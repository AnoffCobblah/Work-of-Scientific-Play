IT conditions
   is now some time since general equations applicable to the
              of most electrical problems have been given, and
attempts, more or less complete, have been made to establish an
analogy between electrical phenomena and those of ordinary
mechanics.    In particular, Maxwell has given a general dyna
mical theory of the electromagnetic fieldt, according to which
he shows the mutual interdependence of the various branches of
the science, and lays down equations sufficient for the theoretical
solution of any electrical problem.     He has also in scattered
papers illustrated the solution of special problems by reference
to those which correspond with them (at least in their mathe

quired to overcome the weight of the great column of water.
The second valve is accordingly opened, and a portion of the
water is forced up.    Now the electrical current, in virtue of
self-induction, can no more be suddenly stopped than the cur
rent of water; and so in the above experiment the polarization of
the voltameter is instantly overcome, and a quantity of electricity
passes.

 the value X the current gradually increases or diminishes to that
 determined according to Ohm’s law, by the resistance of the

 that the resistance of the branch may be varied without affect

 to the self-induction as to make the time-constant compa
 rable in magnitude with the duration of the spark.     The spark
 depends only on the comparative self-induction of the branch

smaller the number of terms of which the secondary consists;
for in calculating the energy of the field, it makes no difference
whether we have a current of any magnitude in a doubled
circuit, or twice that current in a single circuit. The same
conclusion may be arrived at by the consideration of the ana

confusion seems to have prevailed, as shown by the numerous
inquiries into the direction of the induced currents of high
orders. The currents, as a whole, at least after the first, can
not properly be said to have any direction at all, as they                                                     in
volve, when complete, no transfer of electricity in any direc
tion.   Nevertheless the positive and negative parts are not si
milar; and if they were, one must necessarily precede the other;
so that in this way directional effects may be produced.      The
magnetizing power, for instance, depends essentially on the initial
maximum magnitude of the induced current, and is probably
but little affected by the character of the diluted but compara
tively long-continued remaining parts.     This being understood,
the alternately opposite magnetizations observed by Henry in a
series of induced currents of high order, is an immediate con
sequence of the dynamical theory.

IN under
    the Philosophical Magazine for May 1867 there is a paper
          the title given above by Mr. C. W. Heaton, Professor
of Chemistry at Charing-Cross Hospital, the purport of which is
to show that the oxidation which yields the force exerted by the
muscles is intravascular, or that muscular force is generated en
tirely from the blood and within the blood-vessels.       As this
communication is considered by some eminent physiologists to
have established the hypothesis that the blood itself is both the
source and the seat of                    all
                           the chemical change      which force                              by                  is

    The entire question thus turns on the assumption that oxygen
 can leave the capillaries only by passing through the thin mem
 brane of which they consist, in solution in a fluid exudate.      The
necessity for a current of fluid to convey the oxygen is supposed
to arise from the fact that the oxygen, being in solution in the
blood, carries with it       solvent  itspassing through the capillary

to be decided on other   grounds;   and the evidence in favour of

 III. On  Vital Force according to Age, and the “English Life Table.”
           By Thomas Rowe EDMoNDs, B.A. Cantab.f
      BSERVATIONS          on the vital force of man at different ages
        from birth are all of modern date. The idea of the exist
 ence in every population of a law of vital force according to age
was not entertained by mankind until near the end of the seven
 teenth century.     The embodiment of this idea in a “Table of
 Mortality” was first made about the year 1693, by our country
man, Dr. Halley.       The form of the Table of mortality adopted
 about the year 1738, and continued in use to the present time,
may be described as follows:—Such Table consists of three co
lumns. The heading of the first column is “Age,” of the se
cond column “Living,” and of the third column “Dying.” The
numbers in the first column denote completed years of age from
birth-time, beginning at age 0 and ending, say, at 99 years.
The numbers in the second column denote the living or survi
vors at any completed year of age out of a given number born or
living at the age 0. Lastly, the numbers in the third column
denote the numbers dying during the year of age next following
the completed year marked, in the same horizontal line, in the
first column.
   In a Table of mortality, if the numbers in the column of
“Living ” be represented by the letter P, the numbers in the
column of “Dying ” will be represented by AP, for a unit of
time or age taken to be one year. If the time or age be reckoned
from birth, we shall have at any age t the quantity        *
present the ratio of the numbers dying during the (t+1)th year
                                                              t  to
                                                                    re
of age to the numbers living at the beginning of the same year
of age. If the intervals of age, instead of being each one year,
be diminished indefinitely, we shall have to substitute the differ
ential of P, or d. P, for AP; in the above ratio. We shall then
           P,
          P, , or d.log. P. for
obtain                            the expression of the ratio   of the

22              Mr. T. R. Edmonds on Vital Force according
the age of 9 to the age of 12 years, during which the rate of
mortality is constant and at a minimum.       It may be well to ob
serve that the zero of life in the period of childhood may be real
and mark the commencement of animal organization.           Also it
may be useful to observe that, if the law of mortality is conti
nuous above and below 84 years of age as well as above and
below birth-time, it will ensue that the rate of mortality at the
age 90 years is equal to the rate of mortality immediately after
the time of conception, and the rate of mortality at the age 96
years is equal to the rate of extinction of germs existing at the
age of 9 months, measured from the day of commencement of
organization.
   The differential of the hyperbolic logarithm of the living or
surviving at any age a +t is known when the force of mortality
a at the absolute age a measured from one of the two zeros of
vital force is known, and is of the form following:—
                                                                                     —'

vital force. The chief of physical forces is that of gravity, which,
according to distance from a fixed point in space, varies inversely
as R*. That is to say, the law of variation of the force of mor
tality measured from a central point, differs from the law of va
riation of the force of gravity similarly measured, only in the
exponent    of the radial distance.    The exponent is two in the
case of the force of gravity, and the exponent is        or 2-302585

in the   case of the force of mortality.
   The empirical formula published in 1832 was founded on the
supposition that the mortality according to age decreases or       in
creases in a constant geometrical ratio in each of three definite
periods of human life. The com. logs. of the three constant
ratios are    –
            being
                 17, +.0128, and +0333; the corresponding

numbers                                              The first period
begins at birth, and ends near 9 years of age. The second
period begins at 12 and ends near 55 years of age. And the
third period begins near 55 years of age, and continues until
the end of life. There is probably an intermediate fourth pe
riod, from the age of 9 to the age of 12 years, during which
the rate of mortality is constant and at a minimum.
   From the above law of geometric increase or decrease of mor
tality according to age, was obtained for each of the three periods
the differential equation following, viz.
                         d. log.P, = — ap'dt;

   The quantity & in the empirical formula of 1832 represents
the annual rate of mortality at the precise age a whence t is mea
sured, that is when t=0. The actual or infinitesimal rate of
mortality at the time or age when t=0 is adt. The actual or
infinitesimal rate at any other point of time, say tyears or frac
tions of years, is ap'dt. The quantity a thus used to indicate
the rate of mortality at a particular point of age was not known
to the public until the year 1832. In my book of “Life Tables,”
published in that year, the above quantity was first described and
made the subject of a special Table, of which the following is the
title:–“Table A 27, showing at quinquennial intervals of age the
force of mortality, or the number of deaths which would occur
                 ;
in one year, upon 100 constantly living.” Without the quantity
a, as first described by me, any formula similar to that of
                  .2
com. log   Pl =       (1-p)   is of no use except for the    interpola

                       to Age, and the               “English Life Table.”                                  25

tracted from any Table of mortality not regulated by any definite
law of decrement of life according to age.
   In facilities afforded for the rapid construction of Tables of
mortality, the formula of 1832 has the advantage over the                                                  for
nula of 1866, chiefly through yielding successive values of
log A log P, differing from one another by a constant quantity
which is the common logarithm of the annual ratio of increase
of    the
       mortality according     age.   The formula
                                                to   1832 yields                          of

     In   the year 1832 the present writer gave                                  to   the public three

26         Mr. T. R. Edmonds    on   Vital Force according
 series of theoretical Life Tables—one representing “Village Mor
tality,” another “Mean Mortality,” and the third “City Mor
taly,” the principal series being that of Mean Mortality.     At
any given age the rates of mortality in the three Tables are to
one another in the proportion of the numbers 5, 6, and 7% respec
tively. The same three numbers were intended to represent for
the fixed age of ten years the annual mortality per thousand
living according to the same three several Tables. The above
three Tables were deduced from the same formula,
                                   k°o.
                   com. log   P=          (1–p'),
                                   Ap
with the three different values of a above mentioned.     These
Tables were the first ever published in which the rate of morta
lity at any age was connected by a continuous and definite law
of increase or decrease with the rate of mortality exhibited for
every other age. The first of these theoretical Tables, desig
nated as “Village Mortality,” is almost in exact coincidence at
every age with  Heysham and Milne's Table for Carlisle            (pub
lished in 1815), as may be seen on inspection of Tables           I.   and
WI. hereunto annexed.
      the ‘Lancet’ of the 9th and 16th of March, 1850, there ap
     In
peared a paper in which   I
                          compared the results of the “Village,”
“Mean,” and      “City”   Tables of mortality with the observed
rates of  mortality, according  to age, of various parts of the po
 pulation of England during the seven years 1838–1844, these
 observed rates having been published by authority of the
Registrar-General in the year 1849. Extracts from these com
pared results will be found in Table         III.hereunto annexed.
 On inspection of this Table it will be seen that the mortality,
according to age, of the total male population of the four heal
thiest of the eleven Registrar's districts into which England has
been divided is sufficiently well represented by the theoretical
Table of “Village Mortality.” Also it will be seen that the
theoretical Table of “City Mortality’ is a good representation
of the mortality, according to age, of the male population of the
chief towns of England.     Taking four classes of such towns, ar
ranged according to intensity of mortality, it will be seen that
the mortality according to the “City’ Table, at the various            in
tervals of age, agrees nearly with the mean mortality observed
in these four classes of chief towns.
   It is worthy of remark that, although the “City” Table is a
good representation of the mortality of the population of English
cities at ages under 10 years and at ages above 30 years, it is
not so for the intermediate period of age. One of the remark
able results of the English observation        is,
                                            that the mortality
of the populations ofgreat towns between the ages     of
                                                       and 3010

                              to Age, and the               “English Life Table.”                                         27
years is shown to differ very little from that of the general po
pulation at the same interval of age.     If the fact is in accord
ance with the  observation, the result  may  be ascribed to the free
interchange of town and country population at this interval of
age.   There commonly occurs at this interval of age a great                                                             in
flux of population into the large towns from the surrounding
country.                these immigrants become a part of the
                        A portion of
permanent population of these large towns; another portion re
turns and again form part of the country population.      The
greater the competition   and the  greater the freedom of                                                                 in
terchange of the country with the town population, the more
will the mortality of the two classes of population, between the
ages of 10 and 30 years, approach to equality.
  The English Life Table for males, which was published in
1864, coincides nearly at                              all
                                     ages with my theoretical Table                                                          of

or negative.     the construction of the English Life Table it
                             In
has been assumed that the errors of any two consecutive
                                                         quin
quennial rates observed are in opposite directions and balance
one another.                                  mode of estimating
                              This is the most favourable
the amount of error existing—one observed rate being supposed
to be 9 per cent. above the true rate, and the next observed rate
being supposed to be 9 per cent. below the true rate. The least
favourable       of estimating the amount of error existing is
                     mode
by supposing that the errors in two consecutive quinquennial
rates are not in opposite directions, and that the errors in
such observed rates are united or concentrated on one
                                                      only of
 the two observed rates, so that the proportional errors are                                                      al
ternately 18 per cent. and nothing.
    In observations of rates of mortality according to age, no
lower estimate than 5 per cent. can be admitted as the probable
amount of errors of observation.    This amount or rate of error
of observation is fifty times                      of error of obser
                                                 as great as the rate
vation made on the force of steam       according   to temperature.
The formula for steam-force according to       temperature     is the
same as the formula       surviving      for
                                     population  according       age,                                       to
                                                *{ - (1+
with difference    sign only. ofEither formula                                      is

In   the case       of    steam-force, the formula gives results which seldom
differ from the results                observation so much
                                           of                    one     thou            as           in   a

30               Mr. T. R. Edmonds                     on     Vital Force according
   In applying my formula to the determination of the probability
of living one year at the precise ages 20, 30, . . . . 80, and 90
years, Dr. Farr substitutes the ambiguous quantity m for the a
of my formula, at the same time * describing m as equal to the
annual rates of mortality at the “precise ages” 20, 30,        80,                                    ...
and 90 years.    According to this definition, the m of Dr. Farr's
formula is identical with the a of my formula as described by me
in 1832.    But this definition is immediately followed by the
inconsistent and contradictory statement that m at the age 20
years is represented by the mortality “ruling” from the age 19%
to 20% years.    This statement is elsewhere confirmed by Dr.
Farr, and made to extend to quinquennial and to decennial inter
vals of age. The erroneous principle adopted in the construc
tion of the English Life Table                      is,
                                   that the annual rate      mortality                        of

        Principles of Molecular Physics,” published in recent
Numbers of the Philosophical Magazine, is obviously of a cha
racter to demand some answer at my hands.            In replying to it
I  do not  propose  to take  up  in detail, and in the order in which
they occur,             all

points separated by finite distances, every one of which acts
 upon every other point, and hence that there can be no such thing
 in Nature as an atom that has continuous extension.               Now
 this principle    is no inevitable deduction from    recognized  facts;
 for the only certain knowledge furnished by the entire range
 of physical science with regard to the so-called atoms, is that
 they have certain properties and active powers.           The essential
 origin and mode of evolution of these properties and powers must
 for ever remain an impenetrable mystery. It may be confidently
 asserted that few links of the mystic chain that binds each
 ultimate atom to the throne of the Creator will ever be certainly
 discerned.      We may indeed recognize that the so-called “che
 mical atoms” are really complex in their constitution, and
 should accordingly be termed “primitive molecules,” as both
 Professor Bayma and myself maintain, and frame hypotheses as
 to the nature of their physical constitution and the immediate
 origin of the forces they exert, suggested by physical phenomena,
 and to be tested by comparing the deductions from them with
 facts; but the elements, or primary atoms, of which they are
 composed, what are they : Are these of necessity mere points,
 mere mathematical centres of force : Is it not absurd to sup
 pose that when we can know nothing of the essential nature
 and origin of the primary powers, or activities, of these atoms,
 anything can be predicated with certainty with regard to their
 size and the question of their continuity or non-continuity, and
 to claim that a certain conception formed of their geometrical
 character is not an assumption, not an hypothesis, but an absolute
 verity.    Our author’s “demonstration,”         that an atom having
 continuous extension is an impossibility, rests upon the assump
 tion that if an atom be conceived to be continuous, each point
 of it must act upon every other point in the same manner and
 in the same degree at equal distances.           Now in our absolute
 ignorance of the manner in which force and matter are linked
 together, how can we be sure that this is an inevitable conclu
 sion.   It  is in fact    a mere inference   from the assumption that
 force may be evolved from a mathematical point, and take effect
 upon another mathematical point which is the centre of a similar
activity.     If  this be a truth, the knowledge of it can be gained
from   inspiration    alone.
    Let us examine it a little from a philosophical point of view,
somewhat different from that which our author occupies.             The
principle of activity cannot subsist in a mere mathematical point,
for activity implies a something to act, and a mathematical point
is nothing but position.         Also a mathematical point cannot be
acted   upon,    for an   activity  exerted implies something having
receptivity,    and a mathematical point can have no such pro

that the points supposed are not mere mathematical points, but
also centres of force, the answer       the possibility        is,

38               Prof.   W. A. Norton             on the Fundamental
ton has shown that   if the law of elementary action be that of the
inverse squares, the attraction of such a homogeneous sphere for
an element exterior to it is the same as if the whole mass were
concentrated at the centre,      The demonstration involves the
supposition that equal portions, however small, of each spherical
layer are occupied by equal quantities of matter.                 The principle
demonstrated holds good for every distance of the element at
tracted from the surface—except that at very minute distances,
not many times greater than the distance between two contiguous
molecules of the earth’s mass, it may happen that two lines di
verging from the element in question under a small angle will
not actually contain within them any matter on the immediately
contiguous portion of the earth's surface, and as a consequence
the entire attraction of the first spherical layer would be repre
 sented by that of          its
                           mass concentrated               point slightly more

 be   slightly less than the Newtonian deduction.                        follows,         It
 therefore, that    if the element          the supposed minute distance

 the attraction       adhesion that would actually come into play                                        is

 with the distance between contiguous molecules          which their
 effective attraction manifests itself.
    We find      the ‘Molecular Mechanics’ the following funda
                   in
 mental propositions: “one and the same element                cannot                             A
 attract the element      and repel another element
                                  B                     when      and                     C            B
    are  equally distant from                         ;”
                                      and “one and the same element
                                                  A
 of Cmatter cannot               be
                        attractive for one distance and repulsive for
 another.” These are not direct inferences from physical facts,
 since we recognize among molecular actions precisely the differ
 ences which       here stated cannot have place
                       it   is                      the activities                        in

40              Prof. W. A. Norton   on the Fundamental
exerted by the ultimate elements.      But the attempt is made to
establish them    by  metaphysical reasoning,  of which it may be
said that it involves certain conceptions of the “principle of ac
tivity,” “nature,” and “determinations” of elements, designated
as “substance,”    though they are nothing but mathematical
points, which are neither self-evident truths nor have any cha
racter of certainty, but are mere shadows dimly discerned in that
metaphysical region which the finite mind strives in vain to enter.
The most that can be conceded is that they have a certain air of
probability, and may reasonably be adopted by our author as hy
potheses to be ultimately substantiated or overthrown by the
appeal to facts.
   It will be apparent from what has been stated that an impor
tant difference obtains in the nature of the foundations on which
Professor Bayma's theory and my own have been erected, in the
methods of construction employed, and in the claims asserted
with reference to the true character of the results achieved. The
theory developed in my memoir on Molecular Physics rests upon
the most comprehensive generalizations and principles to which
the progress of physical science has conducted, and in no degree
upon metaphysical conceptions or reasonings with respect to the
nature of matter, the size of atoms, the possibilities or impossibili
ties of certain inherent material actions, &c.    On the other hand,
in the  groundwork     of Professor Bayma's theory are included, as
we have seen, certain conceptions and reasonings of this character
which I maintain are fundamentally hypothetical.             Professor
Bayma has proceeded on the philosophical and what he deems
the strictly scientific plan of construction, while I have restricted
myself to the simple deduction of molecular forces and pheno
mena.     He claims that his fundamental principles are either
universally admitted or demonstrated truths, and that his legiti
mate deductions are to be received as established truths.         I do
not venture to    prefer  any higher claim than that the fundamental
principles  I   have adopted are universally admitted (with the
single exception of the hypothesis of an electric fluid or aether;
and this is the only distinct fundamental conception which the
process of inductive research has evolved from electric pheno
mena), and that the recognized molecular forces and the various
classes of physical phenomena can be legitimately deduced from
the few fundamental postulates laid down without the aid of new
hypotheses.      In this I claim to have pursued the ordinary me
thod of physical speculation, and the only one which has hitherto
achieved any substantial success.         Professor Bayma virtually
admits (Phil.    Mag.    March 1869, p. 183) that his method is ra
dically different from the methods of research hitherto employed
by physicists. This, which he esteems      its most excellent feature,

be likely to prove                    its
                         sufficient condemnation.

      W. Note on the Hydrodynamical Theory of Magnetism.
        By Professor CHALLIs, M.A., F.R.S., F.R.A.S.*
  N   the Numbers of the Philosophical Magazine for January
      and February 1861                         I
                               proposed a theory of magnetism
founded on  hydrodynamical   principles, which is also reproduced,
with modifications and additions, in my work “On the Principles
of Mathematics and Physics,” recently published. It has since
occurred to me that an objection might be raised against the
theory because it does not account for the variation of magnetic
action according to the law of the inverse square, which seems to
be established by Gauss's process for determining the absolute
measure of the intensity of terrestrial magnetism.    The purpose
of this Note is to meet this objection.
   Whatever may be thought of Gauss’s fundamental hypotheses
of two fluids acting attractively and repulsively under certain
conditions according to the law of the inverse square, and of the
dependence of sensible magnetic action on the “separation ” of
these fluids, it is certain from the numerical results he has ob
tained that his investigations must have a real physical basis.
A true theory of magnetism ought to be capable of indicating
what that basis         is,
                      and how far the hypotheses are expressions                                         of
facts,  or are simply  empirical.      proceed     try the hydrodyna

dynamics of steady motion it follows that the fluid will have
greater velocity and less density within the cylinder than with
out, simply because of the contraction of channel by the occupa
tion of space by the atoms.            There will be confluence of the
lines of motion towards the extremity at which the stream enters,
and equal divergence of the lines of motion from the extremity
out of which it issues. These lines, as well as the velocity and
 density along them, will be symmetrically disposed about the
axis of the cylinder prolonged in both directions, and also with
 respect to a plane transverse to the axis through                       middle                                    its

Consequently, at points for which                            6=0            and    6=r, W=0                and

across that plane parallel to the axis is half the forward motion
along the axis; and each of these velocities varies as the cube of
the distance from C.
    Since y is an unknown disposable quantity, the above suppo
sition that VR", or W(y?--a”) 3, is equal to a constant, is not ille
gitimate. The function that y is of a will depend on the form
of the magnet.     In the case of a cylindrical magnet y will not
generally differ much from the radius.    It is also to be remarked
that the above value of U for a point on the axis, and that of W
for a point in the transverse plane, are to be considered as ap
proximative functions of r. The more complete values would pro
bably be of the form

  The motion in these magnetic streams is an instance of steady
motion for which uda + ray--wdz may be assumed to be an
exact differential. This may be maintained on the principle that,
after the impulse is given to the fluid within the magnet in the

opposite signs for the two arms.
   According to the before-supposed positions of the magnets,
the stream from the fixed one will oppose the transverse part of
the stream from the moveable one on the east side of the north
arm, and conspire with it on the west side, so that the pressure,
being greater as the composite velocity is less, will be in excess
on the east side.  For like reasons the pressures on the atoms
of the south arm will be in excess on their west sides.     Hence
the movement of the needle will be the same as if the pole B of
the fixed needle repelled the pole B of the moveable needle and
attracted    poleits           A.

sons for these hypotheses as to account for the magnetic facts
proposed to be explained by them.       The present theory tends to
show that there is no     physical foundation for such hypotheses,
the facts admitting of explanation on the supposition that a single
fluid (the aether) acts in a manner conformable to hydrodynamical
principles. The argument contained in this communication I am
entitled, I think, to regard as confirmatory of the hydrodyna
mical theory of magnetism.

        On completion of the circuit the following facts will be ob
served: from the positive wire, gas (oxygen) is freely evolved,
while the negative wire is perfectly quiescent, the hydrogen
being for some time entirely absorbed by the metal.  When the
hydrogen makes     appearance    its
                                  rises from the end nearest
                                                           it                                                   to
the positive electrode.
   On reversing the direction     the current, evolution   of   gas                                    of
ceases from both wires, the hydrogen being occluded        the one,                               by
and the oxygen being consumed        the previously absorbed hy by
drogen         in
            the other+.  Attention should also     directed     the                    be                to

      To obtain          a   direct demonstration                    of the expansion, the writer
availed himself    the deportment

         MY DEAR SIR,                                                           June       13, 1869.
Yolº         late experiments and reports on the polarization of
       light by cloudy matter (Proceedings of the Royal Society,
No. 108, vol. xiii. pp. 223 &c., Jan. 14, 1869) have made a deep
impression on my mind.
   Permit me to advert to an ancient observation of mine relating
to a subject of the kind, but under circumstances widely different,

wise, from Poggendorff, gave       report        a               of

tiful circular arch presented itself to the eye, the centre of which
was the shadow of the head.      I endeavoured to represent it in

upon the wall on the opposite side of
the room.

both sides with a pale orange or brown

have a direction corresponding to the radius in the whitish arch,

       rent as Davy   had done, endeavoured to do as much for the
ammoniacal compounds as he had done for those of the fixed
alkalies.   They made what is known as the ammoniacal amal
gam.      That ammonium exists in this body has never been de

 2. On the Earistence of an Alloy of Ammonium and Bismuth, and
    on another new Test for the presence of Nascent Hydrogen.
     Ammonium had never yet been seen united with any other
 metal than mercury.       Mercury being the only metal fluid at
 ordinary temperatures, should another alloy be formed it would
 be a solid.   Some bismuth was melted in a porcelain dish and
 alloyed with sodium by dropping a piece of that metal on the
 clear surface of the fluid bismuth.   Chloride of ammonium was
 then dusted on the fluid alloy, and then water added in a fine
 quick stream.    The bismuth swells, appears pasty and porous,
 and then congeals.       Abundance of hydrogen escapes from the
 water, and the ammoniacal odour is set free. This body must
 now be dried.            If
                      it be placed near the ear a distinct crackling
 noise will be heard,   a phenomenon which endures for some days.
 To ascertain if this be ammonium escaping from the bismuth, the
body was placed beneath the surface of water, when bubbles of
 hydrogen escaped, easily to be collected and recognized; the
ammonia, if any, must have been absorbed by the water.            To
test for this red litmus-paper was placed in the liquid. Wherever
the currents from the bismuth struck it a blue spot became                                       vi
sible.   On dissolving sulphate of copper in distilled water and
 placing the well-dried bismuth therein, the characteristic flocculi
 of ammonio-sulphate of copper appeared at once.
    It remains to show that the hydrogen escaping is in the nas
cent state. There was not enough of it to test with phosphorus.
The bismuth compound, when placed in a solution of sulphate of
copper, becomes rapidly coated with metallic copper.             Now bis
muth unalloyed will not precipitate copper from             sulphate. To its
test  if the precipitation     the metallic copper was due
                                     of                                the                  to
presence    of nascent hydrogen,       alloy     an         of
                                                  bismuth and sodium
was made and dipped                           sulphate of     copper.
                                                                          to of
                                solution
                                    in   a                                                       It
instantly became coated with that metal, owing               the nascent
hydrogen escaping from the water.          The hydrogen was there
fore escaping       the nascent state from the bismuth and am
                     in
monia, and therefore       was it true alloy a

decompose with       crackling noise. On one occasion
                      a                                         exploded,         it
sharply scattering the metal. The loud crackling noise produced
 by this substance may              be
                             heard for many days after              made.         it   is

  Appendir.—Continuation of the investigation at the laboratory
of the Royal Mint, London, by the kind permission of Mr.
Roberts:—
   The alloy was dried in vacuo over sulphuric acid. It was then
heated in vacuo by means of a Sprengel pump, when it decom
posed, and the resulting gas was collected over mercury. It was
found to have twenty-seven times the volume of the original
solid. Analysis of the gas proved it to contain nitrogen and
hydrogen.        The results of               a   further examination             will shortly be
given.

  Whilst making      some experiments of heating a strained iron wire
to redness   by  means of a current of voltaic electricity,     observed that,    I

dually shortened until it became quite cold.
   On attempting, some little time afterwards, to repeat this expe
riment, although a careful record of the conditions of the experiment
had been kept, it was with some difficulty, and after numerous trials,
that I succeeded in obtaining the same result.             Having again ob

 62        Royal Society    —Mr. G.    Gore on a momentary
justed to the cohesive power of each metal; if the stretching power
 was too weak, the phenomenon sought for was not clearly deve
loped; and if too great, the wire was overstretched or broken when
it approached the softening-point. The amount of strain imparted
 was approximately measured by temporarily substituting the body
of a small spring balance for the hooked wire F. The heated wire
 must be protected from currents of cold air.
    With wires of iron 0.65 millimetre thick (size “No. 23”) and
 21.5 centimetres long, strained to the extent of 10 ounces or more,
and heated to full redness, the phenomenon was clearly developed.
 As an example, the needle of the instrument went with regularity to
 18:5 of index-plate; the current was then stopped; the needle in
stantly retreated to 17.75, then as quickly advanced to 1975, and
then went slowly and regularly back, but not to zero. If the tempe
rature of the wire was not sufficiently high, or the strain upon the
wire not enough, the needle went directly back without exhibiting the
 momentary forward movement. The temperature and strain required
to be sufficient to actually stretch the wire somewhat at the higher
 temperature.    A higher temperature with a less degree of strain,
or a   greater  degree  of strain with a somewhat lower temperature,
 did not  develope   the phenomenon; the wire was found to be per
 manently elongated on cooling.      The amount of elongation of the
wire  during  the momentary    molecular change was usually about ºn
part of the length of the heated part of the wire; but it varied in
different experiments; it was greatest in amount when the maximum
degrees of strain were applied.       The molecular change evidently
includes a diminution of cohesion at a particular temperature during
the process of cooling; and it is interesting to notice that at the
same temperature during the heating-process no such loss of cohe
sion (nor any increase of cohesion) takes place; a certain tempera
ture and strain are therefore not alone sufficient to produce it; the
condition of cooling must also be included.     The phenomena which
occur during cooling are not the exact converse of those which take
place during heating.
   The phenomenon of elongation of iron wire during the process of
cooling evidently lies within very narrow limits; it could only be
obtained (with the particular battery employed) with wires about
21.5 centimetres (=817, inch) long, and about 0.65 millimetre
(=Nos. 22 & 23 of ordinary wire-gauge) thick, having a strain
upon them of 10 ounces or upwards; with a weaker battery the
phenomenon could only be obtained by employing a shorter and
thinner wire.
   The experiment may easily be verified in a simpler manner by
stretching an iron wire about 1.0 millimetre diameter between two
fixed supports, keeping it in a sufficient and proper degree of ten
sion by means of an elastic band, then heating it to full redness by
means of a row of Bunsen's burners, and, as soon as it has stretched
somewhat, suddenly cutting off the source of heat.    In some experi
ments of this kind, with a row (42 centimetres long) of 21 burners
and a row (76 centimetres long) of 43 burners, and the wire attached

 to a needle with index-plate, as in the figure, conspicuous effects
 were obtained; but the momentary elongation was relatively much
less (in one instance wºrm of the length of the heated part) than
when a battery was employed, apparently in consequence of the wire
 being less intensely heated.
     A large number of experiments were made with wires of palla
 dium, platinum, gold, silver, copper, lead, tin, cadmium, zinc, brass,
german-silver, aluminium, and magnesium (wire and ribbon), dimi
 nishing the length and thickness of the wire in each case, and ad
justing the tension until suitable temperature and strain were obtained;
 but in no instance could a similar molecular change to that observed
 in iron be detected.          Palladium and platinum wires of different
 lengths, thickness, and degrees of strain were examined at various
 temperatures, up to that of a white heat; but no irregularity of co
 hesion, except that of gradual softening at the higher temperatures,
  was observed; they instantly contracted with regular action on stop
 ping the current. Several gold wires were similarly examined at dif
 ferent temperatures up to that of a full red heat; no irregularity
 occurred either during heating or cooling; but little tension (about
 4 ounces) was applied, on account of the weak cohesion of this metal.
  Wires of silver similarly examined would only bear a strain of about
  2 ounces, and a temperature of feeble red heat visible in daylight;
  no irregularity of elongation or contraction occurred during heating
  and cooling.       By employing exactly the proper temperature and
  strain, a very interesting phenomenon was observed: the wire melted
  distinctly on     its
                      surface without fusing                       its

german-silver, when heated to redness, behaved like those of copper
in expanding regularly until a maximum was attained, and then con
tracting slightly to a definite point whilst the battery remained con
nected; on stopping the current they contracted without irregularity.
When examined at lower temperatures, with a greater degree of
strain, no irregularity was observed.       Various wires of aluminium
were examined; the most suitable was one 0.88 millimetre thick,
20.4 centimetres long, with a strain of 12 ounces; no irregularity
was observed at any temperature below redness; aluminium expanded
and cooled very slowly, but less so than cadmium. Various wires and
ribbon of magnesium were also examined below a red heat, but no
irregularity of cohesion, except that due to gradual softening by heat,
was detected.
   All the metals examined exhibited gradual loss of cohesion at the
higher temperatures if a suitable strain was applied to develope                                              it.   It

electric current passing through the magnet, a small piece of paper

the battery, the needles remained nearly stationary during several
seconds, and then went rapidly to about 10: this slow decline of the
current during the first few seconds of cooling was probably connected
with the “momentary molecular change of iron wire” during cooling
which I have described in the preceding paper. The irregularity of
movement of the needles did not occur unless the wire was bright red
hot, a condition which was also necessary for obtaining the molecular
change.
   The direction of the current induced by heating the iron wire was
found by experiment to be the same as that which was produced by
removing the magnet from the coil; therefore the heat acted simply
by diminishing the magnetism, and the results were in accordance
with, and afford a further confirmation     the general law, that where   of,

leads us necessarily to several important modifications of the received
theory of the physical constitution of our central luminary—the
theory we owe to Kirchhoff, who based it upon his examination of
the solar spectrum. According to this hypothesis, the photosphere
itself is either solid or liquid, and it is surrounded by an atmosphere
 composed of gases and the vapours of the substances incandescent in
the photosphere.

    The following communications      were read:—
    “Note   on the Heat of the Stars.”       By William Huggins, F.R.S.
    In  the summer of 1866 it occurred to me that the heat received
 on the earth from the stars might possibly be more easily detected
 than the solar heat reflected from the moon. Mr. Becker (of Messrs.
 Elliott Brothers) prepared for me several thermopiles, and a very
sensitive galvanometer.      Towards the close of that year, and during
the early part of 1867,    I  made numerous observations on the moon,
and on three or four fixed stars.        I  succeeded in obtaining trust
worthy indications of stellar heat in the case of the stars Sirius,
                                 I
Pollux, and Regulus, though was not able to make any quantita
tive estimate of their calorific power.
    I had the intention of making these observations more complete,
and of extending them to other stars.           I have refrained hitherto
from making them known;         I  find, however, that   I cannot hope to
take up these researches again for some months, and therefore ven
ture to submit the observations in their present incomplete form.
    An astatic galvanometer was used, over the upper needle of which
a small concave mirror was fixed, by which the image of the flame of
a lamp could be thrown upon a scale placed at some distance.         Usu
ally, however, I preferred to observe the needle directly by means of
a lens so placed that the divisions on the card were magnified, and
could be read by the observer when at a little distance from the in
strument. The sensitiveness of the instrument was made as great as
possible by a very careful adjustment from time to time of the mag
netic power of the needles.     The extreme delicacy of the instrument
was found to be more     permanently    preserved when the needles were
placed at right angles to the magnetic meridian during the time that
the instrument was not in use. The great sensitiveness of this in

70                                           Royal Society:—
strument was shown by the needles turning through 90° when two
pieces of wire of different kinds of copper were held between the finger
and thumb.     For the stars, the images of which in the telescope are
points of light, the thermopiles consisted of one or of two pairs of
elements; a large pile, containing twenty-four pairs of elements, was
also used for the moon. A few of the later observations were made
with a pile of which the elements consist of alloys of bismuth and
antimony.
    The thermopile was attached to a refractor of eight inches aperture.
I  considered that though some of the heat-rays would not be trans
                                                                                                                           air
mitted by the glass, yet the more uniform temperature of the
within the telescope, and some other circumstances, would make the
 difficulty   preserving the pile from extraneous influences less for
                   of
 midable than        reflector were used.

from the stars.               -
    The apparatus was fixed to the telescope so that the surface of the
thermopile would be at the focal point of the object-glass.        The
apparatus was allowed to remain attached to the telescope for hours,
 or sometimes for days, the wires being in connexion with the galvano
 meter, until the heat had become uniformly distributed within the
 apparatus containing the pile, and the needle remained at zero, or
 was steadily deflected to the extent of a degree or two from zero.
    When observations were to be made, the shutter of the dome was
 opened, and the telescope, by means of the finder, was directed to a
 part of the sky near the star to be examined where there were no
 bright stars. In this state of things the needle was watched, and
if in four or five minutes no deviation of the needle had taken place,
then by means of the finder the telescope was moved the small dis
tance necessary to bring the image of the star exactly upon the face
of the pile, which could be ascertained by the position of the star as
seen in the finder.   The image of the star was kept upon the small
pile by means of the clock-motion attached to the telescope. . The
needle was then watched during five minutes or longer; almost always
the needle began to move as soon as the image of the star fell upon
 it.  The telescope was then moved,           direct   again so the sky
                                                                  as   to              it            to

Southwark,               I was much struck with the appearances presented by
some specimens               of iron and steel round bars which had been broken
by torsion.               Some of them were broken right across, as nearly as
may be in a              plane perpendicular to the axis of the bar. On examin
ing    theseI perceived that they had          yielded through      great de all                                   a

beautiful specimens        Mr. Kirkaldy's museum.

                               is

curve as the older rocks, and broken through, nearly in the centre
of the curve, by the basaltic cone of Nga Tutura. This volcano is
about 600 feet high, and is chiefly composed of basaltic lava-streams,
with but little tuff. The eruption is considered by the author to
have been submarine.
   Capt. Hutton then stated his conviction that the fluid matter
which escaped was not connected with a central molten interior of
the earth, but was derived from rocks not much more than 1000
feet in depth, and that the synclinal in question was caused by a
subsidence into the cavity thus formed.
     3.   “On Dakosaurus.”      By J. Wood Mason, Esq., F.G.S.
   The    Kimmeridge    Clay of Shotover Hill has yielded five specimens
of the teeth of this    reptile, now for the first time represented as a
British    genus.   After  noticing  the bibliography of the subject, and
the   presence  of specimens   in various museums, the author proceeded
to describe the characters of the teeth. They are large, conical,
incurved, and slightly recurved, having two sharp, prominent, cre
nulated, longitudinal ridges, which are situated midway between
the convex and concave curvatures.
   This reptile was regarded by the author as foreshadowing the
form of dentition that characterizes the existing group of Varanidae.
If  the materials were at hand for a complete definition of         com           its
parative osteology, Dakosaurus would probably exhibit           combina  a
tion       Lacertilian and Crocodilian characters, but with the croco
          of
dilian elements predominant.
   The PRESIDENT differed from the author as                  to
                                                  the conclusions he
drew from the structure     of
                            the teeth. The teeth      existing Croco
                                                                   of
dilia had been but imperfectly described, and       thought    he
                                                                could             he
point out among existing Crocodiles teeth bearing the character
which the author regarded         as
                                 Lacertilian.  He agreed with Prof.
Owen      regarding Dakosaurus
              in                   Crocodilian rather than Dinosau
                                       as
rian or Lacertilian.

sidered the fasciole to be an appendage to several generic groups
which were distinctly separated by other structural distinctions.
The result of an examination of the Nummulitic Breyniae in the
Society's collection satisfied Dr. Duncan that there were only race
characters separating them from Breynia Australiensis—a recent
Echinoderm.          The persistence of these species, widely distributed
and of     great   geological   age, was very remarkable.

    The    following    communication was read:—
    “Notes of a Geological Reconnaissance in Arabia Petraea.” By
H. Bauerman, Esq., F.G.S.
    The district to which this paper referred is that between Suez
and the lower part of Wady Ferran in the peninsula of Arabia
Petraea, and includes the copper and turquoise mines worked by the
ancient Egyptians.            The rocks within this area were classified as
follows:—
    1. Gneiss and granites, forming the central chain of Sinai and the base of all
the stratified deposits.
    2. Red Sandstone series.
        Cretaceous rocks.
        White   limestones,  with flints, salt, and bitumen. Eocene.
        Flint  conglomerate,   with coralline limestone. Miocene.
        Gypseous marls of Wady Taragi.
    i
        Reconstructed gypseous sands and conglomerates.
        Raised beaches, coralline and miliolitic limestones.
      . Alluvium and desert drift.
     The Red Sandstone series consists of three members, a thin bed
 of limestone being the central and containing remains of Encrinites
 referred by Mr. Etheridge to the Muschelkalk form Encrimites moni
 liformis.       Iron, manganese, and copper ores are found near Nasb
 and Serabib el Khadem.               The turquoise mines of Wady Maghara,
 which were referred to the same horizon, are among the most ancient
 monuments of the world.                The author considered that the tools
 employed were flint chisels or flakes, and hammers made from pieces
 of a neighbouring doleritic lava. The flakes were supposed to have
 been mounted on wooden blocks.
     The Cretaceous rocks, which rest unconformably on the Triassic
 sandstones, consist chiefly of green sand, with alternations of thin
 argillaceous limestones, containing Echinoderms which prove them
 to be of the age of the Upper Greensand.                 Above them comes the
 Hippurite-limestone series.             The fossils were described by Dr. Dun
 can, F.R.S., in a subsequent communication.
     The white limestone, with flints, the next group of rocks in
  ascending order, strongly resembles the European chalk with flints;
 but, according to the author, it must be regarded as representing the
 nummulitic limestone of Egypt, as several species of Nummulites
 have been detected in it near the shores of the Red Sea, below
  Wady Gharandel.            The Miocene flint conglomerate series is a mass
 of coarse flint shingle alternating with these coralline limestones.
 The author considered that a great physical break ensued between

  76                          Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
 the Eocene and Miocene period, while a gradual transition occurred
 between the Cretaceous and Eocene rocks.
    In the gypseous series which overlies the flint conglomerate
 several peculiar effects were noted, owing to the easy manner in
 which tumbled and broken masses of gypsum are reconstructed by
 partial solution and recrystallization when they have been removed
 from their original position by the slipping of the underlying shales.
    The alluvial gravels of the Sinaitic valleys are generally similar
 in containing a coarser and a finer material; the latter is the older,
 and has apparently been deposited by comparatively slow-flowing
 streams. In conclusion, the author called attention to the evidence
 of lakes, marshes, and streams having formerly occupied what are
 now dry barren valleys.

 represents the increase of the quantity of heat actually existing in the

    M. Hirn has assumed the internal work to be negligible in hy
drogen.     He has deduced from the preceding equation the absolute
specific heat of that gas; and by applying the law of Dulong and
Petit to the absolute specific heats, he has been able to obtain under
this hypothesis the values of y with respect to various gases. By
combining the equation (I) with the law of absolute specific heats,
we may compare the values of y for various gases without the as
sumption of any hypothesis with regard to hydrogen.

   In these calculations the specific heats are taken between zero and
200°, and the coefficients of dilatation are in relation to the interval
from zero to 100°; it is probable that between 100° and 200° the
coefficients of dilatation of air and hydrogen retain sensibly the
same value, and that the coefficient of dilatation of carbonic acid
tends to diminish, so that the value calculated for y” is a little too
small.
    Conclusion.—If for each of these three gases (hydrogen, air, and
carbonic acid) we take the proportion of the heat consumed in                       in
ternal work to the specific heat under a constant pressure, we find the
        -
following values for Y            Y       Y     ._

the gas dilates under the constant pressure of the atmosphere be

pressure, which goes on increasing from hydrogen to air and from
air to carbonic acid.
   We may likewise compare the quantities of heat expended in in
ternal work under the same circumstances by considering the three
gases under the same volume at the temperature of melting ice.                       If
we take as the common volume the volume occupied by 1 kilog. of
hydrogen, the weight of equal volumes of air and carbonic acid are

but      I will
              give a comparative view of the results obtained with a
beautiful prism of rock-salt, using as a source of heat either the gas
lamp or Bourbouze's lamp.
   All the arrangements were the same in the two sets of experiments;
in both cases the prism was in the position relative to the minimum
deviation of the red, which for the extreme red was 40° 18'.      Under
these circumstances, working with the Bourbouze lamp, and taking
as the unit of effect that obtained in the extreme red, that obtained
at half a degree from this position is 2:2, at 1 degree 0-3 only, and at
 1° 25' it is zero.  At the same time the rays of the first three layers
are transmitted through a fluor-spar trough containing a layer of
water 2 millims. in thickness, in the proportions of 0.90,0-60, and 0.75.
   On the other hand, with a bat's-wing burner, taking as unit the
effect produced in the extreme red, that obtained at half a degree
from this position becomes 4 instead of 2:2, at 1 degree it is 5 in
stead of 0.3, and at 2 degrees it is still very appreciable.   The spec
trum thus extends much further into the obscure region.         But it is
far less transmissible through water. For the band at half a degree
from the obscure red the transmission is scarcely 0:14 instead of
0-60, and for that at a distance of 1 degree from the red it becomes
insignificant.
    Other differences are met with between the spectra furnished by
these two sources. With the gas-burner, under the conditions of my
experiments, no heat is found either in the yellow or the green, and
still less in the extreme white of the spectrum. With Bourbouze's
lamp I easily found some in the green, although the intensity of the
maximum was not different in the two cases.
     Imay also be permitted to adduce the following results.
   Working with Bourbouze's lamp, the transmissibility of rays of
the maximum through water seemed a little less than that of the rays
which precede or succeed them in the order of refrangibility.
     A similar effect is observed in the solar rays; I have also observed
a similar maximum in investigating the action of a trough full of
chloroform on the rays from a gas-burner.

1.
      I    POINTED   out in a previous communicationt that the con
         stants of capillarity of different fluids might be compared
at temperatures in the immediate neighbourhood of their solidi
fication- or melting-points. I have now thought it proper to ex
tend the determinations given elsewhere to a greater number
of chemical elements and compounds, as the forces which the
particles of any given fluid exert upon each other certainly de
pend on circumstances less complicated than those between par
ticles of heterogeneous substances, and we may hope accordingly
to obtain some clearer ideas in this way of the nature of the
perplexing molecular             forces, which act (almost always) only at
exceedingly          small distances.
    The following inquiry rests on two principles, previously
established by Dr. Thomas Young, which, however,            may, for   I
the sake of connexion, demonstrate in this place.

which falls may be treated as the W in equation (7).
   We may equally neglect the fact that new fluid comes down
at the time when the drop is separating, which tends to make
the drop too large. When this access of fluid is too great,
on the other hand, there is a thin jet of fluid which may readily
be resolved into smaller drops by taps from the outside.         This
is the explanation of the fact that, in the case of many fluids, the
drops attain a maximum for a determined velocity in the supply
of the issuing fluid +.

   The silver was stated to be chemically pure; the gold was
slightly alloyed with silver, chiefly to facilitate the process of
wire-drawing.
    Glass threads, drawn out before the lamp from a thicker piece
of glass, were also treated like wires.   The determinations, how
ever, were less trustworthy, because glass becomes soft before
melting, and accordingly, through a commencing drop-formation
above the fluid drop, the glass cylinder from which the drop falls
off is really widened. A series of determinations was made for each
wire, and the mean of them taken.        The results collected below
prove that the weight of the drops really increases (as it ought to
do according to theory) in proportion to the diameter of the wires.

   9. The same process as was applied in the case of phosphorus
was extended to sodium and potassium, with this difference,
that the water was replaced by petroleum, in which the drops
were received, and that the carbonic acid, after its treatment
with carbonate of soda, was thoroughly dried in a wash-bottle
and Babo's bulb-tubes by means of hydrated sulphuric acid.
The determinations present great difficulties in the case of these
metals, since, whenever the carbonic acid is not quite pure or
the temperature is a little high, we have oxidation of the surface
and phenomena like those with cadmium.       It may even happen
in the latter case that the metal kindles in the carbonic acid.                                                        I
have accordingly not been able for potassium to make deter
minations free from error, since a slight oxidation of the sur
face seems to take place even under favourable circumstances.
The mouth of the glass tube is readily lined with a border of
solid potash, the diameter 2r becomes greater than the mea
surement gave            it,
                    and the constant      capillarity found too         of                                    is
great.   Accordingly     give the numbers for potassium subject
                                I

    12.   I was interested     to note the values of the constants of ca
pillarity for water and mercury by this method of drops, as had              I
made numerous determinations of them at the usual tempera
tures by other methods.           As the following Tables show, the re
sults gave very different values (especially for water) for the con
stants, according to the speed with which the drops were formed.
    The numbers obtained for mercury are usually smaller than
those resulting from my own previous determinations*(from 55-21
to 58.79 milligrammes); but they differ from the results of other
observers, which were obtained by much more accurate methods
(elevations in tubes, and drops on a horizontal surface) by incon
siderable amounts.          According as the measurements were made
immediately after the formation of the surfaces or at a later time,
the results for a ranged for mercury between 40 and 50 milli
grammes.

of a thin-walled      glass   cylinder    of about 50 millims. diameter.
    Distilled water was boiled in a glass vessel with vertical walls
till about two-thirds of the fluid was left. While the water
was    still boiling the vessel was corked,             and a glass rod with

a fine point was inserted air-tight in the cork.   When the bottle
was inverted, after the water had cooled down with the access of
the external air shut off, this point lay in the water immediately
below the lowest part of the upper surface of the fluid.       The
meniscus was formed on a       part  of the  glass wall which had

   The constant for sulphur is calculated                            from the experiments
of Frankenheimt, and that for wax from those of Wertheimí.
   Besides the constant a, the Table gives a”=                                      º: and              a, where
a is the specific gravity of the fluid.                              I    have determined                      the
specific gravity ao for the temperature    0°, with the exception
of those cases which are marked *; and I have calculated a for
the melting-point.     The values of a which are given in these
cases are more or less unreliable, on account of our ignorance of
the expansion-coefficients, the precise melting-points, and the
expansion or contraction which takes place during the process
of melting.

 culties and sources of error in these observations, that the velo
 city of the formation of the drop is left out of account, that for
 a substance such as water, the values of a” given by different
 experienced observers vary between 13:5 and 17-58 sq. millims.,
 we see that the deviations from the law may very possibly be                                                            .
 due to errors of observation*. No relation such as has been sus
 pected to existi between these constants of capillarity and other
 physical or chemical properties of the substances can be deduced
from these Tables.
    15. According to equation (7), the constant a is the weight in
milligrammes of the mass of fluid which can be carried by 1 mil
lim. of the contact-line of the fluid meniscus, and which is half of
the constant which Laplace calls H.      The magnitude a measures,
therefore, the difference of the forces of pressure which are ex
erted on the unit of a plane fluid surface, and on the unit of
a spherical surface, of diameter 1, in the direction of the nor
mals.    We may say, therefore, that a measures the attraction
which the particles within the fluid exert for a given form of
the surface on a volume of the surface-layer, the base of which
is the unit of surface.
       If
      the surface-layer of fluid had the same density in     points                               all
with the fluid inside        finite distance from the
                                         at   a        surface, the
quantity                 or   half the quantity         a”,   would measure the attraction
which
        .  exerted
             is                    on

The part X, a will thus have remained unmoved either by the
increment or the decrement of the temperature, and the plate
will not descend. The strain will be greatest on the points XI
and r, when the plate suffers a diminution of temperature; and
it is a possible case that the tensile strength may not be suffi
cient to bear this strain.       The plate will then be torn asunder
at those   points.     Although   the plate was before too long to be
made to descend       by  the given alternation of temperature, yet the
 parts into which it is thus separated may not.            The points X
 and w are those which sustain the greatest thrust when the tem
 perature is raised; they are therefore those at which there is the
 greatest tendency to crush. The distances XA, a B, X1 Ap, wi Bl
 are independent of the length of the plate.

the positions of the lead were registered on the 19th, 22nd, 23rd,

   The argument is not limited, however, to a bare demonstra
tion that the ear is open to the action of one class of waves
while it suppresses the action of the other. It may be shown
that some of the most remarkable and characteristic portions of
the auditory apparatus are expressly contrived with a view to fa
cilitate and regulate the admission and transmission of waves of
rarefaction, and have no intelligible function as applying to the
transmission of condensed waves.

128        Mr. R. Moon                   on the       Structure of the Human Ear, and on
pressed home, and the membrane of the fenestra rotunda bulging
out into the tympanal cavity, it is evident that when a rare
fied wave becomes incident upon the membrana tympani, the
latter will move outwards, drawing the stapes from the labyrinth,
the fluid in the latter following the stapes by reason of the
pressure of the air in the cavity of the tympanum on the mem
brane of the cochlear fenestra, which would thus be driven
inwards.
     I think that              the foregoing remarks                       will have made evident
what are the true relative functions of the two apertures from
the tympanal cavity into the labyrinth.      So long as disturbance
was supposed to be transmitted along the chain of bones exactly
in the same manner as if they had constituted a rigid bar, with
out producing in any degree that opening or shutting of the
labyrinth which the whole scheme of the mechanism proves is
possible, and was intended to be produced, the supposition that
                                                                                     air

 is oblique to the latter—the vestibular aperture being opposed
 directly to the full stream of the wave, while the cochlear aper
 ture is exposed to it obliquely, and, as apprehend, though                  I                                         I
 speak less confidently as to this point, laterally with respect to
 the main stream of the incident wave*.
    The difference of pressure thus occurring at the opposite ex
 tremities of the labyrinth will necessarily cause a motion of the
 stapes outwards, to counteract which the muscle of the stapes
 will be called into play, so as to produce eventually a motion in
 the opposite direction—the same action in the labyrinth being
 thus occasioned which it has already been shown occurs when
 the ear is in         its
                normal state, and which, would submit, the whole       I

therefore to make a few remarks on the “ sailing” flight of the

the resistance of the air being supposed to be proportionately
the same in both cases.    This is more than we should expect,
considering the great difference of weight of the birds, but is
owing to the small terminal velocity of the Cape-pigeon. It
must, however, be observed that although it seems that under
favourable circumstances a Cape-pigeon could sail for 14 mi
nutes, the velocity of 29 feet a second is so small that, in order
to make headway against the wind, it would have to stop sailing

   The phenomenon of deadening produced when bodies are con
nected with other sounding bodies gives rise to similar considera
tions. If a leaden tube (even a thin one) be so fitted to a glass tube

                prolongation,      found that the longitudinal tone

of the glass tube    very considerably deadened. This
                             is                                  the case                                is

 140             Dr. E. Warburg on           the Heating produced     in
 thence to be concluded that a thinner and thicker tube, the am
 plitude of whose vibrations is the same, develope equal amounts
of heat in the unit of section, that in the above experiments the
thinner tube was only heated more strongly because the ampli
tude of the oscillations was greater in it; the latter is also seen
in the circumstance that the note of the system is distinctly
louder when the thinner is replaced by the thicker tube.
    The investigation of self-sounding lead tubes led to the same
result. Of three tubes of the same thickness of tubing and
length,
    A   tube of 16 millims, external diameter after brisk rubbing
        gave no deflection at the node.
    A   tube of 9 millims.   . . . . . . . 200 divisions.
    A   tube of 4 millims.   . . . . . . . 600            32
The intensity of the deflection decreased the greater the distance
from the node, and in the loops there was virtually no heating
at all. There can be no doubt that here the stronger heating of
the thinner tubes is simply explained by the fact that when the
same amount of force is used to excite the tone, the amplitudes
of vibration in the narrow tubes must be greater than in wider
ones; for with wider ones a greater mass is set in motion than
with narrower ones.
   After it had been thus established what arrangement of the
experiment    produced the greatest increase of temperature by
sounding, it was easy to demonstrate such a heating also in other
bodies.   The only plan, however, was to connect the metals in
the form of thin wire with the sounding body, and then to put
this into powerful vibrations. A brass wire 1, to 2 millims. in
diameter, the length of which was half the wave-length of the
tone of the glass tube, indicated heat in the node corresponding
to 100 divisions.   If by shortening the wire the strength of the
resonance was increased, 300 divisions were obtained.      Then
come, in decreasing order of intensity of temperature observed,
copper, iron, steel, wood.

    Now most of you will see in a moment that here was a clear
issue, which probably the spectroscope, and possibly nothing else,
could solve; for the spectroseope is an instrument whose special
métier it is to deal with radiation and absorption.            It tells us that
the light radiated from different bodies gives us spectra of different
kinds according to the nature of the radiating body—continuous
spectra without bright lines in the case of solids and liquids, and
bright lines, with or without continuous spectra, in the case of gases
and vapours. It tells us also that absorption dims the spectrum
throughout               its
                   length when the absorption          general, and dims           is                                 it
here and there    only  when the   absorption    selective,   the well-known
                                                                          is
Fraunhofer lines being,        you will readily see,
                                              as             instance        the            an                  of
latter kind.     So that we have general and selective radiation, and
general and selective absorption.
     Now, then, with regard       the English theory,
                                                   to       there were more                if

absorption; that                is,
                        the whole solar spectrum would           visible     the                 be              in

               of                 places only.    in
     With  regard     the French theory, only radiating gaseous matter
                               to
to   deal with, we   should,  according       the then generally received

 idea, get bright lines only      the  spot-spectrum.

   The tremendous atmosphere, which apparently the spectroscope
had now proved to be a cool absorbing one, was supposed to be
indicated during eclipses by a halo of light called the “Corona,” in
which corona the red flames are visible. Now as the red flames are
always observed to give out more light than the corona, they were
probably hotter than it; and reasoning thus on the matter with my
friend Dr. Balfour Stewart one day, we came to the conclusion that
they were most probably masses of glowing gas.
    Now this being so, the spectroscope could help us, and in this way.

   The first attempt was made in 1866, a Herschel-Browning spec
troscope being attached to my telescope; and the first and many suc
ceeding attempts failed: there was not dispersion enough to dilute
the spectrum of the regions near to the sun sufficiently, and as a
consequence the tell-tale lines still remained veiled and invisible.
Nature's secrets were not to be wrested from her by a coup de main.

and other gases and vapours, upon which we have for some time
been engaged.
    First, as to hydrogen, what could laboratory work tell us about
the chromosphere and the prominences?
    It was obviously of primary importance—
  (l)    To determine the cause to which the widening of the F line
was due.
    (2) To study the hydrogen-spectrum very carefully under varying
conditions, with a view of detecting whether or not there existed a
 line in the orange.
    We soon came to the conclusion that the principal, if not the only,
cause of the widening of the F line was pressure.
    Having determined, then, that the phenomena presented by the F
line were phenomena depending upon and indicating varying pres
 sures, we were in a position to determine the atmospheric pressure
 operating in a prominence, in which the red and green lines are
 nearly of equal width, and in the chromosphere, through which the
 green line gradually expands as the sun is approached.
    With regard to the higher prominences, we have obtained evidence
 that the gaseous medium of which they are composed exists in a con
dition of  excessive tenuity, and that even at the lower surface of the
chromosphere (that               is,

the slit, and the wider we open the slit the more of the prominence

     So much, then, for the chromosphere and the prominences, which

  150                     Royal Institution   –
  I think the recent work has shown to be the last layer of the true
  atmosphere of the sun.     I shall now invite your attention to spots.
      Now, as a rule, precisely those lines which are injected into the
  photosphere by convection-currents are most thickened in the spec
  trum of a spot, and the thickening increases with the depth of the
  spot; so that I no longer regard a spot simply as a cavity, but as a
  place in which principally the vapours of sodium, barium, iron, and
  magnesium occupy a lower level than they do ordinarily in the
 atmosphere.
     I have told you before, that when these lines are observed in the
  chromosphere, they usually are thinner than their usual Fraunhofer
 lines.
      I will now show a photograph of a spot-spectrum on the screen.
  You will see a black band running across the ordinary spectrum;
  that black band indicates the general absorption which takes place
  in a sun-spot. Now mark the behaviour of the Fraunhofer lines;
  see how they widen as they cross the spot, putting on a sudden
 blackness and width in the case of a spot with steep sides, expanding
 gradually in a shelving one. The behaviour of these lines is due to
 selective absorption.
     We have, then, the following facts: mark them well:—
     (1) The lines of sodium, magnesium, and barium, when observed
 in the chromosphere, are among those which are thinner than their
 usual Fraunhofer lines.
     (2) The lines of sodium, magnesium, and barium, when observed
 in a spot, are among those which are thicker than their usual Fraun
 hofer lines.
     They show,   I  think, that a spot is the seat of a downrush or
 downsinking.
     Messrs. De La Rue, Stewart, and Loewy, who brought forward
 the theory of a downrush before my observations of an actual down
 rush were made in 1865, at once suggested as one advantage of this
 explanation that all the gradations of darkness, from the faculae to
 the central umbra, may be supposed to be due to the same cause,
 namely, the presence to a greater or less extent of a relatively cooler
 absorbing atmosphere—thus suggesting as one cause of the darken
 ing of a spot
     (1) The general absorption of the atmosphere, thicker here than
 elsewhere, as the spot is a cavity.
    To which the spectroscope added in 1866, as you know,
     (2) Greater selective absorption.
    I   have Dr. Frankland's permission to exhibit an experiment con
 nected with our researches on absorption which will show you that
 this increased selective absorption can be fairly grappled with in our
laboratories.    I will show you on the screen the absorption-line due
to sodium-vapour, in one part as thin as it is in the ordinary solar
spectrum, in another almost if not quite as thick as it appears in a
spot; and I accomplish this result in the following way:—Here I
have an electric lamp, and by means of this slit I only permit a fine
line of light to emerge from it; here the beam passes through a bi

sulphide-of-carbon prism, and there you see on the screen the glo
rious spectrum due to the dismemberment of the fine line of poly
chromatic light. Mr. Pedler will now place a glass tube containing
metallic sodium, sealed up with hydrogen, in front of the slit, and
will heat it with a spirit-lamp.
   As the sodium-vapour rises you see the dark line of absorption

that the light which traverses the upper layer       the sodium scarcely        of

gas has been increased.
   You see now on the screen a diagram showing the strange con
tortions which the F hydrogen line undergoes at the centre of the
sun's disk.    Not only have we the line bright, as I have before told
you, but the dark one is twisted in places, generally inclining towards
the red; and often when this happens we have a bright line on the
violet side. You see it sometimes stopping short of one of the small
sun-spots, swelling out prior to disappearance, invisible in a facula
between two small spots, changed into a bright line and widened
out on both sides two or three times in the very small spots, beco
ming bright near a spot and expanding over it on both sides—very
many times widened out near a spot, sometimes considerably, on the
less refrangible side, and, finally, extended as a bright line without
any thickening over a small spot.
   Now the other Fraunhofer lines on the diagram may be looked
upon as so many milestones telling us with what rapidity the uprush
and downrush take place; for these twistings are nothing more nor
less than alterations of wave-length, and, thanks to Angström's map,
we can map out distances along the spectrum from F in Town',www.ths
of a millimetre from the centre of that line; and we know that an
alteration of that line Trotºrbon millim. towards the violet means
a velocity   of 38 miles a second towards the eye             uprush), and          (i.   e.   an

case than in the other: these considerations were found valid through

broken, the mixture formed, and the rise in the temperature of the
calorimeter observed.
  The units of heat evolved in the formation of 5 grims.                                                    of    each

  A small   flask was taken; into this 100 cub. centims. of the mixture
was introduced, and the mouth of the flask closed by a doubly perfo
rated cork. Into one of these perforations a thermometer was intro
duced, into the other a bent tube, dipping beneath the surface of the

    In conclusion the authors confine              themselves      to pointing out cer
tain relations which connect the various              physical    properties       examined.
   These properties may be divided into two classes, according as
they reach a maximum deviation from the theoretical mean at 30
per cent, or 40 per cent. ; each of these is divided into two sub
classes, one containing those properties in which the numbers found
are above those calculated, and the other containing those in which
they are below.

       Class II.
            Subclass c. Rate of expansion.
                 ,,     d. Compressibility.
    Other characters, examined by previous investigators, are :—

   The two latter form a new class, coming to a maximum deviation
from their theoretical value at 45 per cent.                        e
   In subclass a, specific heat—by reference to the Tables given, it
will be seen that the first addition of alcohol to water (though
alcohol has a specific heat much lower than that of water) produces
mixtures which have a higher specific heat than water, and that a
mixture containing between 30 and 40 per cent. alcohol has the
same specific heat as water.
    Similarly alcohol, though much more compressible than water,
yet, when added to                   it,
                            forms mixtures less compressible than water                                                      ;

all  mixtures stronger than this, the rate            expansion     constantlyof                         is
above that calculated.

beds forming the escarpment may                             be     divided into two parts, namely:

  the upper beds, which are brown, sandy, cellular limestones with
  numerous oyster-beds; and the lower, or white Nummulitic lime
  stone proper. A bed of marl with fibrous gypsum generally occurs
  at the junction of the two groups of strata.
       In the upper or brown beds celestine occurs with gypsum, some
  times in isolated crystals, but more generally in stellar or spheroidal
  nodular aggregates, the points of the crystals being turned outwards.
  About thirty feet lower down in the white limestone, rough irregular
  crystals of the same mineral are found in open hollows or druses.
  They are often large, but much decomposed, and apparently crusted
  with Nummulites, Bryozoa, &c., which are in reality included in
  the crystals, and have become exposed by erosion.                   The erosion
  and alteration of the       crystals commences    by   the  roughening   of the
  faces of the prism, owing to the formation of numerous fine stria
  tions parallel to the basal planes, and goes on frequently until the
  entire disappearance of the crystals.           The ultimate product is a
  hollow cast of the      crystal,  which  may then be filled with limestone,
  forming a pseudomorph by total replacement.                This, however, ap
  pears to be rare. More generally the dissolved celestine has been
  redeposited upon the altered crystals, forming macled groups.              The
  secondary crystals are compact, brilliant, and well formed, without
  included foreign bodies.         These phenomena were attributed by the
  authors to the    solubility  of sulphate of strontia in chloride of sodium.

  other Fossils from the Cretaceous Rocks of Sinai.” By Dr. P. Martin
  Duncan, F.R.S., Sec. G.S., &c.
      The author identified the fossils brought by Mr. Bauerman from
  Sinai as belonging to the Upper-Greensand and Hippuritic-Chalk
  horizons, and correlated them with those of Algeria and South
  eastern Arabia.        He determined the following species:—

       After mentioning that no one had satisfactorily proved the former
   existence of glaciers in the Puys of Auvergne, the Cevennes moun
   tains, or the massif of the Lozère, the author stated that, from study
   ing the Government map, it occurred to him that traces of a glacier
   ought to be found in the eastern part of the granitic massif of the

   I passed the current through the apparatus and through a tan

apparatus was then removed and replaced by coils of known resist

reproduce the intensity i. The resistance of the liquid was equal to
that of the coils and of the rheostat.

    This fact does not contradict Joule's law; we shall, on the con

according to this physicist, each section of the current, having a real
intensity I and a duration a, must disengage during a vibration a

  WHEN          an electric
            nometer in which      the individual coils are well insu
 lated, it frequently happens that the position of equilibrium of
 the needle is altered, and that this alteration lasts even after the
 discharge.     This disadvantage may be greater or less, according
to the construction of the galvanometer and the distance from
the coils to the moveable parts of the instrument, while the
quantity and density of the discharged electricity moreover exert
great influence in this respect.        If the electrical discharges are
very powerful, it may happen that the galvanometer becomes
quite spoiled for accurate determinations of the discharge.
    There are several causes for this imperfection of the instru
ment in question.       It is well known that strong discharges can
bring about a change in the distribution of magnetism in the
magnet.       The electrical shock can make the magnetic distribu
tion stronger or weaker, or even invert the poles, or change the
line of connexion between them.           If the galvanometer has an
astatic   system,  the electrical shock may easily alter the ratio of
the   strength  of the magnetisms in the two needles, by which the
delicacy is altered, and sometimes a change ensues in the posi
tion of equilibrium of the system of needles.          Hence a galvano

              the Galvanometer used in Electrical Discharges.                                             171
lims. The mirror was above the frame which was surrounded
by the wire; and the whole was protected by a bell-jar.       When
the magnetic needle was removed and replaced by a brass needle
of the same size, and the mirror with its affixed needle was sus
pended by two cocoon-threads,      by which the moveable system
obtained a definite position  of equilibrium,  it was observed that
this position of equilibrium was altered when a strong discharge
was passed through the galvanometer-wire.         The alteration in
the position of equilibrium could not be due to a change in the
magnetism of the needle; for there was no magnetic needle in the
apparatus.   When the glass globe was carefully removed and the
mirror investigated, it was found to be electrical. This alteration
in the position of equilibrium was thus due to the fact that in
the discharge electrical induction was produced in the moveable
parts of the instrument, which acted electroscopically on the
fixed parts and produced an altered position of equilibrium.
    Hence the moveable parts had to be constructed in such a
manner that the electrical action between them and the fixed
                                                                                                           of a its

with electricity while the machine was at work, there was a ma

made   partly  when the metallic disk on which was the magnetic

when this metal disk was removed and instead of it another
metal disk of equal size, but without a magnet, was fixed to the

                                 of

174                  Prof. E. Edlund on the Path of the
derations  that, like those resulting from voltaic induction, these
currents are formed of two currents equal in quantity, one of
which has the same and the other the opposite direction to that
of the primary currentº.     As these currents are equal in quan
tity, and in opposite directions, they cannot deflect the magnetic
needle; but they can disengage heat, and, as their intensities
may be unequal, can also produce magnetic induction in har
dened steel needles. This view as to the nature of the induction
currents in question, which rests upon theoretical considerations,
has been confirmed since the discovery of the electrical valve has
furnished an unfailing means of distinguishing between the two
opposed currents.    The electrical valve consists of a hollow glass

             Extra Currents through the Electric Spark.                               175
tween the points  and k was a bridge
                       i
of German-silver wire; and the point
k was moreover connected by the
conducting-wire        l
                     with the water
pipe in the house, and was thus placed
in conducting communication with
the earth. When the disk A B was
rotated, sparks passed between b and
                                f
d as well as between and g, and the
needle made a deflection.            The      re
sistance in the wire h was infinitely
small, compared with that of the rheo
stat ºn and in the spark between               f
and g. Hence the induction-currents
formed in the coils of the galvanome
ter passed almost exclusively through
the bridge h; and as they were equal
in quantity while opposite in direc
tion, their action upon the needle
was of course imperceptible.      This
would not have been the case if the
bridge h had not existed, and the currents had had to pass through
the spark between          f
                     and g; for this, as will afterwards be shown,
                                               is,
acts like an electrical valve—that     transmits one current but
stops the other. Polarization-experiments showed, moreover, that
the current obtained arose from the spark between and       and not
                                                               f            g,

shown, had been       much improved that the bridge
                           so                              could         h                be

some interest,    will give them here.

   At  the time the galvanometer was made       also had coil con
                                                                         all a

structed for making induction-experiments, which           respects in
was like the coil      of
                     the galvanometer.     The wooden frame had
the same dimensions; the wire covered with gutta percha was                               of
the same kind; and the number     windings    of
                                               both coils was  in
the same, namely forty.  Hence under the same circumstances
both coils must exert the same inductive actions.    the vol           If
taic resistance       in
                    the rheostat     was called 100,
                                          m             was found   it
that the resistance        in

                                 the coils was 4.5, and the resist
ance in   the two conducting-wires from the points    and             c               e   to
the galvanometer amounted       aboutto much. The following
                                                     as
experiments were made with this coil, which     the sequel willin
be called    R—

176             Prof. E. Edlund on the Path of the
    Experiment I.-The bridge h was removed, so that the entire
discharge traversed the galvanometer:—
                                  52.5
                                  50-5

                 Mean     .   .   50-7
    The coil R was thereupon interposed      between e and m, and the
deflections obtained were
                                  30. 1
                                  27-8
                                  27-4
                                  27.6
                 Mean     .   .   28.2
    When R was placed towards n on the opposite side, there was
obtained                          28-3
                                  28°l
                                  27-9
                 Mean      .   .  27.9
The coil R was then removed, and, in order to ascertain if there
had been any change in the induction-machine, the first experi
ments were repeated. The following deflections were observed:—
                                  51-2
                                  50.2
                                  46-2
                  Mean      .   . 49-2
    The mean of the first and last experiments is 50-0, and that of
 the   middle ones 28:1.       Hence the induction-currents in the
 coil R had diminished the deflection of the magnetic needle by
21:9 divisions. Of these induction-currents, one had the oppo
 site and the other the same direction as that of the discharge.
 The first may be designated as A, and the latter as B.        Hence
 in these experiments the currents A traversed the spark between
f  and g more easily than the currents B. The spark accordingly
 acts in this case like an electrical valve.
     Eageriment II.-This experiment was made in order to           in
 vestigate the action of induction-currents upon the deflection when
 R was interposed between g and e. The currents now traversed
 R in the opposite direction to the former one. When no coil
 was interposed in the conduction the following deflections were

    In this case also the deflection was diminished by the induc
tion-currents.    It is easily ascertained that it was the currents

B which traversed the spark between and g with greater facility.
By introducing the coil R into the circuit the resistance was a
little increased.   To convince myself that this was not the cause
of the diminution in the deflection of the magnetic needle, a few
experiments were made in which the resistance of the rheostat
when R was interposed was so much diminished that the total
resistance was a little less than when R was removed.           But
these   experiments   gave just the same results as the above. The
small alteration in the resistance had therefore no perceptible
influence upon the result obtained.    The experiments were made
in such a manner that the place where the spark was formed
was removed from the position indicated by the figure, a little
towards n, while the rheostat took       place between    its
                                                         and   But                c       e.

galvanometer.              If
                     there is a bridge between i and k, the re
sistance of which is small as compared with the resistance in the
spark and in the rheostat m, the greatest part of the induction
produced in the galvanometer passes through the bridge; and as
they are equal in quantity and opposite in direction, their action
on the magnetic needle is eliminated.       But if the bridge is re

   The following experiments show that the first deflection even                           is
considerably greater than the latter.

in the two eyes. The horizontal line of demarcation is that me
ridian of the eye upon which, under similar circumstances, the
image of an apparently horizontal line falls.               The plane which
passes through the two visual lines we will call the visual plane,
and that visual plane which is at right angles to the line of the
face the primary visual plane.          The line joining the root of the
nose and the point of sight, and which therefore bisects the angle
of optic convergence, we will call the median line of sight.
    Now Helmholtz gives as the law controlling                     the move                            all
ments        the eye the following, viz. that when the eye turns
            of

                     other words, the eye may turn               any axis                             on                   at
right angles       the  optic

                      states that “vertical and horizontal lines keep
their vertical      horizontal position

on the optic awes outward, and that the amount of rotation                                   in
creases with the degree of convergence.  Meissner+ has attempted
to determine experimentally the position of the horopter, and
from the position thus determined he infers the rotation of the
eyes: my experiments prove directly the rotation of the eyes;
and from this, as well as from direct experiment,     hope to esta          I
blish the   position of the horopter.
   Helmholtz, it is true, admits some degree of rotation of the
eye on the optic axis, particularly when the eye makes wide ex
cursions in the field of view; but that he does not regard this
as sufficient to interfere seriously with the law of Listing is evi
dent from the form of the horopter which he deduces.          More
over, according to Helmholtz, these slight rotations are con
trolled by the law of Donders, viz. “ that the eye returns always
into the same position when the visual line is brought into the same
direction.”    He regards this law as rigorously exact.      “Every
position of the visual line,” he says, “is connected with a deter
mined and constant degree of rotation.”     But the experiments
about to be described prove that under certain circumstances the
law of Donders, too, is far from being true.

 perpendicular, looking straight forward at a point exactly at
 the same height as the eyes, the visual plane therefore in the
 primary position, and then slowly increasing or decreasing the
 convergence of the optic axes so that the vertical lines of the two
 images passed slowly over one another, it was plainly seen that
 the verticals of the two images were not parallel, but crossed
 each other at a small angle.
    This, my original diagram, however, is not well adapted to
 experiments on this subject, for two reasons: (1) it is difficult to
 distinguish the image of one eye from that of the other; (2) it
 is difficult to control perfectly the convergence of the eyes. When
 the vertical lines approach each other, they, as it were, leap and
 cling together as a single line, even though they really cross at
 a considerable angle; the really crossing lines, by a well-known
 law of stereoscopic combination, being seen as a single line        in
 clined to the visual plane.        I therefore constructed a similar
 diagram, one-half of which consisted of black lines on a white
 ground, and the other half of white lines on a black ground. It
 is convenient also to have two small circles, one on each half and
                                     I
 similarly situated (fig. 6). If place such a diagram perfectly
                                  Fig. 6.

 perpendicularly before me, with the head perfectly erect and the
eyes at precisely the same height as the small circles, and then
 stereoscopically combine the circles by crossing the eyes,       I dis
tinctly see the white and black lines, both vertical and hori
zontal, crossing one another at small angle, as if the images
of both eyes had rotated on the visual line in opposite direc
tions. This angle of crossing increases as the plane of the
diagram is brought nearer, and decreases as the diagram is
carried further from the eyes.       Or these different angles of cross
ing may be obtained without moving the diagram or the head,
by converging the eyes more and more and causing the white

and black vertical lines to pass successively over each other. This
is more easily done if there are several small circles on each half,
similarly situated but at different distances from each other.        In
this diagram, the lines being of different colours do not stereo
scopically combine easily—they do not cling together as in the
other case. Their approach toward, or recession from, one an
other, and the angle which they make with one another, may be
marked with the utmost exactness.         Nor is there any danger of
confounding the two images; for since the eyes are crossed, we
know that the white lines belong to the right eye and the black
lines to the left eye; we can therefore determine the direction in
which each image rotates.       I find always that the black lines or
the image   of the left eye rotates to the   right -->, and the white
lines or the image   of the right  eye rotates to the left   --.    Now,
as the image always moves in a direction contrary to the motion
of the eye (differing in this respect from spectra), this indicates
a rotation of both  eyes on the optic azes outward     -*   *-*.
   To test this question still further,    I constructed   another   dia
gram, with the horizontal lines continuous across, but the verticals
not perfectly vertical, the upper ends of those of the right half
inclining to the left, and those of the left half to the right, by
about 1° 20' (fig. 7).     On bringing the circles together      I found
that at a certain distance of the diagram (but only at a certain

a  most unaccountable manner.             He says: “Now combine the
two sides stereoscopically, either           squinting    by       stereoscope,     or   by   a
and   you  will see that the white lines                        of
                                                  the one coincide with the
black lines          of
                  the other        soon    as the centres as      both figures           of

                                                                    of
parallel     to
             each other.”      He accounts for this, not                rotation                  by
of the  eyes,  but      theby
                            principle                 of
                                           the difference between real and

                                          of                     He illustrates
this principle thus: “When you draw                       paper            on

                      is              this principle.

                at
   On this principle Professor Helmholtz builds his whole theory
of the horopter.       But that this principle cannot account for the

phenomena he observes,        think can be proved.   I In the first
place,       I
         find that if there be any distinction between real and
apparent verticality for my eyes, the difference is too small to be
detected by the simple observation of lines drawn at right angles
with each other.    For my own eyes really vertical lines are also
apparently vertical, and lines inclined 13° from verticality are not
at     allapparently vertical.       have tried several other normal
                                                      I

horizontals were inclined so as to make an angle of 14° with
the true vertical and the true horizontal (fig. 8), and therefore
perfect squares with one another. At the proper distance, when
the small circles were brought together, the coincidence of both ver
ticals and horizontals seemed to be perfect. When the plane of the
diagram was too near or too far, all the lines crossed, in the one
case in one direction and in the other case in the other direction.
I then        constructed       still other diagrams, in which the inclination
of the lines with the true vertical and the true horizontal were
40 minutes, 24 degrees, and 5 degrees. In        cases  brought     all        I
the lines into coincidence, but    course                 by

which      I
           bring together just as plainly as if they were black and
white threads. While watching them Icontrol their motions almost
as perfectly as if I was sliding with my hands two frames with
white and black threads stretched across them.         There is not the
shadow of a    doubt,   therefore, that in my own case the eyes in con
vergence rotate slightly outward, and that the amount of rota
tion increases with the degree of convergence.
   I  next proceeded to determine the amount of rotation for dif
ferent distances of the point of sight. In the diagram in which the
inclination of the lines was 5 degrees, the distance of the image
was only 2 to 2% inches; for the lines inclined 24 degrees, the
distance of the image was 4 inches; for lines inclined 14 degree
the distance was 7 inches; and for 40 minutes the distance was
about 12 to 14 inches.         I am able by great strain to obliterate,
or  nearly  obliterate,   the common field of view of the two eyes. In
this  case,  of  course,    the eyes both look at the root of the nose.
In this extreme convergence I find that lines coincide which
make with each other an angle of 22°, or 11° with the vertical.
This would seem, therefore, the extreme rotation for my eyes.
The distance of the image in this case is nearly at the root of
the nose.
   If, however,       extreme convergence rotation
                             in                          the optic axes           on

more care and with especial reference       this point. As   ex                                              I

this experiment the verticals came together parallel.    sometimes                                I
thought there was scarcely perceptible inclination

10' for each line with the vertical, or 20' with one another; for
this angle I can distinctly detect under these circumstances.                        I
next constructed a diagram like Professor Helmholtz's, except
that the outward inclination of the verticals was only 40'                         in
stead of 14°.    On combining the two halves of this diagram by
means of a   stereoscope,   there really seemed to be perfect coin
cidence of both verticals and horizontals; but          soon found, by I
trying several, that stereoscopes differ much in this respect.          I
therefore discarded them as unreliable... On      combining    the same
diagram with the naked eye in the manner of a stereoscope, i. e.
beyond the plane of the diagram, the verticals coincided per
fectly when the point of sight was about twelve inches distant,
but the horizontals very perceptibly crossed, though certainly, I
think, at an angle less than 40'              (it
                                       seemed about 20').       On com
bining the two halves           by
                             squinting (of course turning the dia
gram upside down),      I found the result precisely the same when
the  point    sight
              of     was     the same distance, viz.
                                at                          inches.        12       In

this case both seemed         combine perfectly when the point

being 13°.         In
                  this case both verticals and horizontals combined
perfectly     at

line of demarcation.     Both the rotation and the change in the
relation of the two lines of demarcation increases with the degree
of optic convergence.     It is possible that the frequent action of
the muscles   distorting the globe of the eye may leave some per
manent impress upon the form of the globe, so that even in a
passive state the vertical line of demarcation does not coincide
perfectly with the vertical meridian. If so, then to that extent
Helmholtz's principle of real and apparent vertical in the primary
position of the eye will be true.    Or, to express it differently,
we have seen that the inclination of the vertical upon the hori
zontal line of demarcation decreases as the point of sight recedes;
at 13 inch it is 5°, at 2:2 inches it is 11°, at 7-5 inches it is 25',
and at 12 inches 20. It is possible that even when the point of
sight recedes to infinite distance, and the horizontal line of de
marcation becomes coincident with the horizontal meridian, the
vertical line of demarcation may still make a small angle with

the real and apparent vertical spoken of by Professor Helmholtz.

turning the visual plane upward and converging strongly, the

   Meissner accounts for these phenomena          supposing that,                on by                             in
converging the optic axis, the eyes rotate       the optic axis out

with the vertical meridian) and is therefore seen single. But if
the eyes rotate on the optic axes outward, then the image of a
vertical line still falling on the vertical meridian must cross the
line of demarcation in opposite directions in the two eyes, and
therefore cannot be seen single except at the point of sight, the
image of which corresponds to the central point O of the retina
of each eye. In order that the image of a line shall fall on the
line of demarcation in both eyes and thus be seen single, it must
be inclined at a certain angle with the vertical, the lower end
being nearer and the upper end further away.         It is moreover
evident, upon a little reflection, that when the eye rotates, the
horopter cannot be a plane or a surface of any kind; for objects
right and left of the horopteric line must         doubled       dis       all   be              by

with different degrees     inclination ofthe visual plane upward
and downward, Meissner concludes:—(1) That, looking straight
forward        infinite distance, the horopter
              at   an                               plane    right               isa            at

           to                  (2) That for      other distances, the     all
visual plane remaining the same, the horopter            straight line            is   a
passing through the point        sight and increasing
                                             of            inclination                 in

                         the convergence     the optic axes increases.

(3) That      turning the visual plane downward, the inclination
                in
of  the horopteric line with that plane becomes less and less,
until  at45° downward        becomes perpendicular, and therefore
                                       it
the  horopter  again  expands   into   plane     right angles       the   at                     to

                             conclude, therefore, that in this posi
tion of the  eyes the  horopter   is at right angles to the plane of
vision; and since there is no rotation of the eye, the horopter
in this position expands into a surface. Below this inclination
the horopter again becomes a line, but inclined now the other way,
i. e. the upper end towards the observer.      In turning the eyes
upward toward the eyebrows,                                    I
                                    have found the rotation, except
in cases of strong convergence, less than looking straight for
ward.         I
           conclude, therefore, that in this position the horopteric
line inclines less to the visual plane than it does when the visual
plane is in            its
                   primary direction*.

therefore the eye is so constructed and moved as to restrict as
much as possible both distinct vision and single vision. Thus as
in monocular vision the more elaborate structure of the central
spot of the retina restricts distinct vision to the visual line, and
the focal adjustment still further restricts it to a single point in
that line, so also in binocular vision, avial adjustment restricts
single vision to the horopter, while rotation restricts the horop
ter to a single line.
                                      Conclusions.
   The most important conclusions arrived at in this paper may
be briefly summed up as follows:–
   (l) The axial and focal adjustments of the eye are not so                                  in
separably associated as is generally supposed; but, on the con
trary, when distinctness of vision requires it they may be com
pletely dissociated4.
   (2) In this dissociation the contraction of the pupil associates
itself with the focal in preference to the axial adjustment.
    (3) In optic convergence there is a rotation of both eyes on
the optic axes outward, and this rotation increases with the degree
of convergence.
    (4) In inclining the visual plane downward, the rotation of
the eyes for the same degree of convergence decreases until, when
the visual plane is inclined 45° downward, the rotation becomes
zero for        all
              degrees            of
                          convergence.    Below the inclination                               of
45° the rotation     inward.
                           is     turning  the eyes upward, except
                                           In
in   cases     strong
                 of    convergence,   the rotation also decreases
slightly but does not reach zerot         strong convergence

                        Meissner.
      (5) Besides the rotation produced                 by
                                            optic convergence, there

perpendicular to that plane and at the same time expands into a

    I am not aware whether Herr Schröder has seen my subse
quent papers on the subject of which he treats+ ; but as he uses
the same authorities, and no other, it is probable that he has.
It cost me a considerable amount of research to find out the
various memoirs of GErsted, Schönbein, Liebig, and Gernez on
the liberation of gases from solution under the influence of nu
clei–of Watt and Southern, Achard, Gay-Lussac, Rudberg,
Marcet, Bostock, Magnus, Donny, Grove, and Dufour on the
phenomena of boiling liquids; and yet              these authorities, andall
 no other, are made use                   of   by
                                  Herr Schröder.
    It    equally remarkable that Herr Schröder should use the
         is
terms “clean” and “unclean’’             precisely the same sense that
I  do,     distinguishing between
             in                           body that     a in
                                                           “inactive”                is                       in
liberating gas        vapour from liquids and one that
                      or                                         “active”                     is
 in  doing so—and that                    he
                                should describe         inactive body           an                            as
being made active              by
                          drawing through the “finger and thumb”
                                                 it
    say “the hand”), when         becomes contaminated with greasy
or (I

    fatty matter which renders         active.      it   also remarkable       It   is
that Herr Schröder should have hit upon the same explanation
 of the action     flame, sulphuric acid, alkaline solutions, alcohol,
                     of
 &c.     rendering
        in           dirty bodies chemically clean, and therefore                                             in
active       as
           nuclei      gaseous and vaporous solutions.
                          in
 I    should have been quite content            leave               to
                                                            these matters            is all
 unnoticed, seeing that priority         publication  of       my favour,            in
 were     not that Herr Schröder claims for his distinguished coun
         it
 tryman Schönbein the merit          first distinguishing

    Now       Schönbein’s short papert there
              in                                        not the slightest       is
 evidence that the author had     any   idea whatever        the difference              of
between clean and unclean bodies           liberating gas from solution.
 His theory was that solids acted                        so by in
                                          carrying down air, into which
 the gas     solution expanded and
              in                          got liberated.      He expressly
 says that metals from whose surface the adhering film                  has                        of   air
                      of by

 gage bubbles        steam from boiling liquids. Herr Schröder also
 makes Schönbein refer         the action to    porous bodies        nuclei,
                                                                    of                             as
 whereas Schönbein does not even mention             permanently     porous
 bodies,      such    as   charcoal, pumice,
                                    &c.                                    He states,          as   lostock

 XXII.        On the Production  of a Columnar Structure in Metallic
             Tin.    By Dr. T. FRITzsche of St. Petersburg+.
      occurrence of        curious structural change in block tin
THEfrom  Banca was
                                         a
                                     by Dr. Fritzsche. The metal
                                         observed
became   crystalline, and fell into small pieces having a columnar
form. This    change   was attributed to the intense cold prevailing
in St. Petersburg at the commencement of the year 1868.
   Dr. Fritzsche thus describes the experiments instituted to
confirm his view:—“Although                         I
                                     was persuaded that this phe
momenon was     produced  by  the intense cold that we had at the
                                I
beginning of 1868, wished to prove it by experiments.         These
experiments I have lately completed.      I exposed some fragments
cut from a block of Banca tin in an alcohol-bath reduced to the
temperature of —32°–35° R. They underwent a change exactly
similar to that in the blocks in question.
     “It isnecessary for a like cold to be sustained for some hours
to induce the commencement of the crystallization, which showed
itself by the appearance of button-like prominences of a steel-grey
colour rising from the surface of the tin.      Each prominence re
presents a centre from which the crystallization proceeds, if the
cold be sustained.    Gradually the meeting of the acicular crys
tals produces fissures at the points of contact, and the fragment,
the volume of which is much augmented, falls in pieces, which
are very friable and crumble between the fingers.
     “A remarkable fact is that elevation of temperature causes
the steel-grey colour to disappear.       This may be shown by
plunging the steel-grey tin (enclosed in a sealed glass tube) into
hot water, when the natural white colour reappears but without
the former metallic lustre.   This change of colour is not attended
by a loss of weight; neither is the transition of cast tin into
                                                                         air
the crystalline modification, in the presence of            alcohol,     or      in
attended with any loss     weight.   of
                                      have met with cavities
                                                    I           the                   in
altered blocks, one            of
                        which had    capacity     80 cub. centim.;

I     not believe that such large cavitics were formed during the
     do
cooling     of
            the blocks.    attribute their formation
                                     I                  the act            to              of
crystallization; but      cutting these blocks
                                    on               found that the I
change was only superficial, the centre being       the natural con in
dition.    I have there found similar cavitics; and            beyond
                                                                         of it

doubt that   they existed before the commencement        the  change.
As yet English tin has resisted the crystallization; but Banca tin
also undergoes the change even after being melted.

            Prof. W. A. Norton    on    Molecular Physics,        209
sition and office in nature are different.    Professor Bayma also
recognized, in his ‘Molecular Mechanics,’ three distinct portions
or general varieties of matter differing in certain attributes, viz.
the attractive nucleus or “nuclei” of a primitive molecule, a repul
sive “envelope” surrounding the nuclei, and the aether of space.
                                 I
In my reply to his criticisms, stated that we agree in admitting
the existence of two kinds of matter and three forms of matter.
Thus, according to my view, ordinary or gross matter, i.e. ordi
nary material atoms or elements, constitutes one kind of matter,
and aethereal matter another kind.     The latter has the same fun
damental properties, inertia, &c. as the former, but differs from
it in some special property or attribute. Thus the atoms of or
dinary matter were regarded as mutually attractive, and those of
aethereal matter as mutually repulsive.    It was also conceived
that the active forces of the atoms of ordinary matter might be
much less intense than those of aethereal matter—although the
enormous difference between the elastic forces of the aether of
space and of the electric aether and those in operation within
bodies of ordinary matter might be wholly due to the fact that
the latter forces are the reciprocal effective actions of molecules,
which are differential, being the resultant of antagonistic actions.
I will here take occasion to remark that the notion that the
atoms of ordinary matter are mutually attractive, at first adopted,
does not seem to be a necessary one; for if we regard them as
mutually repulsive, it is conceivable that the attraction of gra
vitation might consist in a feeble excess in the attraction of the
central atom of each molecule for the atmosphere of every other
over and above the repulsion subsisting between the atmospheres
of the two molecules, together with the corresponding excess in
the attraction of the electric atmosphere of the first molecule for
the central atom of every other over the repulsion subsisting be
tween the central atoms of the two molecules.       In fact the ex
istence of the former excess is one of the theoretical deductions
of   my  “Molecular Physics.”        Upon the view now taken, an
atom of ordinary matter may differ from an aether-atom only in
                                             to (in
exerting a less energetic repulsion      accordance with the theory
propounded      inmy former answer         Professor Bayma), and   in
exerting    direct attractive action
            a                         upon  the atoms      of
                                                          the electric
aether.   The two aethers, which differ only      subtilety, and ordi
                                                      in
nary matter,    as  has been defined, constitute the “three forms
                     it
of matter.”
     With Professor Bayma the distinction between two kinds         of
matter lies wholly       the kind
                          in         activity manifested.
                                     of                     The one
kind   isessentially attractive  for   all
                                      other elements, and the other
essentially repulsive.     He recognizes two varieties       or
                                                           forms    of

without changing their character, to represent a current of free
electricity. Again, they must be capable of propagation from
molecule to molecule with a continued reversion of their cha
racter, to explain the phenomena of induction.     Still, again,
these atomic or molecular motions must take place simultane
ously with some other mode of motion, answering to heat, and
another, representative of the magnetic or diamagnetic condition;
and these different modes of motion must be convertible each
into every other, &c.       So far from being led into a region of
attractive  simplicity,  the complexity of the scene that presents
itself to the mind's eye would seem to be enough to appal the
most determined explorer in the field of speculative science.
    (3) It is conjectured by some physicists that the luminiferous
aether may be equal to the duty assigned to the electric.              But
no approximation to a successful attempt has yet been made to
realize this idea.     It is a mere conjecture, and therefore un
worthy of serious regard.
    My own position on the question of the existence of an electric
aether was not, as intimated by Professor Bayma, that it is an
established truth, at least with the same degree of certainty that
the existence of a luminiferous aether          but             is,

views that the repulsive envelope of each molecule must “beat
back” the aether of space which it encounters before it comes
within the range of the attraction of the central “nuclei.” But
does he not, in thus escaping one difficulty, encounter another
equally great? This “beating back” of the aether implies that
the molecules of the earth's mass in the advance are, by reason
of the earth’s motion, at such a diminished distance from the
aethereal atoms immediately contiguous to them that a repulsive
action of the molecular envelopes upon these atoms comes into
play superior to that due to the condition of equilibrium that
would obtain if the earth were at rest.     If this be admitted,
it must then at the same time be admitted that the molecules on
the following side of the earth are at a corresponding increased
distance from the aethereal atoms immediately behind them.

        HE                       appearance in phosphorus was
                following remarkable
       described to me some months ago by Mr. James John

   About four years ago Mr. Field placed half dozen sticks                                      a

                          in   a
about half           an
                 inch above the ends      the sticks, and the jar     of
was closed with     bung.   This
                            a    jar was placed       cellar, where                        in   a
it remained undisturbed for about three years.        The cellar                                                     is
flagged with stone,    surrounded is   damp walls, and almost cn

tirely protected from light and currents     air.   The maximum            of
temperature probably does not exceed 50°        55°                          or                  F.
   After this long repose the jar was taken into the laboratory,
when     was found that the level of the water had sunk

218            Mr. C. Tomlinson             on the Supposed Action
weighing ten grains, and ignited both at the same moment.
One piece was placed in a dark room at 67°F., the other was
exposed to broad sunshine at 78°F.    In five minutes
          The taper in sunshine lost 8% grains.
          The taper in the darkened room lost 94 grains.
  The taper, divided into inches, was also burnt in the coloured
portions of the solar spectrum, when it was found that the time
required to burn two inches of taper varied as follows:–
                                                                   r   in

   The conclusion is that the solar rays, in proportion to their
intensity, have the power of retarding to a considerable extent
the process of combustion; and it is supposed that the chemical
rays act in some way on the portion of oxygen about to combine
with the fuel so as to delay, if not prevent, combination.
    Supposing in these experiments the taper was so uniform that
one inch contained precisely the same quantity of matter as an
other inch, the time occupied in burning was too short to justify
so important a conclusion as Dr. M'Keever arrived at, whether
the results were taken by measure or by weight.
   Every one engaged in photometrical observations must be
aware of the difficulty of getting rid of disturbing causes and
perplexing results.        In comparing candles of the same make,
the  light is affected both in quantity and economy by a number
of small circumstances, such as the warmth of the room, the ex
istence of slight currents of air, the extent to which the wick
curls over when burning, and so on.          In testing the quality of
gas, the standard candle defined by Act of Parliament is a sperm
candle of six to the pound, burning at the rate of 120 grains per
hour.    From such a standard we get the terms “ 12-candle gas,”
“14-candle gas,” &c. Mr. Sugg, in his ‘Gas Manipulation,”
has pointed out some of the difficulties in obtaining a uniform
standard candle.      The wick does not always contain the same
number of    strands;    they are not          all    the same degree
                                                           in to

of hardness; the so-called sperm may vary             composition, one
candle containing        alittle more wax than another,         variable    or
quantities    of                 paraffine; the candle may have been
                                       of

                in      was burnt may have been high

All these circumstances affect the rate               of
                                          combustion and the
illuminating-power           of   candles, irrespective   of   the action        of   light,
if   such action really exist.

                          of Light   on Combustion.                      219
  I have  lately had a good opportunity of testing this action at
the works of Price's Patent-Candle Company at Battersea. Under
the direction of Mr. Hatcher, the accomplished chemist of the
Company, the greatest possible care is taken to ensure identity
of composition and illuminating-power in candles of the same
name.    There has lately been an extensive series of experiments
on the  photometrical  value of sperm candles, during which, at
my request, Mr. Hatcher was good enough to note the rate of
combustion of such candles in a darkened room, and also in broad
daylight and even in sunshine.
  In the first observation, three hard and three soft candles
were burned each for four hours in a dark closet.     A similar
set of candles taken from one and the same filling were burned
during the same time in open daylight, partly in sunlight. The
average consumption per hour of each candle was as follows:–
            Sperm in the dark .       .   .     .    134 grains.
            Sperm in the light .      .   .     .    141   ,,
            No. 2 Composites in the dark.                    ,
              ,, Composites in the light.
                                                     133
                                                     140     ,
   It must be noticed that the temperature in the light was 72°,
and in the dark 71°.    Moreover in the light there was a much
greater motion of the air than in the dark closet.    Both these
circumstances would operate in producing a larger consumption
of candle.
      In   a second trial with No. 2 composites the results         were:—
            Ah the   dark    .   . .  140 grains each candle.
             In the  light   .   . . 134       2x      22
      In   a third, also with No. 2 composites, the results were:—
                      In the dark . . . 131 grains.
                      In the light . . . 129                ,
      In
      these two trials the flames were protected as far as possible
from currents of air, and in the third trial the temperature both
in the light and in the dark was nearly equal.
   The fourth trial was made on a bright sunshiny day with hard
sperm candles, which are less affected by variations               of tempera
ture than the composites.  The results were—
               In   the dark (temp. 81°)        .    .    544 grains,
or 136 grains per hour.
           In the light (temp. 84°) . . 567 grains,
or 142  grains per hour nearly.
   It is evident that in this case the increase of temperature
caused by the bright sunshine             led
                                         increased consumption
                                                to   an
of material.

220         Mr. J. Croll         on the supposed greater Loss                     of Heat
  It  will be seen that in the first and fourth trials there is a
greater consumption of material in the light than in the dark,
and in the second and third trials the consumption is greater in
the dark than in the light; but in any case the difference is so
small, amounting only to from 2 to 7 grains per hour, that it
may fairly be referred to accidental circumstances, such as differ
ences in temperature, in currents of air, and in the composition
and make of the candles, the final conclusion to which      am led                                I
being that the direct light of the sun or the diffused light of day
has no action on the rate of burning, or in retarding the com
bustion of an ordinary candle.

founded a   theory  of change  of climate,   and attributes the great
extension of the ice around the south       pole to this extra amount
of heat lost by radiation in consequence of the seven or eight days
of excess in the length of the southern winter over the northern.

222           Mr.      J.   Croll on     the supposed greater              Loss   of Heat
will therefore be the rate at which it will lose that heat by radia
tion. The total quantity of heat received during winter by the
southern hemisphere is exactly equal to that received during
winter by the northern.     But as the southern winter is longer
than the northern, the rate at which the heat is received during
that season must be less on the southern hemisphere than on
the northern. Now this less rate, were it not for a circum
stance presently to be noticed, ought exactly to compensate
for the longer winter.      The southern hemisphere loses heat
during a longer period than the northern ; but then it does not
lose it so rapidly.   Therefore the total quantity of heat lost, were
it not for the circumstance alluded to, would be the same on both
hemispheres.      The same mode of reasoning is equally applicable
to the summers of the two hemispheres.       The southern summer
is shorter than the northern ; but the heat is more intense, and
the surface of the ground kept at a higher temperature; conse
quently the rate of radiation into space is greater.
   When the rate at which a body receives heat is increased, the
temperature   of the body rises till the rate of radiation equals the
rate of absorption, after which equilibrium is restored; and when
the rate of absorption is diminished, the temperature falls till
the rate of radiation is brought to equal that of absorption.
   But notwithstanding        this, owing   allthe slow conductivity  to
of the ground for heat, more heat will pass into          during the                    it
longer summer       aphelion than during the shorter one
                             of                                  peri                             of
helion; for the amount         heat which    passes
                                             of     into the  ground
depends     the length

                  upon the amount received.        Also      like manner            in
during the longer winter         aphelion, more heat will pass out
                                             in                                                             of

standing the greater rate of absorption resulting from the high
temperature of the surface it would not compensate for the short
ness of the day.    On the other hand, the surface of the ground
on the southern hemisphere would be colder during the long
night of 23 hours than it would be on the northern during the
short night of only 1 hour; and the low temperature of the
ground would tend to lessen the rate of radiation into space.
But the decrease in the rate of radiation would not compensate
fully for the great length of the night. The general and com

224        Mr.       J. Croll   on the supposed greater Loss           of Heat
in the sandstone would, if applied to water, raise the tempera
ture of the water 1* C. to a depth of 39 feet 6 inches; that
stored up in the sand would raise the temperature of the water
 1° C. to a depth of 21 feet 8 inches, and that stored up in the
trap would raise the water 1* C. to the depth of 32 feet 6inches.
We may take the mean of these three results as representing
pretty accurately the quantity stored up in the general surface
of the country. This would be equal to 31 feet 3 inches depth
of water raised 1° C. The quantity of heat lost by radiation
during winter below the mean was found to be about equal to
that stored up during summer.
   The total quantity of heat per square foot of surface received
by the equator from sunrise till sunset at the time of the equi
noxes, allowing 22 per cent. for the amount cut off in passing
through the atmosphere, is 1,780,474 foot-pounds.         In the
latitude of Edinburgh about 938,460 foot-pounds per square
foot of surface is received, assuming that not more than 22 per
cent. is cut off by the atmosphere.    At this rate a quantity of
heat would be received from the sun in two days ten hours (say,
three days) sufficient to raise the temperature of the water 1°C.
to the required depth of 31 feet 3 inches.      Consequently the
total quantity of heat stored   up during  summer in the latitude
of Edinburgh is only equal to what we receive from the sun
during three days at the time of the equinoxes.       Three days'
sunshine during the middle of March or September, if applied
to raise the temperature of the ground, would restore          the                        all
heat lost during the entire winter; and another three days’
sunshine would confer      the ground
                                    on     much heat  as   stored               as   is
up during the entire summer.      But     must   itobserved that     be
the total duration of sunshine in winter to that of summer
                                                                                                  of a in

             two months.    But this    not all; the quantity
                                                 is
heat received during winter    scarcely one-third
                                          is        that received     of
during summer; yet notwithstanding this enormous difference
between summer and winter, the ground during winter loses
only about six days’ sun-heat below the maximum amount pos
sessed     by        in   summer.

tained by the earth in winter is as much owing to the excess
in the length of the winter mights over those of the summer as to
the deficiency of heat received in winter from that received in
summer, three days’ heat would then in this case be the amount
lost by radiation in consequence of this excess in the length of
the winter nights. The total length of the winter nights to
those    of the summer               is,   as   we have seen, about                    as

south   polar  winter over the north amounts        only about 184               to

   The storing up of heat or cold in the ground has in reality
very little to do with climate.  Some physicists explain, for ex
ample, why the month of July is warmer than June by referring
it to the fact that by the month of July the ground has become
possessed of a larger accumulation of heat than it possessed in
June. This explanation is evidently erroneous.    The ground in
July certainly possesses a greater store of heat than it did in
June; but this is   not the reason why the former month is hotter
than the latter.             July is hotter than June
                                                because the air (not
the ground) has become possessed of a larger store of heat than
it had in June. And why the                 warmer     July than

comes heated to a considerable depth rapidly.      The quantity of
heat stored up in the ground is comparatively small; the quan
tity stored up in the ocean is great.    (4) The aqueous vapour of
the air acts as a screen to prevent the loss by radiation from
water, while it allows radiation from the ground to pass more
readily into space. (5) The air is heated more rapidly by con
tact with the hot surface of the ground than it is by contact
with the surface of the ocean.      Consequently the heat which
is carried up into the higher regions of the atmosphere and
thrown off into stellar space chiefly comes from the land.

within somewhat more than 420 miles of the equator, supposing
the sun to be vertical over the whole area.
    This enormous difference is quite sufficient to account for the
lower mean temperature of the southern hemisphere.
    But it may be noticed that although the return currents at the
equator are colder than the direct currents, yet they are not so
in the polar regions. The water which leaves the polar seas is
much colder than the water which replaces it from the tropical
regions.
    The general tendency of the great system of ocean-currents is
to cool the equatorial region of the globe and to warm the tem
perate and polar regions.          Also, owing to the present distribu
tion of sea and     land,   and  partly  to the effects on the trade-winds
resulting from the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit”, small as that
eccentricity is at present, there is a constant transference of heat
by means of currents from the southern hemisphere to the
northern.       Ocean-currents tend to reduce the enormous differ
ence of temperature which, according to theory, ought other
wise to exist between the equator and the polest.
    On a former occasion it was shown that aerial currents at the
equator only tend to cool the equator; they do not carry heat
to higher latitudes.         But acrial currents in temperate and polar
regions diffuse over the land the heat carried by ocean-currents.
It is the ocean and not the air that conveys the heat from the
tropics to the temperate and polar regions f.

            object of this communication is simply to point out
 THEmethods,          differing somewhat from those commonly de
 scribed in the books, of demonstrating two or three familiar
 truths of electricity. The experiments I am about to describe
 may probably be well known under one form or another, espe
 cially to practical electricians, who often have opportunities of
 using apparatus and witnessing phenomena which do not fall to
 the lot of mere scientific students.         I do not claim for them any
 novelty, unless it be as lecture-room illustrations.
    1. Eaperiments with the Electrophorus.--So far as I am aware,
 the experiments by which the accepted explanation of the action
 of the electrophorus is supported refer exclusively to the statical
 conditions of the instrument, or, in other words, to the states of

230          Prof. G. C. Foster's Description of   some
electrical equilibrium which it exhibits. The dynamical pro
cesses by which these statical conditions are brought about are
no doubt, in their main features, very easily traced, and are per
fectly well known; but, until quite recently, it has been a rare
exception for electricians to be in possession of the instrumental
means requisite for making them the subject of direct investi
gation. Now, however, the form of reflecting galvanometer de
vised by Professor Sir William Thomson is in the hands of a
great many experimenters; and it accordingly seemed to me
that, with the view of calling attention to the ease with which
the transient electric currents accompanying the production and
disappearance of electrostatical charge in various familiar cases
can be observed, and even measured, by means of this instrument,
it might be worth while to describe the following experiments.
   An insulating table was made by laying a thin board across
two insulated cylindrical conductors, such as are to be found in
every collection of electrical apparatus.  On this was placed a
piece of sheet zinc, to serve as the lower plate of an electropho
rus, the “cake” of which consisted of a circular piece of vulca
nized india-rubber, about 15 inches in diameter and             inch
thick, and the “cover" of a circular brass plate 12 inches in
diameter, with a glass handle.     The lower metal plate was con
nected, by means of an insulated wire, with one terminal of a
Thomson’s astatic galvanometer having copper-wire coils of up
wards of 6900 B.A. units resistance, the other terminal of which
was connected with a gas-pipe in the laboratory, so as to make
a good earth-contact.     On rubbing the india-rubber with the
hand, the cover having been removed, the galvanometer showed
a deflection which, as soon as it had become steady enough to
be read, amounted to 35 divisions of the scale on the side indi
cating the passage of a positive current from the earth into the
electrophorus-plate. This deflection gradually diminished while
the rubbing was continued, the spot of light finally returning to
zero.   The earth-wire was now removed from the galvanometer
and replaced by a wire connected with the cover: on laying the
cover upon the india-rubber, the galvanometer gave a deflection
of 250 divisions on the opposite side to that observed during
the rubbing.    On lifting the cover again, there was a deflection
of 230 divisions in the original direction, followed by a deflection
of 200 to the other side on replacing         On repeatedly lifting
                                             it.
and replacing the cover, deflections were obtained every time,
though gradually diminishing      in amplitude      consequence
                                                   in               of
the imperfect insulation  of the india-rubber.
  In  a second similar experiment, the maximum deflection during
the rubbing was 40 divisions; the deflection       on
                                                    putting    on the
cover, 260 divisions;   on removing    it,
                                         240.

    These results show very plainly the nature and importance of
 the electrical changes which take place in the lower plate of the
 electrophorus while the apparatus is being used. Their mean
 ing is too obvious to require further comment.
    Equally decisive results are obtained if the lower plate is left
 constantly in connexion with the earth through the galvano
 meter, and the cover is repeatedly put on, touched, raised, dis
 charged, and replaced, as in the common way of taking a series
 of charges from the electrophorus.              On putting on the insu
 lated cover, the galvanometer is not affected; but on afterwards
 touching the cover, a strong deflection is obtained in the direc
 tion indicating a downward positive current (that                        current              is,

following experiments the condenser                        of
                                             medium-sized Ladd's

induction-coil was used.

 With the two Daniell's cells connected in series, the sum of the
 opposite deflections  was 307 divisions.
   These numbers      give, as the mean ratio of the electromotive
force of one Grove’s cell to that of one Daniell's cell,
                         507: 307 = 1.65   : 1.
According to Poggendorff, the ratio, as determined by his me.
thod of compensation, is 1.68 : 1.
   The mode of comparison by means of the galvanometer and
condenser may be rendered more accurate by increasing the ca
pacity of the latter, so as to get larger readings and so diminish
the relative importance of the errors of observation.    The above
numbers, however, which are of course given merely for the sake
of illustration, do not represent the limit of accuracy attainable
with the apparatus I employed: by simply altering the position
of the adjusting magnet of the galvanometer, so as to render the
suspended magnets more perfectly astatic, a deflection of 355
was obtained instead of 307.      For proving to a class the way in
which the electromotive force of a galvanic battery depends upon
the mode in which the cells composing it are connected together,
and other fundamental facts of a like nature, this method can
easily be made abundantly accurate, and is probably as conve
nient and rapid as any of the methods in common use.
   4. Method of demonstrating the existence of the Inverse and
Direct Ertra-currents.-The only method of rendering distinctly
evident the retardation in the establishment of electric currents
in coiled conductors, or Faraday's extra-current on making bat
tery-contact, which I have found described in any of the ordinary
text-books of physics, is one due to Edlund, and requires the use
of a differential galvanometer.     By an arrangement of apparatus,
which may be regarded as a modification of that employed by
Edlund, it is easy to show the extra-current both on making
and breaking the circuit upon an ordinary galvanometer.         This
arrangement will be understood by reference to the figure, where

234.      Description of some Lecture-experiments in Electricity.
B    represents a galvanic battery of one
or two cells, Ka key for making and
breaking the battery circuit, G the gal
vanometer, C and C'two coiled conduc
tors, with or without iron cores, and R.
and R' two zigzag or uncoiled conduc
tors, of which the resistances are so ad
justed relatively to the resistances of C
 and C' that, when the battery-contact
 is permanently maintained, no current
 passes through the galvanometer. Then,
 on completing the circuit, there is a
 temporary deflection of the galvanome
 ter due to the inverse extra-current,
 and on breaking it there is an opposite
  deflection due to the direct extra-cur
  rent. The reason of this is easily seen.
  Supposing p to be the positive and n
  the negative pole of the battery, when
  the key K is pressed down the current
  is immediately established in the circuit
  B Rab R' B, causing a corresponding deflection of the galvano
  meter; after a very short interval, however, the current is also
   established in the circuit BC b a C' B, and brings the galvano
   meter-needle to rest.    On raising the key the current ceases in
   stantaneously in the uncoiled conductors R and R, but continues
   for a short time in the coiled conductors C and C', traversing
   the galvanometer from b to a and causing a momentary deflec
   tion in the opposite direction to that produced on making the
   battery-circuit.   Using for the conductors C and C' the primary
   wire of a medium-sized Ladd's induction-coil and the wire of a
   straight electromagnet, and uncoiled German-silver wires for
   the conductors R and R', I obtained with one cell of Grove’s bat
   tery a swing of from 50° to 60° on a large astatic galvanometer
   with heavy needles 8 inches long on completing the battery-cir
   cuit, and an equal swing in the opposite direction on breaking
    contact after the needles had come to rest.     The directions of
    the swings were such as to indicate that the current both com
    menced and ceased more suddenly in the uncoiled than in the
   coiled conductors.
       The only special precaution that need be pointed out in order
    to ensure the success of this experiment, is that the resistances
    of the several conductors shall be so small, and their mass so
    great, that they may not become sensibly heated and so have
    their relative resistances changed during the passage of the
   current.

     It
      will be seen that the combination of conductors that has
been described is essentially the same as that constituting Wheat
stone’s “electrical balance;” in fact the whole experiment con
sists in purposely exaggerating an effect which, in comparing
electrical resistances by means of that arrangement, it is neces
sary to get rid of by a well-known artifice in the mode of making
contact.

few words on those by the first two, they proceeded to criticise the
others more fully, intimating that the English and Canadian observers

cimen having some tubuli filled with calcite, to which they suppose
Dawson refers when speaking of chambers filled with calcite, as
a case in point; they were unacquainted with any published                                              in

their observations on the so-called “canal-system,” they suggested
that the globoso-vermicular bodies noticed by Dawson and Gümbel
may be metaxite; and they insisted on the difficulty of explaining
the presence of isolated unbroken tube-casts in patches of pure
limestone.      The Madoc specimen, described by Dawson as having                                        its
“canals” and “chambers” filled with calcite, was next referred                                          to

   2. “Notes on the Geology of China, with more especial refer
 ence to the provinces of the Lower Yungtsi.”     By Thomas W. Kings
 mill, Esq.
   The sedimentary deposits of the south of China were described as
 commencing at the base with a series of coarse grits and sandstones,
 having a thickness of about 12,000 feet, and overlain conformably
by limestones and shales (with coal in the lower part), attaining a
thickness of between 6000 and 8000 feet. The whole of these
rocks were described by the author as the “Tung-ting Series.”
In the Nanking district this formation is succeeded by sandstones,
grits, and conglomerates, which the author has grouped together
under the name of the “Chung-shan Series.” Its uppermost member
contains beds of coal, and possesses an unknown thickness; but the
remaining beds are together about 2400 feet thick. Mr. Kingsmill
described in detail the geological relations and geographical extension
of these rock-masses; he then gave a sketch of the superficial
deposits, which occupy an important position in the geology of
China, and from the older of which Mammalian bones and teeth
have been obtained ; and he concluded by stating that he had been
uniformly unsuccessful in his frequent searches for traces of glacial :
action.

   1. “On Hyperodapedon.”        By Prof. T. H. Huxley, LL.D., F.R.S.,
Pres. G.S.
   The author described the characters of the genus Hyperodapedon,
dwelling especially upon those presented by the head and dentition.
The head presents indications of a bone forming a second zygomatic
arch on each side; the upper jaw is produced and bent downwards,
forming a strong beak; and the lower jaw is produced on each side
of the symphysis into a pointed process, between which the decurved
beak of the upper jaw is received.     The maxillary and palatine teeth
are arranged in rows, and present some resemblance to the large nails
in the sole of a boot; they are inserted on each side of the upper jaw
upon the sloping sides of a deep groove, and are worn down and
polished by the action of the mandibular teeth, which form a con
tinuous and very close single series along the upper edge of the
mandible. The author remarked upon this peculiarity of arrangement,
which, he said, enables the teeth of Hyperodapedon to be recog
nized wherever they may occur. The vertebrae have their centra
slightly concave at each extremity.       The other known parts of the

and part of the humerus, the pelvis, femur, and proximal ends of
the tibia and fibula, and the abdominal false ribs, which are largely
developed in this Reptile.
   The author declared the affinities of Hyperodapedon to be de
cidedly Lacertilian.    Its nearest fossil ally is the Triassic genus
Rhynchosaurus, and in the present day             type    structure      its          of                      is

 garded   as determining the Triassic age           any rockof     which     may     in             it

   2. “On the Locality of a new Specimen of Huperodapedon onthe
South Coast of Devon.”     By W. Whitaker, Esq., F.G.S.
   The author described the section presented by the South Devon
coast westward from the great landslip at Dowlands.   The cliffs here
show Rhaetic beds   passing  down into Red Marls of   Upper   Triassic
age, which have greenish layers among them, favouring the view that
the Rhaetic beds might as well be classed with the Trias as with
the Lias.   Below these beds are Red Marls and Sandstones; and at
Budleigh Salterton a bed of quartzite pebbles occurs. West of the
Exe the cliffs are of sandstone with layers of breccia; and beyond
Dawlish the breccia gradually predominates, until towards Teign
mouth the cliffs are almost wholly formed of      This breccia forms      it.

them       to     be   the equivalents               of       the Rhynchosaurus-sandstones                   of
Shropshire.
   Professor RAMsAY regarded the Red Marls and Sandstones de
scribed by Mr. Whitaker      Keuper, and the lower members

    Dr. MERYon inquired as to the implantation of the teeth in the
jaws of Hyperodapedon, and suggested that the position and direc
 tion of the orbits were not accordant with terrestrial habits, and
 also that the absence of processes on the ribs indicated a flexibility
 of the body consistent with a fluviatile mode of life.
    Prof. Huxley showed that no conclusion could be drawn from the
 want of processes on the ribs or the position of the orbits as to the
 habits of the animal, and remarked that the processes in Sphenodon
 were not anchylosed to the ribs; he considered it possible, but not
 probable, that the jaws had a horny covering.       He stated that in
 using the term “poikilitic,” he was desirous of indicating that,
 while several marine formations with changing forms of life suc
 ceeded each other, the terrestrial fauna may, in certain cases, have
been   continuous.   He believed that terrestrial forms were at least
as persistent  as marine.
   Dr. CARRUTHERs remarked that the Permian vegetation showed
mesozoic affinities, and in fact that the commencement of the Meso
zoic flora was to be sought in the Permian.

  superficial basaltic layer. The remains are imbedded in a Red Clay,
  and associated with haematitic iron ore.
     The author regarded a large cone as that of a true Pinus, and
  branches of another coniferous tree as belonging to a Sequoia nearly
  allied to S. Sternbergi, Heer; of this a small imbricated cone might
  possibly be the fruit. Other fragments of Coniferae seem to belong
  to Cupressites or Tawites.     The fossils consist chiefly of leaves of
  true Dicotyledonous plants. The author identified some of these
  with species of Rhamnites, Olea, Fagus, and Quercus.           Leaves of
  endogenous plants, such as Sedges and Grasses, occur not unfre
  quently.    A large mass of fossil wood of dicotyledonous structure
 was obtained from the haematitic conglomerate. Carpolithes are also
 found.     The vegetable remains are accompanied by a few elytra of
  Beetles.
     The author remarked that these remains seem to differ as a group
  from those of the island of Mull.     Their alliance appears to be with
 Mid-European forms, and they are certainly of Upper-Tertiary age,
 probably Miocene.
     3. “Remarks upon the Basalt Dykes of the Mainland of India
 opposite to the Islands of Bombay and Salsette.”         By G. T. Clark,
 Esq., F.G.S.
     The author described the general features of the country referred
 to, and stated that the dykes which traverse it vary from 1 or 2 to
 100 or 150 feet in width, and often extend many miles. They are
 all basaltic, with a tendency to prismatic structure, but never co
 lumnar.     The adjacent Trap is but little modified, only somewhat
hardened, so as to resist weathering; by this means long, narrow
ridges, more or less deeply furrowed above by the weathering of the
basalt dyke itself, are produced.      The general direction of the dykes
is parallel to the lines of volcanic vents; those near the main axis of
the Concan lying N. and S., and those near the subordinate axis in
the Malseji valley, about E.N.E. and W.S.W.             They run nearly
straight, and have their faces usually parallel, but sometimes swell out
or contract, or include a rider.       The author considered that these
dykes were formed probably during the latest periods of volcanic
action in Western India. They probably belong, in his opinion, to
two periods, as dykes of different grain frequently intersect each
other. The dykes running N.E. and S.W. often traverse and slightly
dislocate those lying more N. and S., and are probably of later date.
    4. “On Auriferous Rocks in South-eastern Africa.” By Dr.
Sutherland.
    Fourteen years ago the author expressed the opinion that gold
would be found in the metamorphic rocks of Natal. A few months
since Mr. Parsons found this metal by washing the iron-sand of
some of the southern rivers of the colony.          The gold is in micro
scopic rounded grains.        Dr. Sutherland considers that the gold is
diffused as minute    particles in the granite and gneiss underlying the
Silurian rocks of South Africa.
    These old gneissic rocks are very much contorted, include ex

                  Intelligence and Miscellaneous     Articles.                243
tensive veins and lenticular masses of quartz, and are traversed by
basalts.  The Silurian strata, resting unconformably on the gneiss,
have been invaded by <U+017F>igneous matter (which is never granitic), and,
though generally horizontal, are frequently flexuous, and in some
places greatly faulted, to the extent of even 1000 feet, together
with the gneissic rocks beneath. These latter have been deeply
eroded by the rivers, frequently to the depth of 500–1000 feet, and
even of 3000 feet in some valleys; and in the alluvia of these
valleys the gold occurs.  The valleys have sometimes evidently com
 menced in great displacements, forming “valleys of elevation,” on
 which the denuding agency has been operating ever since.
   In certain mountains in the basin of the St. John's River,
Natal, dioritic rock traverses the secondary strata; and along the
line of contact it contains copper-ores with 100 grains of gold to
the ton.
   Mr. DAVID Forbes was glad to find that Dr. Sutherland corrobo
rated his views as to the occurrence of gold in two ways:—
   1. In auriferous granite, as in Wicklow and elsewhere.
   2. In eruptive diorite, a basic rock without free quartz, and cer
tainly of postoolitic date, almost always accompanied by copper
veins.   Most Californian alluvial deposits of gold were derived from
this class of rocks.
   In constructing some of the railways of South America the granite
was found to be so soft, from decomposition, that it could be cut with
the pick and spade; and this softened granite, when washed, pro
duced gold.
   Prof. T. RUPERT Jones considered that, by means of Dr. Suther
land's communication, the Laurentian and Silurian rocks were now,
for the first time, to be recognized as existing beneath the Dicy
nodon-rocks of the Natal ridge.

 NOTE ON ELECTROLYTIC           POLARIZATION.        BY PROFESSOR         TAIT.
I     HAD just obtained one of Sir W. Thomson's most recent forms
      of quadrant electrometer, and it occurred to me that this must be
the proper instrument for determining polarization, as             its

bodies in circulating streams with a velocity either constant or fluctua
ting periodically.  This, of course, implies that the forces acting
amongst those particles are capable of transmitting that motion.
   The principal conclusions arrived at are the following:—
   (1) In a substance in which the action of the vortices is isotropic,
the inteusity of the centrifugal pressure per unit of area is two-thirds
of the energy due to the steady circulation in a unit of volume.
The centrifugal pressure is the pressure exerted by the substance in
the perfectly gaseous state.
   (2*) If there be substances in which the action of the vortices is
not isotropic, then in such substances the proportion already stated
applies to the mean of the intensities of the centrifugal pressures in
any three orthogonal directions.
    (3*) The proportion which the whole energy of the vortices, in
cluding that of the periodic disturbances, bears to the energy of the
steady circulation alone may be constant or variable.
   (4) Absolute temperature is proportional to the energy of the
steady circulation in unity of mass, and to the specific volume in the
perfectly gaseous state.
   (5) In substances which are nearly in the perfectly gaseous state,
experiment shows the proportion in which the whole energy exceeds
that of the steady circulation to be sensibly constant; and         value                         its

pounds:–olefiant gas, cyanogen, carbonic oxide, naphthalin, car
bonic disulphide,        carbonic tetrachloride, amylic

marsh-gas.
    It may  be obtained from olefiant gas either by burning the gas
with   oxygen,    as already described, or by taking the spark of an
induction-coil in the gas at the ordinary pressure.          In the lat
ter case, however, carbon is rapidly set free and the spectrum
becomes continuous. The electric discharge in olefiant gas under
diminished pressure gives a different spectrum, which will be
afterwards described.
    The spectrum obtained from cyanogen varies with the mode
of production. The flame of cyanogen in oxygen exhibits y, 8,
and e. The red group is replaced by a series of bands which
show an opposite character to the rest of the spectrum, inasmuch
as each band is brightest at the most refracted edge.          If cyano
gen be burnt in air instead of in oxygen these bands are more
numerous, extending nearly to 8, and replacing y, which is
then not to be seen *. Instead of the group
           groups      lines—t,
                                                     f we have two very
brilliant           of           which includes seven lines (105–113),
and   6,  which is   composed   of six lines (136–142).     Fig. 1 e is a
reduction of Dibbits's drawing of the spectrum of cyanogen burn
ing in air (De Spectraal Analyse), and agrees well with my own
observations.
    If the cyanogen, instead of being burnt, be rendered incan
descent by the discharge of an induction-coil in the gas at the
ordinary pressure, a spectrum is obtained which contains y, 8, e,
 £, and 6, but which does not exhibit f.         The red group a may
be obtained precisely the same as from the olefiant-gas flame;
but when the intensity of the spark is increased a different aspect
comes out, which is represented in the Plate, fig. 1d.
    Precisely the same spectrum is obtained from a Geissler's tube
enclosing cyanogen of a few millimetres pressure. The spectrum
consists of 2, y, 8, e, , and 6.
    When a Leyden jar is included in the circuit, the relative         in
tensity of the lines is altered, but the spectrum is essentially the
same, with the addition of the nitrogen-lines obtained from the
spark in air.
    The flame of carbonic oxide gives only a continuous spectrum;
but if the induced spark be taken in the gas at the atmospheric
 pressure, we obtain again the carbon-spectrum, comprising
 sometimes Y, 8, e, and f, and sometimes y, 8, e, , and 6. The
red end is too faint to determine. The replacement of the
group    f by     and 6 is very curious, but I have been unable to
    * These bands are thus obtained more completely developed at the lower
 temperature of the flame in air, and are doubtless due to the compound
 cyanogen itself.

    A Geissler's tube enclosing marsh-gas gives y, 8, , and 6,
but the group e is not observed.           This spectrum contains also
a line at  74,  which   may   belong   to the second carbon-spectrum.
    Carbonic oxide has been stated to yield the ordinary carbon
spectrum when the induced spark is taken in the gas at the or
dinary pressure.        The discharge through a Geissler’s tube,
however, exhibits an entirely new spectrum which contains none
of the ordinary carbon-lines. That this new spectrum is also
due to carbon itself is shown by the fact that it is obtained either
from a vacuum-tube enclosing carbonic oxide, or from one enclo
sing olefiant gas”; and it becomes a question of much interest
to determine upon what conditions the production of one or the
other of these forms of the carbon-spectrum depends.                Olefiant
gas is capable of yielding either spectrum.           When the discharge
is passed through a tube containing olefiant gas of only a few
millimetres pressure, the spectrum drawn (fig. 2e) is obtained,
but the gas at the ordinary pressure yields the first form. In
order to determine at what pressure the second spectrum dis
placed the first, a tube provided with platinum wires was con
nected with the air-pump so that it could be exhausted, and by
means    of a tap  with a source of olefiant gas.         It was also pro
vided with a    gauge-tube,    by   means of which the pressure could
be measured. When the             pressure    is about 12 millims, the
spark is violet and gives the carbon-spectrum              of fig. 2; when
the pressure of the gas was gradually increased the spark became
blue; and at a pressure of about 100 millims. the spectrum
changed to that of the first form. When still more gas was ad
mitted the spark became white, and carbon was rapidly sepa
rated.
    Plückert has observed these lines of the second carbon-spec
trum. In his earlier paper he describes them as lines belonging
to the compound carbonic acid; but in the paper published in 1865
he represents them as belonging to carbon itself.             Fig. 2, a & b,
shows the observations of       Plücker,    reduced from the drawing to
his paper in the Philosophical Transactions to the scale employed
throughout this paper.         Fig. 2a shows the spectrum obtained
from   spectral  tubes enclosing    carbonic oxide of 32 millims. pres
sure.    A  comparison    of this  spectrum     with that of carbonic oxide
(fig. 20) and with that of olefiant gas (fig.2e), shows that Plücker
did not succeed in completely separating the two spectra.                  I
have, however, repeatedly obtained the second spectrum alone,
consisting of the bands h, j, k, l, m, n, and o, and exhibiting no

compounds was first noted by Dr. Roscoe, in a lecture delivered before the
Royal Institution in May 1864.

of the gas, the carbonic anhydride is decomposed and the new
carbon-spectrum becomes visible.
     If
      we attempt to define the conditions under which these dif
ferent forms of the carbon-spectrum are produced, we are met
by very considerable difficulties. The knowledge we possess of
the temperature of gases ignited by the electric discharge is so
small, that we cannot with any certainty compare the spectra
produced in this way with those obtained from the flames of car
bon-compounds.      Indeed it seems by no means certain that
we are  right in attributing   the differences obtained in electric
spectra simply to the different temperature to which the gas is
heated.
     In comparing            the spectra               of fig. 1, we notice that the changes
take place at the ends of the spectra, the central groups y, 8, e
remain substantially the same.      If we pass from the spectrum
of the olefiant-gas  flame to that of the cyanogen-flame, we find
the change   at the blue end of the spectrum consisting in the dis

    There is another element of uncertainty which must not be
 forgotten. The calculated temperatures and those obtained ex
 perimentally by Bunsen are the mean temperatures of the flames,
 and it is quite possible for one part of a flame to be 1000° C.
 hotter or 1000°C. colder than the temperature given as the
 temperature of the flame.    The blue cone of a Bunsen gas
 flame, from which the carbon-spectrum is obtained, is certainly
 much colder than the exterior cone of the flame at the same
 p oint.
      Ihave made several attempts to reduce the temperature of the
 olefiant-gas flame, but have not succeeded in altering the spec
 trum at all. Olefiant gas, burnt by means of oxygen in an
 atmosphere of hydrogen, gives the carbon-spectrum brilliantly
 with      all
            the fine lines previously described; and          mixture                           a                        of

carbon rendered luminous below 1500° C.         The result that
the temperature         of the discharge in a vacuum-tube may be
below         1500°C. is certainly unexpected, but it can hardly be
rejected” unless we give up the attempt to account for the dif
ferences in the spectra of the same element by differences in the
temperature of ignition.    We may, of course, suppose the exist
ence of allotropic modifications of carbon-vapour, but we have no
proof of the existence of such.
    The explanation of the Bessemer-flame is extremely difficult.
I  have endeavoured to obtain some approximation to the tempe
rature of the flame both by calculation and by experiment.    The
calculation is based upon the composition of the gas issuing from
the convertor.    A sample of the gas collected from the converter
at the Steel-works at Crewe was analyzed by Mr. C. R.A. Wright,
B.Sc., and gave the following result:-

     An electromotive force, like any other natural force, cannot pro
duce mechanical work out of nothing. The well-known principle,
ea nihilo nihil fit, finds everywhere a confirmation. Electromotive
forces are only “transforming forces,” which change one kind of
motion into another, and always in such a manner that the kind of
motion which is changed has the same mechanical value as that
into which it is changed; they are mechanically equivalent to
each other.             If a closed conducting-wire

the contact between these two metals must show relatively great
variations in temperature, without these indicating any consider
able electromotive force between them.
     If the
          metals are arranged according to the quantities                                of heat
which are absorbed or produced in case a voltaic current                                traverse
the place of contact, it does not seem to me that it is                                 a priori
certain that we should obtain the same series as that                                    formed
when they are arranged according to their electrical tension on
contact.  It seems conceivable that the magnitude of the cur
rent which a contact can produce does not depend simply on the
tension which the electricity can attain when the insulated
metals are placed in contact, but also on the time necessary
 for the production of this state. Though this time is certainly
.very short, it may doubtless be comparable with the time for
 the passage of the current from one pole to the other.            it                      If
 is indeed so, the ordinary electrical series for the case in which
 a real current is produced cannot without further proof be re
 garded as the right one. What is the real state of the case must
 be decided by trustworthy measurements of the heat absorbed
 and produced.     Peltier's phenomena obtain thus an unexpected
 interest.     If
               time and circumstances permit,       hope before long      I
 to make an experimental determination of the quantities of heat
 in question.

                                     obtained a new formula for
dispersion. The numerical results from the two investigations
(exhibited in page 427) show that the second formula accords
with the experiments in a slight degree better than the first.
   Since the publication of that volume                     I
                                           have become acquainted
with Ditscheiner's measures of a large number of wave-lengths
for dark rays of the solar spectrum, and of corresponding refrac
tive indices; and my present object is to compare these data with
the theory modified as above stated.      Ditscheiner's measures,
accompanied by investigations of appropriate formulae, are given
in a memoir in the Sitzungsberichte of the Mathematico-physical
Class of the Imperial Academy of Sciences at Vienna (vol. 1.
part 2 (1864), p. 296).      The values of X were determined,
according to Fraunhofer's method, by the diffraction-spectrum.
The mean interval between the lines of the grating, in default
of means of measuring it directly, was, at first, inferred, by ob
servation and calculation combined, from Fraunhofer's determi
nation of the value of X for that component of the double line D
which is nearest the violet end of the spectrum; and the wave
lengths obtained for the other lines were thus made dependent
on that determination.    Subsequently, having learnt that Ang
ström had employed a value of the interval between the lines of
his grating obtained by direct mechanical means, Ditscheiner
succeeded in effecting a like determination with respect to his
own grating, and was thus enabled to calculate independent
values of       all
                 the wave-lengths.         The results     this calculation,

which differ but little from those previously obtained, are given
in  the above-cited publication (vol. lii. part           (1865),     2289).             p.

   In the foregoing Table Fraunhofer's principal rays are indi
cated, as usual, by the letters B, C, D, E, F, G, H.                          The other
letters were employed by Ditscheiner to                 designate        lines for which
there were no measures by Kirchhoff.                    The numbers opposite to

the double line D apply to the mean position between the com
ponents. The refractive index corresponding to the measure
1989.5 has been altered conjecturally, the given value (1.63133)
having been the same as that corresponding to the measure 2005-0.
    Respecting the numbers in the last four columns, it is to be
stated that they express actual lengths in millimetres multiplied
by 10°. It will hence be seen that the differences between the
calculated and observed values of A are generally very small. The
larger differences occur so exceptionally that they must plainly be
referred to errors of the data from observation.    This is especially
the case with respect to the rays whose measures by Kirchhoff
are 1135-0, 2119.8, 2416-0, and 2436-5, and the ray designated
by the letter v. Leaving out of account the discordant results
for the ray 1135-0, there seems to be a systematic variation be
tween the calculated and observed wave-lengths in the part of
the spectrum from B to E, but not nearly in the same degree in
any other part. Also it is to be noticed that there is a close
agreement between the results from the two calculations, the
 difference in no case exceeding 26, excepting in the first three
comparisons, for which the differences are respectively 117, 80,
and 40. This circumstance might be supposed to indicate a
 discrepancy in the data for the rays B and C.

     In order to clear up this point, went through for the seven
 principal rays the same calculations as those by which the Table

differences between the results of the first and second calcula

  In       this       is not the same discrepancy between the
                     case there
comparisons for the rays B and C as in the two former calcula
tions, and the law of the mean excesses is in some degree altered.
It must not, however, be concluded that the previous discord
ances arose from inaccuracy in either or both of Ditscheiner's
values of p for those rays, because it is possible that differences
in the character of the results may be due to differences in the
qualities of the glasses employed, and that the dispersion-formula,
which can only be regarded as approximate, may apply more
accurately in proportion as the refractive and dispersive powers
are larger.    This point will be adverted to again presently.
  It  being uncertain to which of the two lines D Fraunhofer's
determination of A applies,                          I
                                  have compared the calculated
value of A with the observed value for each line.   The excesses,
given above within brackets, show that the more refrangible line
is considerably more in accordance with the theory than the other.
   The calculations were then repeated with the same values of
p and with Ångström's values of A already cited, and the wave
length obtained                 for
                    was compared,     Dabove, with the observed     as

     Here again the mean excesses for B and C are more accord
 ant than those deduced by the former calculation from Ditschei
mer's values of A and the same values of A.             Also the law of the
 mean excesses     agrees generally     with that of the means obtained
 by the next preceding calculation, although their amounts are
 somewhat larger.       As the more refrangible of the lines D again
 gives more consistent results than the other, the theory, think,    I
 may be considered to have decided that this line was bisected by
 Fraunhofer.                                   I
                  In future calculations shall assume that this was
 the case.
     It  remains to discuss more particularly the consequences of
 applying the dispersion-formula to substances of different densi
 ties and different refractive powers. With this object in view             I
 begin with comparing Ditscheiner's values of A for the seven
 principal rays (that for D being 58989), with values calculated
 by the formula from Fraunhofer's refractive indices for flint-glass
 No. 23 (prism of 60°) and flint-glass No. 3. The specific gravi
 ties of the two substances are respectively 3724 and 3.512 (that
 of No. 13 is 3-723). In these two instances the calculation of
 A', B, C' was made from one set of data, viz. the observed values
 of u and X for the rays B, E, G. The following results were
 obtained, CA–O, signifying the excess of the calculated above
 the observed value of    X:-
     For No. 23,

 The values of C.—O, for the rays C, D, F, G, inasmuch as they
 correspond to large values of CA–O, show that it is necessary
 to take into account a greater number of terms of the series.             It
 was, in fact, to be expected, from what was said above, that an
 approximation could not be obtained by determining only three
 constants.
    The above data for the rays B, D, F, H having been employed
 for calculating the constants of four terms of the series, the
 results were
    Ao-2290385,           Al-[0.2260364],          -A2=[0,8234811],
         As=[17942593].
 Hence on calculating the values of a for the rays              C, E, G by
means    of these constants and the above values of A for the same
rays, the excesses      C.-O.      to five places of decimals were found
to be respectively +0.00001, 0:00000, -0.00006. These re
sults prove that the relation between u and X for this substance
is very closely expressed by taking account of only four terms of
the series.
    Lastly,  I employed the same series to four terms to calculate
C.—O,     for the rays C, E, G for water, the means (to five places
of decimals) of two determinations of the refractive indices by
Fraunhofer being adopted, viz.
  Bu-1-33096, Cu + 1.33171, Du-1-33358, Eu-1-33585,
         Fu-1-33780, Gu-134128, Ha-1-34417.
Calculations made with the data for B, D, F, and             H gave
   Ao-   1748267,         Al-[0,1049879],          -As- [0.985.4382],
         A3– [18172302];
and the values of Cº-O, found for the rays C, E, G were re
spectively —0.00002, +0.00002, —0.00005. These differences,

which are of the same order as those between the different expe
rimental determinations of p, sufficiently attest the accuracy of
the formula.
    I take occasion to advert here to a memoir by the Astronomer
Royal in the Philosophical Transactions for 1868 (part 1, p. 29),
the object of which is to calculate the wave-lengths correspond
ing to Kirchhoff’s scale-measures      of lines of the spectrum, in
order to increase the scientific value of these measures.           The
calculations for this purpose are based upon Ditscheiner's deter
minations of the wave-lengths for the lines B, C, D, E, F, G.
Kirchhoff’s measure is expressed as a function of the correspond
ing wave-length by a simple algebraical formula of interpolation
containing six constants, the values of which are found by means
of the scale-measures and wave-lengths of the above six lines.
Mr. Airy chose this method because he did “not know any phy
sical reason for adopting one formula in preference to another.”
The method appears not to have been successful, several of the
 differences between the computed and observed wave-lengths in
the part of the spectrum between F and G ranging between 800
 and 900, and in some cases exceeding the latter number.             In
the Table    given  in this  communication,   the  greatest  difference
 between the calculated and observed values of X in the case in
 which the calculations were founded on the values of A and A.
 for only the three lines B, E, G is 106, a few larger (evidently
 affected by errors of observation) being excepted.       The superior
 accuracy   of the results thus obtained is not to be attributed to
 my calculations having been made with refractive indices instead
 of Kirchhoff’s measures, because these are data of the same kind as
 the others and equally trustworthy. My better success is rather to
 be accounted for by the advantage I have taken of the indications
 of the Undulatory Theory of Light, and may,         I think, be justly
 regarded as some evidence of the truth of the proposed theory of
 Dispersion.     Since Kirchhoff’s scale-measure is a function of u,
 the results of the foregoing calculations made by assuming for
 A* a series proceeding    according to powers of       would   seem  to
                                                   X?'
 prove that, by the intervention of a like series for the scale
 measure, it would be possible to calculate the corresponding
 wave-length with great accuracy.

282                 Prof. E. C. Pickering's Observations of
ization is produced only by specular and not by diffuse re
flection.
    The spectrum of the corona was observed in the following
manner. A common chemical spectroscope was used; but                                                        in
stead of attaching it to a telescope, it was merely pointed in the
proper direction a short time before totality.               As        field                 its             of
view was       7     degrees
                    or    8      diameter,     in
                                               the sun remained              for

a   considerable time, and the spectrum obtained was that due                                                to
the corona, protuberances, and sky near the sun. On looking

                                                                     a

 that these were due        the protuberances; but Professor Young,

 with a   large spectroscope          five prisms, found

 which remained visible even when the           image      the  protuberance  of
 was moved off the slit, and therefore inferred that                  was due                it
to   the corona.     He also found the continuous spectrum free
 from dark lines—and that one, perhaps three                       the bright           of
 lines coincide with those of the aurora borealis.             These results
 would lead        the belief that the corona

            the Corona during the Total Eclipse, August 7, 1869.                                    283
positives especially show that this effect extends over a large part
of the sun's disk. The exposure was rendered instantaneous by
passing a diaphragm with a slit in it in front of the camera, the
rapidity of motion being regulated by a series of springs.       Any
irregularity in the motion would cause variations in shade in the
photographs; but these would form bands parallel to the slit,
while the shade mentioned above was not parallel to it and was
curved so as to follow the moon’s edge. Since, then, there is an
increase both of the actinic power and of the heat, it would seem
that these effects are real, since the methods of observing them
are so totally different that no error in one could be introduced
into the other. The only explanation of the phenomenon that
seems possible is to assume the presence of a lunar atmosphere.
The corona would then be caused by refraction, light reaching
 the observer from parts of the sun already eclipsed.      Although
 for various reasons this    hypothesis  is  unsatisfactory, yet it is
 strengthened by other observations.       The  protuberances    have
 often seemed to indent the moon’s edge, an appearance usually
 ascribed to irradiation.    Several of the photographs, however,
 show this same effect; and in some of them the exposure was so

stinct, and that the light of the sun during an eclipse should be
increased rather than diminished.        Again, we should expect
that such variations would be produced by changes of tempera
ture that they could scarcely fail to be detected.
    We then conclude that the polariscope gives only negative re
 sults, and cannot be regarded as proving that the light is reflected.
The evidence of the spectroscope needs confirmation, since the
 dark lines may have been invisible owing to the feeble light of
 the corona.    But if the observations with it are correct, the self
luminous character of the corona is established.       The thermo
 metric and actinic experiments point towards a lunar atmosphere
 as the cause of the corona.

 of each view, unbiased by any theory, leaving to those best able
 to judge to determine whether either explains          the facts ob                      so all

conclusion than the     general  one that these bodies exhibit a
vapour-density more widely different from the theoretical one the
nearer they are to their condensation.     Bineau then furnished a
few numbers concerning the relation between         three quantities,             all

was indicated by fine Geissler normal thermometers graduated to
the tenth part of a degree, which were controlled by comparison
with other normal thermometers, and by repeatedly checking their
fixed points. By means of a double stirrer, which could be rapidly
moved up and down, a uniform temperature was preserved
throughout the bath. Outside the bath a T-shaped glass tube,
pom n, was now connected with the protruding end of the tube,
cd, by an india-rubber tube and some luting-wax. The descend
ing branch (on) of this tube, which was provided with a perforated
glass cock, was connected with an air-pump, while the other end,
om, conducted into a chloride-of-calcium tube, u, and thence
into a manometer, ef. The connexion between these last two
ends was made by means of an india-rubber plug, which em
braced the narrow tube and was forced into the larger one.         All
the  points  of connexion were so    tightly secured that the  appara
tus, so long as it was in use, was perfectly air-tight, even under
the highest ranges of the manometer.          A barometer (gh) of a
very wide bore gave the atmospheric pressure, whilst a thermo
meter (t') placed beside this and the manometer gave the corre
sponding temperature.
   The course of investigation was as follows:—As soon as the
calibrated tube, being perfectly dry, was filled with warm, very
pure and dry mercury, freed to the utmost from air, and when a
bursting bulb containing a weighed quantity of fluid had been
placed on this, it was closed by means of a small wooden
disk, lined on one side with caoutchouc and provided with a
knob on the other, and being then inverted was placed in the
larger iron sheath.     The latter operation was rendered possible
by placing about the sheath a wooden case which, filled with
mercury, afforded plenty of room for the purposes of manipula
tion.    Into the smaller iron sheath the tube c d was introduced
half filled with mercury. The remaining half of the same, being
still free, served for the reception of the mercury that over
flowed from the calibrated tube in the course of the experiment,
while the circumstance that the lower half already contained
mercury facilitated the necessary compression. For compres
sions, the calibrated tube a b, as well as the india-rubber collar
embracing    it, was secured firmly     to
                                         the iron sheath    bymeans     of
iron rods and cross tie. This portion

thus prepared was placed           the bath, and, with the principal
                                   in
tube  ina   strictly vertical position, was united, after the fashion
described above,      the other part, which was fastened

part of the apparatus) does not recommend itself. We should
then run the risk of individual particles of fluid adhering to the
glass, without evaporating, perhaps much longer than would
correspond with the particular temperature and rarefaction of the
air.   However, before any measurement was taken, we kept the
vapour for a long time dilated to such a volume that it obeyed
Mariotte’s law at the defined temperature, and then allowed it
to proceed to a smaller volume by the gradual introduction of the
air, whereby a longer time was allowed for the acquisition of a con
stant condition before each measurement of the vapour, so that we
had more confidence that we were observing circumstances which
actually corresponded to the external pressure and temperature.
   The determination of the pressure by the measurement of the
six mercury-levels could be made very accurately with the above
named cathetometer.     The cathetometer itself, which stood on a
strong fixed table, was daily corrected.
   Through the telescope of the cathetometer we could clearly
read off the volume of the vapour found in the calibrated tube to
the tenth part of a cubic centimetre.        Having measured the
volume and     pressure  coexisting at the  given  temperature, we
then subtracted from the latter the  pressure exercised under these
circumstances by the air-bubble, which had been determined
first of all.  For each temperature, the volume v and the pres
      p
sure of the vapour were measured from the maximum of ten
sion, i. e. from the saturation of the vapour, to such a distance
from saturation that the vapour followed Mariotte's law. The
                                   º,
commencement of this latter was manifested by the constancy of
the product pu, which up to this time had been always increasing.

   The size of the air-bubble which was present amounted to
'064 cubic centim. for 0° and a pressure of 0.760 millim.       The
weight of the alcohol examined was 0248 grim.         Hence are cal
culated, for the following different temperatures, the final vapour
densities which correspond to the mean value of the constant pu
for each temperature.

  As the second fluid I took chloroform; during the examination
of this, in order to avoid the chemical influence of light, I
covered the side of the bath which was turned towards the win
dow with a piece of yellow glass.    For this preparation, as well
as for the bisulphide  of carbon, which will be discussed further
on, both of them perfectly pure, I return my best thanks to Dr.
Glaser. The following Table gives the numbers for chloroform,
obtained in the same manner as those given for alcohol:—

 of the measurements), when the chloroform was not yet protected
 by the yellow glass, that a small trace had been already decom
 posed. This, however, could not make a greater difference in the
 weight than 1.5 milligrim. The examination of bisulphide of car
 bon, which will be subsequently described, gave a similar result,
 where the traces of the sulphur which might be separated during
 the boiling out and sealing of the bursting bulb also could not
 have produced the difference of weight necessary in order to bring
the vapour-densities actually found into accordance with the theo
retical ones. That in both these cases no error can lurk in the
method which would induce the differences may be indubitably
recognized from this, viz. that at each temperature the final
vapour-densities for the most various volumes are, within the
limits of errors of observation, exactly proportional to the final
vapour-densities at              all
                          other temperatures.      Besides,    general                      in

no of
   the old determinations could not give any exact results because

  The temperature 8°5 was taken on a cold October day, yet
could not be maintained without the help of some ice. This
certainly influenced the degree of constancy in the temperature
which existed in all other cases. The numbers obtained are less
accurate; but they appear to show pretty clearly that for these
temperatures the vapour already follows Mariotte's law imme
diately on         its
                declension from the point      maximum tension.                    in of

         of Vapours   to Mariotte and Gay-Lussac's Law.           301
   The specific volumes of the three vapours examined are found,
according to the principles of the mechanical theory of heat, laid
down in Zeuner's Grundzüge, 1866, where the values of u given
in Tables 3, b, 5. b, and 7. b, multiplied by the values of a given
page 288, determine the specific volumes for each vapour.
The values of u given there are calculated on the basis of Reg
nault's formulae for tension and the heats of evaporation com
municated by Regnault.         In order to render possible a compa
rison of the specific volumes of perfectly saturated vapour thus
obtained with those derived from the relation pºv, = const. Va.--t,
I  have calculated these last from Regnault’s tensions, using the
theoretical vapour-densities,    and at the same time I have given
the volumes which result       according   to the old view when the
vapours are supposed to follow the laws of Mariotte and Gay
Lussac. The foundations for these last have thus been built upon
Regnault's tensions and the theoretical vapour-densities.

302               Dr. H. Herwig's Investigations on the Conformity
   The difference between the figures entered in columns a and b
is manifest. We may remark that it seems impossible that the
volumes as calculated by Zeuner should be correct, as being
larger than those entered under column c. Since, however, the
figures in columns b and c are derived from the theoretical va
pour-densities, possibly the preparations examined by Regnault
may have possessed a somewhat different final vapour-density,
which would account for the discrepancy.          In the first figures
the difference (in the case of alcohol)         course,  too large    is,   of                                 to    be

temperature.     It is only necessary, by means of a comparison of
the  pu’s which stand in Tables II. and III. immediately over
and under the last corresponding horizontal lines with the mean
volumes of PW given in Tables II. a and III. a, to make sure of
the correct position of the horizontal lines, and to inspect the
values of the volumes v between which the horizontal lines lie.
In the case of chloroform, at the temperatures examined, may be
remarked first a decrease and then an increase of V1, while in
the case of bisulphide of carbon there is a continual increase from
the lowest temperature (8°5).       In the case of alcohol, nothing
analogous                at the temperatures
                       can be seen               examined.     For
the clearer exhibition of these relations, a graphic construc
tion of Wi may be contrived.   It is usual in the plane coordinate
system to take the absolute temperatures as the abscissae      and                                          ar,

cussed, the curve                      of
                            Wi coincides with the curve                    the                    of   v,   at

results the necessity             minimum   of   athe curve VI, provided of
there be an initial descent.         For chloroform this minimum                                                    is
actually proved from the observations. For bisulphide                 carbon                           of
the same lies close        the neighbourhood

tion, indeed probably approaches this the more nearly the higher
the temperature is raised.    Since, according to the mechanical
theory of heat, the temperature represents the measure of the
vis viva of molecular motion, while the greater or less deviation
of the vapour from the gaseous condition consists in a more or
less marked influence which the interaction of the isolated mole
cules exerts on this motion, it must consequently be admitted
that the unit weight of vapour, when occupying an invariable
space, may, for a certain inertia of the molecular motion, display
a considerable degree of the maintenance of the molecular interac
tion, which decreases as the motion becomes more active, entirely
disappears, and then, with a greater intensity of movement, reap
pears and increases in energy the higher the molecular motion
is raised.
   This conception is difficult, it cannot be denied ; but the ob
servations compel us thereto; nothing else can be deduced from
the observations, even under the assumption of the widest pos
sible errors in them.    Moreover this conception appears to me
to be not at       all
                 inconsistent with the mechanical theory    heat.                of

  Very similar results are obtained from the consideration                       of   Pi   at
different temperatures, i.e.       of
                                 the different tensions under which
the  vapour   ateach temperature   first enters into the gaseous con
dition.   Representing  graphically    the connexion              of
                                                          the tensions
pi and   P, with the temperature (fig. 3), the curve          becomes
                                                                       pi

the well-known tension-curve, which constantly withdraws itself
from the axis of abscissae as the temperature increases. At the
abscissa a--9-5 the curve P, coincides with the curve pl; but
afterwards at higher temperatures approaches nearer to the axis.
And here the vapours of chloroform and of bisulphide of carbon
show that the curve PI may have a maximum. Now, since we
cannot assume that, beyond the maximum, Pi constantly decreases
with an increasing temperature, therefore the curve Pi after the
maximum must have a minimum, in order that it may withdraw
itself more and more from the axis of abscissae, as is approxi
mately shown in fig. 3.
   Consequently we may draw a parallel to the axis of abscissae
from a point on the curve pi which shall cut the curve P, three
times; i. e. the same tension of the vapour may correspond to
the superheated condition for lower temperatures and to the ga
seous for higher temperatures, then the vapour may enter again
into the superheated, and finally into the gaseous state. This
conclusion is connected with that drawn previously from the
course of W1, since the product PIV, must increase proportion
ately to the absolute temperature (the abscissa in the diagram).
                                         § 10.
    From what has been said in the last two paragraphs, a surpri
sing conclusion is arrived at concerning the behaviour of the co
efficients of dilatation of vapours of constant volume and under
a constant   pressure.
   Since the superheated condition shows a smaller product pu
than there would be in the corresponding gaseous condition, it
follows that whenever a constant volume v is taken, the pressure
p must be smaller for superheated vapour than it             under other     is,
wise similar circumstances, for                an
                                          ideal gas. Hence          follows             it
that when the vapour under constant volume and with
                                         a                              gra                  a
dually increasing temperature passes gradually from the super
heated condition into the gaseous condition,               must exhibitit
greater coefficient     of
                         dilatation for constant volume than that

 tation, and the parallel to the axis of abscissae MN the coefficient
 of dilatation of an ideal gas. The curve, fig. 4, drops from a
value which is larger than that for an ideal gas, down to this
value, and in its further course arrives at still smaller values.
    In the same way, from the particulars of the curve P (fig. 3),
it follows that the coefficient of dilatation of a vapour under a
constant pressure may depend on the temperature in the manner
shown in fig. 5, which is arranged after the fashion of fig. 4.
The curve (fig. 5) crosses the line which represents the coefficient
of dilatation of an ideal gas, so that, starting from greater values,
it meets this line, further on it arrives at a minimum lying
under        it,
           then rises      maximum which lies over
                                    to  a                     and finally,                 it,

             Mr.  J. S. Aldis  on the Nebular Hypothesis.       309
of density in the central body, the exterior part would vary in
density according to such a law, as that body contracted.
    Those that do not obey this law confirm the nebular hypo
thesis quite as well. They all have satellites, and have them
because the detached body was not spherical but elongated, the
stalk end of the pear-shaped mass being unusually long. The
impossibility of homogeneity necessarily would develope a pear
shaped mass in the cooling down of the central body rather than
the ellipsoidal or spheroidal.      The density of the earth should
be about seven or     eight  times what the above Table indicates,
for it to vary between the inverse square and inverse cube (the
law is nearly the inverse cube, but not quite); and to have that
increased density with the same amount of angular momentum
 in the detached body, the latter should be some three or four
times as long as broad, and hence in contracting, as it would
 in length be about double the distance of the earth from the
 moon, it would naturally separate into two bodies.       The moon’s
 original day apparently was nearly half as long again as that of
 the earth.
     The densities of Jupiter and Saturn are far less than the law
 would give, and due to the same cause, since they abound with
 satellites, though the great gap between Mars and Jupiter
 strongly suggests those nebulae where a central mass is sur
 rounded by a ring, on the outskirts of which hang smaller
 nebulae.
     There is connected with this hypothesis a point in the struc
 ture of the earth deserving attention. It has been remarked
 that there is a tendency in mountain-chains to run north and
  south, and to present steep slopes to the west, gentle declivities
  to the east. This may arise from the contraction of the earth.
  If a portion of unsupported crust sink towards the centre, it
  will subside on to that which is moving east less rapidly than
 itself, and in consequence will, so to speak, fall over towards the
  east, the surface forming a gradual slope to the east, and the
  fractured western edge a precipitous descent to the west.
     In the moon, too, we see proofs of the contraction continued
  long after the stage in which we now find the earth. . The
  spheroid of the moon has contracted since it assumed that shape,
  and, contracting less in the longer diameter, is now more sphe
  roidal than it should be according to theory, whilst the thick
  ened crust, no longer crushed down on the interior, has left cavi
  ties in which the moon’s ocean and atmosphere are entombed for
  ever.

     What is the origin of this quantity of heat which thus re
mains confined within the batteryff
     It seems to me that it can only be explained on the assump
 tion that the following actions come into play either together or
 separately:—(1) the condensation of hydrogen upon the plati
 num, which becomes an obstacle to the transmission of the cur
 rent; (2) the local action due to the passage of the hydrogen
 from the nascent to the ordinary state; (3) the action, also
 local, due to the sulphatation of the zinc deposited on the pla
 tinum plates—a deposit arising from the electrolysis of sulphate
 of zinc, as this salt continually increases in the liquid in which
 the couples are immersed.
     I  will first remark that if the hydrogen offers a passive resist
 ance to the passage of the current, this resistance is included in
 the internal resistance of the battery, the thermal constituent of
 which has already been calculated.                  Moreover  I estimate that
 no considerable fraction of the quantity of heat indicated by the
  calorimeter in which is the battery (a quantity which increases
  with the number of anterior operations) can be attributed to
  the influence of the condensed hydrogen.
      III.    I have confirmed a fact already stated by several phy
  sicists, that the quantity of hydrogen condensed on the surface
  of the platinum is very small, and does not go on increasing                in
  definitely. Working with two of Smee's elements joined to
     * The sulphuric acid used, of a given degree of dilution, liberated 19,834
  thermal units in acting upon zinc.
     t I may mention that in my couples the passive resistance which the
  sulphate of zinc presents to the current is sensibly equal to that presented
 by sulphuric acid.
      1 In my previous experiments I had found this quantity equal sometimes
  to 4000, sometimes to about 6000 units; the variation is much greater in
  the present experiments (from 1800 to 2000), but under well-defined con
  ditions.

     W.  Resuming my determinations of the electrolysis of sulphate
 of  copper  and sulphate of hydrogen +, and varying the conditions
 of the experiments,      I obtained a number higher than those          I
  have given, and which must be nearer the real number repre
 senting the change of condition of hydrogen. This number,
 which is about 6000 thermal units, is but little different          from
 that given in my previous memoir.
                                             I
     In the present series of researches have taken the precaution
 to collect and analyze the gases disengaged in the voltameter,
 and to allow for the formation of oxygenated water and for the
 water which is reformed.
    When, instead of working with pure and renewed acid, the pro
 portion of sulphate of zinc is allowed to increase, the influence
 due to the electrolysis of the salt is soon evident.           In conse
 quence of it a deposit of zinc is formed on the surface of the pla
 tinum.     In dissolving, this produces a quantity of heat which is
 not transmissible to the circuit—a fact which explains the num
 ber 9122 which expresses the quantity of heat which is not
 found in the circuit R+r, and which the causes previously in
 vestigated would not have produced.
    VI. In fact, when we examine what takes place in a battery
of several Smee's elements, we see, when by successive operations
the liquid has become charged with sulphate of zinc, that one or
several of the couples scarcely disengage any gas-bubbles; then
when the circuit is opened, the couples disengage more and
more rapidly the complement of gas, forming for each element
a total equal to that which had been disengaged by each couple
working regularly to the moment of opening the circuit.
    The same phenomenon is produced with a single couple, and
becomes markedly apparent; for the disengagement of gas is
seen to continue for a certain time after the circuit is opened, and
then suddenly to stopt.
   The quantity of sulphate of zinc thus decomposed, and the
acid of which being liberated attacks the zinc of the couple,
always corresponds to an equivalent quantity of sulphuric acid
which does not come into play in the reaction; so that for the
same intensity there is always the same amount of zinc attacked
   *  Comptes Rendus, vol. lxvi. Feb. 10, 1868.
   t I  may remark that, the circuit being open, the zinc may remain  in
mersed for a whole week without any gas being liberated.

to the advantage of the current; but as the metalloid radical

   It now appeared desirable to verify this result, as far as possible,
by determining by direct experiment the proportion which exists
between the heat which reaches the earth from the sun and from the
moon.
  If we       start with the assumption that the sun's heat is composed
of two portions,
                           the luminous rays, whose amount = L,
and                        the non-luminous,     >>   ,,   = O,
also that the moon's light consists of two corresponding portions,
L', O', the luminous not being absorbed, and the non-luminous being
entirely absorbed in their passage through glass, then

              L'+ O'
Substituting for                    its   generally received value (800,000), we have
                           i.

     In the above, the proportion between the areas of surface pre
  sented by the moon and earth to the sun is taken = 13:55, and the
  angle subtended by the earth at the moon = 1° 55'.
     The value of the readings of the galvanometer was determined by
  comparison with those obtained by using a vessel of hot water coated
  with shellac and lampblack varnish as a source of heat. The vessel
  was of tin, circular, and subtended the same angle at the small con
  cave reflectors as the large mirror of the telescope.                It was thus
  found that (the radiating power of the moon being supposed equal
  to that of the lampblack surface and the earth's atmosphere not to
  influence the result) a deviation of 90 for full moon appears to in
  dicate an elevation of temperature through 500°Fahr." In deducing
  this result allowance has been made for the imperfect absorption
  of the sun's rays by the lunar surface.
     In the present imperfect state of these observations it would be
  premature to discuss them at greater length; but as some months
  must elapse before any more complete series can be obtained, and
  the present results are sufficient to show conclusively that the moon's
  heat is capable of being detected with certainty by the thermopile,                I
  have thought it best to send this account to the Royal Society; and
  I shall be most happy to receive suggestions as to improvements in
 the method of working, and as to the direction in which it may be
 most desirable to carry on future experiments.

    * This may seem a very large rise of temperature; but it is quite in accordance
 with the views of Sir John Herschel on the subject (Outlines of Astronomy,
 section 432 and preceding sections), where he says that, in consequence of the long
 period of rotation of the moon on its axis, and still more the absence of an atmo.
 sphere, “The climate of the moon must be most extraordinary, the alternation
 being that of unmitigated and burning sunshine, fiercer than that of an equatorial
 noon, and the keenest severity of frost, far exceeding that of our polar winters,
 for an equal time.” And again, “..... the surface of the full moon exposed to
us must necessarily be very much heated, possibly to a degree much exceeding
that of boiling water.”

   1. “On the Evidence of a ridge of Lower Carboniferous Rocks
crossing the Plain of Cheshire beneath the Trias, and forming the
boundary between the Permian Rocks of the Lancashire type on the
North and those of the Salopian type on the South.”          By Edward
Hull, Esq., M.A., F.R.S., F.G.S.
   In this paper the author proposed to account for the dissimilarity
of mineral and stratigraphical characters of the Permian formation
of Lancashire and the North of England as compared with that of
the Midland Counties and Shropshire, on the ground that they had
originally been deposited in separate basins, divided off from each
other by a ridge of Lower Carboniferous rocks, stretching from west
to east, under the central plain of Cheshire.
   The author showed that there was evidence of such a ridge on the
east side of the plain of Cheshire, by the uprise of the Lower Car
boniferous rocks to the north of Congleton Edge, in the valley of
the River Dane, and that the date of this uprise and the denudation
of the Upper Carboniferous beds along the axis of elevation was
clearly determined to be antecedent to the Permian period by the
outlier of Permian rocks at Rushton Spencer.
   On the west side of the plain there was evidence of a similar axis of
upheaval to the south of the Flintshire Coal-field near Hope, where
the Lower Carboniferous rocks (Yoredale and Millstone beds) are
brought up to the surface at the margin of the New Red Sandstone.
   Mr. Hull regarded the uprise on each side of the plain as
referable to the same Prepermian age, and as belonging to the East
and West system of flexures into which the Carboniferous rocks
were thrown at the close of the Carboniferous period over the north
of England.      Such an axis had       antetype its the concealed ridge
                                                                     in

                                                       of
suggested that      similar ridge, now concealed beneath the Triassic

The author gave a list of these fossils, and also of those of the Red
Chalk, the latter amounting to sixty-one, and presenting a mixture
of forms belonging to the Lower Chalk, Upper Greensand, and
Gault.   On comparison with the Gault section at Folkestone, the
author considered it evident that the Red Chalk of Hunstanton was
equivalent to the upper part of that formation.   He mentioned that
ten miles south of Hunstanton, in artificial sections, blue gault has
been found resting upon the Carstone, whilst rather nearer to
Hunstanton the same place was occupied by a red clay, connecting
the two dissimilar deposits, which, however, were shown by analysis
to contain nearly equal quantities of iron.   If the Upper Greensand
be represented in the Hunstanton section, the author considered that
 its
   place must               be   in
                    the band numbered       containing Siphonia para       2,

   But it is necessary to determine whether the closing of the stop
cock has been instantaneously effected at a given moment; this is
the essential point of the method.    For this purpose a voltaic circuit
is arranged, containing an electromagnet; and the movement of the
stopcock determines the closure of this circuit at the moment when
the orifice is opened, and afterwards its rupture at the moment when
the orifice is closed. The electromagnet moves a pencil which leaves
a trace upon a sheet of paper which moves at a known rate; from
 the length of this trace is deduced the duration T of the opening of
 the stopcock.    A series of experiments comprises those in which we
 make T vary without changing either p, or p. This series is re
 presented by a line having for abscissae the values of T, and for ordi.

                      and according to a different law when T is above
that duration.     The curve is then formed of two very different
branches, the point of intersection of which is determined graphi
cally.    The abscissa and the ordinate of that point give the duration
0 of the complete flow and the value of p, which we want.
    The lower branch was virtually a right line, nearly parallel to
the axis of abscissae, which indicated a very slow heating-action on
the part of the sides.    Hence is deduced a correction giving the supe
rior limit of the value that p, would have assumed if the sides had
been impervious to heat.      The feebleness of the thermal action of
 the sides is remarkable; we may attribute it to the formation of a
 gaseous sheath varnishing the sides.
     First mode of observation.—p, —p, is small; it is measured by
 means of an       oil

 We know that this theory leads to this formula when we suppose
 the internal work due to the change undergone by the gas equal to
  zero.    It would seem that this does not hold for carbonic acid, the
 internal work of which is considerable.               M. Hirn has put forward a
  theory applicable to this case which leads to the same formula;
  my experiments are consequently favourable to this theory; but I
  ought to remark that this law represents an ideal expansion which
 cannot be realized, and it will be seen that real expansions comport
  themselves differently.
     Second mode of observation.—We keep p, constant and vary p. It
 is thus that I have studied expansion from a pressure of 9 atmo
 spheres to 5, 4, 3,      ....    atmospheres. The principal results of this

    The specific gravities have been calculated by the help of M. Reg
 nault's formulas for the compressibility of gases.
    At is the decrement of the temperature, calculated according to
p, and pº by means of Gay-Lussac's law.
    Ay is the diminution of the ordinate for the lower branch of the
 curve which represents each series, corresponding to an increment
 of the abscissa equal to one second.                   It is by means of these
 values that the correction relative to the sides has been made.
    p, is the observed specific weight without any correction.
   p' is this weight corrected according to the thermic action of the sides.
    p" is this weight calculated from the formula of Laplace and
 Poisson with m-l'4l for air and 1-291 for carbonic acid.
    If  we calculate the differences p"—p, we find quantities which,
according as p, diminishes, vary very little for air, but which for
carbonic acid first increase, then decrease.                 The result shows that
the real specific gravity at the end of the expansion is always smaller
than if the gas followed the preceding law, and that the deviation
cannot be solely due to the influence of the sides; for according as

                 Intelligence and Miscellaneous   Articles.        325
p, diminishes,  the decrement of the temperatnre At increases consi
derably; consequently the heating by the sides ought to increase
the deviation more and more if no other cause intervened.           We
must also remark that this deviation is      greater for carbonic acid
than for air, although the thermic effect of the sides is less.
    I regard, then, the observed deviation as the result of two distinct
causes; one is the thermic action of the sides, the other is of a dif
ferent nature.
   We have the effect of this latter in the last column of the Table.
We see that for the two gases, p"—p' begins by increasing when
p, diminishes; this difference reaches a maximum and then decreases.
Now there is a mechanical effect which varies in the same manner.
   Let us consider the expansion from 9 atmospheres to 1 in two
distinct cases:—
   (1) Without appreciable velocities: the law is that of Laplace and
Poisson.
   (2) As takes place in our apparatus: the molecules situated near
the orifice are animated with a certain velocity; there is in the re
servoir A less gas than in the first case; according as the pressure
diminishes, the velocity increases; but soon it diminishes; conse
quently it passes through a maximum.        According to the period at
which the flow is stopped, the difference of the specific gravities
which exist in A in the two cases ought to vary in the same manner.
   It is true that my experiments do not exactly realize the second
case.    Thus in the first series the expansion takes place from 9 to
about 5 atmospheres, but the reservoir B is found also under a
pressure of 5 atmospheres at the end of the flow; while in the last
series the reservoir A is subjected to 5 atmospheres when the re
servoir B is found subjected to a less pressure. However, we can
conceive that this circumstance does not influence the direction of
the deviation.
   In fine, the formula of Laplace and Poisson can be applied to a
reversible expansion; but there must be another law in the case of
 an irreversible expansion. The investigation of this law will be the
object of a further study.
    I would also remark that, the difference p"—p' being greater for
 carbonic acid than for air, the impulse of the gas in the irreversible
expansion varies in the same direction as the internal work.         We
 meet, in short, with an effect of the gaseous viscosity that M. Reg
 nault speaks of in his memoir on the velocity of sound.—Comptes
 Rendus, August 9, 1869.
on THE EMPLOYMENT OF THE SPECTRoscoPE IN ORDER To Dis
  TINGUISH A FEEBLE LIGHT IN A STRONGER ONE. B.Y. M. J. M.
     SEGUIN.
    To the two poles of a Ruhmkorff-coil    of middle size there are
attached two fine platinum wires which are kept in a horizontal
position, their extremities being separated by an interval of about
1 centim. The spark is produced with       its
                                             usual characteristics, and
we  especially observe the shell  of
                                  blue  light which envelopes the end
of the negative  wire. We   bring the  positive wire gradually nearer

326              Intelligence  and Miscellaneous   Articles.
and nearer to the negative one.           The latter begins to redden ;
at first the blue light continually grows fainter, then becomes      in
visible; at least we cease to distinguish the shell that it forms
around the wire; and if any trace of it remains, it is only a bluish tint
in the light due to the incandescence. When the wires are almost in
contact, especially if the finger is presssd lightly on the hammer of
the contact-breaker, the incandescence of the negative wire becomes
dazzling, and then there is no more appearance of the blue light.
    I was curious to know if it had really disappeared, or if it was
only concealed by the brilliancy of the wire when white-hot; and        I
thought that the now celebrated method by which we discover the
trace of the solar protuberances amongst the intenser rays of his
disk might be applied here.
    I made use of a vertical spectroscope by Duboscq. The slit
is vertical, and can be moved from one wire to the other along the
spark.     The characteristics of the spectrum change according as we
view the brilliant point where the spark is detached from the posi
tive wire, or the blue shell which envelopes the extremity of the
negative wire, or, finally, if that is incandescent, the red parts which
lie beyond the blue shell.
    We keep the slit upon the blue shell while the spark is too long
to admit of the wire becoming red. The spectrum is characterized
chiefly by a group of four green rays, a group of two rays placed be
tween the green and the blue, a group of three violet rays, beyond
which we can see others of less brilliancy.
    As before, we gradually bring the positive wire nearer to the ne
gative wire, which latter begins to redden. One would expect to see
a continuous spectrum ; and this in fact is what actually happens, if
 we direct the slit towards the parts of the red wire which are
beyond the blue electric glow. We have then a continuous spectrum
 which is worth noting, because we thus learn, without requiring
 to light up the micrometric scale, that the violet rays given by the
 blue light correspond nearly to the most refrangible extremity of this
 continuous spectrum.        Bringing back the slit to the extreme end
 of the   negative    thread,  we find again the streaked spectrum of
 the blue    light.  The red in it becomes more brilliant in propor
 tion as the thread becomes more incandescent; but the green, blue,
 and violet rays still continue.      But when the incandescence is very
 intense, the green rays disappear, then the blue, and the spectrum is
 continuous into the violet, but at the extremity of the violet we still
 perceive the group of three violet rays, which become less distinct,
 but mark their position until the thread begins to melt.            The
 ultra-violet rays have ceased to be visible.      Thus the spectroscope
 permits us in this case, as well as in the observation of the solar pro
 tuberances, to ascertain the presence of a feeble glow in the midst of
 a light which to the direct vision is dazzling.—Comptes Rendus,

 ON   THE MEAN VELOCITY OF THE MOTION OF TRANSLATION OF
     THE MOLECULES IN IMPERFECT GASES.              B.Y. M. P. BLASERNA.
    We    are often led    to inquire  whence arise the deviations from

Mariotte's law that experiment reveals in the different gases.     I
do not think that we can accept the explanation that M. Dubrunfaut
has lately offered", an explanation which tends to ascribe these de
viations to small quantities of aqueous vapour existing in even the
most perfectly dried gases. When Plücker published his experiments
on Geissler's tubes, I succeeded in preparing tubes of nitrogen and
 of carbonic acid which contained no traces whatsoever of the three
brilliant rays which belong to hydrogen and aqueous vapour. To
 accomplish this, I made use of a good common air-pump; I exhausted
the receiver thirty or forty times, and dried the gases by the ordi               I

stead of aluminium, which is very often employed.
    This is the method, pointed out by Rudberg, that M. Regnault
 and all experimenters have followed.              nevertheless,    trace        If,

   The velocities found for the pressure zero represent the ideal case
of a gas infinitely rarefied (that is to say, perfect), the attractions being
infinitely small. We see that the velocities diminish when the pres
sure increases—that is to say, when the volume becomes small and
the attractions are more intense.                   For atmospheric air at 100° it is
necessary to carry the calculation to the second decimal place in
order to find the differences, which shows clearly the degree of
perfection that this gas reaches at that temperature.                              It seems
almost superfluous to remark that, in order that the numbers given
for air may have a real significance, we must consider air, not as
a mixture of two gases, but as a single ideal gas whose molecules
possess the physical properties of nitrogen and of oxygen in known
proportions.—Comptes Rendus, July 12, 1869.

these experiments the greatest care was taken to keep the bulb
of the thermometer as far back as possible beneath the tongue,
while the margin of that organ was applied firmly against the
lower jaw, the lips being kept closed, so that respiration was
entirely effected through the nose. It was, consequently, im
possible that any of the                          air
                            used for breathing could come into
 contact with the bulb                      of

    In  twenty observations made while in the state of rest, at alti
tudes varying from 1050 to 4672 metres, and in various condi
tions as regards the food taken, the temperature of my body
varied from 36° to 37°1, or 1°l only; and it is remarkable
that the highest temperature was found at the greatest altitude”.
    Although there exists a comparative degreee of uniformity be
tween the various temperatures observed when at rest, it is worth
remarking that the highest can, as a rule, be connected with the
circumstance that food had been taken not long previously, or
with the fact that the thermometer had been observed while in
the act of resting on the way                          The six highest readings
of the    thermometer,       with but one        exception,     may be accounted
for in that    way;    they    are as follows:—
 metres.     Temp.

                        a full breakfast with meat.
   4672       37'l  Bosse du Dromadaire; breakfast with meat 23 hours
                        before ; then a steep and exciting ascent, but slow
                        and without fatigue.
   1621       370    Fasting, but down hill (Col du Géant), for four or five

                        hours before; temperature taken after eight minutes'
                        rest.
    This last observation, made at the summit of the Col du Géant,
appears to be an exception to the rule: the temperature then
   * An observation at Planpraz, showing a temperature of 35°5, is not
here taken into account; it is exceptionally low, which must be owing to
some extraordinary circumstance, such as excessive perspiration during the
last part of the ascent.

        various Altitudes, in connexion with the act                               of Ascending.         333
noted was very high, considering that there could be at that
time no food in the stomach, and the ascent had been uninter
rupted for the previous three hours. This was perhaps due to
a reaction, the temperature having fallen very low (34°5) during
the ascent.
   Result II.-That the temperature of the body during the act
of ascending has invariably a tendency to fall, but that the degree
of cooling depends mainly on a condition of fasting, or want of
food, at the time. A rapid and steep ascent on an empty stomach,
when the body is out of breath and perspiring freely, appears to
be attended with the greatest reduction of heat.
   In twelve observations made while walking up hill the tempe
rature of the body varied from 34°5 to 36°5, the range being
thus 2°·0. The greatest fall of temperature observed on four oc
casions was as follows:—

  The influence of walking up hill on the temperature of the
body was well marked in the two following experiments:—
        I
    walked up from Chamounix to Planpraz (Brevent) soon after
an excellent breakfast and during digestion. When halfway up
                                                                                                up

slightest sensation   fatigue; my temperature under the tongue,

exposure, the temperature was 34°5, remaining steady for about
one minute; then having lessened my speed, the thermometer rose

   Result IV.-Finally, the sickness many people suffer from at
great altitudes appears to be attended with a remarkable fall in
the temperature of the body.                      -
    Isuffered from this affection, for a short time, at the Pavillon
du Mont Fréty, on awaking early in the morning. Immediately
after an attack of retching, my stomach being then quite empty,
I  took the temperature under my tongue: the reading of the
thermometer was steady at 35°; and the mercury rose slowly
during the following few minutes to 36°, during which time                                         I
recovered my health perfectly.        On arriving at the summit
of Mont Blanc the same kind of sickness returned.                 I then
attempted to ascertain my temperature, but while so doing had
the misfortune to break my thermometer.              Professor Lortet
of Lyons, with whom I had the pleasure of making the ascent,
then kindly lent me a maximum-thermometer,             which he read
after     its
           bulb had been under my tongue for               short time;           a
the instrument then showed        much lower  a  temperature      than                             I
 had ever yet observed; but the time        exposure was,   of  feel cer             I
 tain, too short for    accurate observation; still, after
                                    an                            similar                 a

 risen higher.      can hardly think that
                          I                        perfect health, and

 consequently only 138 metres below the very summit                 Mont                  of

 336        Dr. Marcet  on the Temperature  of the Human Body at
      I  cannot help thinking that mountain-sickness is due to
  want of power in the body of recovering the heat it loses under
  those physiological circumstances to which it is subjected on
 mountains. At a certain height the body is altogether placed
 under cooling circumstances, such as cold weather and frequently
 insufficient clothing; at night there is often a deficiency of
 bed-clothes; and as a climber must be an early riser, he com
 mences his day’s work (after a cold night) precisely at the pe
 riod in the twenty-four hours when, under ordinary circum
 stances, his body is coldest; food has often to be taken cold;
 and to this may be added the cooling process from muscular
 exertion in the act of climbing.       In order to resist this cooling
 action, the vital energy ought to be proportionally high ; it is
 so in many cases, but not always, either from exhaustion, or from
 a deficient supply of food, or from want of appetite to take
 it—insufficient food not only contributing to reduce the vital
 energy, but also depriving the body of the material on which
 this energy has to act in order to make heat.
    The result of my experience is that the circumstances which are
 known to be productive of animal heat are those best calculated
 to cure mountain-sickness.
     These may be considered—as, first, going down-instead of up
 hill, which is known by many sufferers to cure the sickness. On
 going down hill there is little or no muscular exertion, and con
 sequently, it may be anticipated, no great expenditure of animal
heat.
     I  suffered last year from mountain-sickness on Mont Blanc
from the “grand plateau” to the top of the Mur de la Côte,
but felt immediately relieved on going down, and was quite well
shortly afterwards.       On that occasion every circumstance under
which I happened to be, combined to lower my temperature:             I
had started from the Cabane des Grands Mulets having taken
little or no food; an intensely cold wind, many degrees below
the freezing-point, was driving clouds of frozen snow into the
                                                   I
face; hands and feet were benumbed; and had gone up by
the corridor, where the well-known want of air must have assisted
in lowering every vital phenomenon.
     Next, a violent attack of vomiting is often followed by imme
                                  I
diate return of health. At first could not possibly understand the
reason of this remarkable fact, nothing being brought up from
the stomach, which was invariably empty, showing that the
sickness could not be due to indigestion; but on considering
this circumstance     I have come to the conclusion that, by increa
sing considerably the rate of the circulation, the retching caused
a rising of the heat of the body.

   Finally, if food can be taken on the sickness first coming on,
it will  be found very useful to arrest or relieve the illness.
    The best precaution to take against mountain-sickness is
obviously to eat plenty of good substantial food, and to repeat
the meals at short intervals. Should the appetite fail, think it                       I
best to endeavour to take a little food as often as possible.

        Lieut.         J.   Herschel         on the Eclipse       of August 1868.                339
mula    862 H + 1440, which                         refers the readings to another scale
and zero.
   In    the following             column are shown               Mr. Pogson's readings of
the solar lines, of which those in italics are bright-line measures*.
The dark-line measures correspond with converted measures in
the previous column; and the close agreement shows that the
empirical formula is correct, and that the dispersions of the two
instruments are commensurable throughout. Mr. Pogson's dark
solar lines are also unmistakably identifiable with B, C, D, b, F,
and another, unnamed line, instead of those whose names he has
assigned.
  In the fifth column, those in the fourth are converted by                                        the
empirical formula 440 P-6207, which refers the readings                                              to
the scale and zero of that part of Kirchhoff's                                 map in which the
bright lines must be placed.
   The sixth column is derived from the second by the formula
440(862 H + 1440)—6207, or 379-3H + 129, and is merely
a check on the identity of the lines supposed to have been mea
sured.
   The seventh column shows Kirchhoff’s measures.        Compared
with the two   previous  ones, it is evident that the empirical for
mulae by which they are obtained are only applicable strictly to a
small portion of the spectrum—as was to be expected.
   The last columns show the positions on Kirchhoff’s scale of
 allthe bright solar lines                    of
                               which measures are available, with
their (temporary) reference letters.
   Mr. Pogson's data would                           be
                                   more valuable had the dark solar
lines been measured immediately before and after the event; but
    assures the writer that there was little,

Winterings in the Arctic Regions during the last fifty years.                                 341
been effected during the last fifty years. The precautions which
were found useful in these, the number of deaths and accidents,
the occupations and scientific operations will be particularly                                in
dicated, in order to show how unfounded is the opinion still fre
quently entertained by the general public that it is impossible
for Europeans to endure the winter in those climates, and at the
same time to lay down more accurately the scientific operations
which may be carried out during the winter.
   The first wintering of an exploring expedition of which we
have any knowledge is the unfortunate one of Sir Hugh Wil
loughby in the year 1553, who, being cast away by a storm,
was frozen in upon the coast of Lapland, and perished by hunger
and cold with his whole crew.
   This melancholy occurrence did not, however, deter other bold
seamen from repeatedly making the attempt to discover a com
mercial route north of Europe and Asia to the fabulous kingdom
of Cathay; and by these expeditions Spitzbergen, Nowaja Semlä,
&c. first became known to western Europeans.
   One of these expeditions sailed from Holland in the year
1596;      its
            conduct was entrusted        Jakob Heemskerk and his
                                                       to
truly wonderful pilot,William Barents.       Their ship was beset                               by
the ice    on
           the north-east coast      Nowaja Semla, and they them
                                                 of
selves compelled      pass the winter
                           to               that inhospitable shore.
                                                            on
Of the crew, which consisted                  of
                                    seventeen persons, five died—
two during the residence         Nowaja Semla, three during the
                                         on
return voyage, among whom was Barents;                 them suffered  all   of
more      or
         less from scurvy.     Nevertheless this wintering must                                 be
regarded       very successful one for that time; and even
               asa                                                the                    to
present day our entire knowledge                           of
                                           the north and north-east
coasts    Nowaja Semla

since  Barents,  has succeeded     reaching inthe “Eishafen.” where
he wintered.
   Many attempts have subsequently been made                                to   pass the     win
ter  inthe arctic and otherwise uninhabited regions, upon Spitz
bergen, Jan Mayen, and         the Hudson’s Bay Territories, but
                                     byin
of  these unfortunately       far the greater part were failures.
                       most cases were scurvy and the necessity,

   Successful winterings are, however, to be noted even among
these, and indeed one in which this was hardly to be expected.
In the year 1630, eight sailors belonging to an English whaler
were separated from the ship and compelled to pass the winter
on Spitzbergen under 77° N. lat.    Of course they had no pro
visions from the ship, and we might therefore have anticipated
that they would not live through the winter.    But this very cir
cumstance was their   salvation; for in order to obtain nourish
ment they were obliged to go hunting, and were fortunate
enough to kill a sufficient number of reindeers and bears to fur
mish them with fresh meat and warm clothing. The fresh meat,
in conjunction with much moving about in the open air (the two
conditions of health in this climate), kept them strong and
healthy, and thus they were found and brought home in May of
the following year by their former ship, without any of them
having been seriously      during the winter.

     But unfortunately such   successful wintering

Behring's Straits, these voyages, which were commercially
useless, were given up, and people contented themselves with
working the rich fisheries found                             on
                                           the previous voyages                                          of

    For nearly forty years voyages      discovery towards the north

                 1815 Kotzebue made          fresh attempt        aforce                       to

to determine how far the continent extended towards the pole,
or whether islands lay off the coast, &c.
   As the first of these voyages, we must name that undertaken
in 1818 by Sir John Ross.      Properly speaking, he only repeated
the voyage   made two centuries previously by Baffin, but did not
consider it advisable to penetrate any further than the latter, and
returned to England in the autumn of the same year, after making
the rich fisheries in Lancaster Sound and Pond Bay accessible.

   These precautions proved to be extraordinarily beneficial to
the health of the wintering party.   The sick-list of the surgeon,
Dr. Edwards, usually bore only one, or at the utmost two names
of people who had slight attacks of scurvy; and these were cured
 in a few weeks by the administration of an extra dose of lemon
juice with sugar.     On one occasion, however, when a fire
 broke out in the observatory, a considerable number (sixteen)
of the people suffered a good deal from frost, as in their ex
citement they had neglected the necessary precautions; and
 this led in some cases even to the amputation of fingers.
The expedition had only one death to lament; and this was
caused by disease of the lungs, which became combined with
scurvy.    The sanitary condition of this wintering was there
fore excellent, thanks to Parry's indefatigable care and     ad                          its
mirable equipment.
   The ships were laid                    up
                              for wintering      the following man in

                                                         in
arrangements were altered and improved          some few particulars,
                                                                   in
which will      be
                noticed hereafter.    The moveable ropes and yards
were taken down. The former were left lying          the open, where     in
they froze quite hard, and      this state were completely protected
                                               in
from rotting,        which they would have been exposed
                         to                                      the                     in
moist air between decks.
   The entire deck was then provided with          high-pitched roof    a
of oil-cloth, and served during the winter,       bad weather,      in                    as   an
exercise-ground      and promenade for the officers and men.             At
 first  Parry  had the water    kept   open  around the    ships,  until                       he
 found that this would be too troublesome.          Then he allowed the
 ships         be                  in,
                             and had snow shovelled up against their
       in to    frozen
 sides      order    keep
                     to       the heat; and this
                                     in                the same time hadat
the    great advantage    that the ice round the ship did not become
so thick as where no snow covered it.
    The greatest evil that Parry had           contend against was the
                                                              to

reached such       pitch that the beds were one half frozen, and one
                    a
half completely wet through. At first the ice condensed                 the              on
walls was removed daily; and once when this had been omitted
for some weeks,               no
                         less than 5000      6000 pounds    or    ice were         of
taken out      ofthe cabins. Twice day, when the crew were abroad,

                                               the precautions was most
rigidly watched               by
                         the officers: thus, for example, the people
were obliged every day          take the prescribed quantity
                                         to                         lemon           of

between   decks.   The fixed berths, which had been introduced
into the ships  quite against the ordinary practice of a man-of
war, had to be exchanged for hammocks, entirely on board the
‘Griper,’ and partially on board the ‘Hecla;' and this (from the
great amount of moisture) contributed greatly to the mainte
nance of good health; nay, one officer, whose life was consi
dered in some danger, was thereby completely restored                                                     in   a few
weeks.
   That the cabins could not be cleaned with water under such
circumstances was a matter of course.  Instead of this the floors
were scrubbed with stones and hot sand which had stood all
night upon the stove.
   All these precautions would not, however, have sufficed for the
preservation of health if the people had not played and been ex

Winterings in the Arctic Regions during the last fifty years.        347
the following year only a small advance towards the north was
made, and the winter was passed in Iglulik, when the Fury and
Hecla Straits were discovered and examined during the winter
by Parry's officers, who actually obtained a sight of the great
sea of the Eskimos as a large surface covered with ice, which
was afterwards known as the Gulf of Boothia.
    After this second successful wintering, Parry returned with his
two ships in good condition to England, having furnished, by
passing two consecutive winters in the arctic regions with very
little loss of life, a proof that it was very possible for Europeans
to dwell in winter in those latitudes.
     In the following year (1824) Parry sailed again for the
discovery of the north-west passage, having set before him for
this purpose the examination of the great passage, Prince-Re
gent Inlet, which had been observed on his first voyage.           Being
detained     by  the unfavourable condition of the ice in Baffin's
Bay, Parry was compelled to winter in Port Bowen, a small har
bour on the east coast of Prince-Regent Inlet.             Here he had
the misfortune of      having   one of his crew drowned.
    He examined by land the west coast of Cockburn's Land, from
his winter-harbour southwards to 72° N. lat., and northwards to
Lancaster Sound. In the summer of the following year Parry
went to the other side of Prince-Regent Inlet and investigated
Creswell Bay, but lost his ship the ‘Fury.” With his usual
foresight Parry had the provisions and the extra stores of
clothing brought on shore and enclosed in a wooden house built
for this purpose.       This depôt was of incalculable value to sub
sequent expeditions; and the stores assisted the last Franklin
expedition under M'Clintock, as much as thirty-three years after
wards, to complete their own equipment.
    The land and coast expeditions in the north of America, car
ried out before 1830 by Richardson, Franklin, and Beechey,
were obliged to winter under very different conditions; and as
we have here chiefly to show what has been attained by means
of ships, and how the dangers of the arctic winter may be dimi
nished in naval expeditions, they need not be taken into consi
deration.      It is sufficient to say that, with enormous toil and the
loss of  many    men, they discovered and surveyed the north coast
of North America from Cape Turnagain in 109° W. long. to
Return Reef in 148°.
    The next great naval expedition was undertaken by Sir John
Ross in 1829*. It was fitted out by Sir Felix Booth, a rich mer
chant; and Ross desired by this voyage to reestablish his fame

lently attacked.   In this he and his nephew, Sir James Clarke
Ross, who has since become so famous by his antarctic voyages,
most perfectly succeeded.
    The expedition sailed from London in a paddle-steamer (the
 ‘Victory”) of 150 tons, with a crew of twenty-three persons,
officers and men.    The engine soon proved to be quite useless;
 and after a stoker had unfortunately lost his arm by means of
it it,
    and some unsuccessful attempts      employ    had been made,

 James Clarke Ross investigated the two coasts          Boothia Felix,              of

 continent          by

Winterings in the Arctic Regions during the last fifty years.                      349
the coast as a bay (Brentford Bay). The second winter he was
obliged to pass nearly in the same place where he had remained
during the first winter; and he then had to decide upon wintering
for the third time quite close to his previous winter quarters, in
Victoria Harbour.     At the end of May 1832 he was obliged to
quit his ship (the ‘Victory’) and to endeavour to save himself
by means of sledges, taking his boats with him. They reached
Fury Beach and afterwards Batty Bay. In this retreat Parry's
precaution of bringing the ‘Fury's' stores on shore saved the
brave band from starvation.     After pressing on to Batty Bay,
Ross was surprised   by  the winter,  and compelled, in order to
save the lives of himself and his men, to return to Fury Beach.
Here, in a house built of planks and coated with blocks of ice,
they continued, by means of good stoves, to provide themselves
with a comparatively warm and comfortable dwelling.
   In the following summer they at last succeeded in reaching
Barrow's Strait, and thence they sailed on in their boats and
were taken up at the entrance of Lancaster Sound by the
‘Isabella,” which had    been sent to their assistance.
   As  regards the health of this expedition, we may say that in
the first two winters it was very good. In the winter of 1829–30
Ross lost only a single man, who had concealed a disease of the
lungs which had previously brought him several times to the
hospital. No scurvy made                  its
                                    appearance.    The first case                      of

   The unfortunate termination of this expedition is well known.
Although the history of the last desperate attempt to escape
contains many doubtful and unexplained points, we may obtain
much information upon the earlier part of the expedition from
the short report which was left on King William's Land by Cro
zier and Fitzjames, and discovered by Lieutenant Hobson, who
accompanied the last searching expedition under M'Clintock.
   The portion of this short report which is particularly interest
ing to us relates to the number of deaths, and runs as follows:–
   “25 April, 1848. . . . . Sir John Franklin died on the llth
of June 1847, and the total loss by deaths in the expedition has
been to this date nine officers and fifteen men.” When the ex
pedition sailed in the summer of 1845 the entire crew consisted
of 129 people, officers and men, deducting the few who were
sent back from Baffin’s Bay on account of illness.   The provi
sions were calculated for three years; but unfortunately  a great
part of them was supplied by the marine purveyor Goldner, who
sought by the most shameful fraud to make a fortune, and filled
the preserved-meat cases with completely useless offal instead of
with eatable materials. By this means the provision was con
siderably diminished; but as Sir John Franklin wrote from
Baffin's Bay full of hope that, if necessary, he should be able
to hold out for five or even seven years by renewing his stores
from the produce of the chase, we may assume that, notwith
standing the loss of what was useless, the provision was sufficient
for three years in case of need.
    The ships were abandoned in April 1848; and we may sup
pose that want had not then reached any very high degree.     Up
to this moment the expedition had hardly been in any worse    po
sition than that under Ross, for example, after the same lapse of
time; and the number of deaths reported up to this period,
although doubtless considerable, is by no means very surprising,
especially when we consider that three of them occurred as early
as the first winter (1845–46), on Beechey Island. What became
of the 105 who were still living after the abandonment of the
ships, will probably always remain in obscurity.
   The apprehensions as to the fate of Franklin and his compa
mions gave rise to a long series of searching expeditions, which
are known in the history of arctic voyages as the Franklin-expe
ditions. To go through                      all
                              the numerous expeditions singly

    The great scientific results of these expeditions, and especially
the enormous extent of coast which was explored by them, are
well known. In the first place, towards the north, Smith Sound
was investigated by Kane; and the coasts of Wellington Channel
and the entire north coast of Parry Island were examined by
Belcher. M'Clure penetrated from Behring's Strait through
Investigator Sound, wintered three times in Banks's Land, and
once, when he was obliged to abandon his ship, on Melville
Island with Kellett; and he was the first who demonstrated the
existence of a north-west passage by his actually tracing water
passages from Behring's Strait to Baffin's Bay, although these
were in part impassable for ships.            Kennedy and the French
officer  Bellot, who attached themselves to the expedition as vo
lunteers, discovered Bellot’s Strait, named after the latter, ex
plored Prince-of-Wales's Land on the further side of Franklin's
 (Peel's) Strait, and returned northwards round North Somerset
to their winter harbour in Batty Bay.

during the arctic explorations;                      its

tions much fresh meat into the ship, which did much good to
the sick. But they had not only to suffer from scurvy; the cold
also could not be sufficiently kept off. The ship was lifted so
high upon the ice that it was impossible to heap the sides with
snow or to adopt other customary precautions.        It contributed
not a little to heighten the difficulty of their position, that the
“Rescue” got into so bad a situation that she had to be aban
 doned for a time and her crew transferred to the “Advance.”
   Notwithstanding his heavy medical duties, Kane did not neg
lect to do whatever lay in his power for science.        His report
contains   very many   important  notices upon   the formation and
 movement of the arctic glaciers, with hints as to the deficiencies
which still remain to be filled up in this field, and upon the pe
culiar ice-structures which occur here and there.
   He complains that the confined space and overloading of the
ship did not allow him to be so regularly active as he desired in
scientific matters. The observations of temperature are irregular,
but still very numerous; and in connexion with them he calls
attention to various points, to precautions which must be em
ployed in order to obtain correct readings, and to many other
things. The northern lights found in him a zealous observer;
and here also it did not escape his acute mind how much still
remains to be explained in the theory of these phenomena.

   Dr. Hayes, who was making his first arctic voyage, discovered
Grinnell Land, and, besides fulfilling his medical duties, which
were   in themselves great and heavy enough, made many journeys
for the purpose     hunting and exploring,

    We come now to the last of the so-called Franklin-expeditions*.
It was the fourth of the expeditions fitted out by Lady Franklin;
and the command of it was entrusted to Captain M'Clintock.
He sailed on the 1st of July 1857, from Aberdeen, in the screw
steamer ‘Fox,’ of 180 tons, with a crew in
                                                                             all

officers were Lieutenant Hobson       the Royal Navy     offirst, and                    as
the merchant-captain Allen Young           second officer.     as

fallen through a fissure of the ice into the water, had then gone
several miles in his wet clothes, and died in a hut which they
reached.
   In the spring of the following year Hayes commenced one of
the most toilsome sledge-journeys that has ever yet been made.
Its object was to penetrate as far as possible upon the coast of
Grinnell Land, and to reach the polar sea which had been seen by
Morton.     On the way he was obliged to leave behind him a por
tion of his party, and went forwards with only one young man of
19years old (Knorr) and one dog-sledge, until his further progress
was prevented, under 81° 35' N. lat. and 70° 30' W. long, by
rotten ice and partially open water which extended as far as the
eye could reach.     He was compelled to abandon his desire of
penetrating into this water with the ship, as Smith Sound was
not free from ice this year; and so Hayes returned from his
interesting voyage in the autumn of 1861, to Boston. The im
portant scientific results of this expedition have been published
by the Smithsonian Institution.
                                                       Conclusions.
  With this the series of marine expeditions which have wintered
in the north is for the present closed.                           They furnish evidence
that with  a little care a                       residence in the arctic regions is by no
means impossible.

Winterings in the Arctic Regions during the last fifty years.       359
                              Remarks.
  1. Died of lung disease.
  2. One of lung disease concealed on the voyage out; two               of
scurvy; one after return in consequence of hardships.
  3. According to the information found by M'Clintock.
Causes of death unknown; three died in the first winter(1845–46).
  4. In consequence of a sledge-journey of forty days with              in
sufficient provisions.
   6. Sickly from the first; died in consequence of hardships
on sledge-journeys.
   8. Suffered much from scurvy; equipment rather hasty.
   9. All the deaths in the last winter, from scurvy.  -
* 11. One of heart-disease; two from weakness in consequence
of hardships; one on a sledge-journey.
   13. Two died in consequence of a sledge-journey; one on
the return voyage in consequence of a dislocation.
   14. One in consequence of a fall; one of apoplexy; one of
scurvy.
   15. In consequence of a fall into the water.     The Eskimos
that Hayes had with him are omitted.
   From this review it appears, therefore, that the percentage of
deaths is on the average very favourable when compared with
the mortality upon voyages in the tropics.      The result would
have come out much more favourably if we could have taken in
Collinson’s and some other winterings; but with regard to these
reliable information was wanting.
   Even when compared with the ordinary mortality at the age
of 30, which, according to Milne's Carlisle Tables, amounts to
1:19 per cent, the result may be called very satisfactory, espe
cially if we consider that most of the deaths occurred in conse
quence of great hardships upon sledge-journeys,     or were pro
duced either  by  diseases the germs of which were  previously in
existence, or by accidents which could not be foreseen; the last
are possible upon any journey, even when it is not directed
towards the North.
   We believe that in the preceding statements we have furnished
a proof that a winter residence in the arctic regions is by no
means dangerous for Europeans, always supposing that the neces
sary precautions are taken.   These precautions are as follows:—
   First, a thoroughly good equipment of the ship, rendering            its
          strong as  possible—partly    resist the pressure      ice,
                                                                to of
sides as                              to
and   partly  for the sake  of warmth.    How the    ship  is           be
prepared for   its winter quarters  we have already described cir
cumstantially, and may therefore abstain from      its
                                                     repetition.
   The second main     point is  good  nourishing  food,  especially
fresh meat and     pemmican—salt    meat  being  not  good   even for

the healthy, whilst for those affected with scurvy it is absolute

                                                      is all

       contributions to the Spectral Analysis        of     the   Stars.       361
spectrum-analysis, have been made in the optical instruments for
observing the spectrum, open out the prospect of demonstrating
that influence on the spectra of the stars. Theory requires that
this should consist of a small displacement of the spectrum-lines,
which, for instance, for the mean velocity of the earth of 18.2
miles in a second, amounts to the tenth part of the distance
between the two sodium-lines. This magnitude, which is very
easily deduced from the velocity of light and the length of oscilla
tion of the rays corresponding to the sodium-lines, has been
quite recently again deduced by            J.
                                       C. Maxwell in accordance
with earlier calculations by F. Eisenlohr 4.
   Yet the magnitude of the displacement appears to Maxwell to
be so small, that he concludes his observations with reference to
the spectroscopes hitherto constructed and the method of deter
mining the position of the lines with the remark, “it cannot be
determined by spectroscopic observations with our present instru
ments, and it need not be considered in the discussion of our
observations”f.
  Huggins, nevertheless, in his most recent papert, of which the
above-mentioned    investigations of Maxwell form an integrant
part, has attempted the solution of the problem in question by
using a spectroscope with not less than five prisms, of which
two are flint-glass Amici's, and three crown-glass.
   The great enfeeblenent of light produced by so great a num
ber of prisms permits the observation of only the brightest stars.
Huggins even restricts himself to the communication of his
results from observations on Sirius, and thought he had here
found a slight displacement of the line F compared with a bright
hydrogen-line produced by a Geissler's tube. The direction and
magnitude of the displacement would indicate an increase of the
distance between the earth and Sirius with a velocity of 41.1
English miles in a second.
   Eliminating the component of the earth’s motion, which at the
time of observation amounted to twelve miles, the velocity with
which Sun and Sirius move apart would be 29.4 miles in a
second.
    Huggins himself considers this result as affected with great
uncertainty—an uncertainty partly due to the enfeeblement of
the light produced by numerous prisms, partly to the difficulty
of comparing the coincidences of the bright lines of terrestrial
luminous sources with the analogous dark ones of the star
spectra.    The latter have at times a different appearance—are,
for  instance, indistinct at the edges and of variable breadth, as is
just the case with this line F in the spectrum of Sirius.

    The most important of these difficulties which have heretofore
hindered a definite solution of the problem in question, think                                                     I
 I have overcome by a new construction of the spectroscope, the
first specimen of which                          I
                           have the honour of laying before the
 Society.
   The arrangement is essentially as follows:—The line of light
produced by a slit or by a cylinder lens is in the focus of a lens
which, as in                all
                   spectroscopes, first renders parallel the rays                                                            to
  bedispersed.    The rays then pass through two Amici's direct
vision  prisms,  which obtained        superior excellence from the
                                       I                            of

be  permitted  to remark that    had a non-achromatic    Ilens* of
1 Paris foot diameter and 6 feet focal distance; the pencil was
received a few inches in front of its focus on a suitable concave
meniscus of flint glass, and, thus freed as far as possible from
spherical and chromatic aberration, it impinged on the slit of the
spectroscope.            I              I
                  think must here more especially point out that,

cessary for the observance of the spectrum, especially of indivi
dual parts of           it,

would be found of separating all the lines which result from ab
sorption in the earth's atmosphere from those which owe their
origin to the sun's atmosphere, inasmuch as the displacement in
question can only affect the latter.
   Another subject of investigation by spectrum-analysis of the
 sun are the protuberances.    Lockyer and Janssen have, as is
well known, succeeded in observing the spectrum of these ob
jects (consisting of three bright lines) independently of a total
solar eclipse.
   At present attention     is directed on        sides    finding out         all                to
methods which shall enable not only those lines, but the entire

   (2) The brightness of the superposed spectrum increases pro
portionally to the breadth of the slit.
   (3) With an oscillating or rotating slit the brightness of the
superposed spectrum remains unaltered; that of the image of
the protuberance decreases according to a law which depends
upon the number and duration of the impressions produced on
the place of the retina in question in the unit of time, and on
the refrangibility of the observed protuberance-band.

considerably weakened, that then the intensely luminous protu
berances stand out from the illuminated parts of the corona
of the darkened sun. We may form an idea of the magnitude
of the necessary enfeeblement of the diffuse light of our atmo
sphere,      if we  assume that the mean luminosity of the atmosphere
during       a total solar eclipse is equal to that during an average full
moon.         From my photometrical measurements+ this luminosity
is 618,000 times less than that produced by the sun.       Hence
the selective absorption of coloured media must stand in a similar
ratio to that of the homogeneous light of the protuberance,                                                        if,

berances visible without dispersion.

the alcohol-flame    was just bounded by the rectangular slit,                                              I
was   surprised by  the  far greater beauty and distinctness with
which the     images  of the flame stood out from the diffusely
illuminated spectrum-ground.
    I may remark that                 I
                            used in this experiment only one of the
above-mentioned newer prisms; but it is clear that, with increa
sing dispersion, the enfeeblement of the superposed non-homo
geneous light may be enhanced at pleasure.
    In principle no difficulties prevent the application of this me
thod to the sun's protuberances *. Yet practical success, with the
given ratio of the intensities of homogeneous protuberance- and
superposed atmospheric light, is essentially dependent on whether
a sufficiently strong dispersion for this ratio can be attained.

   The apparatus among mammalia is essentially the same in
character as in man.    That of birds differs (so far as regards our
present purpose) in two features:–first, that the bones are in
part replaced by cartilage, and, as regards their mutual colloca
tion, are somewhat differently arranged; secondly, that the
tympanal membrane is convex outwards, and not concave out
wards as in the case of mammalia.
   The apparatus in birds may be described as consisting of the
labyrinth and of a single true bone (which from the correspond
ence of          its
            functions with those     the stapes    mammals may        of                        in

rebound and again move outwards.     A single atmospheric pulse
might thus throw the auditory apparatus into a state of oscilla
tion for a considerable time—a circumstance which would mate
rially interfere with the distinct perception of articulate sound.
To obviate such an effect is the special function of the tympanal
muscle in birds.
     It is worthy of remark                   that, although in the auditory apparatus
of birds recourse is had to the principle of elasticity to the extent
above explained, the principle requires to be kept in check, and
is kept in check in the manner above described.      In the more
perfect organ of man and of mammals, on the other hand, the
uncertain and unmanageable principle of elasticity is through
out excluded, the tympanal membrane, the ligamento-fibrous
membrane wrapped about the base of the stapes, and the mem
brane of the fenestra rotunda being alike inelastic and inex
tensible.

                   XLIV.     Theory of the Voltaic Pile.
                 By W. KENcELY BRIDGMAN, L.D.S.*
Theº            are extant at the present time two theories of the
         voltaic pile, neither of which, however, can be said to be
sufficiently satisfactory to set the natter altogether at rest.
    The conclusions arrived at by the late Professor Faraday were
to the effect that the source of power in the battery was derived
from “the chemical force alone” (Experimental Researches,
2053); but as chemical force is not supposed to be able to                 ori
ginate itself, or to become developed otherwise than by generation
from some antecedent force or forces, the disturbing cause, or
initiating step whereby it becomes excited to action, still remains
for elucidation.                               -
    On the other hand, Professor Tyndall expresses his belief in
“the contact electricity of Volta being a reality,” though it could
produce no current, and goes on to observe that Sir William Thom
son “and others now hold what may be called a contact theory,
 which, while it takes into account the action of the metals, also
embraces the chemical phenomena of the circuit” (Faraday as a
 discoverer, by John Tyndall, note, p. 66); but as Faraday has
 demonstrated in the clearest possible manner (Exp. Res. 879–
 883) that metallic contact is not requisite for the completion
 of the circuit and obtaining the current, it can scarcely be admis
 sible to recognize contact of the metals as one of the conditions
 necessary to the action of the battery.
     In conducting the Experimental Researches relating to the
 action of the battery, Faraday starts with the assumption that
 “when an amalgamated zinc plate is dipped into dilute sulphuric
 acid, the force of chemical affinity exerted between the metal and
 action of the auditory apparatus when the tympanal membrane is absent,        I
 may mention that I am assured by an eminent aurist that when the mem
 brane is absent the interposition of the promontory would prevent the ex
 posure of the cochlear membrane to the direct action of a wave of sound
 which had traversed the meatus externus, and that the latter me & brane
 could only be reached by a reflected wave.
     I may observe that the statement (p. 126, note) as to the action of the sta
  pedal muscle, so far as the tympanal membrane is concerned, is perhaps
                                                       I
  made too positively. Whatever that action may be, apprehend that it must
  always be subordinate to the action of the tensor tympani; so that while
  the joint effect of the two muscles combined must necessarily be to draw
  in the membrana tympani, that of the smaller and weaker muscle may be
  to effect some minute adjustment of the form of the membrane. A similar
  remark would apply to the functions of the laxatores tympani muscles,
                                                                               if
  upon further examination it should appear that such muscles exist.

surfaces in contact and occasion the decomposition of water by

   Again, in reference to a cylinder of amalgamated zinc placed
inside a double cylinder of copper, and the two then inserted
within a jar of dilute sulphuric acid, it is asserted that “being
thus arranged there was no chemical action whilst the plates
were not connected ” (957); and “a battery constructed with
the zinc so prepared (that                           is,
                                     amalgamated), and charged with

of the former commencing to undergo solution; and after having
been suffered to remain undisturbed for twenty days, it presented
the appearance exhibited in the diagram, fig. 1.      Fig. 1.
   The  portion A which had been immersed in
the acid was partially corroded into pits and
furrows, gradually decreasing in extent down
wards.
   The upper end, B, exposed to the atmosphere
had become coated with a layer of minute and
beautiful crystals of sulphate of copper, extending
from the top down to within about three-six
teenths of an inch of the liquid.
    At the intermediate portion, C, a greater
amount of chemical action had been induced—cor
roding the wire, as represented, about halfway
through and forming a neck tapering upwards.
   The solution containing the end A was only
slightly tinged in proportion to the amount of
copper dissolved, the crystallization having been
derived almost wholly from the metal above the
surface of the liquid.

   From four species of Touraco, or Plantain-eater, the author has
extracted a remarkable red pigment.     It occurs in about fifteen of
the primary and secondary pinion-feathers of the birds in question,
and may be extracted by a dilute alkaline solution, and reprecipi
tated without change by an acid.      It is distinguished from    other                                        all

 ciently wide to admit of the prisms being pushed to the side when not
  wanted, so as to allow the light, after passing through the object
 glass, to pass freely up the tube K. A pin at M enables the prisms
  to be thrown either in or out of action by a movement of the finger.
     As the prisms are close above the object-glass, the usual sliding
 box, carrying the binocular prism and the Nicol's prism (shown at   N),
 may be employed as usual, and the spectrum of any substance may
 thus be examined by both eyes simultaneously, either by ordinary
 light, or when it is under the influence of polarized light. The inser–
 tion of the prism-box between the object-glass and the body of the
 microscope does not interfere with the working of the instrument in
 the ordinary manner.      The length of the tube is increased 1 or 2
 inches, and a little additional rackwork may in some instruments be
 necessary when using object-glasses of low power.       The stereoscopic
 effect when the Wenham prism is put into action does not appear
 to be interfered with.

the top and bottom of the gems are ground and polished flat and

   A good opal is not injured by moderate heating in water, soaking
in turpentine, or heating strongly in Canada balsam and mounting
as a microscopic slide.
   By the kindness of Mr. W. Chapman, of Frith Street, Soho, and
other friends, I have been enabled to submit some thousands of opals
to optical examination; and from these have selected about a dozen               I
which appeared worthy of further study.

      an opal which emits a fine broad crimson light is held in front
of the slit of a spectroscope or spectrum-microscope, at the proper

to produce a striking resemblance to a twisted column.
   No 2. gives an irregular line in the orange.      Viewed binocularly,
this exhibits the spiral structure in a marked manner, the different
depths and distances standing well out; upon turning the milled
head of the stage-adjustment, so as to carry the opal slowly from left
to right, the spiral line is seen to revolve and roll over, altering its
shape and position in the spectrum.         It is not easy to retain the
conviction that one is looking merely at a band of deficient light in
the spectrum, and not at a solid body, possessing dimensions and in
actual motion.
   No. 3 has a line between the yellow and green, vanishing to a point
at the top, and near the bottom having a loop, in the centre of which
the green appears.     Higher up, in the green, is a broad green band,
indistinct on one side and branching out in different parts.
   No. 4 has a broad, indistinct, and sloping band in the blue, and
another, still more indistinct, in the violet.
   No. 5 has a band in the yellow, not very sharp on one side, and
somewhat sloping.      Upon moving the opal sideways, it moves about
from one part of the yellow field to another.         In one position it
covers    the line D, and is opaque to the sodium-flame            of   a   spirit
lamp.
     N.  6 shows a curiously shaped band in the red, very sharp and
black, and terminating in one part at the line D. In the yellow
there is a black dot. The spectrum of this opal showed by reflected
light intensely bright red bands, of the shape of the transmission
bands. On examining this opal with a power of 1 inch, in the or
dinary manner, the portion giving this spectrum appeared to glow
with intense red light, and was bounded with a tolerably definite
outline.    Without altering any other part of the microscope, the
prisms were then pushed in so as to look at the whole surface of
the opal through the prisms, but without the slit. The shape and
appearance of the red patch were almost unaltered; and here and
there over other parts of the opal were seen little patches of homo
geneous light, which, not having been fanned out by the prisms,
retained their original shape and appearance.
   No. 7 shows a black patch in the red, only extending a little dis
tance, and a line in the yellow.      On moving the opal the line in the
red vanishes, and the other line changes    its position and form.
   No. shows the most striking example

holds the governing masses in when their centrifugal forces exceed
the forces of the springs, and resists the motion by forces of friction
increasing approximately in simple proportion to the excess of the
speed above that which just balances the forces of the springs.             As
long as the escapement-tooth is unresisted, the nut collar is carried
round with the quicker motion of the outer tubular shaft, and so it
screws upwards, diminishing the force of the springs.              Once every
semiperiod of the pendulum it is held back by either pallet, and the
nut collar screws down as much as it rose during the preceding inter
val of freedom when the action is regular; and the central or main
escapement-shaft turns in the same period as the tooth, being the
period of the pendulum.                           If

the point due to the effect of mere temperature, and the records fur
nished by the instrument rise too high”.
   A simple expedient occurred to me as being likely to remove the
difficulty; and as upon trial it was found to be perfectly successful,
I  have thought that a notice of the plan pursued might not be
unacceptable to future observers.
   The form of self-registering thermometer which it was decided to
employ is one constructed upon Six's plan.     Much care is requisite
in adjusting the strength of index-spring, and the size of the pin,
so as to allow it to move with sufficient freedom when pressed by
the mercury, without running any risk of displacement in the ordi
nary use of the instrument while raising or
lowering it into the water. Several of these
thermometers have been prepared for the
purpose with unusual care by Mr. Casella,
who has determined the conditions of strength
in the spring and diameter of tube most fa
vourable to accuracy. He has also himself
had an hydraulic press constructed expressly
with the view of testing these instruments.
By means of this press the experiments
hereafter to be described were made.
   The expedient adopted for protecting the
thermometers from the effects of pressure
consisted simply in enclosing the bulb of
                                                                                              C.

in   a strong wrought-iron    cylinder filled with water, and submitted
to   hydraulic  pressure, which could be raised gradually till it reached
three tons   upon   the square inch; and the amount of pressure could
be read as the    experiment   proceeded,   upon a gauge attached to the
apparatus.
     Some preliminary trials made upon the 5th of May showed that
the press would work satisfactorily, and that the form of thermo
meter proposed would answer the purpose.
     These preliminary trials showed that, even in the thermometers
with protected bulbs, a forward movement of the index of from 0°-5
to 1* F. occurred during each experiment. This, however,            I  be
lieved was caused, not by any compression of the bulb, but by a real
rise of temperature, due to the heat developed by the compression of
the water in the cavity of the press.
     This surmise was shown to be correct by some additional experi
ments made last week to determine the point.            On this occasion
the following thermometers were employed:—
     No. 9645. A mercurial maximum thermometer, on Prof. Phillips's
plan, enclosed in a strong outer tube containing a little spirit of wine,
and hermetically sealed.
     No. 2. A Six's thermometer, with the bulb protected, as proposed
by myself, with an outer tube.
     No. 5. A Six's thermometer, with a long recurved cylindrical bulb,
also protected in a similar manner.
     No. 1. Six's thermometer, with cylindrical bulb of extra thickness,
not protected.
     No. 3. Six's thermometer, with spherical bulb, extra thick glass,
not protected.
     No. 6. Admiralty instrument, Six's thermometer, ebonite scale,
bulb not protected.
     No. 9651. An ordinary Phillips's maximum mercurial thermo
 meter, spherical bulb, not protected.
     The hydraulic press was exposed in an open yard, and had been
 filled with water several hours before.       A maximum thermometer,
introduced into a wrought-iron tube filled with water, open at one
 end to the outer air, closed at the other, where it passed into the
water contained in the press, registered 46°7 at the commencement,
 and 47° at the end of the experiment. Temperature of the external
 air 49°F.
     In commencing the experiment, the seven thermometers under trial
 were introduced into the water in the cavity of the press, and after
 a lapse of ten minutes the indices of each were set, carefully read,
 and each instrument was immediately replaced in the press, which
 was then closed, and by working the pump the pressure was gra
 dually raised to 24 tons upon the inch.       It was maintained at this
 point for forty minutes, in order to allow time for the slight elevation
 of temperature caused by the compression of the water to equalize
 itself with that of the body of the apparatus. At the end of the forty
 minutes the pressure was rapidly relaxed. A corresponding depres
  sion of temperature was thus occasioned, the press was opened im

 mediately, and the position of the indices of each thermometer was
 again read carefully; and the water was found to be at a temperature
 sensibly lower than before the experiment began, by about 0°-6 F.
 By this means it was proved that the forward movement of the index
in the protected thermometers, amounting to 0°-9, was really due
to temperature, and not to any temporary change in the capacity of
the bulb produced by pressure.
   This will be rendered evident by an examination of the subjoined

the others were   uninjured.     The broken thermometer was the earliest
constructed upon the plan now proposed, and it was consequently not.
quite so well finished as subsequent practice has secured for those of
later construction.     The results of the trial under the higher pres
sures showed an increase in the amount of compression experienced
by the unprotected instruments rising in one instance to as much as
 11°5 F. With the protected instruments the rise did not exceed 1°5,

 genera.” By W. Carruthers, Esq., F.L.S., F.G.S.
    The author indicated the characters of the medullary rays of dico
 tylcdonous stems, and stated that these stems have a vascular hori
 zontal system connected with the axial organs, in which respect the
 dicotyledonous and acrogenous stems agree.     The woody columns of
 Stigmaria and Sigillaria are destitute of medullary rays, the struc
tures previously described as such being the vascular bundles run
ning to the rootlets and leaves.    Hence the author concluded that
Sigillaria is a true cryptogam—a position supported by the charac
ters of the organs of reproduction as described by Goldenberg. The
paper concluded with an enumeration of the forms of fruits belong
ing to Sigillaria and              its
                          allied genera, with indications   the exist                    of

              which  they most nearly approach.

last year *. There are four seams of coal, each about 7 feet thick,
from 50 to 100 feet apart.   A tunnel has been driven through one
of the seams for a distance of between 150 and 250 feet, and at an
elevation of 430 feet above the sea.  From this the coal obtained is
carried down to the shore on the backs of men, mules, and ponies.

     2.   “On    a peculiarity     of the Brendon-Hills Spathose Ore-veins.”
By M. Morgans, Esq.
  The author described    the Brendon Hills as consisting of a Devo
nian slate dipping S. by E. and N. by W. on the two sides of the
axis of elevation. The cleavage-laminae dip S. by W. at an angle
of 80°; and the cleavage-strike forms only a slight angle with that
of the beds, which, however, is sometimes irregular.          Weins of
spathose iron-ore, very rich in manganese, occur in the slate; and
the general dip of these appears to coincide with that of the cleavage
planes. The veins consist of thin “tracks” of softened clay-slate
and quartz, with larger or smaller pockets of productive ore. These
metalliferous portions do not descend parallel to the line of their
dip, but slope more or less, usually to the west. The author stated
that the veins have been segregated from the adjoining clay-slate,
the unproductive portions of them occurring where the conterminous
strata were not impregnated with sufficient ferruginous matter to
produce a lode of iron-ore; the slope of each productive part, called
“end-slant” by the author, is determined by the line of inter
section of the plane of the vein with the boundaries of the ferru
ginous portions of the beds.

   The author regards the absolute limiting value of the magnetic
momentum of the unit of length as a physical constant characteristic
of iron, and comparable with the constants of elasticity, solidity,
&c.; and he holds that its existence is quite in accord with the
theory of rotatory molecular magnets, of the probability of which he
thinks a striking proof has been afforded by his discovery of abnormal
magnetization and the phenomena connected therewith.
   The author finally points out that the result of his calculation,
contained in the above law, also justifies the conclusion that the pro
portionality indicated by Müller between the coefficient B of his
formula and the length of the bar, but considered inaccurate and
imperfectly established, must have general validity.      At the same
time the circumstances are mentioned to which it must be ascribed
that both Müller and the author were led to doubt, from existing
data, the applicability and universality of this formula.
   The author refers to a research by Oberbeck which has recently
appeared, of which he only heard after his investigation was finished:
in it the question of the existence of an independent limiting value of
the magnetic momentum of the unit of volume is discussed. But the
author remarks that this research involves no change or completion
of the results above adduced; for the amount of the limiting value is
neither ascertained nor adduced, and the results of the experiments
show too irregular a course to permit a numerical deduction of such
a limiting value, although the existence of such a one seems to follow
from two of the series of them.—Sitzungsberichte der Kaiserlichen
Akademie in Wien, 1869, No. 12.
 ON THE    REFLECTION OF HEAT FROM THE SURFACE OF FLUOR
             SPAR AND OTHER BODIES.         BY G. MAGNU.S.
    After succeeding in freeing the heat from various substances
raised to 150° C. from the rays of the heating-flame and of other
heating-bodies, it was possible to show, in the research laid
 before the Academy on June 9, that there are some bodies which
only radiate one or at most a few wave-lengths, others which emit a
greater number. Hence it seemed interesting to answer the question,
 what is the reflecting-power of these bodies? whether the same dif
ferences which are observed in reference to the absorption and trans
mission of heat by bodies that are identical as regards the action of
light also occur in the reflection of heat.
    Differences in reflecting-power can only definitely occur when
rays are reflected which only contain one or a few wave-lengths.
 Such rays have been already obtained by using individual parts of
 a spectrum produced by a rock-salt prism, or by allowing the rays
 of a source of heat which radiates many wave-lengths (those of a
lamp for instance) to pass through substances which only absorb a
 certain number.      But there are very few substances which transmit
rays of only one or of a few wave-lengths; and these are, moreover,
of small intensity.

406             Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
     In spite of this difficulty, MM. La Provostaye and Desaims showed
in 1849* that, according    as heat from a Locatelli's lamp has passed
through glass or through rock-salt, various quantities are reflected by
speculum-metal, silver, and platinum; and in the case of all re
flecting surfaces, less was reflected of that which had passed through
glass than of that through rock-salt.
   The same inquirers have subsequently published a comprehensive
series of experiments made with the heat of a lamp decomposed by
means of a glass prism, in which it was shown that heat from the
different parts of the spectrum is variously reflected.        But they
restricted their experiments to reflection from metallic surfaces,
doubtless on account of the feeble intensity of the incident heat. Now
that we possess in rock-salt a substance which only emits one or a
few wave-lengths, and we also know other bodies which at the tem
perature of 150° C. radiate a limited number of wave-lengths, it is
possible to make experiments on the reflection of non-metallic sur
faces.   It has thus been found that from these the different kinds of
heat or wave-lengths are reflected in very different quantity.     Only
one of the most surprising examples shall be here mentioned. It
refers to the reflecting-power of fluor-spar.
   Of heat which very different substances radiate, there are reflected
at an angle of 45° quantities which are indeed not equal, but which
do not differ much from each other.

     Of the  heat from rock-salt, fluor-spar reflects 28 to 30 per cent.,
while   silver,  glass, and rock-salt do not reflect larger proportions of
this than of the other kinds of heat.
   Here, as in the experiments on the transmission of heat, it has
been confirmed that sylvine emits a large quantity of rock-salt heat,
but at the same time emits other kinds of heat.                And fluor-spar
reflects 15–17       per  cent. of    sylvine-heat,  consequently   less than
it reflects of rock-salt heat, and more than it does of that from the
 other radiating bodies.
   If our eyes had the power of distinguishing the various wave-lengths
of heat as well as the colours of light, fluor-spar would appear brighter
than    allother substances when the rays           rock-salt fell upon them.

If the  rays   came from    sylvine,   fluor-spar would also appear brighter
than   all other  bodies,   but not     so bright    with the radiation from
                                                        as
rock-salt.
   Melloni has taught     us     that various substances transmit very dif
ferent  quantities  of   heat,  and that the source from which      originates  it
has   great   influence  on    its transmission. But the sources          heat       of
were only distinguished       as   to their degree    heat, and we knew that
                                                        of of
with increasing temperature the diversity            the radiation increased.

It has now been found thateven   at one and the same temperature, and
that a temperature (150° C.) which is very far from a red heat, dif
ferent substances emit very different kinds of heat, and that thus, in
any space whatever, an extraordinarily large number of different wave
lengths are continually crossing each other. This manifold crossing
is especially increased by the selective absorption which is met with
at different surfaces.
    Hence an eye which could discriminate the various wave-lengths
of heat like the colours of light, would see      objects     the most              all                  in
 different colours, even  they were not specially warmed.—Poggen

duced under the influence of a toothed disk of india-rubber previ
ously electrified. We remark, in short, that the flash of the illumi
nation increases with the velocity of the disk. This circumstance
is but little favourable to the hypothesis according to which the               in
fluence would be exercised across dielectrics by a polarization of
 successive layers; it would be necessary in that case that the polar
 ization should be instantaneous, and we cannot see in what the
 difference between insulating bodies and conductors would consist.
    III. Tubes filled with rarefied gases and provided with metallic
 wires sealed at the ends like Geissler's tubes, but terminated ex
 ternally by knobs to prevent the wires from acting like points, may
 be applied with advantage to demonstrate the movements of electricity
to which the influence gives rise, especially those of the return shock.
I  have executed these experiments; but the credit of them is due to
 M. G. Govi, of Turin, who has very ingeniously employed this means
 of demonstration in the place of metallic conductors armed with
pendulums, of the electroscopic frog, and of the other contrivances
 usually employed in this part of the study of electricity". These
 luminous conductors have also been made use of by him to exhibit
the phenomena of induction of different orders by interposing them
in long metallic circuits.

    IV. In the course of the experiments which have had occasion
 to make with rarefied gases,            I
                                      have remarked that the glass was
charged by the intervention of gaseous conductors with the same
facility as by means of metallic conductors. I have thus been led
to construct a Leyden jar in which the metallic coatings are replaced
by rarefied gas: it is composed of a closed primary tube enveloped by
a second, to which it is fused; each of the tubes is provided with a
platinum wire; a vacuum is created in them to the extent of about 3
millims.     Such a system is charged with a Leyden jar of the same
dimensions; the residues in it seem to be less abundant than in ordi
nary jars; but this question, in order to be fully solved, requires
more numerous experiments.
    In fine, rarefied gases behave precisely as metallic conductors. It
is to be remarked that such a medium formed into a point acts just
like a metal of the same shape, and manifests the same effects of
tension, to such an extent that, in the glass vessels intended to con
tain gases with a view to the experiments here treated of, it is neces
sary to avoid   all  such tapering           of
                                         the tubes       would give

                                   the motions of camphor on
     THEwater form a kind of scientific waif, which has at va
rious times been claimed by certain scientific lords of the manor,
quarrelled over, and then thrown aside. At one time it has
wandered over the outer boundaries of science, occupying a sort
of no-man's-land; at another it has been admitted into the best
society, which latter position it may be said to occupy at the
present time.
   2. During the current year a remarkable memoir' has been
couronné by the Royal Academy of Sciences of Belgium, and
favourably reported on to the Academy” by that distinguished
Belgian physicist M. Plateau.      As the author has done me the
honour of    frequently  referring  to my labours, and was so
good as to forward to me a copy of his memoir, I trust an
account of it will not be considered out of place in the Philoso
phical Magazine.
  3. But first it may be of advantage to give an account of the
phenomena in question as briefly as is consistent with clearness.

the point where the effluvium is discharged most abundantly,
covering the water and suffusing it with colour.  It is further
shown that when the water becomes   impregnated  with the cam
phor &c. the motions            that warm water and fine weather
                                     cease,
are favourable to the phenomena, that the purity of the water
and of the containing vessel are necessary to success (indeed the
success or failure of the experiment is a sort of indication of the
purity of the water), that agitation of the water assists the expe
riment, and, lastly, that the gyrations take place on wine but
not on spirits of wine, and not very well on olive-oil.
   9. About the year 1794 Carradori" began to publish a number
of papers and memoirs, sull' attracione di superficie, in which he
shows, by a great variety of ingenious experiments, that the
surface of water exerts a remarkable attractive force on various
bodies; and in 1800, referring to the motions of camphor, he
says”,      “I
            prove that on this surface-attraction, and on no other
cause, the motions of camphor depend.”          And again, “The me
chanical force of the elastic vapour against   the water has nothing
to do with the   phenomenon;      it depends     entirely on surface
attraction;” and in order to show that a non-volatile body will
rotate, he repeats Franklin's experiment (6) on the gyration
of bits of paper smeared with a fixed       and thrown       oil
                                                             the sur                      on
face of water.

on water, rotates.
    11. Fourcroy”,     reporting Prevost’s paper, expressed his own
                               in
opinion that these motions are due         the attraction   to odorous                    of
matter both for air and for water, and their solution     one     both.             in          or

claims it as his own.      The camphor owes           motion      the ex      its                     to

Academy of Sciences a memoir which clashes a good deal with
Dutrochet’s (21); and the noise is heard at intervals during this
and the first half of the following year.   The authors do not
seem to have added much to the subject in hand.       They found
that thin slices of cloves, pepper, orange-peel, &c. rotated on
water, and that naphthalin, though motionless on the surface of
water, rotated briskly on that of mercury.    The advantage of
working with mercury is that it renders visible effects which are
not seen on the surface of water.
    23. Although Dutrochet's researches (21) occupy nearly
seventy pages of the Comptes Rendus between the 4th of January
and the 5th of April, 1811, he felt that he had published them
with too much precipitation, and accordingly retired for awhile
in order to reconsider the whole subject.  This led to the pub
lication of a separate work, in two parts”, in which not only
the motions of camphor, but a vast number of other interesting
facts are traced to the influence of a force residing on the surface
of liquids, and hence named epipolic (éTutoN), surface). He does
not admit, and probably did not see, that this is nothing more
than another name                       for

 ducted in a large bottle.    The camphor has been made to dip
 into the water contained in a clean bottle: at first there were
faint indications of a current; but these soon ceased. After
many hours some of the water was poured from the bottle into
an open vessel; and the moment the camphor was lowered into                                                 it,

was shown in my original essay that essential oils did not per
manently arrest the motions of camphor, but only so long as they
remained in the form of films on its surface.  When these had
evaporated without leaving any residue or oxidized deposit, the
motions set in as before. But   now found that if the oils were     I
freed from oxidized products by being distilled in contact with a
of bit   of

of the surface tension of liquids.
1751, and of Dr. Thomas Young” in 1806, rendered it very
probable    that there existed a contractile force or tension at the
surface of liquids.        The labours of Henry”, Lamarle”, Dupré
de Rennes”, Van der Mensbrugghe",                    and others have con
verted this probability into a certainty; so that the existence of
such a force (which is a more perfect definition of Carradori's
attraction of surface (9), and of Dutrochet's epipolic force (23))
is not only capable of proof, but can also be expressed numeri
cally for different liquids at a given temperature.                As this force
cannot be said to be yet recognized in our Manuals of Physics,
perhaps I may be excused for quoting the following lines from
one of the few books, intended for the use of the student, in
which it is noticed :—
    “Every liquid possesses a certain amount of tenacity or direct
cohesion, whereby                            its

acceptable than the recoil theory, which has       long found favourin                 so

            the surface     mercury.          of

greater rapidity;                     indeed         their gyrations are sometimes so rapid
as to make the fragment appear hazy.       This also occurs when
the ether-sponge is held over the rotating camphor.      Flakes of
solid acetic acid are amazingly active on water; while the needles
of solid carbolic acid have a peculiar rapid jerking kind of
motion, not consistent with the reaction of the solution on the
fragment. Then, again, the sharply defined character of the
perfectly circular disk of ether formed by holding the ether
sponge over the surface of the water (25) seemed to point to
the action of a force acting equally around and exterior to the
disk.
   39. With respect to the rotations on the surface of mercury
in which the camphor &c. are not soluble, the theory is not quite
so clear.  But I gather from the memoir that the rotations are
due to variations in surface-tension consequent on the adhesion
of the camphor.     This must be very slight; for Prevost says
(note *) the fragments seemed scarcely to touch the surface.
I also do not see how Prevost’s experiment (14) on the motions
of camphor on solid plane surfaces is to be accounted for on
this theory. It is very desirable to repeat this experiment; and
I hope some of our microscopists will do so.       also do not see                     I
how the case of pure or recently distilled essential oils, occu
pying the surface of the water without interfering with the mo
tions of the camphor (28), is met by the theory, unless it can be
                                                                             by   its

XLVIII.  Microscopical Investigation of thin polished Lamina of the

        HE general tint of these laminae is grey, spotted with yellow;
      they are semitransparent, with the exception of some opaque
or dark-yellow spots.        Incident light shows not unfrequently
minute   spots  of metallic lustre. The whole appears fine-grained
to the unassisted eye, and spheroidally grained (“oolitic,” to
use a somewhat inadequate term) under a magnifying-power
of two to four. The granules are grey, some of them more
or less angular; the yellow tints appear only in irregular
spots, not being proper to any distinct component.             Opaque
substances are irregularly interspersed, in some cases mark
ing the outlines of isolated granules.         The spherical granules
pass gradually into angular forms with rounded edges; and
some of them lose their rounded form under strong magni
fying-powers.       Rounded and distinct sections appear scarce
under a   thirtyfold magnifying-power, which has proved the best
for examining    the structure in      totality.   its

These three components may be best discerned by the microsco
pical examination of the laminae under incident light. If the light
from above is stopped, they           appear black all transmitted                      by

                      a very delicate means                      From the
      smallness of the mass    put in motion in the action of this instru
      ment, the initial oscillations are of very short duration. The
      moment of inertia of a manometer which is specially intended for
      such experiments, may be materially diminished as compared with
      that of the commercial instruments, in which little attention is
      ordinarily paid to this element of delicacy.
           Iwill here communicate a few observations which I made at
      the instigation of Professor Weber, which cannot indeed serve
      for more than a preliminary trial of the method, and should                                                                                      in
      cite to a more accurate repetition with more perfect means.
          The instrument used was a Paris barometer graduated in milli
      metres.     It was placed on the plate of an air-pump under a re
      ceiver of about 6 litres capacity.   The air under the receiver was
      dried by means of chloride of calcium.      By a rapid stroke of the
      piston, the air in the receiver was rarefied and immediately shut
      off by a stopcock.     The index of the barometer at first moved ra
      pidly towards the smaller numbers, and then retrograded, at first
      rapidly, and then more slowly through a number of divisions.
      During this time one observer gave a signal as often as he noted
      that the index passed over a whole division; a second noticed the
      corresponding time. When the motion of the index had become
       slower, parts of a division were noted.      After a lapse of sixty
       seconds a motion could no    longer be  perceived; that    the mass                                                        is,

   The calculation of a mean from these individual series is                                                       faci
litated by the circumstance that the first observation was in each
case made about the same time (two seconds) after the com
 mencement of the stroke, and that thenceforward the intervals
 of time were almost equal. Hence it is sufficient if we take the

                     –0.75    ×  0.939  = –0.698 millim.
 This number must be added to the value y=9.912 calculated
 for 0.75 second, from which the diminution in pressure due to
lowering of temperature when the air is rarefied is
                             yo=10.610 millims.
     From this we get the ratio of the specific heat under constant
pressure c to that under constant density c in the following
manner.         If the mass of air unity, at the temperature 6, is rare
fied from d to d, without the access of heat from without, it un
dergoes a diminution in temperature of

   Yet the value found above (= 1:302) would be in disaccord
with the observed velocity of sound and with the number assumed
for the mechanical equivalent of heat; for it would lead to
3.19.4 metres for the velocity of sound, taking 0.0012934 as the

region of the Trialat Mountains near Beloi Kliutsch, about forty
wersts (263 Engl. miles) from Tiflis.      The hailstones, although
different in form in both cases, were of uncommon size, and
deserve some attention.        In the first case they presented a
quite regular flattened spheroidal form, somewhat like the so
called “mandarin-oranges,” and a series of varieties almost re
minding one of organic evolution. The second case was a com

teorological conditions observed in Georgia during June 1869,
and characterized by uncommonly intense frequent rains and
thunderstorms. On June 20, a hailstorm, still more violent than
those of May 27 and June 6, caused horrible devastations in the
valley of Manglis, 18wersts from Tiflis, and progressed, in the form
of rain and electrical discharges, as far as into the valley of Algat.
  Pl. III. figs.9 and 10 are intended to represent the outlines of two
of the most remarkable varieties of hailstones as true to nature                                         as
possible, without any pretence to elegant execution.     In the two
cases under   notice, personal observation sets more or less at de
fiance any theory of the formation of hail hitherto established.
How could indeed the formation of such crystalline aggregations,
as regular as those of the calcareous spars of Andreasberg, be
possible in the midst of the tumult generally supposed to
be necessarily connected with the formation of hail?          These
aggregations   may have had a long stay within a medium of
highly refrigerated aqueous vapour before they fell to the ground,
It must be remarked, to fully understand the drawings, that the
shaded    portion of the flattened spheroidal fundamental form
of the  groups  is not always opaque in the original.            Only the
circle round the centre has a     milky   aspect,  due to the air-bubbles

of the insulator.     Battery-contact being still maintained, the
deflection falls very rapidly at first, and gradually becomes reduced
for some time after.
   The shorter the length of cable and the lower the degree of in
sulation, the less defined will be the differences in the deflections
after a few minutes’ contact.
   Great care must be taken, when making these experiments,
that the cable has not been previously charged; should the cable
have been charged, it must be connected to earth for some hours
before testing.    The battery must be in very good condition, and
unsteady deflections totally discarded.
   The ratio between the deflections for equal periods of contact
is independent of the length, and is greater or less according to
the specific resistance of the dielectric.
   The ratio is unaltered under different electromotive forces so
long as constancy is maintained during the time of observation
and the deflection itself the same with the different electromotors
at the end of the first period of contact; but when, with different
electromotive forces, the deflections at the end of the first period
of contact are not the same, we may obtain the deflections which
should be given on prolonged contact if we know the deflection
for a corresponding period by any electromotive force, since the
deflections for the first period of contact will have to one another
the same ratio which the deflections at any other period of con
tact have: thus if with a given electromotive force we obtain at
the end of the first minute's contact a deflection of 84, which at
the end of the second minute is reduced to 76, and with a dif
ferent electromotive force we have a deflection of 70 at the end of
the first minute's contact, the deflection at the end of the second
minute will have the same ratio to 76 which 70 has to 84.
   Under different temperatures the resistances corresponding to
one, two, three, &c. minutes' contact follow the same law of varia
tion.  Thus if R =r x constant, represent the resistance after
one minute's contact, then
         R! =r' x constant

9, we may calculate what the deflection should be at the end of
the second minute for any other temperature by knowing only
the deflection after the first minute at this temperature.
   Let G and g be the deflections after one and two minutes'
contact respectively at a given temperature, and G' the deflection
at the end of the first minute at any other temperature, then
G: G'::g: g'; g' will be the deflection at the end of the second
minute at this temperature.
   By calculating in this way the value of g, and comparing it
with the actual reading, much more reliance can be placed on the
value of a test than can be done by correcting for temperature in
the usual way. We are thus quite independent of temperature
for knowing whether a cable or core has received the slightest
injury in manufacture.
   G and g may readily be obtained by testing a core at a fixed
temperature, as 75° F., which is now done.
   Coils having the same dimensions have rarely the same ratio
in their resistances on prolonged contact with a battery; but
when several coils are joined together, the ratio between the de
flections for any two successive durations of contact may be ob
tained from the reciprocals of the deflections of the several coils.
   In reducing tests of insulation by discharge to measures of
resistance, it is impossible to obtain but approximations in the
ordinary way of making the tests. The best way is to charge
the cable or core for one minute and then note the discharge,
recharge the core, and take the instantaneous discharge.         By
this method we know exactly the amount of electrification which
has been given to a core; but by taking the instantaneous dis
charge first, even although contact with the battery is made for
one minute, we cannot say how much electrification is retained
in the core.
   When a core is thus connected to a battery for one minute and
afterwards removed, electrification still takes place, but, of course,
not precisely as if connected to a battery; for the insulator,          in
stead of being acted upon by a constant charge, is affected by
the variable charge consequent upon leakage; but when the core
is held free for one minute, it is very easy to ascertain how much
effect the electrification has had in reducing the loss.
   The amount of electrification retained at any given interval is
proportional to the quantity of charge remaining at that time.
The longer battery-contact is maintained, the slower will a core
or cable lose  its  charge, and conversely.
   In a   cable which has been charged       by
                                             contact with     battery

   If the discharge   after one minute's contact and one minute's
insulation be 180, and the immediate discharge 200, the dura
tion of contact being also one minute, the total effect for electri
fication at the end of the minute's insulation will be 95 per cent.
of what it would have been if connected to the same battery for
two minutes.

strictly applicable for deducing from the loss of static charge in
time t the resistance for the same period of contact in absolute
measure, or in terms of that system which makes R and K func
tions of each other; and we may expect that the capacity K can
be eliminated from this formula when R is known, if we can
determine the constant for electrification for the interval of time
during which the core is held free.
    In this formula, if the test is performed in the manner here
indicated, t will be 60, and the value obtained for R will be the
     -                                   -                      C
resistance at the end of the second minute more nearly as          ap
proaches 1. This resistance has then to be divided by a number
which expresses the ratio between the first and second minute's
contact; approximately, and on short lengths of core, this may
be obtained as follows:–Recharge the core, after being kept to
earth for some hours, maintaining contact with the battery for
two minutes     before noting the loss; then by dividing the per
centage of loss in the first experiment by the percentage of loss
given in the second experiment, we shall obtain a number by
which, if R be divided, the resistance corresponding to one mi
nute's contact may be found.
    The following ratio expresses the rate of increase in resistance
on prolonged contact:-Let D be the deflection at the end of the
first period of contact, and d the deflection at the end of the nth
 period, then D: d. : d: deflection at the end of n° minutes; or
the deflection after the first period of contact is to the deflection
for any other period of contact as this deflection is to the deflec
tion at the period of contact corresponding to the square of the
intervals.
    I  have to acknowledge my obligation to Mr. Hooper for pla
cing at my disposal the necessary instruments and cores for the
subject of this paper.

        the last series of these researches, while discussing the
         N
       various processes of producing liquid films,   tried to make                                           I
 it clearly understood that the  production  of such films always
 depends upon the cohesion and viscosity of the liquid—the former
property opposing the rupture, and the second impeding the re
lative motion of the molecules when the liquid has reached a
certain degree of thinness, and thus rendering any further atte
nuation of it more slow.                                       I
                                   concluded, in consequence, that the
property of undergoing extension into thin films must belong to
  all
    liquids, and      tried   I show that this      really the case.

 general characters of the first are the formation of little or no
 froth when shaken, the incapability of being blown into bubbles,
 the absence of colours on the hemispheric bubbles, or a tardy
 and only incipient coloration, showing only the red and green of
 the last orders.   Among the numerous liquids which belong to
 this category,        I
                     may mention water, glycerine, sulphuric and
 nitric acids, ammonia,   saturated solutions of tartaric acid, nitrate
 of potassium, carbonate of sodium, and chloride of calcium.
    The liquids of the second category are distinguished from the
 preceding by the prompt and decided coloration of their films,
 showing tints of               all
                         the orders.     These liquids are the fat
 oils, lactic acid, glacial acetic acid,         turpentine, alcohol,  oil   of
 benzine, Dutch liquid, chloroform, sulphuric ether, sulphide                                                        of

cules will then easily drag after them their inside neighbours,
which will thus be separated in their turn also; the sepa

break at this point.   Now in hemispherical bubbles of the first
category the superficial layers have, according to my principle, a
very great viscosity, so that molecular movements take place
with difficulty; hence it is intelligible that very near to the
summits of either of the faces an increased molecular interval

 and this is supported by a comparison of the respective tensions
 of water and of our solution of Marseilles soap : the tension of
 a film of water at the common temperature is 14.6, and that of
 a film formed by a solution containing one part of Marseilles
 soap to forty of water is only 5-64*, or between one-half and
 one-third of the former.
   Nevertheless, in order that a liquid may be capable of exten

     pivot, 25 millims. high, carrying a magnetized needle 10
centims. long, was fixed at the centre of a cylindrical glass dish,
11 centims. in internal diameter and 6 centims, deep. In making
an experiment, the liquid to be examined was poured into the
dish until it just came up to the lower face of the needle; next, by
means of a bar-magnet, the needle was turned through 90° from
the magnetic meridian, and kept in that position until the surface
of the liquid had again become motionless; then the bar-magnet
was suddenly removed and the time observed that the needle
took in traversing a given angle : in my experiments this angle
was 85°.    When this time had been observed, more liquid of
the same kind was added until the needle was covered to a depth
of about 2 centims, the interior of the cap of the needle was
freed   from the small quantity of                 which        air

    Experiments        this kind were made with five liquids
                           of                                              the                       of

observations the mean time occupied                  traversing    85°

     In
      the second place,     the liquidsof  the first Table, that one
                                                                 in

which, when shaken        flask, yields the most perceptible froth;
                                in     a
we may therefore suppose that   saturated solution ifa                                           of carbonate

having that property               as    the four other liquids.

     In   the third place, among       the liquids            of the second Table,
the one which shows the smallest ratio is solution of resin-soap,
and this is also the liquid in which bubbles attain the smallest size.
   The small difference will no doubt be observed between the
ratios 10-65 and 11:05, belonging respectively to solution of car
bonate of sodium, which does not admit of being blown into
bubbles, and to solution of resin-soap which does yield bubbles
up to a certain diameter.       But this, again, is a consequence of
our theory; in fact, according to our Tables, the superficial vis
cosity is smaller in the second of these liquids than in the first,
and, as I have stated above, the ratio at which the formation of
bubbles first becomes possible is higher the greater the super
ficial viscosity.  It is therefore intelligible that, if the ratio 11-05
for  resin-soap   allows of the formation of bubbles of moderate
size, this same ratio (and still less the somewhat smaller ratio
10:65) will not allow of the formation of bubbles in solution of
carbonate  of sodium.
   Lastly, my theory leads me to a complete explanation of the
long persistence of bubbles blown with the glycerine-solution,
as well as of the singular property possessed by the film which
forms them of not diminishing in thickness beyond a certain
degree, and then increasing in thickness again.          In the first
place, I endeavour to find the approximate value of the superficial
viscosity of the liquid in question, and                I
                                              find it equal to 80:25,
whence it will be seen that it is distinctly less than that of water;
the tension of the films is the same as for solution of soap,
namely 5-64; hence for the ratio of these two elements in the
glycerine-solution we have the number 14:22.      Bearing in mind
the comparatively low value of the superficial viscosity of the
glycerine-solution, this ratio may be looked upon as high, and
is much greater than is needful for the formation of bubbles;
accordingly the glycerine-solution yields very large bubbles.
  But this liquid absorbs moisture from the air, and consequently,
when a bubble has been blown with                 it,
                                            the film     subject    twois              to
opposite influences—namely, that          weight which tends
                                             of                   make                to
it  thinner, and that      absorption, which tends
                              of                            thicken         to              it.
The former    predominatesat   first, and the film  gets  thinner;  but
the descent      the liquid becomes slower through two causes—
                    of
first, the diminution     the mass, and, secondly, the gradual ab
                              of
sorption     moisture, which renders the liquid more aqueous and
               of
thus approximates          its
                        viscosity      that
                                       to     water.of     follows that It
soon the descent      the liquid becomes
                         of                  slow that the augmen
                                                        so
tation    of
           thickness due     absorption
                                 to     predominates.    As regards
the  tension,  M.  Dupré    has found that      solution    soap
                                                             in                  of         it
varies extremely little with the proportion        water; and thisof
probably holds good for the glycerine-solution also.

   Thus, on the one hand, in consequence of the continual ab
sorption of aqueous vapour, the film can never at any phase of
its existence become verythin; and, on the other hand, the ratio
between superficial viscosity and tension remains great enough
to render the rupture of the film difficult, until the proportion
of water assimilated by it has become very great.
   I  conclude by showing that in relation to the ready develop
ment of large films and the persistence of them, the part played
by cohesion is subsidiary to that played by internal viscosity.  In
fact, for different liquids, the cohesion is known to vary in the
same direction as the coefficient of the sum of the curvatures in
the expression for the capillary pressure—a coefficient which,
according to the researches of M. Hagen and M. Dupré, is nothing
else than the tension; and since this latter is much weaker in
soap-water than in pure water, the same is necessarily true for
the cohesion also ; but, notwithstanding, solution of soap yields
 enormous bubbles, while water does not yield any.

ceptional children of the above age could be brought to know much
more about long division than that it is a process leading to a certain
result. Nor does this to any serious extent diminish the value of the
intellectual training which a child goes through in the study of
arithmetic.     That training is undergone by means of particular ex
amples.     Thus, let the question proposed be this:—“A watch gains
uniformly 13 seconds a day. It is 2 minutes 10 seconds slow on a
certain day, by how much will it be fast at the end of three weeks?”
The reasoning by which a child arrives at the answer is quite inde
pendent of his knowledge of the ultimate reasons of the processes
of multiplication &c. that he employs.
    We suppose that in reality Mr. Fitch's opinion is not very differ
 ent from ours; for we find that in the book for children, of which he
 is the joint author (the ‘School Arithmetic”), no more is attempted
 than the statement and illustration of rules. The method of the
book is this:—In each section a typical example is given and           so                                              its

                                      the rule, and finally many examples
of   the rule are given for practice.   Of the examples some are such

     following communication was read:—
                Observations on Hydrogenium.”                                 By Thomas
Graham,    F.R.S., Master of the Mint.
     From the elongation of a palladium wire,               caused by the occlu
 sion of   hydrogen,   the   density  of hydrogenium       was inferred to be a
 little under 2. But it is now to be remarked that another number
 of half that amount may be deduced with equal probability from
the same experimental data. This double result is a consequence of
the singular permanent shortening of the palladium wire observed
after the expulsion of hydrogen. In a particular observation formerly
described, for instance, a wire of 609: 14 millims. increased in length
to 618-92 millims. when charged with hydrogen, and fell to 599:44
millims. when the hydrogen was extracted. The elongation was
978 millims., and the absolute shortening or retraction 9.7 millims,
making the extreme difference in length 19:48 millims.                 The elon
gation and retraction would appear, indeed, to be equal in amount.
 Now it is by no means impossible that the volume added to the
wire by the hydrogenium is represented by the elongation and re
traction taken together, and not by the elongation alone, as hitherto
assumed. It is only necessary to suppose that the retraction of the
palladium molecules takes place the moment the hydrogen is first
absorbed, instead of being deferred till the latter is expelled; for
the righting of the particles of the palladium wire (which are in
a state of excessive tension in the direction of the length of the
wire) may as well take place in the act of the absorption of the
hydrogen as in the expulsion of that element.                    It may indeed
appear most probable in the abstract that the mobility of the pal
ladium particle is determined by the first entrance of the hydrogen.
The hydrogenium will then be assumed to occupy double the space
previously allotted to               it,
                               and the density                                   be

of   four observations     upon   the same      wire,  previously  recorded,  the

                   of certainty.
we are unable as  yet to see the full import.    In illustration, another
experiment upon a pure palladium wire may be detailed. This
wire, which was new, took up a full charge of hydrogen, namely
956-3 volumes, and increased in length from 609-585 to 619-354
millims.   The elongation was therefore 97.69 millims. With the
expulsion of the hydrogen afterwards, the wire was permanently
shortened to 600-115 millims.      It thus fell 9:470 millims. below its
normal or first length. The elongation and retraction are here within
0.3 millim. of equality. The two changes taken together amount to
19:239 millims., and their sum represents the increase of the wire
in length due to the addition of hydrogenium.            It represents a
linear expansion of 3205 on 100, with a cubic expansion of 9-827
on 100.    The composition of the wire comes to be represented as

similar, namely 468 volumes, and was not increased by protracting
the exposure of the wire for the long period of twenty hours. There
can be little doubt, then, of the uniformity of the hydrogenium com
bination, the volumes of gas occluded in the three experiments being
4642, 4637, and 468 volumes. The linear expansion was 1:9 on
100 in the third experiment, and therefore similar also to the prece
ding experiments.
    The hydrogenium may be supposed to be in direct combination
with the palladium only, as gold by itself shows no attraction for the
former element.       In the first experiment the hydrogenium is in the
proportion of 0.3151 to 100 palladium and gold together. This
gives 0-3939 hydrogenium to 100 palladium ; while a whole equiva
lent of hydrogenium is 0.939 to 100 palladium *. The hydrogenium
found is by calculation 0.4195 equivalent, or 1 equivalent hydroge
nium to 2:383 equivalents palladium, which comes nearer to 2 equi
valents of the former with 5 of the latter than to any other proportion.
    To ascertain the smallest proportion of gold which prevents retrac
tion, an alloy was made by fusing 7 parts of that metal with 93 parts
of palladium, which had a specific gravity of 13:05. The button
was rolled into a thin strip and charged with hydrogen by the wet
method.       An occlusion of 585'44 volumes of gas took place, with a
linear expansion of 17 on 100.             A retraction followed to nearly
the same extent on afterwards expelling the hydrogen by heat.
    With another alloy, produced by fusing 10 of gold with 90 of pal
ladium, the occlusion of gas was 475 volumes, the linear expansion
 1.65 on 100.       The retraction on expelling the gas afterwards was
extremely slight.      To nullify the retraction of the palladium, about
 10 per cent. of gold appears therefore to be required in the alloy.
    Another alloy of palladium of sp. gr. 13:1, and containing 2479
per cent. of gold, underwent no retraction on losing hydrogen, as
 already stated.

                                                                    weight did
 not materially reduce the occluding power             the palladium.

    5. “On a peculiar instance of Intraglacial Erosion near Norwich.”
 By Searles Wood, Jun., Esq., F.G.S., and F. W. Harmer, Esq.
    The authors described the general structure of the valley of the
 Yare near Norwich, in which the fundamental chalk-rock is covered
 by the following drift-beds:–1, the Chillesford sand and clay; 2,
‘pebbly sands and pebble-beds; 3, the equivalent of the contorted
 Drift of Cromer; 4, the middle glacial sand ; and 5, the Boulder
 clay. The valley is hollowed out in these beds.              Sewer-shafts sunk
 in the bottom of the valley near Norwich have shown the existence
 of an abrupt hole or narrow trough in the chalk, having one of                                                 its

     The following communications were read:—
     1.    “On the Geology and Mineralogy    Hastings County, Canada     of
West.”    By        Wallbridge, Esq.
                        T.   C.
   Before describing the gold and iron-ores    Hastings, which formed     of
the main subject       this paper, the author introduced
                                  of                           general                                a
sketch     the geology
               of          the county.  ofAfter noticing certain local

Mr. Wallbridge   on the Geology   of Hastings   County, Canada.       467
deposits of recent origin, he described the extensive accumulations
of drift-gravels and boulder-clay.   A single boulder near the Shan
nonville railway-station was said to cover an area of about 5 acres,
and to have a thickness of 100 feet. The evidences of glacial action
over the whole country were referred to, and the direction of ice
marks cited from several localities. Below the posttertiary deposits
the rocks consist, in the southern townships, of Lower Silurian lime
stones referred for the most part to the Trenton group, and, in the
northern townships, of a large series of metamorphic rocks, supposed
to be of Lower Laurentian age.     Bosses of syenite and gneiss pene
trate the Silurian beds to the south of the main Laurentian mass;
and several outliers of Trenton limestone point to the former ex
tension of the Silurian rocks northwards.    All the minerals of eco
nomic value are confined to the Laurentian area.
   Gold was first discovered in the county of Hastings in 1866. The
author described in detail the singular occurrence of the metal at
the Richardson Mine in Madoc, where it was found in two pockets
associated with a peculiar black carbonaceous     substance, a ferru
ginous dolomite, and ochre-brown iron-ore.         Assays of the sur
rounding rocks showed the existence of gold even at a considerable
distance from the mine. Mention was also made of several other
 gold mines, in Madoc, Marmora, and Elzevir, from which specimens
 were exhibited, and analyses of ore quoted.
   The iron-ores of Hastings occur partly as magnetic oxide and
partly as hamatite.   In addition to the well-known “Big Ore
bed” and the “Seymour bed,” the writer called attention to some
new localities of magnetic ore in Madoc. The deposit of haematite
called the “Kane Ore-bed” was discovered by the author some
years back; and from ancient workings in this bed (apparently
those of the Indians, who may have used the ochre as war-paint)
he has obtained bone needles and other objects of human workman
ship.   Attention was then directed to a large deposit of specular
iron-ore in Hungerford, hitherto undescribed, and to the pyrrhotine
or magnetic pyrites of Madoc.
   The paper concluded with a notice of the galena and other less
important minerals of the county.
   2. “On the distribution of Flint Implements in the Drift, with
reference to some recent discoveries in Norfolk and Suffolk.”    By
J. W. Flower, Esq., F.G.S.
   The author noticed some recently discovered localities in the
valley of the Little Ouse which have yielded Flint Implements,
viz.:-at     Broomhill, about 350 feet from and 5 or 6 feet above the
level of the river; at Gravel Hill, about 1 mile from and 10 feet above
the river; at Shrub Hill, about 1 mile from and only a foot or two
above the river; and at Lakenheath, nearly 3 miles from the river,
and 60 feet above it. In the first three of these localities the worked
flints are in coarse gravel, resting immediately on the Cretaceous
beds (chalk in the first and second, gault in the third), and overlain
by regular deposits of gravel and sand. The implements resemble
those of Acheul, Thetford, and Salisbury, but present some pecu
liarities, from which the author inferred that each place had   its own

 workmen, and that the different forms were intended to answer dif
 ferent purposes.    At Brandon, implements formed of quartzite were
 found in a bed   consisting of rounded quartzite pebbles mixed with
 about one-fourth of flints.    Flint implements occurred beneath this
 bed.
    The author indicated the geographical characters of the district
 and the peculiarities in the distribution of the flint implements, which
 he regarded as in accordance with the phenomena presented by the
 valley of the Somme; and he argued from the consideration of all the
 facts that the implements were not transported to their present
 situation by the agency of the rivers in whose valleys they occur,
 but that they were made upon the spot, exposed upon the surface
 with the gravels in which they are found and from which they were
 made, and finally covered up by the river-gravels and sandy beds
 which now overlie them.

       GENTLEMEN,                          September 22, 1869.
    You have given in the August Number of this Magazine an ex
 tract from the Comptes Rendus for June, on the “Measurement of
 the Electrical Conductivity of Liquids hitherto supposed to be                             In
 sulators.”   In a paper read in the Chemical Section of the British
                                              I
Association at Dundee, 1867, gave the resistances, in B.A. units, of
a definite length and thickness of oils, and pointed out in some in
stances the electrolysis resulting from the tests.  This paper appeared
in the   Report  of the British Association for     1867,  the Chemical
News, October 1867, and in the Proceedings of the British Pharma
ceutical Conference, as well as in the Pharmaceutical Journal for
October 1867.
    Some of the oils operated upon gave much higher resistances than
any of the liquids tested by M. Said-Effendi.       In the case of oil of
turpentine, I found by continued contact with the battery that                              its
resistance became considerably reduced          consequence       electro

    To investigate the influence of the quantity of the absorbed gases
 on the magnitude of the change in the melting-point, the tempera
 ture of a mixture of ice and water which was saturated under 1, 2,
 3 atmospheres was examined, and was found to be —0° 13, -0°-25,
 and —0°35. The alteration in the melting-point seems proportional
 to the amount of dissolved gas.
    The remarkable property which ice has of regelation has been
variously interpreted.         Faraday has explained it by assuming that
the particles in the interior of a mass of ice have a higher melt
ing-point than those on the surface*.             Forbest and others assume
that ice on melting assumes an intermediate condition of softness,
and that in this condition pieces adhere together, like those of weld
able metals. Thomson                  :
                                   and, subsequently, Helmholtz explain the
phenomenon by an alteration in the melting-point                    of ice by
pressure. There must always be an increase in pressure on inti
mate contact of the pieces of ice; under this pressure a portion of
the ice must melt at the surface of contact, the water formed must
run off, and, in virtue of            its
                                     lower temperature, partially freeze again
in  places where       it liberated from pressure.

guides, feels a heaviness of the head and a somnolence which are
frequently very painful, evidently due to a venous stagnation and
imperfect oxygenation of the blood. Even after two hours' com
plete rest and while still fasting, the pulse always remains between
90 and 108. The sphygmograph applied to the wrist after an hour's
rest indicates an extremely feeble tension, and a most pronounced
dicrotism.     According to M. Marey, this defect of tension must be
due to the fact that, owing to muscular motion, the blood flows more
rapidly through the small vessels. When the sphygmograph is ap
plied to persons suffering from mountain-sickness, curves are ob
tained which exactly resemble those obtained in cases of algidity.
The pulse is so weak that the spring of the instrument is scarcely
raised. This alone would indicate a general cooling of the body.
   Internal Temperature of the Body.—This was always taken with
great care at different heights, the thermometer being placed in the
mouth underneath the tongue; the mouth itself was closed, and
breathing was effected through the nose.       The thermometer was a
Walferdin's maximum with index, on which, from 30° to 40°, the hun
dredths of a degree could be read off.       The index facilitated the
reading, and prevented any errors. The instrument was always left
for at least fifteen minutes in the mouth, a time which was far more
than sufficient for it to reach the maximum.
   While fasting and exactly in the same conditions, during the ascent,
the decrease of the internal temperature of the body is very remark
able, and is proportional to the altitude reached.  This is easily seen
by an inspection of the following Table, which condenses the ob
servations made upon myself during my two ascents of Mont Blanc.

 Mont Blanc, however, where every one feels a little uneasiness,
 more than half an hour elapsed before the thermometer attained
 its normal height. These data cease to be true during digestion.
 Then, in spite of the efforts which the ascent necessitates, the tem
 perature is maintained at about 36° or 37°, and even exceeds 37°-3.
 The influence of the food does not last long; scarcely half an hour
 after having eaten, the body is again cooled.
    Whence arises this diminution of temperature ? In a state of rest
 and while fasting man burns the materials of his blood, and the heat
 developed is altogether employed in keeping his temperature constant
during the variations of the atmosphere. On a plain, and by mecha
nical efforts, the intensity of the respiratory combustions, as Gavarret
has shown, increases proportionally to the expenditure of force.
Heat is transformed into mechanical force; but from the density of
the air and the quantity of oxygen inspired, enough heat is formed
to compensate this expenditure.         On a mountain, on the contrary,
especially at great heights and on very steep snowy ascents, where the
mechanical labour of the ascent is very great, an enormous quantity
of heat must be transformed into muscular force. This expenditure
of force consumes more heat than the organism can furnish; hence
the body is cooled, and frequent halts must be made in order to
reheat  it.   Although the body        burning and
                                                 be       state      perspira
