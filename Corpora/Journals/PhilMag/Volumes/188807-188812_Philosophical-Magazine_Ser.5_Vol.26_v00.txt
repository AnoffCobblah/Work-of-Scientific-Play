        .." simplest,  and at the same time the most reliable,
                  of determining indices of refraction, i.e. the
relative velocities of light in transparent bodies, is that of
prismatic deviation. This method has proved available even
 º
for strongly absorbent intensely-coloured substances which
show considerable irregularity of dispersion in particular
        of the spectrum, if prisms of suitable form are employed.
   o attempt has, however, yet been made to determine the
  rismatic deviation of light in metals, since the metals, even
in very thin films, are completely opaque. Attempts have,
therefore, been made in other ways to draw conclusions as to
the velocity of light in the metals.           In particular the index
of refraction for silver has been calculated by Quincke
from various interference phenomena, and by Wernicke
from the absorption of light. The indices found by Quincke
by various methods are partly smaller than unity, partly very
large; Wernicke finds for silver values between 3 and 5.
On the other hand, Voigt calculates from Wernicke's obser
vations the refractive index of silver at about 0.25f.
     Further, from observations on the reflexion of metals Beert
has deduced the velocity of light in metals according to
Cauchy's theory, and Voigtt according to his own theory. On
 both theories the law of refraction of Snellius is certainly not

                                    Preparation            of   the      Prisms.
         Most       of   the prisms were                  electrolytically                deposited          upon

                  of Refraction of the   Metals.                  3
platinized glass.     At the commencement of my investigations
I  had two kinds of such glass at my disposal, viz. some pieces
of French platinized glass taken from an apparatus made by
König of Paris, and some pieces which              }.  Lohmann of
Berlin had platinized for me. Only a very small portion of
them possessed a sufficiently plane surface.        Further, though
the  layer  of platinum   on these  glasses  is no doubt coherent,
yet, as the microscope shows, it is far from uniform.           This
latter circumstance is of no consequence when it is desired to
deposit another metal in considerable thickness upon the
platinum; but for the preparation of the prisms it is very
  rejudicial.   As the stock of platinized glass was soon ex
   usted, and more was not to be obtained, either from Dr.
Lohmann or from Paris, nothing remained but to prepare
the platinized glass myself.     After much trouble I succeeded
in finding the composition of a platinizing solution which
   rmitted the burning-in of the platinum at a low red heat,
so that the plates remained perfectly even.            Further, the
film of metal was so      perfectly uniform that even with high
powers no want of homogeneity could be detected under the
                   º
microscope. The plate-glass employed was about 6 millim.
thick. The film of platinum was burnt-in in a small muffle-oven.
It is unnecessary         to enter particularly into the details of
the  method,   which will be described in another place.        The
metallic prisms were formed upon the platinized glass in the
following manner:—Upon a strip of glass about 3 centim.
broad, placed horizontally, a vertical electrode of the metal to
be deposited, of equal breadth, was placed so that it did not
touch the platinum.        In the angle between the glass and
metal a capillary layer of the electrolytic fluid was placed and
decomposed     by a current of suitable strength.         A double
wedge of metal was deposited whose greatest thickness lay
directly against the metallic electrode.     Whether the surfaces
of the double wedge were in any degree plane, or whether
they were strongly convex or concave, depended upon so
many variable circumstances that the result was purely a
matter of chance.       Only those double wedges were of any
use in which the surfaces were so far plane that they sharply
reflected a fine wire cross when seen through a telescope pro
vided with a Gauss's eyepiece.         Often 50, and not unfre
quently many more, prisms had to be made before one at           all
usable was obtained.
   At first, when used the thin (1.5
                I                        to
                                         2     millim. thick) Paris
and Berlin     glass, they  were, for the most part, not double
prisms but single, which were obtained             by plunging the
metallic electrode vertically into the electrolytic bath, and
bringing the platinized glass horizontally against      it.   There

4                                  Prof. A. Kundt on the Indices
is then deposited from the capillary layer of liquid, between
the metal and the glass, a wedge of metal upon the glass and
lying close to      edge.  With silver the prisms were pre

of reduction.   Prof. Quincke first showed how      obtain                                            to

   The glass plate supporting the small metallic prisms was

6                Prof. A. Kundt on     the   Indices
suitably cemented upon the plate of the spectrometer for
the observations.     An arrangement of screens was placed in
front of it which, in the case of simple prisms, left free either the
prism or a neighbouring portion of the glass, and in the case
of double prisms the one prism and the other in succession.
The angles of refraction, and in the case of double prisms the
sum of the two angles, were determined in the usual manner
by reflexion of cross-wires in a Gauss’ eye-piece; the de
flections by adjusting a fine cross of wires on the image of a
slit.   In both determinations the plate with the prisms re
mained fixed, and the divided circle with the observing tele
scope was turned.      The side faces of the glass plate must be
plane; but, as is easily seen, it is a matter of no consequence if
these faces have a slight inclination to each other.
    According to the above formula it is sufficient to adjust the
glass plate with the prisms at right angles to the incident
rays by eye, although generally this adjustment was controlled
by reflexion.      Since the surfaces of the prisms are very
small—2–3 millim. broad and about 10 millim. high—the
pencil of rays received by the objective was very small; hence
the adjustment of the eyepiece of the observing telescope in
the right focal plane is more difficult, and the image of the
slit, after passage through the thin prism, is never sharp, but
has indistinct edges produced by reflexion.             In order to
avoid the dangerous errors resulting from insufficient adjust
 ment of the observing telescope, observations by way of
control were made each time, by the aid of which the tele
scope could be correctly adjusted.        Into the details of this
process it is not necessary to enter.
    The deflection was always determined for white light—lamp,
sun, or electric lamp. Notwithstanding that with some of
 the metals, as will be seen below, the dispersion is very large,
yet with the small angle of the prisms used the deflection for
white light could be determined exactly. The value observed
applies to the mean rays of the spectrum. Then the deflec
 tion was determined for red and for blue light, for which
purpose either the sun or the electric light was always
employed.
    For observations in the red the rays passed through from
 one to four red glasses, according to the brightness of the
source of light and the transparency of the prism ; for the
observations in the blue, through a blue glass, and a vessel
with more or less concentrated solution of copper oxide
in ammonia. Since it was not always possible to employ the
same number of glasses and the same concentration of solu
tion, the mean wave-length of the red and blue light used is
not the same in    all the experiments,      so
                                              that the observations

                             Mean 45-86,
which corresponds to an angle of 11:47 for the silver.
   So also a bismuth prism and a nickel prism, converted into
oxides, gave angles from which the angles of the metallic
prisms could be calculated with a sufficient agreement with
the angles directly measured.
  If  the refracting angles are correctly measured by reflex
ion, the observations of deviation can hardly be falsified by
variable change of phase.    Nevertheless it might be supposed
that the diffraction of light might influence the observations
of deflection. The small aperture of the prism itself of course
produces a marked diffraction; and even with the best prisms
the image of the slit is not given with perfectly sharp edges.
Moreover the absorption of light by the prism increases
towards the base.   I believe, therefore, that  Ihave established,
by numerous experiments, that refraction produces no con
stant error in the determinations of deflection.
   Further, the circumstance that prisms of very different
aperture, very different angles, and different thicknesses, in
which, consequently, the decrease in the intensity of light at
increasing distance from the edge of the prism was very dif
ferent, gave values of a not affected by any regular change,
shows that diffraction could introduce into the observation no
error which would be greater than the general errors.
   Finally, we have the important question, What meaning is
to be given to the values of n calculated from the observa
tions 2 We see from the numbers given that n is a constant
for each metal and a given kind of light in the neighbour
hood of the angle of prism employed, and does not depend in
any definite way on the value of these angles, which varied
in the case of iron and silver from one to four. n is of course
a magnitude characteristic of the optical behaviour of the
metal.   If  n, as in the phenomena of transparent media, is
the ratio of the velocity of light in the surrounding medium
(in our experiments, air) to    itsvelocityin  the metal, then,if

the metal prisms are brought into another medium, the de
flection of the rays would alter—in correspondence with the
refractive index of the new medium. In order to try this,
experiments of the following kind were made.            Upon the
glass plate carrying the prism a second glass plate was
cemented at a short distance from        and the space betweenit,
was filled with      fluid, and the deflection was determined

the same meaning           before, then, remembering that the
                                 as
angle  is small, we have
                                       2'   =8(n—n'),
and
                                 2—2'-8(n'—1).
We can thus calculate                 the deflection                 a'    from the value of               n'
determined         in   some      other way, and                          from      the      difference
between     2'    and   a    the value of n'.

for iron, nickel, platinum, and bismuth.           There is a consider
able difference between       the absolute    value of n as calculated
from my observations and from those of Voigt. This pro
bably also arises from differences in the materials used.
    Voigt has further shown, in a separate treatise", that
according to his theory the refractive index of strongly ab
sorbent media can be correctly determined in the ordinary

the prism is sufficiently small.          The quantity          sin”8, in
which n denotes the index of refraction, k the coefficient of
absorption, and 8 the angle of the prism, may be neglected.
  º
 This is always the case with our prisms; and thus, accordin
 to Voigt, also our assumption made above is justified that the
           obtained for n are the reciprocals of the velocity of
  ight.
    It is not possible to enter upon a discussion of the measure
 ments made by Herr Dessauf of the dark rings seen in coni
 cal metallic layers, with the values of refractive index here
                 j
 found, since he was not able to measure the rings with normal
 incidence.     I will only remark that the anomalous dispersion
 in   platinum,   iron,   and nickel does not necessarily require
 an anomalous order of the rings in the red and blue, since,
 according to the above values for n in the metals named, the
 wave-lengths for red always remain greater than for blue.

     In  the course  of this investigation opportunity occurred of
 determining the      indices of refraction of some compounds of
 the metals—and      in particular of the oxides—chiefly in order
 to check the              of observation in different ways. Since
  for many of the     substances examined the index of refraction
 has not hitherto      been determined,     I  give some of the num
 bers obtained.      I  add some determinations on metals which
  were impure by     reason   of the presence of oxides.

16                  Prof. A. Kundt on the Indices
Connecion between the Indices of Refraction of the Metals and
     their Power of Conducting Light and Electricity.
     If
      we glance at the values of n (compared on p. 12), the
connexion between the indices of refraction and the con
ducting power of the metals for light and electricity at once
strikes the eye. Those which have the smallest indices, and
for which consequently the velocity of light is the greatest,
are also the best conductors of heat and electricity.
    The galvanic specific conductivity and the coefficient of
conduction for heat of a substance are perfectly definite values
for a given temperature; the velocity of light in a body at a
  iven temperature is not, for it varies with the wave-length.
 f therefore we wish to further investigate and formulate the
above suggested universal connexion, we shall have to settle
what is to be understood by the velocity of light. The for
mulae of dispersion for transparent bodies lead always to a
definite limiting value of index of refraction with increasing
wave-length.       at such a limit exists also for the metals
cannot indeed be proved, but is probable.     For our determi
nations those values are    probably  the nearest which were
obtained for red light.
     If
      we take the velocity of red light in silver as 100, then,
according to the table on p. 12, we obtain the following
numbers for the other metals:—
                   Silver    .   .    .   .   .      .     100

                   Bismuth       .    .   .   .      .      10.3
     A
     glance at the above table shows that with one exception,
viz. bismuth, the values of v fall within the limits of the num
bers for the electric conductivity, obtained by the different
observers, when that of silver is taken as 100". The number
60 for copper appears somewhat too small. It         however,      is,                     to
 beobserved that the electrolytic copper      our double prism

might possibly contain some cuprous oxide, which would make
the index    refraction too great, and the velocity
              of                                         light too      all of

considerably less than 10. The bismuth with which the de
terminations     conductivity were made was, however, always

susceptibility at a much lower temperature than the steel.
Nickel was found to lose its                     about 330° C. to
                                 susceptibility
340°C. (according to Becquerel about 400° C. ; according to
Pouillet 350°C.). Gore has published accounts of experiments
relating to the sudden loss of magnetic properties of both
iron and nickel at certain temperatures*.       Chrystalf, in the
course of some experiments on the magnetic sounds in iron,
nickel, and cobalt when traversed by an interrupted current of
electricity, found evidence of sudden changes in the magnetic
susceptibility of iron and nickel at certain temperatures, and
gives some curves which enable us to trace the connexion
between these changes and the equally curious changes of
thermoelectrical power observed by Tait in iron and nickel at
certain temperatures f.      Baur Š and Wassmuth || have also
taken up the matter. According to the former, for small
magnetizing forces the susceptibility of iron at first increases
 rapidly as the temperature increases, reaches a maximum at
 red-heat, and then falls suddenly to zero. For large forces
 the susceptibility decreases gradually up to red-heat, and then
 falls suddenly to a very small value. According to him, if a
 bar be cooled from a white heat the first traces of susceptibility
 are observed at a very bright red, the brighter the greater the
 magnetizing force. Berson" has published a curve showing
the relation between the magnetic induction of nickel and the
 temperature right up to the point at which the susceptibility
practically vanishes, namely, 336°C. The author" has also
  uite recently published similar curves for nickel, and finds
 that the susceptibility practically vanishes at temperatures
ranging from 333°C. to 41.2°C. according to the strength of
the magnetizing force, the greater the force the higher the
temperature. The author, like Berson, finds the temperature
at which the nickel begins to rapidly lose                    its

M. Nouel             and the author that, at any rate in the case of
annealed           iron, there is no sudden change in the thermal ex
pansibility at this critical temperature.
   When the temperature, after it has been raised to the
critical point, is again lowered, the centres m1, m2, m3, will
creep closer together again and the magnetic properties will
reappear as suddenly” as they were lost.
   According to the theory, it would seem that if we could make
the magnetic molecules assume a sufficiently closed magnetic
circuit, iron'and nickel might be converted into diamagnetics.
Indeed we can understand that diamagnetics may be such in
consequence    either of a paucity of magnetic molecules in
each molecule of the substance, or from having their magnetic
molecules forming nearly closed circuits.
   Again, if the temperature be raised high enough it would
seem possible to partly restore the lost magnetic susceptibility;
for then, by the further expansion of mi, me, and ms, the N
and S poles would begin to be separated.          therefore, such             If,

therefore, desirable to ascertain if this sudden loss of per
manent molecular strain would, like permanent magnetization,
 take place at a lower temperature than the loss of temporary
 susceptibility.     The iron wire in the last experiment was,
 therefore, permanently twisted through twenty revolutions
 and then released from torsional stress.          When, on heating, a
 certain   temperature     had been reached there was a sudden
 untwisting of the wire, followed after an interral of sereral
 seconds by the usual deflection of the Thomson's galvanometer,
which showed that the temporary magnetic susceptibility was
beginning to disappear.           This experiment was repeated at
least six times with different pieces of the same kind of wire,
and, invariably, with the same result—the permanent torsion,
 like the permanent magnetism, began to disappear suddenly at
a temperature considerably below the temperature at which
 the temporary magnetic susceptibility began to disappear.
     The contrary, however, was the case with a specimen of
annealed nickel wire * of the same length as the iron but of
rather less diameter. When this wire had received a few
turns of permanent torsion f, and was afterwards heated, the
 loss of temporary magnetic susceptibility occurred at a much
lower temperature than the rapid loss of permanent torsion;
whilst Berson has shown that the permanent magnetization
of nickel resembles the permanent magnetization of iron in
disappearing before the temporary susceptibility.
    This experiment, therefore, shows that the temperature at
which permanent magnetism begins to suddenly disappear is
not the temperature at which permanent torsion begins to
suddenly disappear.
   III.  On a Diffusion Photometer.          By  J. JoLY, M.A.B.E.f
        PECULIAR         appearance      presented   by  a translucent
         substance, when rendered discontinuous by a crack or
break, is probably a matter of common observation.                When
such an object—it may be the familiar one of a cracked
paraffin candle—is placed in an unequally illuminated field,
the presence of the discontinuity shows out, in general, boldly,
as a plane of separation between a bright and a dark portion
of the substance.        The light, in fact, diffused through the
substance, passes only in a feeble degree across the crack, so
that that part of the body near the source of light appears
      * Containing nearly 98 per cent. of nickel
      + Only two or three turns can be given before the wire breaks.

  Recently           I
               have changed the nature of the material to the
more durable one of glass, of very similar translucency.   It
may be said that the nearer the glass approaches the uniform
soft translucency of paraffin the better it is for the purpose.
The durability secured in the use of this material and the
accuracy of surface it permits in grinding and polishing are
great advantages.       I have also heightened the effect of the
plane of separation by interposing between the parallelepipeds
a film of silver leaf.      This is caused to adhere by means of

If the mixed solutions containing the pellet be left standing
for some hours before finally adjusting, it will be found on
examination with a lens that bubbles will no longer gather
on the paraffin.
    The last operation is finding the specific gravity of this
solution, which gives us s in the formula.             This is most
accurately done in a Sprengel tube, holding about 2 cc.;
the bottle may also be used.
    The table opposite contains the results of some determina
tions made by the method.
    Of experiments 4 and 5 it is interesting, perhaps, to note
that 4 was undertaken with the notion that the mineral
being dealt with was barite.       Its weight, as a hand specimen,
was   deceptive,  it being penetrated   by sphalerite. On getting
the result (2:78) it was concluded that an oversight had been
made somewhere in the measurements, and experiment 5 was
undertaken ; this giving 2-77, the specimen was appealed
to.    Tests then showed it to be calcite.      The determinations
numbered 11 and 12 were effected on minute, greenish
crystals, hexagonal in shape, removed from the Wicklow
granite.    The crystals alone sank rapidly in Thoulet’s solution
 (sp. gr. 2:77).                                                                               to,

                     By   THOMAS H. BLAKESLEY,                M.A."
IN Society
  .
   bringing my views on Transformers before the Physical
           it is my        emphasize:–
                                 desire to
   (1) How the magnetic lag, if it exist, may be measured by
employing dynamometers of low resistance.
  §(2) That the magnetic lag has a real existence.
       That the magnetic lag necessarily accompanies an
absorption of work involved in the reversal of polarity in the
iron, and how this may be measured.
   (4) The points in the general argument where scientific
facts are wanting, and the direction which investigation should
take to meet this want.
   The possibility of the existence of a magnetic lag renders
the problem a different one from that of two coils acting and
reacting upon themselves by means of mutual and self
induction, whose coefficients,     being geometrical, are con
stant.
                                        I
    For the latter problem gave in the year 1885 a complete
                     I
solution, but pointed out that the completeness of the result
rested upon the absence of anything in the nature of hysteresis
(a word not then in use) or work done in the field.
    The following year Mr. George Forbes, F.R.S., gave what
should have been (but for the very poor reporting of the
Society of Arts' Journal) a solution of the “secondary gene
rator” problem, treating it as a case of two coils, assuming
that “the magnetism of the core varies as the sum of the cur
rents in the two coils;” and the same gentleman has treated the
subject again in a recent paper before the Society of Telegraph
Engineers and Electricians, in which he makes the same
assumption, and says, referring to the harmonic functions
                                                         iº.
 which he attributes to the electrical and magnetic quantities
involved, that the existence of magnetic hysteresis would
 cause departure from the harmonic                but that, being
 insignificant so long as the magnetic induction in the iron is
 not high,     its
               consideration may                    be
                                      omitted statements which;
 seem rather     evade than
                     to         overcome the difficulty.
                                          to
    Mr. Gisbert  Kapp,  who has done     much good work  so    the      in
practical development        transformers, also,
                                   of                my opinion,   in
makes the same assumption, that the state        magnetizationof             in
the core coincides with the     magnetic   stress resulting from
compounding the stresses derived from the two coils.

        In    the view          I shall    put forward           I shall       assume         —
    §
    1) That the variations are harmonic.
        That the only induction in the secondary coil is derived
from the core, and is therefore, as regards phase, in quadrature
with the magnetization. As the current in the secondary coil
will be considered as producing one of the components of the
stress producing magnetization, itself reacting upon the coil,
the necessity of introducing a special E.M.F. of self-induction
is obviated.
  (3) That each turn in either coil embraces the same number
of magnetic lines.

force. Just as when a body moving in a medium does work
in the medium, it does so by calling into being, or inducing,
a force, viz. friction; force being that sort of magnitude which
acting upon a body produces motion.
   By analogy alone, therefore, we may infer that when
changing magnetization is a continuous source of absorbed
work, the changing magnetization induces what would itself
produce magnetization, that is an induced stress acting in
oppºsition to the direction of the change in the magnetization.
   This may perhaps be allowed; but it may be urged that
there is plenty of magnetic stress already, impressed by the
 currents; why should not the changing magnetization work
on this? The answer to this objection is that if there be no
other stress but that impressed from outside, then the phase
of the magnetization will be in the same phase, and therefore
the increase of magnetication will be in quadrature with the
stress, and hence no work will be continuously absorbed.    For
*
though through some phases work may be done in such a
case, this is always recoverable and recovered in a complete
period; a proposition which I have stated and proved in my
         upon Alternating Currents in 1885.
      apprehend, therefore, that besides the stresses AB BC
we have another induced stress in quadrature with the mag
netization, because called into being by                  its

potentials" has an E.M.F. equal and opposite to E.        shall                         I
assume that E is always the same so long as we keep to the
same substances and the same temperature ; and also that
when electric equilibrium has been established each con
ductor is at a uniform potential throughout, except very near
the junction, and that there the potential changes in general
by a finite amount as we pass through a layer of very small
but finite thickness, which includes the surface of separation.

of  variable potential.    Here the distribution evidently depends
upon the thickness           the layer, the law

potential across the layer, and the specific inductive capacity
of               B. This last quantity       evidently the true

finite specific inductive capacity, and not the apparent
infinite specific inductive capacity which conductors appear
to  have    in ordinary electrostatic experiments;        for       the                 in
latter case the electric potential energy             the layer CD  of
would be infinite.

     Hence,      if
              in order to establish the difference of potentials
P between A and B, the quantity M of electricity must cross
the junction, the work done by the E.M.F. E. during the
operation is E.M., half this work being spent in producing
the Joule effect, and half in raising the electrostatic potential
energy of the system.
   But the E.M.F. E is due to molecular action in the
immediate neighbourhood of the junction, and, therefore,
when the E.M.F. E does work by causing a displacement of
electricity, a corresponding amount of molecular energy is
absorbed        at    the   junction.
    Now, E being finite, suppose that the surface of contact at
 the junction C (fig. 2) is very small, and that the electro
 static capacities of the conductors are very great. Then M
 will be very great, and so will E.M. In fact, keeping the
junction as small as we please, we may increase EM in
 definitely by increasing the electrostatic capacity of the
system.
     But, by hypothesis, the E.M.F. E will always be maintained
so    long as we keep to the same substances, and maintain
them at the same constant temperature.
   Hence, when the E.M.F. E does work, the molecular
energy absorbed is of such a nature that it can be supplied
in indefinite amount by a small finite junction maintained at
a constant temperature.
   There are only two kinds of energy which fulfil this con
dition: —(1) Heat; (2) Chemical action at the junction.
   First, suppose that the conductors A and B (fig. 2) are                         in
capable of acting chemically upon one another.            Then for
every quantity d’M of electricity which crosses the junction in
the direction of the E.M.F.                  E.,
                                   this E.M.F. does work Ed                            M,
and    anequivalent amount       heat       of
                                        absorbed     the junction.
                                                      is          at
And, conversely,      electricity dM cross the junction
                             if                                 the          in
opposite direction, work will       done against those molecular

   Hence, the true contact E.M.F. between two chemically
inactice conductors      equal     their coefficient
                                  is         to         the Peltierof
effect expressed            in   absolute measure.
     An argument sometimes                 advanced against this proposition
is substantially             as   follows   (Iquote from Professor Lodge's
paper     the Phil.               Mag. for April 1885,      p.

                                                                 up

circuit containing an electromotive junction, V'—Wis produced
by and is equal to E. Hence, at an electromotive junction
no work need be done by a current; in other words, the
existence or non-existence of a Peltier effect has nothing to
do with the existence or non-existence of a local E.M.F.” "
   But although on an open circuit, there are two equal and
opposite E.M.F.'s at the junction, and consequently there is
no resistance to the flow of electricity in either direction,
still the E.M.F. which acts in the direction of the flow will
do work upon the opposing                        E.M.F.
     A mechanical     example may make this clearer.             a particle            If
be acted     upon   by  two  equal   and  opposite   forces,  each of one
dyne, the smallest possible force will be able to displace the
particle in any direction ; but if the particle be displaced one
centimetre in the direction of one of the dyne-forces, this
force will do just one erg of work upon the other force.
    Now, at the junction between two chemically inactive con
ductors, the two E.M.F.'s are (1) an E.M.F. E due to a
tendency to absorption of heat-energy at the junction, and
transformation of the absorbed energy into electrical energy
by displacement of electricity across the junction, and (2) an
E.M.F. P. (= —E) due to difference of potentials between
the conductors.
    Hence, if electricity M cross the junction in the direction
of the E.M.F.                   E.,

   Professor Lodge considers that the E.M.F. between chemi
cally active substances is due to a tendency to chemical action.
But mere tendency to chemical action at a finite junction
could not be the source of an indefinite amount of energy,
and could not, therefore, account for the phenomena in the
case discussed above.        There must be actual chemical action.
It appears in fact (excluding             idea                all

energy being furnished by the partial satisfaction of the said
affinity.   The method further assumes that when the metals
are fused together it is this same affinity which, being satisfied
as completely as possible, gives rise to an evolution of heat.
But if (as appears from what precedes) the energy required
to produce the difference of potentials is supplied by absorp
tion of heat at the junction, and if the contact E.M.F. is due
to a tendency to convert heat-energy into electrical energy,
then the heat evolved on fusing the metals together can have
no direct connexion with E.M.F.'s of contact, and the method
would not apply to the case of two metals.
   It would, however, obviously apply where the E.M.F. was
due to chemical affinity, as in the case of zinc and oxygen
  roposed by Professor Lodge (Phil. Mag. May 1885, p. 363).

view is the more correct,         I
                            have made a few experiments on
the electrification of glass and ebonite when dipped into
mercury.     This method of experimenting             to offer
several  advantages.  The  mercury   being  permanently  con
nected to earth was always at a known potential (zero), and
it was only necessary to measure the charge of the ebonite
or glass. Then, again, contact was obtained over the whole
surface submerged, with very little mechanical violence when
desired ; and the conditions of contact could be considerably
varied by using more or less suddenness and violence and
longer or shorter duration of contact.
                                      Fig.   4.
   The ebonite or glass employed consisted of a small circular
slab S (fig. 4) with a convex surface A, which was attached
to one end of a rod BC of the same material. This rod was
encased in a brass tube DE, inside which it was fastened by
means of packing FG.      The length BF of ebonite or glass
served to insulate the slab A.   In the case of the glass the
length BF was varnished. The charge on A was measured
by means of the conductor L connected to a Thomson elec
trometer. A was placed near to L, which was put to earth
and then insulated.    On withdrawing A, a deflection was
produced proportional to the charge on A. The movement
of A was controlled by making the tube DE slide in metal
bearings between fixed stops. The tube DE being of metal,
no electrification was produced by friction in the bearings.
The following results were obtained:—

    The above results, it will be seen, are very irregular, owing
no doubt to the fact that all the circumstances of contact
could not be accurately known.              These irregularities, and
especially the variable sign of the electrification, make it clear
that the effects are not due to a true and definite contact
E.M.F., but      are dependent in some degree on the manner in
which the surfaces are brought together and separated.              The
experiment of Canton in 1753 (where the rough and polished
parts of a glass tube became oppositely electrified when
rubbed with the same cloth) seems to point in the same
direction.
    Professors Ayrton, Schuster, S. P. Thompson, and           J. Perry
discussed the     points raised, and it was considered that direct
experiment on contact electromotive force in a very perfect
vacuum could alone decide the question.
    This experiment seems almost as impracticable as a direct
measurement of the size of a molecule. Yet the two ques
tions may be equally capable of solution by inductive reason
ing. The question is whether the reasoning given above is or
is not conclusive.—C. W. B.

     HE    existence, amongst thermochemical data, of certain
       quantities which are constant, or nearly constant, cannot
be denied.
   We have in the first instance the fact that the heat of
neutralization is in the majority of cases independent of the
nature of the acid and the alkali concerned ; and a simple
explanation of this may be found, as           I  have shown (Chem.
Soc. Trans. 1887, p. 593), in the complete saturation of the

 residual affinity of one of the radicals in the molecules con
cerned by the excess of water used to dissolve them. When,
again, metals are acted on by excess of water (or of weak
hydrochloric acid), the heat evolved, though not an absolutely
constant quantity, is approximately so in many cases, espe
cially when the cases taken refer to metals belonging to the
same group.      The chemical reactions involved are of a pre
cisely similar nature in each case; and the small differences
which exist are easily accounted for by the differences in the
constitution of the metallic molecules themselves.
   The heat of formation of any given metallic salt in solution
is calculated from the heat evolved in reacting on the metal
with water, the heat of neutralization, and the heat of forma
tion of the acid and water; thus

    There is not one of these sets of quantities (except perhaps
the actions of chlorine on potash, 13, and the formation of the
haloid acids, 10) in which the actions compared are so simple
or so strictly analogous, that we might reasonably expect the
sum total to be made up of the same constants.
    In some cases, indeed, it is apparent that Thomsen has been
led astray by his eagerness to discover the existence of simple
relations. Thus, in the case of 11, what possible meaning can
be attached to quantities obtained by subtracting the heat of
formation of aqueous solutions of the haloid acids from that of
   * In this and the following case Thomsen inserts two other quantities
which are multiples of the same constants, but they are in reality (as he
shows) dependent on those given here.
   I have not inserted the case of marsh-gas and carbon tetrachloride, the
heat of formation of which is nearly the same; this is a constant of a
different character and presents no difficulties.

the corresponding solid ammonium salt? This same case is
also an instance of an entirely fictitious constant; from the
fact that, in calculating the value of N, H., Cl, the quantity
H, Cl, aq. is involved, and also that the heat of neutralization
of ammonia by the three haloid acids is identical, it follows,
as Thomsen himself clearly shows, that each of the differences
N, H., Cl–H, Cl, aq. is made up of w—A, where a is the same
quantity in each case, and A is the heat of dissolution of the
ammonium salt concerned.        So that the constancy depends
entirely on the three values for A being nearly equal (which
we might well expect to be the case); these values are 3,880,
4,380, and 3,550 respectively, showing a variation of as much
as 800 cal., which amounts to 20 per cent. of the whole, but,
 when imported into the large quantity of 36,000 cal., appears
as little more than 2 per cent.
    There are other points which must raise suspicion as to the
 reality of these constants.    Why, for instance, amongst the
 many acids containing sulphur, should dithionic and tetra
 thionic acids alone show numerical relations?      Why should
                                            º
 P.O., As2O5, and As2O3 form a group to the exclusion of
 P;Os? Then, again, there may           found other quantities
 where there is as evident a numerical relationship as in many
 of those quoted by Thomsen, but in which this relationship is
 evidently accidental; thus, immediately opposite the page on
 which No. 4 is given, we find
                            SO;", aq. = 7,700,
                            SO", aq. = 1,500,

although the difference between the first and second quan
tities is due to purely physical causes, and the other differences
to chemical, or combined physical and chemical causes. Again,
it may be observed that the numerical relations are in many
cases scarcely of a very simple character, such fractions as #,
 of ºr,       occurring    and, moreover, that the error
      and  º,               ;                                  often

proportion to the actual experimental errors: similar errors,
amounting to 1,000 to 3,000 cal., could be mentioned in several
of the other cases.
    These last observations give, in fact, as       believe, the clue           I
to an   explanation  of these   supposed   constants.    By taking a
sufficiently high fraction and allowing a sufficiently wide
margin for “error,” it is obviously possible to represent any
two numbers whatever as multiples of the same constant.
The whole question, therefore, resolves itself into one of
probabilities.
    Thus in No. 1 the difference between the two quantities is
68,810 cal., and the error which the first of them shows as
compared with the second is (111,590–(3 x 36,880)=) 1,150
cal. ; while the error which the second shows as compared
with the first is (5 x 37,197—184,400 =) 1,585 cal., or a total
error of 2,735 cal. is made allowable. Now it is obvious that
if the error allowed had been as great as the difference
between the two values (184,400 and 111,590), every quantity
between these two numbers would have been regarded as
thus related. As it                      is,
                            however, only 2,735 out        68,810,                       of         or

                                 such quantities amongst the data
for  sulphur.
    Thus       these four cases there are two
                 in                                   which the data            in

cidences were a matter of mere chance, whereas in the other
two they are only ; and as numerous as they should be :
but it must be remembered that we are only taking the actual
data expressed in a limited number of ways, such as Thomsen
happened to have selected, and that these same data might
be expressed in numerous other ways, giving us a much
longer list of numbers.
    gi.       Nos. 5 and 6, where the quantities are equal, the
fallacy of their connexion may be well shown thus:—The
two quantities in No. 5 are selected from the two pages (403,
404) on which the sulphur data exist: can we find numerical
equality as striking by taking any other two pages of data ?
Taking p. 402, which contains iodine data, and p. 403, which
contains sulphur data, we find             :-
           K, I, Os (cryst.     salt)    .   .   . . . = 124,490,

          H, I, Os, aq. (heat of form. and dissol.) = 55,800.
 Four instances of approximate numerical equality between
 quantities representing reactions which are altogether dis
similar.
     Nos. 7, 8 and 9 refer to the formation of metallic com
 pounds : they are the only ones of this nature quoted by
 Thomsen, and bear but a very small proportion indeed to the
 hundreds of values for metallic compounds given in vol. iii."
     Of those cases which deal with differences between the heat
 of formation of similar compounds, Nos. 11 and 12 have already
 been discussed, and it is only necessary to point out further
 that these three instances form but a minute fraction of the
    * The heat of formation of the oxides of iron is partially dependent
 on that of the chlorides and on the heat of neutralization of the respective
 oxides by hydrochloric acid.        It is possible that there is an error of
 4,000 cal. or more in the determination of Fe2O3H,0,6HCl (vol. i. p. 410);
 since the difference between this quantity and the heat of neutralization
 of the same oxide by sulphuric acid is smaller by this amount than in
 any other known case. .     It is more probable, however, that the error is in
 the heat of neutralization by sulphuric acid, for the indirect determina
 tions of it involved in the precipitation of iron sulphate by a barium salt
 (pp. 416, 417) give similarly anomalous numbers.         Some recent deter
 minations of these latter quantities (Fay, Chem. News, lvii. p. 36, and
Pickering, ibid. lvii. p. 76) tend to show that this anomaly does not always
 exist with iron sulphate. It may have been due to the presence of
 colloidal ferric oxide in the solution.

almost infinite number of groups of compounds which might
be constructed out   of the 300 quantities given in Thomsen's
2nd volume.      Similarly, also, the number of comparable reac
tions (Class C) which     might   be collected in the same field
would certainly afford sufficient chances for the existence of
the two coincidences shown in Nos. 13 and 14.

    The “perfect analogy” of these various reactions, even
when we confine ourselves to the members of each separate
group, is certainly of a somewhat questionable character, and,
in my opinion, cannot be regarded as existing in even the
most superficial sense; and where an analogy does exist, as in
the formation of the six sulphates, we might expect the heat to
be the same in every case, but can attach no meaning what
ever to     itsbeing     multiple
                            a           some constant; nor can we

understand why certain other perfectly analogous reactions

been led        to
               do.
     In our original investigation         the subject we considered

                         in
at  was    adifferential winding         the field-magnet.

being constant current, our original equations could                                                                  be
differently interpreted, and that the demagnetizing series
could      be
            dispensed with.     Consequently        motor for constant   a

   We shall for the general consideration       the problem use               of
the simplest equations for    motor,  disregarding

the shunt-coil of the field-magnet.        Hence the field-magnet
would be    weakened,     which would cause the motor to go more
slowly, and so on until it stopped and possibly reversed.         This
objection is a curious one, because exactly the same apparent
difficulty might have been stated by the author of this treatise
when he was dealing with our method of governing motors
to run at a constant P.D. a few pages earlier.            Here, how
 ever, he sees the explanation of the difficulty, and he points
 out quite correctly that, although it might at first sight appear
 anomalous to say that, in order to keep a motor running at a
 fixed speed, it is necessary to weaken the field of the motor
 when the load on it is increased, the explanation is found in
 the fact that the power depends not     hºl,      on the strength of
 the field but on   i.   current passing through   the armature, and
 that this latter is much increased when the field is weakened.
 Hence, on the whole, it is quite right to arrange matters so
 that the field is weakened when the load is increased. We
 say it is curious then, that while the author has explained the
 apparent difficulty so clearly when he was dealing with our
 method for governing motors when the supply condition was
 a constant P.D., he does not see that exactly the same explana
 tion clears away the difficulty which he has himself raised
                                                    .
 regarding our method for governing motors to run when
 supplied with constant current.
       hat, however, we particularly wish to point out in this
 short note is that when the condition of supply is constant
 current it is not necessary to have a series demagnetizing-coil
at all, and consequently the motor can be                  to run at
 constant speed independently of the load, and in addition to
 work with high efficiency.
    We will first see whether such a solution is possible when
 the condition of supply is constant P.D. Let the motor be a
 simple shunt-motor; then, if as before E be the back F.M.F., n
 the speed, p a term depending on the permanent magnetism,
and Z the current round the shunt,

If n is to be constant as well as V, the left-hand side of the
equation is constant, whereas the right-hand side varies with
A the current through the armature, which must alter as the
power given out by the motor alters. One solution for
making this equation always true independent of the value of
A is the well-known one of making a very small. When,
however, a is not very small, and we have shown in detail
elsewhere why we consider it a mistake to make the resistance
of the armature as small in a motor as in a dynamo, equation
(10) cannot be fulfilled for constant values of n and V, and
a variable value of       A;
                        and in order that the equation may be
made true a negative term proportional to A must be intro
duced on the left-hand side. The simplest way of doing this
is to add a series demagnetizing-coil.  Then (9) becomes

But as this is negative it is necessary, in order that the shunt

but, by hypothesis, not the residual magnetism, otherwise p

magnet and rotating armature together form a brake-dynamo
while the           and the armature will form the motor.
But this is simply    one of the solutions (a theoretical one of
course and not a practical one) given by us on page 310 of
our original paper and illustrated in figure 10 on that page.
  The fact, however, still remains that in the case of the
supply condition being constant current, equation (11) can
be satisfied without the employment of a series demagnetizing
coil; and all that we have to do to in order to make the solution
a practical one, that is to enable an ordinary field-magnet with
soft iron core to be employed, is to alter the equation so that
when the speed equation (12) is satisfied (11) leads to a
positive value of the current.     This result may be obtained
by adding to the right-hand side of equation (11), a positive
constant term e numerically larger than mp, for in that case, if

    The net result    of this paper is that Haecker's (and Ber
noulli's) formula is merely another way of saying that the
lifting-power of magnets in which the intensity of the mag
netic induction has been carried up to an equal degree, is
proportional to the polar surface. And Haecker's coefficient
is proportional to B* through that surface.

Watts's    Dictionary of Chemistry, revised and entirely rewritten
   By H. FostER MoRLEY, M.A., D.Sc., and M. M. PATTIson
   MUIR, M.A., assisted by eminent Contributors. In Four Volumes.
   Vol. I. Longmans, Green, & Co., 1888.
         standard work of reference in the English language used by
THE   chemists in this country and America is the well known
“Dictionary of Chemistry and the allied branches of other Sciences’
bearing the name of the late Mr. Henry Watts as author.          But
this work was commenced more than a quarter of a century ago,
and was only completed in 1881.         During that period the rapid
advancement of chemical science made it necessary to issue four
supplementary volumes containing altogether between four and
five thousand pages of additional matter.     So rapid is the growth
of the science, however, owing to the continuous increase in the
number of workers, that an interval of seven years is sufficient to
make even the last “Supplement” require further supplementing;
and the late Mr. Watts had undertaken to revise the whole work
and bring out a new and more condensed edition, representing the
present state of chemical science, when his labours were cut short
by death. The lamented author had only gone so far as to pre
pare a code of “Instructions” for the use of contributors, and had
written some sixty odd pages of the new edition at the time of his
decease.    The completion of the work has been entrusted to Dr.
H. Foster Morley and Mr. Pattison Muir, who have utilized Mr.
Watts's materials as far as they go, but who have of course been
obliged to supply the greater part of the matter which fills the
pages of the present work.
    The chief difference in form between the old edition and the
new one, of which the first volume is before us, is the greater
condensation which the publishers have insisted upon in the present
issue. Instead of the nine thick volumes which chemists have been
so long in the habit of consulting, the new edition is to be com
pressed into four volumes of about 750 pages each.      Whether this
condensation can be effected without serious injury to the Dic
tionary will depend entirely upon the skill and judgment which
the compilers exercise in carrying on the work: it must be confessed
that as far as the present volume is concerned there is no complaint
to be made on this score. The 752 pages of the first volume are
as replete with well organized information as could be desired by
the most rapid of readers.      There can be no doubt that much of

   74                   Notices respecting New Books.
   the older edition was unnecessarily lengthy and that many of the
   articles were out of place in a dictionary of pure chemistry, so that
   there has here been ample scope for condensation.                  On the
   other hand, when we consider that the subject of organic chemistry
   as treated in Beilstein's        Handbuch, the most perfect type of
   compressed information at present at the disposal of chemists,
   requires three large volumes of the most closely printed matter, it
   is difficult to see how the compilers are going to treat of the whole
   º
   of the science in the prescribed limits.      But we must not anticipate
   difficulties since the   present   notice refers only to the first volume,
  and in this Messrs.      Morley   and Muir have certainly shown their
             to perform   the  literary  feat which has been demanded of
  them.
      The first volume of the Dictionary, which we are glad to see is
  still to retain the name of the late author of the first edition, takes
  us as far as the letter C, the concluding article being on Chemical
  Action. The work of editing has been facilitated by each editor
  taking charge of one of the two great divisions of the science, Mr.
  Muir being responsible for the inorganic and general chemistry, and
  Dr. Morley for the organic portion of the subject. This division
  of labour was no doubt necessitated by purely practical considera
  tions,    since the unavoidable tendency to specialization among
  modern workers has arisen from the enormous multiplication of
 facts, which renders it more and more hopeless for a chemist to
 become an adept in both departments of his science in the present
 state of its development.        While conceding the practical necessity
 for this division of our science into organic and inorganic, we only
 do so with the understanding that there are not two chemistries,
 but that the compounds of the one particular element carbon,
 having been studied in greater detail than those of any other
 element, and the number of these compounds being practically un
 limited, the mere wealth of material in this department of knowledge
 claims all the faculties of the chemist who devotes himself to its
 study.      This multiplicity of carbon compounds is of course nothing
more than an accident contingent upon the nature of the atom of
the element on the one hand and of our present methods of
investigation on the other.         With the development of the science
and the      consequent  perfection   of our methods of research, we may
 expect to see the chemical histories of other elements developed
into a state of complexity comparable with that of carbon, and the
“organic” chemist of the future may be rivalled as a specialist by
his brother worker on the compounds, say, of silicon, or of any
other element to which new methods of investigation may be
applied.
     Among the features of the new edition to which attention must
be called are the special articles contributed by various writers, many
of whom are recognized authorities on the subjects of which they
treat.      Nineteen such contributors, including the late Mr. Watts,
figure in the present volume. Taking these in the order given in
the list at the commencement of the work, we have articles on

                   Notices respecting New Books.                   75
Cellulose by Mr. C. F. Cross, on Analysis by Prof. Dittmar, on
Diazo-Compounds       by Mr. A. G. Green, on Chemical Change by
Dr. J.   Hood,  on Blood by Dr. Halliburton, on Benzil and allied
subjects by Dr. Japp, on Bacteria by Prof. Ray Lankester, on
Allotropy by Prof. Lothar Meyer, on Azo-Colouring Matters by
Prof. Meldola, on Affinity by Prof. Ostwald, on Amylamines by
Dr. Plimpton, on Acids and Alloys by Prof. Ramsay, on Arabic
acid &c. by Mr. C. O'Sullivan, on the detection and estimation of
Poisonous Alkaloids by Dr. Stevenson, on States of Aggregation by
Prof. J. J.  Thomson, on Atmosphere by Prof. T. E. Thorpe, on the
Ash of    Organic  bodies by Mr. Warington, and on Caoutchouc by
Mr. C.   J.Wilson. A portion of the article on Alcohols and many
minor articles are by the late Mr. Watts.
   It would be invidious to make any lengthy comments on these
special articles, but we cannot refrain from expressing satisfaction
at the co-operation of Continental chemists which the editors have
secured. We allude more especially to the valuable contributions
of Profs. Ostwald and Lothar Meyer. The article on Bacteria by
Prof. Lankester is an interesting example of the encroachment
of Biology into the domain of Chemistry, and serves well to illustrate
the mutual advantage arising from the contact of different branches
of science. The same principle is seen with respect to Chemistry
and Physics in the articles on Allotropy, Affinity, and States of
Aggregation ; but the interdependence of these two branches of
science is too well known to need insisting upon here. Perhaps
one of the most remarkable signs of the activity of research in a
special group of products is seen in the articles on Azo- and Diazo
Compounds, which together fill over 36 pages.            Some lengthy
articles which  fully  merit the title of  “special” are written by the
editors, such for instance as Mr. Muir's very useful contribution
on “Atomic and Molecular Weights,” which covers about 25
  à.
pagreS.
         important difference between the present and the older
edition is the printing of the pages in double columns, an innova
tion in which we must confess we fail to see any advantage from
the reader's point of view. Another innovation is the use of large
thick capitals for the words heading each article, and this is a
decided improvement, as on running down the columns the eye at
once catches the heading sought.       Whilst on the subject of print
we should like to  express  dissent from the plan of inserting hyphens
into the names of    compounds    with the lavish profusion which the
editors have    adopted.     Opening    the volume at random we find
such words as “Tetra-amido-iso-di-naphthyl " (p. 169), “wa-Di
bromo-wo-di-nitro-ethyl-benzene”       (p. 591), and so on throughout.
 Our chemical names are       surely sufficiently long as it is without
 spreading them out into what an American humourist calls an
alphabetical panorama.         We fully admit that the subject of
chemical nomenclature is a very difficult one to deal with in a
thoroughly systematic manner, and we protest equally against the
 Continental custom of fusing up    all   the component syllables into

76                            Notices respecting New Books.
one immense word.       Thus in the number of the Berichte just
to hand we find a paper on the condensation of “Tetramethyl
phenylamidocrotonsäureester.”     In the present state of nomencla
ture some   compromise   between these two extremes seems the most
practicable way of dealing with complex names.
   The relative complexity of the two main divisions of Chemistry
is well seen in the introductory explanations which each editor
contributes to his own branch.     Mr. Muir finds less than a page
sufficient to enable those who consult the Dictionary to understand
the plan of the articles on Inorganic and general Chemistry, while
Dr. Morley       has had to contribute an introduction                     to the articles on
Organic Chemistry of seven pages in length. This last introduction
is based on the code of instructions drawn up by the late Mr.
Watts for the use of the abstractors for the Chemical Society's
Journal, and will be found of the greatest use, nay, absolutely
indispensable before the scheme of the organic portion of the work
can become thoroughly familiar to those who use it for reference.
The plan laid down in these instructions has been fairly well
adhered to; but we must express regret that Dr. Morley has not
made use of his present opportunity of helping to some extent the
systematizing of our nomenclature by entirely sweeping away such
trivial names as resorcin, pyrocatechin, and hydroquinone, which
are   all
        distinctly phenolic substances.

   By numerous experiments made with different instruments (fog
horn, organ-pipes, &c.), we have ascertained that the height of the
sound has no influence on the velocity of propagation of the wave.

  The movement of the wave is independent of the vibrations
which it carries along—Comptes Rendus, April 3, 1888.
 ON THE ELECTRIFICATION OF METAL PLATES BY IRRADIATION
    WITH ELECTRICAL LIGHT. BY WILLIAM HALLWACHS.
    At the close of an article recently published       had mentioned              “I
that, to judge from preliminary experiments, metal plates become
electrostatically   charged when irradiated       with the electrical
light.  It   could be seen from the outset that we were not dealing
here with charges at potentials that could be measured by a gold
leaf electroscope.    In order to ascertain whether a charge measur
able with sensitive electrometers could not be obtained, the final
experiments were made as follows :-The circular metal plate,
8 centim. in diameter, to be illuminated was suspended by an
insulated wire in the centre of a cylindrical sheet-iron vessel,
50 centim. in length and 37 centim. in diameter, which lay with
its axis horizontal.    The surface of the metal plate was coated with
rust, but one portion of the surface was brightly polished and was
put to earth. The wire by which the plate was suspended passed
 through, but insulated from, an earth-connected brass tube, to a
Hankel's electrometer, which was chosen for these experiments on
account of   its small capacity.      the In               lid

                    THE BENECKE PRIZE IN PHILOSOPHY.
    The Philosophical Faculty of the University of Göttingen pro
pounds the following as the subject for the year 1891:—
    In the last decades the fundamental importance of the law of
entropy for the theory of all those physical and chemical pheno
mena, which are attended with a production or absorption of heat,
has acquired greater prominence.          And more especially in those
essays on the law of energy which competed for the Benecke prize
in 1884, has it appeared that the law of entropy is necessary for
the completion of the law of energy.          Simultaneously with this,
the researches which have had for their object the establishment of
the law of entropy on the basis of general mechanical principles,
have in recent times made important progress.           A comprehensive
treatment of all questions which are connected with the law of entropy
appears therefore particularly desirable at the present time.
    Such a treatment should in the first place give the development
of the law of entropy, in connexion with a thorough restatement
and justification of Carnot's researches; it would then have to dis
cuss, not only historically but also critically, the investigations in
reference to the connexion of the law of entropy with the general
principles of mechanics; it should finally contain a comprehensive
           of all
report on       the applications which the law       energy has found      of                in
the theory       physical and chemical processes.

XII.   The Function of Osmotic Pressure in the Analogy between
     Solutions and Gases.       By Professor    J.  van’T HoFF".
      URING    an investigation which required some knowledge
       of the laws regulating chemical equilibrium in solutions,
the conclusion has gradually been evolved that a deep analogy
—indeed almost an identity—exists between dilute solutions
exerting osmotic pressure on the one hand, and gases under
ordinary atmospheric pressure on the other. The following
pages contain an attempt to explain this analogy; and the
physical properties of such systems will form the first subject
of discussion.
   I.  Osmotic  Pressure—the nature of      the  Analogy due to this
                                                      -
                              conception.
   In order clearly to realize the quantity referred to as osmotic
pressure, imagine a vessel, A (fig. 1), com-                Fig. 1.
pletely full of an aqueous solution of sugar,
placed in water, B.     If it be conceived that
                                                           &
the solid walls of this vessel are permeable
to water, but impermeable to the dissolved
sugar, then, owing to the attraction of the
solution for water, water will enter the
vessel A up to a certain limit, thereby        in
creasing the pressure on the walls of the vessel.          Equilibrium
then ensues, owing to the pressure resisting further entry of
water. This pressure we have termed osmotic pressure.

82          J.   van't Hoff on               the   Function of Osmotic Pressure
     Itis evident that this state of
equilibrium might have been at
tained in A without entry of
water if the vessel had been con
structed with a piston, compress
ing the solution with a pressure
equal to the osmotic pressure
(fig. 2).      It follows moreover
that, by increasing or diminishing the pressure on the piston,
the state of concentration of the liquid can also be altered,
owing to the passage of water through the walls of the vessel
in an outward or inward direction.
    Such osmotic pressure has been experimentally investigated
by Pfeffer (Osmotische Untersuchungen, Leipsig, 1887). The
walls of the cell consisted of unglazed porcelain, rendered
impermeable to sugar though not to water, by filling it with
a solution of potassium ferrocyanide and placing it in a solu
tion of copper sulphate. Owing to diffusion, the ferrocyanide
and the copper-salt come in contact after some time, and pro
duce a membrane of copper ferrocyanide having the required
properties.      Such a vessel is then filled with a one-per-cent.
solution of sugar; it is then closed with a cork provided with
a manometer, and sunk in water ; the osmotic pressure gra
dually rises, owing to entry of water, and the pressure due to
the entry of water is read off when it becomes constant. As
an example of the results obtained, it may be mentioned that
a one-per-cent. solution of sugar (which, owing to                      con                     its
 siderable mass, was not appreciably diluted            entry       water) of on

   The great practical advantage arising from this method of
regarding the behaviour of solutions, which leads at once to
quantitative conclusions, consists in the fact that the applica
tion of the second law of thermodynamics to liquids is rendered
exceedingly easy; for reversible processes, of which this law
treats, can now be very simply conceived. It has already
been mentioned that a piston and cylinder with semipermeable
walls, placed in the solvent, permits of alteration of concen
tration of the solution contained therein, by alteration of the
pressure on the piston, in exactly the same way as a gas can
be rarefied or compressed; except that in the former case it
is the solvent which escapes through the semipermeable walls
on increase of pressure. Processes of this kind can always be
made reversible, if care be taken that the pressure on the
                                                                                    is,

   Comparison of Osmotic Pressures by Physiological Methods.
—Observations of de Vries (“Eine Methode zur Analyse der
Turgorkraft,” Pringsheim's Jahrb. xiv.) show that equal
changes of concentration of solutions of sugar, and of potas
sium sulphate and nitrate, exercise equal influence on the
osmotic pressure.    This osmotic pressure was compared, by
physiological methods, with that of the contents of a plant
cell ; the protoplasmal envelope contracts when it is immersed
in solutions possessing great attraction for water. By a
systematic comparison of the three bodies mentioned, using
the same cells, three isotonic liquids (i.e. liquids exhibiting
the same osmotic pressure) were obtained.        Cells of a differ

constant, is not so manifest. Yet proof can be furnished from
thermodynamical considerations; and experimental data exist
which are highly favourable to the results predicted on

   Theoretical Proof–It has been already mentioned that, by
means of a piston and a cylinder with semipermeable walls,
reversible processes can be conceived to occur. If such pro
cesses are expressed in the way common as regards gases,
volume and pressures are indicated on the lines ÖV and O B
(fig. 3); but pressure in this case,            ---

constant by introduction of the requisite amount of heat. This
amount of heat can be at once determined, inasmuch as it is
equivalent to the external work performed, PdV, by the
motion of the piston. Internal work is absent, for the dilu

        IV.   Avogadro's Law applied to Dilute Solutions.
    We have considered the changes produced in the osmotic
pressure of solutions by alteration of temperature and con
centration, and attempted to exhibit the analogy between
dilute solutions and gases, in relation to these two quantities
It now remains to compare directly the two analogous quan
tities, gaseous pressure and osmotic pressure, in one and the
same body.       It is obvious that this analogy should hold with
        in solution ; and in actual fact it will be shown that, if
#. enry's law be taken into consideration, the osmotic pressure
in solution is absolutely equal to the gaseous pressure, under
similar conditions of temperature and concentration.
    To prove this statement, we shall picture a reversible pro
cess by aid of semipermeable diaphragms, temperature being
maintained constant; and we shall again make use of the
second law of thermodynamics, which in this case leads to the
simple result that no work is transformed into heat, nor heat
into work; and hence the sum of all work done at different
stages of the process is zero.
    This reversible process may be conceived by means of two
similar cylinders and pistons, like those already described.
 One contains a gas (A), say oxygen, and in contact with it a
saturated aqueous solution of oxygen (B) (fig. 4). The wall b c
                                                     Fig. 4.
allows only oxygen to pass, but
 no water; the wall a b, on the
 other hand, water, but notoxygen;
and it is in contact with water, E.
 A reversible process may be car
 ried out by such an arrangement
 as follows:—By raising the two
 pistons (1) and (2), oxygen is
                        a its
 evolved from           aqueous solution       gas, while the water
                                                           as
                          this change can proceed without altering
                            is of b;

 the concentration        the solution. The only difference between
 the two cylinders            the statein             of

 tions which   they    contain;    we may  explain  the action thus:–

 90      J.  van't Hoff on the Function of Osmotic Pressure
     V. General Expression for Boyle's, Gay-Lussac's, and
            Avogadro's Laws for Solutions and Gases,
    The well-known formula expressing both Boyle's and         Gay
 Lussac’s laws for gases,
                            PV=RT,
 are, in so far as these laws are applicable to liquids, also appli
cable as regards osmotic pressure; with the reservation, also
 made in the case of gases, that the space occupied by the
molecules must be so great that the actual volume of the
 molecules becomes negligible.
    To include Avogadro's law in the above expression, Horst
 mann's suggestion (Berl. Ber. xiv. p. 1243) may be adopted,
 to express the molecular weight of the substance in kilograms;
taking 2 kilos. of hydrogen, 44 kilos. of carbon dioxide, and
so on.    Then R in the above equation has always the same
value; for, under equal conditions of temperature and pres
 sure, these weights occupy the same volume. Calculating
this value, and expressing the volume in cubic metres, and the
pressure in kilograms per square metre, and choosing hydrogen
gas at 0° and 760 millim. pressure as starting-point, then
       P=10333;      VT
                             2

                                      T=273;-        -
                                                   R=845-05.
                                                            -
 Hence the combined expression for Boyle's, Gay-Lussac's,
and Avogadro's laws becomes
                           PW=845.T.;
and this expression is applicable to solutions, substituting
osmotic pressure for gaseous pressure.
    We may give this equation even a simpler form, inasmuch
as the number of calories equivalent to a kilogrammetre of
work (A=      } =43)     stands  in a very simple relation to R,
viz. AR=2 (in reality about one thousandth less).             Hence
we may choose the form
                           APW=2T      ;
and this form has the great practical advantage that work,
which will often be discussed in the following pages, receives
a very simple expression, if calculated back to heat, measured
in calories.
   Let us next calculate the work, expressed in calories, when
a  gas or a solution, under constant pressure and temperature,
expands V volumes; V volumes containing a kilogram
molecule. This is evidently 2T.       It must be added that this

constant pressure is maintained only when the total volume of
gas or solution is very great compared with V, or in cases of
evaporation, where the vapour-pressure is at       maximum.                             its

solutions  may be  compared  with each other, and a second law
may be deduced, which Raoult has also discovered experimen
tally. The following reversible process, consisting of two
operations, is carried out with a very dilute solution of P per
cent., at temperature T.
    1. Remove, by use of cylinder with semipermeable wall, a
portion of the solvent containing a kilogram-molecule (M) of
the dissolved substance : here the total quantity of solution is
                                  *
supposed so great that no alteration of concentration occurs,
and the expenditure of work is therefore 2T.
     2.   This quantity,                    kilograms, of the solvent is returned
as vapour; it may be conceived as produced from the liquid
by evaporation at                its
                        vapour-pressure    then expanded till
                                                            ;                                  its

                is    the vapour-pressure

  We can follow this relation still further, and, assuming
Avogadro's law for solutions, deduce the above normal mole
cular depression of the freezing-point from other data.         It
bears a close relation to the heat of fusion of the solvent, as is

    1. We shall first examine Guldberg and Waage's observa

and they found, according                          to    their simplified formula, that
                              log   Crso,               log CK,co,- K.
The relation given      our equationby  almost identical, for,        is

A  similar agreement exists with sodium carbonate, for then
the values       for Na,SO, and Na,COs are 1.91 and 2:18

106            Messrs. Rowland and Bell on the
rate of variation of the square of the magnetic force in that
direction.     This rate of variation is greatest near the edges
and points of a magnetic pole, and more work will be required
to tear away a particle of iron or steel from such an edge or
point than from a hollow. This follows whether the tearing
away is done mechanically or chemically.        Hence the points
and edges of a magnetic pole, either of a permanent or induced
magnet, are protected from chemical action.
    One of Prof. Remsen's experiments illustrates this most
beautifully.     He places pieces of iron wire in a strong mag
netic field, with their axes along the lines of force.         On
attacking them with dilute nitric acid they are eaten away
until they assume an hourglass form, and are furthermore
pitted on the ends in a remarkable manner. On Prof. Remsen's
signifying that he had abandoned the field for the present, we
set to work to illustrate the matter in another manner, by means
of the electric currents produced from the change in the elec
trochemical nature of the points and hollows of the iron.
    The first experiments were conducted as follows:—Two bits
of iron or steel wire about 1 millim. in diameter and 10 millim.
long were imbedded side by side in insulating material, and
each was attached to an insulated wire.        One of them was
filed to a sharp point, which was exposed by cutting away a
little of the insulation, while the other was laid bare on a
portion of the side. The connecting wires were laid to a re
flecting-galvanometer, and the whole arrangement was placed
in a small beaker held closely between the poles of a large
electromagnet, the iron wires being in the direction of the
lines of force. When there was acid or any other substance
acting upon iron in the beaker, there was always a deflection
of the galvanometer due to the slightly different action on the
two poles.      When the magnet was excited the phenomena
were various. When dilute nitric acid was placed in the beaker
and the magnet excited, there was always a strong throw of the
needle at the moment of making circuit, in the same direction
as if the sharp-pointed pole had been replaced by copper and
the other by zinc. This throw did not usually result in a
permanent deflection, but the needle slowly returned towards
its
                              it.
     starting point, and nearly always passed
reversed deflection.     This
                                               it and produced
                                      effect was disregarded for
                                                                a
the time being, and attention was directed      to  the laws that
governed the apparent “protective throw,” since the reversal
was   so   long delayed as   to   bequite evidently due   to after
effects and not to   the immediate action of  the magnet.
    With nitric acid this throw was always present   in greateras
less  degree,  and sometimes remained for some minutes         a or

               Action  of a Magnet on Chemical Action.            107
temporary deflection, the time varying from this down to a
few seconds.        The throw was independent of direction of
current    through   the magnet, and apparently varied in amount
with the     strength  of acid and with the amount of deflection
due to the original difference between the poles.         This latter
fact simply means that the effect produced by the magnet is
more noticeable as the action on the iron becomes freer.
    When a pair of little plates exposed in the middle were sub
stituted for the wires, or when the exposed point of the latter
was filed to a flat surface, the protective throw disappeared,
though it is to be noted that the deflection often gradually
reversed in direction when the current was sent through the
magnet; i.e. only the latter part of the previous phenomenon
appeared under these circumstances.
    When the poles, instead of being placed in the field along
the lines of force, were held firmly perpendicular to them, the
protective throw disappeared completely, though as before
there was a slight reverse after-effect.
    Some of Prof. Remsen's experiments on the corrosion
of a wire in strong nitric acid were repeated with the same
results as he obtained, viz. the wire was eaten away to the
general dumbbell form, though the protected ends instead
of being club-shaped had the ends perceptibly hollowed.
When the wire thus exposed was filed to a sharp point the
extreme point was very perfectly protected, while there
was a slight tendency to hollow the sides of the cone, and the
 remainder of the wire was as in the previous experiments.
 In  both cases the bars were steel and showed         near the ends
 curious corrugations, the metal being left here and there in
 sharp ridges and points.       In one case the cylinder was eaten
 away on sides and ends, so that a ridge of almost knife-like
 sharpness was left projecting from the periphery of the ends.
    These were the principal phenomena observed with nitric
 acid.     Since this acid is the only one which attacks iron freely
 in the cold, in Prof. Remsen's investigations this was the one to
 which experiments were in the main confined.              With the
 present method, however,       it was possible to trace the effect of
the magnet whenever there was the slightest action on the iron,
 and consequently a large number of substances, some of which
 hardly produce any action, could be used with not a little
 facility.
    In thus extending the experiments some difficulties had to
 be encountered.       In many cases the action on the iron was so
 irregular that it was only after numerous experiments under
 widely varying conditions that the effect of the magnet could
 be definitely determined.         Frequently the direction of the

108
the wires      .     Messrs. Rowland and Bell on the
original action would be reversed in the course of a series of
experiments without any apparent cause, but in such case the
direction of the effect due to the magnet always remained un
changed, uniformly showing protection of the point so long as
                     parallel to the lines of force. When, how
ever, the original action and the magnetic effect coincided in
direction, the repetition of the latter showed a decided ten
dency to increase the former.
   When using solutions of various salts more or less freely
precipitated by the iron, it frequently happened that the
normal protective throw was nearly or quite absent, but
showed itself when the magnetic circuit was broken as a violent
throw in the reverse direction, showing that the combination
had been acting like a miniature storage battery which
|..".      discharged itself when the charging was discontinued
 y breaking the current through the magnet. The gradual
reversal of the current some little time after exciting the
magnet was noted frequently in these cases, as before.
Owing to this peculiarity and their generally very irregular
action, the various salts were disagreeable substances to ex
periment with, though as a rule they gave positive results.
   Unless the poles were kept clean experimenting became
difficult from the accumulation of decomposition products
about them and oxidation of their surfaces. A few experi
ments showed how easily the original deflection could be
modified, nearly annulled, or even reversed in direction by
slight differences in the condition of the poles. These diffi
culties of the method are, however, more than counterbalanced
by    itsrapidity and delicacy when proper precautions are
     en.
  Nearly thirty substances were tested           the manner previ
                                                 in

                                                      as
have   shown,   the  protective  action     is  general

     From these experiments it was quite evident that the
protective action, whatever                          its
                                   cause, was more general than

discover and if possible eliminate the cause of the reversal of
the current which regularly followed the protective throw.
Experiments soon showed that it could not be ascribed to
accumulation of decomposition products around the electrodes,
and polarization, while it could readily neutralize the original
deflection, could not reverse            direction.  itsWhatever the
cause,     was one which did not act with any great regularity,

pole was simply exposed over small portion       a           side while    of      its

this case the protective throw was not nearly              large              as              as   in
the free acid, since the electrodes tended          become polarized to
while the gelatine was hardening, and only weakly acid
gelatine would harden                      all

permanent deflection was produced instead                     transitory   of      a

    This point being cleared up, attention was next turned                                         to

 suspected      the previous work, could not have been definitely

less than 0-0001 volt in case of the acids evolving hydrogen,

initial electromotive forces normally existing between the

the question of direct protection of the poles, have furnished
additional proof of the purely mechanical action of the magnet
by reproducing some of the characteristic phenomena where
chemical action was eliminated and the only forces acting
were the ordinary magnetic attractions.
   An attempt was made to reverse the magnetic action, i. e.
to deposit iron in a magnetic field and increase     deposition                            its
where there was     sharp pole immediately behind the plate
                             a                                                                                  on
which the iron was being deposited.       This attempt failed.
The action was very irregular and the results not decisive.
The question         stirring-effect was also examined. Usually
                         of
stirring the liquid about one pole increased the action                that                            on
pole, but sometimes produced little effect             even decreased        or                                 it.
This, however,           entire agreement with the irregular action

114     Mr. C. Tomlinson on         some Effects    of Lightning.
1888, he describes an experiment similar to the one in this
paper, but without our theory with regard to the action of
points.    Indeed, he states that the ends of his bars acted like
zinc, while the middle was like platinum, a conclusion directly
the opposite of ours.   The reason of this difference has been
shown in this paper to be probably due to the currents set up
in the liquid by the reaction of the magnet and the electric
currents in the liquid.        -
   In conclusion,   we may   remark that our results differ from
those of Professor Nichols in this : firstly, we have given the
exact mathematical theory of the action and have confirmed it
by our experiments, having studied and avoided many sources
of error, while Professor Nichols gives no theory, and does not
§.
notice the action of points ; secondly, our experiments give a
  rotective action to the points and ends of bars, while Professor
          thinks the reverse holds, and that these are more easily
dissolved than unmagnetized iron.

IN theeared in the ‘Times’ newspaper,       describing some
remarkable effects of lightning. These letters were inserted
under such headings as “Eccentricities,” or “Wagaries of
Lightning;” but it is not difficult for an electrician to assign
the effects described to admitted principles, or at least to well
known electrical behaviour.
   I have been interested in the subject from the time, nearly
                               I
half a century ago, when acted as Snow Harris's scientific
representative (as Faraday named me), while that distinguished
electrician was getting up his case in defence of his system of
lightning-conductors for the British navy. It was my business
to search the scientific journals, English and foreign, logs of
ships, &c., for cases of damage by lightning. Hence I became
tolerably familiar with the “vagaries of lightning,” and I find
that the cases recorded of late years are not distinguished by
any particular novelty. But the lightning stroke is so powerful
and irresistible in its effects, that the ordinary observer cannot
help seeing many things which, being new            him,  to    he
                                                            thinks
worthy  of  description   inthe  newspaper.    Even medical men
sometimes describe cases       as novel which are well known         to
the electrician.   Some years ago the frequent accidents that
occur  to persons  seeking   refuge from     thunderstorm under

        Mr. C. Tomlinson    on some Effects  of Lightning.   117
   In communicating this case to the ‘Times’ newspaper of
June 2nd last, I agreed that this theory does not apply to the
above case, and referred to the numerous recorded cases of
animals being struck while human beings have escaped.
M. d’Abbadie mentions a case which occurred in Ethiopia, in
which 2000 sheep were killed by a single flash of lightning.
In Sacco, in the kingdom of Naples, on August 17, 1858, out
of a flock of 140 sheep the lightning killed 120. The shep
herd was not touched and the shepherd boy escaped, but a
kid which he had in his arms was killed. In June last three
bullocks were killed by lightning in Betchworth Park, near
Dorking ; and in the same month, at Frensham, several cattle
were killed by lightning; some boys left to tend them were
struck, but not seriously injured.        In short, innumerable
cases are recorded in which the shepherd, the farmer, and the
huntsmen have been spared, while the sheep and cattle, the
dogs and the horses, have been killed.
   When Snow Harris was planning his system of lightning
conductors for the Houses of Parliament, he explained to me
the necessity for strongly protecting the ventilating-shaft of
the House of Commons.          As a coke fire is usually kept
burning in this shaft during the session for the purpose of
maintaining a ventilating force, a column of hot rarefied air
ascends from this shaft to a considerable height, and would
probably act as a line of least resistance, and so determine the
course of a stroke of lightning. Indeed a case of this kind
occurred in August 1887 at Birmingham, where a chimney
shaft 140 feet high was discharging a hot current into the air.
During a storm two men sought refuge in a hut at the base
of the shaft, which was not furnished with a conductor: the
lightning struck the chimney, passed through the hut, and
killed the men.    The local paper which recorded the accident
states that a mark like the impression of a tree was found on
the chest of each man, and signs of scorching in other parts.
    When a flock of sheep or other animals are huddled together
 during a storm a similar column of warm rarefied air is pro
duced.    In the case described by Mr. Dudgeon, the horses
just taken from the plough were very warm, and sent up a
steamy rarefied air which acted as a line of least resistance to
the disruptive discharge.    The man probably did not share in
this rarefied air, and so escaped  from the lightning only to be
injured by the fall of the horse.    This view is confirmed by
Mr. Dudgeon, who, having read my explanation in the
‘Times,’ states that such a view seems to be quite reason
able —“The day was particularly hot and oppressive (ther
mometer 79° in the shade), so the horses must have been very

warm, and carrying up with the heated air from their bodies
a considerable column of moisture.”
   Mr. Dudgeon has been so good as to send me the particu

               QUESTIONs.                                   ANSWERS.
      Date 14th June, 1888.
1. Were the sheep huddled        to-        1. Six of them were together, but
  gether or separate *                        not huddled; four huddled about
                                              5 yards from the nearest of the
                                              six; two in another direction,
                                              about 10 yards off the six.
2. Were they in the open or under           2. Six immediately under a tree;
  a tree ?                                    four below the outer branches of
                                               the tree and in the shelter of a
                                                 hedge;     two      in   shelter    of a
                                                 hedge.
3. Were there any marks caused              3.    Six were covered with soil
  by the lightning on the sheep,                 which hindered any mark being
  or on any of them P                            seen ; most of the others had a
                                                 straight dark mark up both sides;
                                                 one had one of the hoofs nearly
                                                 torm off.
4.    Were any trees near the sheep         4.   No.
     struck by lightning at the same
     time?
   These answers were supplemented by a letter addressed to
Mr. Dudgeon by Mr. Douglas. Premising that a number of
sheep were grazing in a field near a small wood to which they
had access, the narrative thus proceeds:—
   “At the time the storm was at                 its
                                         worst, there was      heavy            a
hail-shower.    The   sheep being  not long  clipped,  seem     have            to
gone     to
          the trees for shelter.      was under
                                         It           beech-tree thea
lightning struck the earth          three places, equally distant
                                       at
round the tree, and about         foot      two from   or       then      it.   It
went     two
         in   directions,  one    at a
                                  right  angles      the other.                        In

one direction     followed one

bare the soil, and stripping the bark off the root, and killing
                                                                                       an

four sheep      the direct line

                  the other direction     cut      the ground until

         Mr. C. Tomlinson on           some Effects      of Lightning.                119
it  came to an oak-tree, which it went half round, grazing the
bark, and then continuing the same straight line which it had
been following, and killing two sheep, one about two yards in
front of the other, both in line. Where it had first struck
the ground, it sent the earth and grass to a great height, the
leaves of the trees being covered with earth to a height of
from fifteen to fifty feet. The earth being washed down
the heavy rain so covered the sheep as to prevent any mar                              º
being seen. One of the sheep was bleeding at the mouth,
and another had a hoof nearly torn off.             The six were lying
from one to two yards from each other. A girl who saw
them first, and immediately after the stroke, says there was
another sheep trying to get up ; she assisted it and it ran off.
It does not seem to have been injured, but it had the same
dark blue mark as the others up each side and across the
kidneys. The tree struck does not look any the worse, nor
any other tree near it.”
    Certainly, some of the effects described in the above
 interesting case seem to justify Mr Dudgeon's opinion that
 the electrical discharge proceeded from the ground upwards.
 There are recorded cases of this sort, and when these are
 referred to by Arago, in his celebrated essay “Sur le
 Tonnerre,” contained in the Annuaire pour l’an, 1838, it is
 with some hesitation.           If
                                lightning moves with the velocity
 attributed to it by Wheatstone, how can we tell whether it
 ascends or descends? The answer must be, by                       effects.its

 coals also were scattered.    The theory of the return stroke
 is that such effects as the above result from the discharges
 of the remote clouds producing electrical disturbances in
 distant bodies, even some miles from the spot over which the
 thunder clouds appear.
    The case related by Mr. Brydone resembles in several par
 ticulars the recent case communicated to me by Mr. Dudgeon.
 In the one the hair was singed on the legs, and under the
 bellies of the horses; in the other there were marks of singe
 ing in the regions of the kidneys of the sheep. In both
 cases the animals were struck suddenly stone dead.           Mr.
 Brydone, who, as we have said, examined the spot soon after
 the accident, says:—“Had there been any convulsive
 struggle, the marks would have been visible in the dust of
 the road where they fell.”       And, as a further analogy, “a
 shepherd standing in an adjacent field stated, that he had his
 eye on the waggon at the
 saw a vortex of dust arise.” sº    instant of the explosion, and
                                  In Mr. Douglas's narrative the
 soil was hurled upwards so as to cover the leaves of the trees
 to a considerable height.
    Arago is so sceptical as to the possibility of a lightning
discharge from the ground upwards (de bas en haut) that he
is disposed to attribute the explosions above described,       in
 cluding the turning up of the soil, and the barking of the
 roots of the trees, to the conversion of the moisture of the soil
 into high-pressure steam by the intense heat of the lightning;
just as he accounts for a large tree being split up into
matches by the conversion of the sap into the same tremen
dous elastic force.     But in the case at Coldstream, Brydone
 says nothing about rain, and the principal effects occurred in
 a dusty road.    He also describes a very curious case, which
 supports the idea of a discharge from the ground upwards.
A woman who was cutting grass on the banks of the Tweed
 was suddenly thrown down without any apparent cause.         She
 called her companions immediately to her aid, and told them
that she received a sudden and violent blow on the soles of
 her feet, but whence it proceeded she could not tell. At
 the moment this happened there was neither thunder nor
 lightning.
    Arago admits that the facts as to ascending lightning are
against him, although they do not amount to demonstration.
He is also sceptical as to the phenomena of ball lightning
(éclairs en boule) or that which moves through the air at a
comparatively slow rate, appearing like a luminous ball or
a globe of fire.    Arago terms this ball lightning a stumbling
block   (pierre d’achoppement)   for meteorologists, due probably

                                                                                 *   -

to an optical illusion.     We need not discuss his objections,
seeing how numerous the cases are, and, apparently, well
established.   Let us take only one or two cases. Mr. Chalmers
states (“Phil. Trans.’ xlvi.) that, being on board the ‘Mon
tague' (seventy-four guns) on November 4th, 1749, he
observed a large ball of blue fire rolling along on the surface
of the water, as big as a millstone, at about three miles dis
tant.    Before they could raise the main-tack, the ball had
reached within forty yards of the main chains, when it rose
perpendicularly, with a fearful explosion, and shattered the
main topmast in pieces.        So also on the Malvern Hills, in
June   1826,  a ball of fire was observed to roll along the hill
towards a    building   where some people had taken shelter.
 Here it  exploded,  and killed two of them.
   According to Snow Harris these luminous balls result
from a kind of brush, or glow-discharge.        In the case of the
 ‘Montague,” it was rolling on the surface of the water
 towards the ship from to windward.         This was evidently a
 sort of glow-discharge,    or St. Elmo's fire, produced by some
 of the polarized atmospheric particles yielding up their elec
tricity to the surface of the water.      On nearing the ship the
point of discharge became transferred to the head of the
mast; and the striking distance being thus diminished, the
whole system returned to                its
                                    normal state, that         say,     is       to           a
disruptive discharge ensued between the sea and the clouds,
producing the usual phenomena              thunder and lightning,

                                      the Malvern Hills      another        is

1h   13m 12°, when  the altitude was 52°51'5, which gave for
the reading     the north point 57° 56'-9.

which differs only by half a minute from the value obtained
when the mirror was in adjustment.
   In like manner the bearing of a pinnacle, as given by the
mirror in adjustment, was 128° 40'.8, while, when the reading
for the image of the cross wires was +5-7 div., it was.
                                    128° 40'.2 + 0.8–128° 41'-0.
The elevation was 15° 39', and the two results agree to 0-2.
It is evident from these test cases that, since the error of the
mirror was far larger than that produced by travelling for a
day or two, observations in the field can, by means of the
scale, be corrected to within the limits of the error of ex
 eriment.
   The additions to the magnetometer, which we have here
described, were made for us by Messrs. Elliott, and we
venture to think that they might with advantage be incorpo
rated in standard instruments of the Kew pattern.

   Among the many papers in the earlier volumes of Gilbert's
Annalen der Physik, which the invention of the voltaic pile
had directly inspired, will be found several by Prof. Erman
of Berlin.      With the aid of the imperfect instruments known
at that time he made an investigation on the conducting
power of bodies; and in his fourth research" there appears a
division of bodies into five classes, of which the following
schema shows the chief features:–

   To understand this classification it will be necessary to
describe the method of experiment employed by Erman in
order to find the class to which a body belonged.                    PN (fig. 1)
is a well insulated Volta’s              pile,  P and N     being   the positive
and    negative   poles     respectively.        Connected with P is a gold
leaf electroscope      E,       and with N a similar electroscope E,.
The body (B) to be tested, which is permanently connected
with earth, is made to touch separately E, and                      E. If     the
body belongs to Class I. neither of the electroscopes will be
affected, but the case is otherwise if B is a conductor.                      Let
us suppose the latter; it will, therefore, be necessary to
ascertain to which of the other four classes the body
belongs.       Permanent connexions are made (as represented
by the dotted lines of fig. 1) with B, and the behaviour of the                            -

          (b) On Sulphuric Acid and Caustic Potash.
    Ohm" employed a galvanometer in studying the unipolar
conductivity of these liquids.      The instrument was placed in
series with 1–6  single fluid  zinc-copper cells, and a voltameter
containing strong sulphuric acid.        Employing electrodes of
platinum, gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, and tin, he found that
the deflection obtained on first making the circuit speedily
sank to a very small amount.       He showed that the cause dimi
nishing the current was between the anode and the acid; for
on bridging across the anode and the liquid by some moist
threads the deflection was immediately increased to the ori
        amount. Also, in the case of the oxidizable metals, by
#.iluting the liquid in the neighbourhood of the anode the
current was greatly increased, whilst a dilution of the liquid
near the kathode produced no effect.        Further, replacement
of the anode    by a clean electrode   produced    the original de
flection for a time, whilst changing the kathode made no
difference.   He finally concludes that the fall of the current
is due to the development of a force at the anode.        This con
clusion he verified    by   the use of an    electroscope.     Thus
strong sulphuric acid is classed amongst the negative unipolar
conductors   f.
  Ohm also experimented with various electrodes in strong
potash solution, which led him to regard the latter as a
positive unipolar conductor.
           3. Experiments and Theory of Christiani.
   The  only modern contribution of importance to the subject
of irreciprocal conduction is the pamphlet f produced by the
late Prof. Christiani, whilst working in the laboratory of Du
Bois Raymond.       He investigated generally the case of elec
trolysis with unequal-sized electrodes, and comes to the con
clusion that, as a rule, with low E.M.F.'s the current is able to
  *  Schweigger's Journal, lx. (1830) p. 32.
  t It seems probable.that   what Ohm observed was a decrease of cur
rent due—(1) in the case of the oxidizable electrodes to a transition re
sistance caused by the formation of a badly conducting salt-layer on the
anode in strong sulphuric acid; (2) in the case of platinum and gold in
sulphuric acid and potash solution to polarization, this polarization being
of a unipolar nature, that is to say it was much greater at one electrode
than at the other.    We do not believe that Ohmu ever observed the phe
nomenon of unipolarity in strong sulphuric acid with electrodes of plati
num or gold due to a transition resistance.    This conclusion is supported
by comparing Wiedemann, Electricität, Band     ii. pp. 629,607.

 pass more easily from the lesser to the greater electrode, and
 vice versä with large E.M.F.'s. This difference, he says, exists
 after the influences of polarization and chemical transition
 resistance are allowed for, meaning by the latter term a re
 sistance due to the products of electrolysis.    We have been
 at some trouble to examine the experiments and reasoning
 upon which the above conclusion is based, and have arrived
 at the opinion that they are equally open to criticism; his
 results and theory being, however, very interesting and repre
 senting a large amount of work, it will hence be desirable to
notice them at some length, especially as his pamphlet is not
readily accessible in England.
    In order to eliminate as much as possible changes in the
electrolyte caused by the passage of the current, momentary
currents from an induction-coil were used throughout the
greater part of his work, his object being a study of the
                                                                                            j

   Here it seems evident that the irreciprocity is due to the
  radual formation of a badly-conducting film on the anode,
É.   Christiani does not accept this simple explanation, appa
rently because it would not, as he thinks, explain the results
obtained with transient currents.
   Having rejected both polarization and a chemical transition
resistance as causes for the effects obtained, a theory of elec
trolysis which would afford an explanation of them was
necessary.     The theory which Christiani evolves is a direct
development of the idea that electrolysis is a convection of
electricity by the atoms of matter. He considers the me
chanism of electrolysis to consist in the two ions of a mole
cule conveying equal and opposite quantities of electricity in
opposite directions, but assumes (1) that the impulse causing
this motion takes place only at the anode. He assumes, more
over, (2) that in a given electrolyte the number of atoms
(=n) which meet any unit area in unit time only depends

134                               Messrs. Gee and Holden on
on the temperature of the electrolyte.         Finally, he makes use
of the assumption (3) that every monad ion carries the same
...'.      of electricity (=e). These assumptions are applied
 inally to the case of unequal-sized electrodes, a plate of area
P and a point of area S, as follows. According to assump
tion (2) the number of atoms which touch the plate in unit
time will be nP, and therefore by (3) the greatest quantity
of electricity which can leave the plate by ordinary convec
tion in unit time is n Pe, and similarly nSe is the greatest
quantity of electricity which can leave the point in unit time.
He then argues that, although n is a very large quantity, e is
a very small one, and that it may thus happen that n Pe and nSe
are quantities of electricity small enough to be dealt with in
experiment.      He then considers the effect of an E.M.F. (=E)
acting in the circuit for a very short time (=t).             Suppose
that the  plate  is the anode and        such      E.M.F.    (=E,)

   The theory is thus highly ingenious, but          verification                       its                    is
a matter     considerable difficulty, for we have

Table I.).     Take two clean platinum electrodes, one being
much larger than the other, and place them in strong pure
H2SO. It will be found that a very large current can pass
from the larger to the smaller electrode (see fig. 4, a direc

divisions on the galvanometer. On reversing the current
(see fig. 5, 8 direction of current), if it be of suitable strength,
after the first sudden deflection the galvanometer-needle will
soon return nearly to zero; in many cases scarcely a trace of
a deflection is to be observed; in fact the current in the a

volts and upwards had been employed.        Measurements of the
resistance were also taken by Kohlrausch's method, this bein
done by breaking the circuit of fig. 3 between a and b, an
including the arrangement in one of the arms of a Wheat
stone's bridge.     It was found very difficult to get anything
but a   very  approximate    value of the resistance during the
insulating condition, for the passage of the alternate currents
apparently tended to destroy the insulation, and caused con
tinual vibration of the needle of the dead-beat galvanometer.
This effect was much less when the current was sent in one
direction
           through the primary coil of the induction-coil than
in the other. The values of the resistance obtained, however,
fully confirmed those obtained by other methods; so that we
may conclude that the insulating condition is due to a re
sistance at the anode.     In what follows it will be convenient
to  regard  this as due to a film of badly-conducting matter.
   c. The Film-forming Current-density.—If       we increase the
size of the anode a greater current is necessary to produce the
insulating condition, hence the current-density at the anode
is an important factor in determining the formation of the
film (see Table I.). Calling C the minimum current which
will form the film and S the whole surface of the anode im
mersed, then C/S=A we shall define as the film-forming
current-density.     The actual value of A depends upon several
conditions, such as will be best understood after an examina
tion of Tables I. and II.
   Examination of the following and similar observations show
that A is not perfectly definite in value, but is greatly in
fluenced by the previous treatment of the anode. For example,
if   the    anode    has been heated to redness and washed                     before
putting in the current, the film forms with a less value of A
than if the anode had been previously used for electro
lysis (see experiments 2 and 3, Table               and
                                                       I.,           5,

      The method of placing the anode in the acid has an
  important influence upon the value of A, as the following
  experiments show:—
      Exp. I.-The end of a Pt wire used as an anode was im
  mersed in the acid, and then the film was formed by the
  lowest value of the current-density.                 The anode was then
 gradually lowered into the acid, when it was noticed that the
  film was formed over the whole wire. When the wire was
  lowered rapidly the film remained on the lower part for a
  time, but the upper portion was conducting, as evidenced by
  the escape of gas from                  it.

     f. Influence of Temperature.—Inspection            of the curves
 (figs. 6, 7, and 8), giving the variation of the film-forming
 current-density with the temperature will show that A is
 markedly affected by a change of temperature, and particu
 larly so at the higher temperatures; an increase in the
 temperature requiring a corresponding increase in A, the rate
 of increase of A with temperature being greater at the
 higher temperatures.         The observations from which the
 curves are drawn were obtained in the following manner:—
 The anode and kathode were placed in separate beakers, each
 containing strong pure H2SO,.              Connexion was made be
tween the two vessels by means of several inverted U-tubes
 filled with acid.      The beaker containing the kathode was
 kept at a constant temperature throughout.              Starting with
 both beakers at about 15°C. the current was put on in the
A direction, and the current-resistance varied until the film
 was formed and the corresponding value of A noted. The
current was then reversed for a moment in order to remove
the film, the beaker containing the anode heated, and for
every few degrees of rise of temperature A was found as
just described. In the case of falling temperatures the pro
cess was somewhat different and yielded more regular results.
After A had been found for the highest temperature, the
resistance in circuit was slightly increased, the film being
removed by reversing for an instant, and the anode vessel
                                                           j
allowed to cool. The temperature was then noted at which
the film again formed with the slightly diminished current.
This procedure was repeated until the anode vessel had cooled
        |".
down to the desired extent.
     g.            of Viscosity.—It was thought probable that if
we made dilute H2SO, (say 10 per cent. acid) sufficiently
viscous that the film would be produced ; but negative results
have accompanied the addition of both glycerine and gelatine
to the dilute acid. With a 50 per cent. acid to                   2 per
cent. of    gelatine had been    added,   the value of A was reduced
to one third by this addition.           Addition of glue to strong
HASO, has a similar effect in lessening the value of A *.
      . Effect of Platinizing the Electrodes.—Some difficulty has
been     experienced in trying to estimate           the effect which
platinizing a platinum electrode has on the value of A, on
account of the impossibility of accurately measuring the
surface of the platinized wire. There is no doubt that after
platinizing a few moments much greater currents than that
   * It is perhaps worth mentioning that a jelly made of glue and water
gave the film at the kathode.   In one case, when the electrodes were a
wire and a Wollaston's point, the resistance was 2000 ohms when the wire
was kathode, and 45,000 ohms with the point as kathode.

which produced the film before platinization are now unable
to do so, but whether the surface of the anode has increased
by platinizing in the same ratio we are unable to say. In
one case, in which before platinizing the film was formed
with a current of 70 divisions, after a few moments' platiniz
ing the film would not form with currents as high as 300
divisions.

   A piece of common white soap was cut in the form of a
cylinder 4 cm. long and 1 cm. diameter.            It was protected
by a glass tube, and mounted so that platinum plates pressed
against         its
            two ends.     The resistance,       measured       Ohm's               as                         by

 146                               Messrs. Gee and Holden on
strengths of sodium benzoate giving the film without difficulty.
Careful observation showed that with weak currents the
oxygen produced at the anode was able to break through the
layer of benzoic acid, and thus prevent the film-formation;
but with strong currents the solid acid obtained the mastery,
the oxygen then not being able to break through and so dis
perse the acid.   Hence, with strong currents a film, consisting
of solid benzoic acid in which oxygen bubbles were entangled,
was formed round the anode, thus stopping the current.
               6.       Discussion         of     the possible         Causes         of the Film.
     The film in H,SO, with platinum             electrodes is in many
 respects   very   analogous   to those obtained in the same liquid
 with oxidizable electrodes, and also to that which causes the
             of iron, in which cases a solid oxide or sulphate
|...".
  ayer on the anode is acknowledged to be the cause of the
insulation.      The non-formation of the film with platinum
 electrodes in H2SO, below a certain strength, the increase
 of A with the temperature, the fact that the film disappears
 gradually on breaking the circuit, and immediately on re
 versing the current,            point,     may all   argued,it       solid      be                 to   a

carbon electrodes, the non-formation of the film with platinum
electrodes in various oxidizing agents, and other minor pro
perties, which will be found in the previous part of the paper,
have led us to doubt the accuracy of the oxide theory in the
case of platinum or carbon electrodes, and to provisionally
adopt another theory, as indicated below.
   The behaviour observed at the anode in the case of the
electrolysis of sodium benzoate solution suggests that the
badly-conducting sulphuric acid which appears, in electro
lyzing that liquid, at the anode, may under certain conditions
be able to stop the current.
we have to remember                  :-
                               In discussing such a hypothesis
   (1) That the specific resistance of H2SO, increases very
rapidly with the degree of concentration.
   (2) That the concentration of the acid at the anode during
electrolysis is partially prevented (a) by the evolution of
oxygen (as we have pointed out in Phil. Mag. April 1888,
p.283), and also (b) by                         its
                               dilution, the rapidity     which                                   of
depends       the viscosity and strength
                   on                         the acid solution            of
used.
    (3) That        a    certain amount               of   oxygen forms             a   gaseous layer
on the anode.
    Bearing these points             mind, we will examine whether
                                           in
they are sufficient         explain our experiments.

will     be  formed       quantity too small

dilution, and the resistance             the layer    of

anode may increase              rapidly

                                           is           conceivable that
                                                                      it       is

layer    ;  for     would
                    it         expected that the tendency
                                     be                            the gas                    of

to the acid, we have succeeded in obtaining such an upper
limit.     The discovery of an upper limit makes some of our
experiments of less value, for where we have stated that no
film has been obtained, the non-success may be due to failure
in fixing on the right limits of current-density.                  It also
 explains the peculiar jumps in the current which we have at
 times observed in using platinum electrodes in strong H2SO,.
 These jumps, which were of a similar kind to those which
 we obtained with gold electrodes, are probably due to the
 current-density used being near the upper limit when small
 causes, such as the heating of the liquid, would involve the
 disappearance of the film ".
     This provisional hypothesis likewise accounts for the non
 formation of the film in dilute H2SO, f.              Here the rate of
 dilution (even if the electrolyte be made viscous by the
 addition of glycerine) of the concentrating layer will be more
 rapid, and hence a greater length of time would be required
 to produce a thoroughly concentrated layer.              But the longer
 the time that elapses before this is attained, so much the
 greater must be the quantity of oxygen produced.               Thus, just
 as in the case of current-densities above the upper limit in
 strong H, SO4, the formation of film will be prevented.
     The less rapid increase of the specific resistance with the
 degree of concentration         in the cases of HaPO, and KHO
 probably explains the difficulty found in obtaining such a
  high degree of insulation as we have observed with H2SO4.
     Some other aspects of transition resistance, evidenced by
  some experiments not included here, will be considered in a
  subsequent paper.
   XVII.      On a Practical Constant- Volume Air- Thermometer.
                 By   J. T. BOTTOMLEY, M.A., F.R.S.;
         the   fourth Mémoire of his celebrated Relation des             Er
  IN périences,       published in 1847, Regnault gives cogent
  reasons for preferring the air-thermometer before any other
  as the instrument by means of which temperature may be
     * We are not disposed to think that the jumps obtained with gold are
  due to the same cause.    Gold really comes under the head of attackable
  electrodes, and the phenomena with it are, therefore, prºbably of a more
  complicated character than with either platinum or carbon.      Palladium,
  in this respect, must be classed with gold, for when used as anode in
  moderately strong sulphuric acid, it dissolves.
     f The results obtained by Christiani, we believe, may also be explained
  by this hypothesis.

 150              Mr.   J. T. Bottomley on    a Practical
defined, and high temperatures determined.                 The thermo
dynamic researches of Sir William Thomson have furnished
an absolute thermodynamic definition of temperatures; and
the experimental researches of Dr. Joule and Sir William
 Thomson have established the practical agreement of Reg
nault's air-thermometer with the thermodynamic scale of
 temperatures. Lastly, the air-thermometer is the only                 in
strument known at present, with the exception of a mercurial
thermometer which has been compared with an air-ther
mometer, by means of which temperatures higher than, say,
 150° C. or 200° C. can be determined within 3° C. or 4°C.”
    In experimenting on the resistance of platinum and carbon
filaments at high temperatures, in connexion with a research
 on thermal radiation with which        I have been engaged,       I have
used air-thermometers of various forms          ; and   I  have  recently
been using a constant-volume air-thermometer, which I first
described to Professor Gray, of University College, Bangor,
just two years ago (January 1886), and partially constructed
for him at that time. It is this instrument, greatly improved
 as to practical details, which I now desire to bring before the
 Royal Society.
    The best known constant-volume air-thermometer is that of
 Jolly of Vienna. It is a convenient instrument, and is fairly
 accurate for moderate temperatures; but for high tempera
 tures a correction, which it is necessary to apply on account
 of expulsion of air from the heated part of the thermometer,
 becomes serious, at any rate with the dimensions commonly
 given to the instrument.          It has also some other defects,
 among which may be mentioned difficulties as to the capillary
 surfaces of the mercury, want of flexibility or adaptability for
 various positions, and the proximity of the manometric column
 to the heated regions.
    The modifications which        I have made in the construction
 of the air-thermometer have a threefold object, one part of
 which is to improve on the accuracy of the instrument, and
 reduce to the minimum that is practicable the correction above
 referred to for the air expelled by heat from the thermometer
 bulb or air-reservoir.       A second object is to increase the range
                                º,
 of the instrument        by  giving it a form in which the hard
 Bohemian      glass   can be used in the construction of the part to
 be heated.      The third object is to make that part of the ther
 mometer which is to be                 and which, in the use of the
    * Mr. H. L. Callendar has proposed to  use the resistance of platinum
 for thermometric purposes; but in this   case also the final  standard of
 reference is the air-thermometer.

tube d is very small in capacity in comparison with the bulb ;
and were it not for these reservoirs, a very small change in
temperature would cause the air to be driven out round the
bend of the U, or the liquid in the bend to be drawn over into
the bulb, unless the observer were incessantly on the watch to
prevent this occurring by regulating the pressure.

and the shorter downwards, from the zero line, and the

freezing.     For, if the quantity of air be                     greater
than corresponds with this condition, there is a loss of range
in the instrument; whereas, if there be but a small quantity
of air, there is a tendency for the liquid of the volume-gauge
to be drawn over into the bulb when the temperature of the
room comes down (as in winter it may) to about the freezing

point, unless the instrument be left with the three-way stop
cock closed and the air under diminished pressure.                    For
special circumstances the                of air may be made to suit
the conditions; for, as Regnault has shown, the results
obtained with the instrument are but very slightly affected by
the initial pressure of the air, and this with very wide limits;
and by commencing at common temperatures with air of
small density, very low pressure, the upper limit of the range
may be extended without increasing the length of the mano
metric tubes.

    The filling accomplish in the following way:—The proper
quantity of liquid is first introduced into the volume-gauge,
and the stop cock t helps in introducing the liquid and in
adjusting the quantity.        For this and the subsequent opera
 tions I use a good Bunsen water-aspirator, with a Woulfe's
two-necked bottle interposed between the aspirator and the
work, and a good length of small-bore non-collapsible india
rubber tubing.      With the india-rubber tubing the apparatus
to be exhausted can be turned into any required position
while the exhaustion is being carried on, and air-bubbles can
be got rid of with ease.
    When the volume-gauge has been supplied with liquid,                        I
connect the three-way stop-cock t' to the aspirator, and draw
the whole of the liquid up into the bulb b' and the tube lead

 potential. When alternating currents are employed, induction
  coils of appropriate construction are used as transformers.
  But the use of such currents is attended by two disadvantages:
 namely, that alternate currents cannot be used for electro
 chemical purposes, and that, pending the invention of a satis
 factory alternate-current motor, they cannot be used for the
 actuating motive machinery.            When continuous currents are
 used, the appropriate transformer may be one of two types
 —(1) the motor-generator, (2) the commuting-transformer.
    The motor-generator in                        its
                                         primitive form consists                                   of   a
 motor    to receive the    incoming     current, geared mechanically
to a   generator which produces the outgoing current.                   more                 A
 specialized form consists            single machine with one field
                                            of    a
 magnet and two armatures; one                     receive the primary
                                                                 to

                                       to                         secondary            or

   The theory of alternate current-transformers has been in
vestigated by various authorities.     It was first shown by
Maxwell that where there is mutual induction between two
circuits, the effect upon the secondary circuit of the presence
of the primary circuit is threefold :—(a) to transform in a
certain ratio the electromotive force; (b) to add to the resist
ance of the secondary circuit an apparent resistance equal to
that of the primary multiplied by the square of the same ratio;
(c) to deduct from the coefficient of self-induction of the
secondary circuit a quantity equal to the coefficient of self
induction of the primary circuit multiplied by the square of
the same ratio. The ratio in question was found to be the
quantity
                             27tnM       -

where M is the coefficient of mutual induction, n the number
of alternations per second, Li and R, the coefficient of self
induction and the resistance respectively of the primary
circuit.     In a communication made last year to this Society
I  showed how, assuming the proper conditions of good con
struction to have been observed, this ratio was equal to the
ratio of the number of secondary windings to the number of
primary windings in the transformer ; which ratio is known
as the “coefficient of transformation.”
    The object of the present paper is to show that in continuous
current-transformers effects of the same kind exist. The
investigation is of an elementary character, secondary reac
tions being assumed to be negligibly small.
    Consider a motor-generator, with double-wound armature
of ring or drum type, arranged to rotate between the poles of
a common fixed field-magnet.             The magnetism of the latter
may be considered for present purpose constant: the effect of
variation in the magnetization will be afterwards considered.
 Let the number of armature-conductors of the primary or
 motor part, as counted                 all
                                 round the periphery,         called Cl,   be

sible can be seen at once, from a computation of the correction
term involving the semidiameter of the bubble in the formula
for a” which is given by Poisson, and presented later in this
paper. It will be found that, for a bubble of the diameter of
100 millim., the correction to be applied to reduce the value
of a” obtained on the assumption made by Prof. Quincke,
amounts for water to more than 5 per cent., for alcohol to
nearly 3 per cent., and for other liquids to similar percentages

                 Contact-Angle          of Liquids and Solids.                        165
constant a.    In the experiments with water, given by Dr.
Traube, the radius of the tube employed was 1:72 millim.,
and the value of a may be taken as about 3.87. In the
cases of the other liquids employed, for which the value of
a is in every case less than that for water, the ratio of the
radius to the value of a is almost unity. Clearly in these cases
the approximation is no longer applicable. A calculation by
Poisson's formulas of the height of the meniscus formed by
water in a tube of radius 1:72 millim., gives as that height
1:51 millim.    The height observed by Dr. Traube was 1:45
millim. The   agreement   of the calculated and observed results
is such that the difference may be explained as due, perhaps,
partly to the difficulty of observation noticed by Laplace,
partly to the inadequacy of the approximation in tubes of such
a diameter, and not necessarily to the existence of a finite
contact-angle.    The diminution in the height of the meniscus
as the temperature rises may be explained from the well
known fact that the value of a” decreases as the temperature
rises, and does not demonstrate the existence of a variable
contact-angle.
    Method.—The     method employed in the investigation here
presented    was, in general, that used by Prof. Quincke”.           It
consists in the   comparison    of the values of                     a”,
                                                      for the different
liquids examined, determined by two independent methods.
One   of the methods       independent
                               is             any assumption about
                                                       of
the contact-angle, and the other involves the assumption that
the contact-angle       zero.
                          is     The formulas show that,           case         in
this  assumption      untrue,   the value        given of    the latter    by
                     be is                                  bya
method should        less than that given        the other; while the
results    of
            the two methods should             substantial agreement
                                                  be   in
if the assumption      justifiable.
                          is
   Both methods     employed    were based upon measurements                               of
the dimensions       large air-bubbles formed

                                     the first method the distance
measured was the vertical distance from the bottom of the
bubble    the horizontal plane containing the greatest section
           to
of the bubble.   This distance,    the subsequent formulas and

                       the second method the distance measured
was the vertical distance from the bottom of the bubble     the                      to

The bubble was blown from a glass pipette.                    By means of the
levelling-screws of the tank the bubble could readily be placed
central under the lens.         Its horizontal section appeared always
to be strictly circular.        The curvature of the lens' surface was
such that bubbles with diameters ranging from 25 millim. to
150 millim. could be examined. In                                 all

168                       Dr. W. F. Magie on        the
of the object-glass was fastened a small piece of white paper,
the images of which, reflected at the under surface of the
lens and at the surface of the bubble, could be observed by
the microscope. The paper was illuminated by the rays from
a gas-flame or an incandescent electric lamp, concentrated by
a lens and reflected upon the paper by a mirror.   The mirror
was a glass plate, silvered on the front surface, backed with
black paper, and pierced with a small hole through which the
reflected images were observed.   Light was thus largely ex
cluded from the interior of the bubble. The cathetometer
was furnished with a micrometer-screw reading directly to
hundredths of a millimetre.   To make a measurement of k a
bubble was       formed under the lens, and observations were
suspended      until the liquid film had evaporated from the
centre of the lens under the microscope.     Five settings were
 then made on the sharply focused image of the paper re
 flected at the under surface of the lens, and five settings on
the image reflected at the bottom of the bubble. The dis
tance between the two positions, determined from the means
of these settings, is the distance          A-N
                                         of formula III. which
follows. To form a new bubble, most of the air contained in
the one already measured was removed with the pipette, yet
not so much that the liquid again wetted the portion of the lens
under the microscope. The bubble was then enlarged by the
introduction of more air. In this way the delay occasioned
by waiting for the evaporation from the lens' surface was
avoided, and an accuracy in the settings obtained which was
not possible when the reflexions were observed before the
reflecting portion of the lens became dry.
     Calculation of k from Measurements.-If the measurements
described were made upon a bubble formed under a plane
glass plate, it can easily be shown that the measured distance
A–N       would be the desired distance k.     Since, however,
the bubble is formed under a lens, three corrections are
necessary:—
    1. The first of these arises from the fact that in the first
observation the rays from the object pass through the thick
lens, are reflected at a convex surface, and pass out through
the lens.     If we express by
  A,       the distance from the object to the lens in the first
         observation,
  e,     the thickness of the lens at       its
                                         centre,
                                                          by
 f, n,    the index  ofrefraction   the glass, and
                                       of
       a    distance such that (n-1)        felt,
                                             the radius        of
                                                        curvature
         of   the concave face   of   the lens,

it may  be easily shown that the distance in air from the object
mounted on the end of the object-glass to a point seen clearly
and in good focus, which distance, in this method of obser
vation, is taken as a constant, is expressed by
                                  2A +2e       –        m    –

   Sources of Error.—Before discussing the bearing of these
results upon the question of the existence of a finite contact
angle, it is important to consider the possible sources of con
stant error in a set of observations.          mostly affect the                  H.

                             the tank is so placed that the wall
through which the observations are made is not vertical, or
nearly so, the distance measured by the microscope and the
value of q deduced from it will be a little too small. The
same result will follow if the microscope is not horizontal in
its  supports.      the micróscope does not move

1528 at 21°5, and again 15:39 at 16°7, and, by the method
of this paper, 15-17 at 23°2. The values of a” obtained on
the same days by the “k” method, in the first two cases with
bubbles formed under a flat plate, and in the third under the
lens as described, are respectively 15:18, 1493, and 14.96.
The evidence afforded by these consistent differences of the
results by the two methods is strengthened by the fact that
experiments on the rise of water in capillary tubes by Gay
Lussac", Frankenheim and Sondhaust, and Brunnerf, give
for a” at 20° the value 1480, and those of Volkmann $ give
14:90.    Assuming that the “q’’ values are correct, these
values are such as would follow from the method of capillary
tubes if there were a small finite contact-angle, and if in the
computations the contact-angle were assumed to be zero.
The differences in the values of a” are, however, so small, and
the difficulty of obtaining surfaces of glass really clean so
great, that, while these experiments point to a finite contact
angle between water and glass as probable, yet do not feel                                I
that they demonstrate             its
                               existence.

 180                   Dr. W. F. Magie on the
tion is supported by the observations of March 10 and April 24.
The measurements were then made while the film of liquid
still covered the lens' surface, so that the supposed irregula
rities at the circle of contact were far less likely to occur.
The settings were more difficult and the readings not quite so
accordant, but the agreement of the results by the two methods
is such as to indicate that the cause of the discrepancy in the
results of the other days was not operative.
    This view obtains further support from the results of another
series of measurements on ethyl-alcohol".        By the “q” method
the value then obtained for a” was 5'576 at 23°.         By the “k”
method, in which the bubbles were formed under a flat plate,
the values were 5'803 and 5786 at 22°.           From the ordinary
method by the use of capillary tubes the value was 5'805;
and by a method in which the radius of curvature of the
meniscus in a capillary tube was measured directly, and which
did not involve the contact-anglef, the value was 5'859. In
the last two methods the disturbing effect of the water in the
surface-film would be felt as well as in the “k’’ method.
Hence arises,    I think, the substantial agreement of the results
by the last three methods, and also the difference between them
and the results by the “q " method.
    The results of March 10 offer no evidence of a finite contact
angle ; and though those of April 24 differ by more than one
 º    cent., yet this difference is mostly due to the values given
  y the last bubble. If these be omitted, the means from the
four others are 5'592 and 5-560.         The difference is too slight
to demonstrate the existence of a finite contact-angle.

    Other Liquids.-In the cases of chloroform, methyl-alcohol,
formic acid, and benzine, the agreement of the results is such
as not to indicate a finite contact-angle. , The variations of
the values of a” in the case of formic acid, and the way in
which those variations were shown by both methods of obser
vation, are worthy of notice.
    In the cases of acetic acid, turpentine, petroleum, and ether,
the results indicate the existence of a finite contact-angle. A
rough calculation of the value of that angle was made in each
case by taking the value of k which              give the mean value
of a” given by the “k ’’ method, and using it with the mean
value of a” given by the “q’’ method to calculate the value
of a from formula IIa. In the numerical values thus ob
tained little confidence can be placed.        They are only given
                    –
as rough approximations.

   Discussion of the Results.-The close agreement of the “q.”
and “k’’ results in those cases in which no finite contact
angle is inferred, by showing the general validity of the
method of experimentation, is such as to force me to rely
with some confidence on the evidence of the existence of a
finite contact-angle in the other cases. It is more difficult to
decide if this contact-angle is due to the relations among the
molecular forces in equilibrium at the line of contact, as was
assumed, in the statement of the problem, would be the case.
Another possible explanation may be given, in favour of
which the experiments here presented offer some evidence.
In experiments conducted on the plan here described, the
temperature of the liquid is almost necessarily a little lower
than that of the air above the lens.          Presumably the lens,
the upper surface of which is not covered by the liquid, is
also at a slightly higher temperature than the liquid.            The
evaporation from                its
                            under surface will therefore         more                 be
rapid than from the cooler lower surface        the bubble.  of After
the interior of the bubble has become saturated with the
,
vapour      the liquid, evaporation will
                                                        go

              of                                  from the lens and
precipitation will occur upon the surface         the bubble.     This
evaporation will cut away the thin liquid surface             line          at   its             of
contact with the glass; and unless the facility with which the
liquid travels over glass        such that new particles move
                                      is                                                         up

certain problems in solid elastics.                                        Following Meyer and
others, “ elastische Nachwirkung '' is                                 a   possible occurrence in
liquids.
   Boltzmann's "theory, amplifying deductions of Lamy and
of Clebsch, is based on the assumption that the elastic forces
are dependent not only on the present but on the preceding
deformations of the body. The effect of earlier states of stress
on the existing stress diminishes with the intervening time,
but is independent of the intervening states of stress. More
over different viscous deformations are superposable.         Boltz
mann's    theory  therefore subserves a mathematical     purpose,  as
Kohlrauschf remarked, and, by presupposing the phenomena,
brings the laws of solid viscosity tersely into formulae.           o                                        If
is an interval of time reckoned back from t to t—o when the
strain 6,-, existed, then Boltzmann's law may be most clearly
exhibited, perhaps, in      application its the problem    vibration  to                        of

200           Mr. C. Barus    on   Maxwell's Theory of the
for —t and for +T, both at 6=20° and 6=100°. In No. 3
the effect of —t and +t is of different magnitude at 20° and
enormously more different in magnitude at 100°.    In No. 4
the effect of +7 following —t is even more phenomenally
pronounced, both at 20° and particularly at 100°.   In No. 5
the wires nearly identical at 20° show differences at 100°. In
No. 6 this is true even in much greater degree, whereas in
No. 7 wires differing considerably at 20° show relatively small
differences at 100°.      And so         I
                                       might go through the series.
The element of vagueness asserts itself throughout, and is
almost serious enough to obscure the law. Nor is this wholly
due to the latent torsions mentioned at the outset of this para
graph.      Nos. 13 and 14 are wires originally free from torsional
strain; but the said vagueness also appears in these.
    Careful inspection of the tables reveals the law that viscous
                                  i.
deformation takes place at numerically greater rates during
the even twists than during the odd twists which immediately
and respectively precede                  Irrespective of these oscil
lations, the effect of twisting here, as in § 7, is pronounced
increase of viscosity.
    Maxwell's theory accounts for the stated vagueness of be
haviour at once. In two samples of a complex substance like
 steel, the distribution and relations of the unstable molecular
 configurations will only in very rare instances be physically
and chemically identical.        The previous paragraph shows that
                                                                           .
such identity is rare even in pure homogeneous metal.
    The effect of twisting alternately in opposite directions is of
such great importance in           its
                                   bearing        Maxwell’s theory that

206              Mr. C. Barus             on Maxwell's        Theory of the
graphically shown for the divers tempers, An. 25°, An. 100°,
An. 190°, An. 370°, An. 450°. It so happened that the
normal is less viscous than the other (An. 450°) rods selected.
Hence the negative values of Table II. The axis of abscissa
in figure 1 represents Nos. 2 and 3, thus avoiding negative
values.   Regarding the data for 6=20°, it is to be noted
that An. 25° are new wires, whereas An. 100° to An. 450°
have undergone twisting in earlier work. Hence the experi
ment exaggerates the size of the interval slightly. The same
irregularity affects the distribution of the other degrees of
temper An. 100° to An. 450°.
   Returning to Table II., it is clear, inasmuch as viscous
deformations are measured differentially, that (4–6)/T and
so-sº     are to be compared.     It appears that these quantities
increase and decrease        together.   This is more easily dis
cernible when rods free from strain are compared".              The
exceptions of Table II. are due to the fact that latent strains
influence (ºp-q')/T to a relatively much greater extent than
so-so". Again, if so—sº and (q)-p')/T be compared at 100°,
Table      II.shows that in this case also the two quantities                             in
crease and decrease together.        Indeed the data for 100° are
the more      uniform,  a result due to the fact that at 100° much
of the latent torsion is made to vanish because of the
annealing effect of 100°.        Data of even greater uniformity,
 cat.  par.,  are to be looked for at higher temperaturef.
    If  a  comparison   is made between the mean rates at which
viscous deformation and resistance increase together with
temper, at 20° ((qb–ºb')/T and so—s') and at 100° ((4–4), t
 and sloo-sºº'), it is seen that the mean rate of increase of
 (6–4')'t relatively to s—s' is about ten times as great at 100°
 as at 20°.      This is the phenomenon in virtue of which the
 viscous behaviour of steel, regarded as a test of Maxwell’s
 theory, is almost crucially important.                         I

          be                                         13; because such in   §                               a
 rod would undergo annealing during the viscous measurements
at 100°.
    Hard steel annealed                      at
                                   100° bears the same relation        100°                        to

     In
     one respect the present results differ from the above. The
phenomena are here spread out over scale (roughly estimated)    a
about ten times larger.     This means, following Maxwell’s
theory, that             at
                100° the number      unstable molecular confi  of

212                     Mr. C. Barus                  on Maxwell's                     Theory of the
amount of free motion. Wiscosity in solids is the result of
 changes of molecular configuration brought about by inter
 change of atoms of contiguous configurations, in the manner
 explained by the Clausius-Maxwell principle”.                   In solids
 under stress such changes take place gradually, through
infinite time, because the conditions favourable to inter
transfer of atoms are of rare occurrence, and because the
number of molecules for which such transfer is possible is
limited.     This limited interchange of atoms between mole

metal like           is analogous to that of dissolving molecules
                 steel,
of acid or salt in a non-conductor like pure water. These
added molecules are the unstable groups with which Clausius's
theory deals.      In both cases the effect produced is propor
tional to the number of unstable molecules distributed.                                    If
the number be sufficiently increased, the medium will
ultimately be a viscous               in the one case and an electro
lytic conductor in the other. At the outset, pure water
typifies the rigid solid.
   The applied stress imparts a permanent strain to the solid.
Wiscous deformation is therefore accompanied by a residual
phenomenon, which manifests itself when the applied stress
is removed or reversed.*.            In liquids, when acted on by
electromotive    forces,   the analogous     reaction is the reciproca
ting force of galvanic polarization.
   Again, Clausius's and Maxwell's theories mutually sustain
each other.     For if the conception that in a solid, molecular
configurations      are present in            degrees      all

   Of the three terms in equation (1), the first and most im
portant depends on no hypothesis as to distribution at all;
the second depends on the assumption of uniform distribu
tion of displacement-recoil in the dielectric, and may there

on the magnetization of the conductor itself by a uniformly
distributed current, and if the current keeps itself to the
exterior surface, as a very rapidly alternating one will, this
term vanishes.
   Now that we know S and L, we can easily find the cri
terion for the discharge to be oscillatory, and can determine
the rate of alternation.

several thousand ohms would offer to a steady current of cor
responding strength ; the actual obstruction being given by
equation (8').
   Another way of putting the matter, is to say that for the
first few oscillations the damping term, e-" in equation (3),
has no appreciable effect; and that, accordingly, the E.M.F.
applied to the conductor alternates rapidly from Wo to —Vo
                                  -
and back again.
   But Vo is the initial potential of the condenser, diminished
(so far as the conductor is concerned) by the E.M.F. needed
to jump whatever thickness of air it has jumped before reaching
the conductor.      Hence this Wo may be something quite com
parable to the potential needed to jump through air         the rest                        all

inches without any alternative path, it remains able to jump,
say, 1% inches when offered as an alternative a copper rod a
quarter of an inch thick and six or seven yards                This
gives a rough notion of the kind of results obtained, and it
shows that the extremities of the rod experience almost the
whole of the original E.M.F. of the condenser.
    Some experiments on much the same lines had been previ
ously made by Prof. Hughes and M. Guillemin (see Comptes
rendus, 1886, Annales Télégraphiques, 1865, Address to So
ciety of Telegraph Engineers, 1886); but they used a fine
wire instead of an air-space, and tried what conductor would
protect the fine wire from being deflagrated.
    Under these conditions the experiment is practically a com
parison between the impedances of two conductors—one of
which has     its
                inertia term the bigger, while the other has                                                   its
 resistance term the bigger.

   The experiment with an air-gap as the alternative        is
better; because one may be sure then that none of the dis
charge chooses that path, when it is properly adjusted for                                                          its

   The jar discharges at A in the ordinary way, and simulta
neously a longer spark is observed to pass at B at the far end
of two long leads. Or if the B ends of the wire are too far
apart to allow of a spark, the wires glow and spit off brushes
every time a discharge occurs at A.
   The theory of the effect seems to be that oscillations occur
in the A circuit according to equation (3') with a period
                          T=2irw/(LS),
where L is the inductance of the A circuit, and S is the ca
pacity of the jar. These oscillations disturb the surrounding
medium and send out radiations, of the precise nature of
light, whose wave-length is obtainable by multiplying the
above period by the velocity of propagation.
   This velocity is known to be

   Postscript.—Since     writing the  above  I have seen in the current
July   number of Wiedemann's Annalen an article by Dr. Hertz,
wherein he establishes the existence and measures the length of
ather waves excited by coil discharges; converting them into
stationary waves, not by reflexion of pulses transmitted along a
wire and reflected at its free end, as     I  have done, but by reflexion
of waves in free space at the surface of a conducting wall.
   My friend Mr. Chattock has also written to me about a recent
experiment exhibited to the Physical Society,         I  do not know by
whom, which shows that the same discharge as can excite ather
waves a kilometre long can excite air waves of one millimetre.
The whole subject of electrical radiation seems working itself out
splendidly.

       many manuals, text-books, and elementary treatises on Che
SOmistry     are now being issued by the teachers of the science that
it becomes almost invidious to select any of these works for notice
in these pages; but Mr. Pattison Muir, who is Prælector in Che
mistry of Gonville and Caius College, having for some time past
figured as a reformer in chemical teaching, we feel bound to call
attention to the two books above named. The first of these may
be described as the theoretical complement of the second work,
which is the laboratory guide for those who are undergoing instruc
tion in the principles of science in accordance with the scheme laid

our methods of teaching the science of Chemistry in this country
were and are still in need of serious reform, and we gladly welcome
any new departure which promises to break through the old and
stereotyped system of “test-tubing” which reigned supreme in our
laboratories a few years ago.          The ‘Elementary Chemistry’ is a
praiseworthy contribution to the desired reformation; but we are
not very sanguine of                   its

tain the author's reputation for sound and dependable practical
instruction; and we have no hesitation in recommending it to all
students of chemistry who wish to acquire a good all-round know
ledge of the principles and methods of quantitative analysis.         The
first part of the volume is devoted to exercises in weighing and
measuring, the fundamentals of quantitative work.           The next sec
tion gives a series of exercises in analytical methods, the examples
being well chosen, and sufficiently varied to give the student a
broad grasp of quantitative analysis.       The third section treats of
organic analysis, and the fourth section of gas analysis, in con
nexion with which will be found some very useful exercises. The
next section is devoted to a series of promiscuous exercises in the
application of the knowledge derived from the previous parts of
the work to the analysis of certain special things likely to be met
with in the course of practice; such as sea-water (upon which the
author is an authority), Stassfurth Potash Salts, Cast Iron, Super
phosphate, Guano, Milk, Butter, Soap, &c. The volume concludes
with some useful notes.       We have no doubt that Prof. Dittmar's
work will soon find    place  among   the recognized working manuals
used in our laboratories.

THE    1. “On the Spheroid-bearing Granite of Mullaghderg, Co.
Donegal.”     By Frederick H. Hatch, Ph.D., F.G.S.
    This paper deals with a remarkable variety of granite which may
be compared with the well-known orbicular diorite or Napoleonite
 of Corsica. According to Mr. J. R. Kilroe, of the Geological Survey
of Ireland, who first discovered this interesting rock, the concre
tionary balls occur in close juxtaposition in a mass of granite of 5
 or 6 cubic yards in size.        They have not been found in any
 other portion of the granite area.
    The author first gave a detailed description of the microscopic
 structure of the normal granite.     It is a coarse-grained rock, com
 posed essentially of quartz, orthoclase, microcline, oligoclase, greenish
 hornblende and black mica.         Sphene is an accessory constituent.
 Since it contains no white mica, the rock belongs to that subdivision
 of granite which has been termed granitite. A description of the
 spheroidal bodies was then given. The balls are somewhat flattened,
 the greatest diameter being, in one case, 4 inches, the smallest 3.
 Each ball consists of two distinct parts, a pinkish central portion
 (the nucleus) and a dark-coloured peripheral or zonal portion (the
 shell). The nucleus consists of an irregular granitic aggregate of
 oligoclase felspar with a little interstitial quartz. The peripheral
 shell is composed chiefly of oligoclase, but also contains abundant

      Eozoic and Palaeozoic Rocks of the Coast of Canada.                                                       233
included plates of biotite, and over 12 per cent. of magnetic iron-ore.
It is to the presence of the last-mentioned mineral that the zonal
portion owes         its
                 dark colour.       means

      3. “Notes on some of the Auriferous Tracts of Mysore Province,
   Southern India.” By George Attwood, Esq., F.G.S., F.C.S., &e.
      The author was employed during parts of 1886–7 in inspecting
   a large area of mineral lands in Southern India supposed to be
   auriferous, and the paper contained the results of his observations.
      1. Melkote Section. This section (in the Hassan district of the
  province of Mysore), starting one mile west of Melkote in a north
  easterly direction, exposed gneiss, mica-schist, hornblende-schist,
  quartzite, talc- and chlorite-schists, eclogite, and quartz veins,
  striking generally N. 20° E., and having varying dips. The eclogite
  was described at length, and special attention was called to the
  flattening of the contained garnets, which were probably originally
  almandite; other evidences of great crushing were also noted.
     In this section and on most of the schistose lands of Mysore a
  dull grey, nodular, and botryoidal calcareous deposit, known as
  “kunkur,” is found in nullahs, on hill-sides, and on the detritus of old
 gold washings, and it was suggested that the contained lime was
 derived in great measure from hornblende-schists.
     Many quartz outcrops, large at the surface but diminishing in
 thickness downwards, were met with at the east end of the section;
 these veins have a strike about      N. 15° E. to N. 20° E., coincident
 with that of the schists.
    Extensive gold-washings have been carried on in the ravines
 and hill-sides, and the mode of occurrence and character of the gold
were described.
    The author considered the schists, as well as the quartz veins, to
 belong to very old series of rocks, probably Archaean.
    2. Seringapatam Section. The second section was taken in a south
easterly direction from the 72nd milestone on the Seringapatam and
Bangalore road to the N.W. side of the village of Arakere.        Gneiss,
hornblende, and mica-schists, &c., were here met with, striking about
N. 20° E. with varying dips. These were traversed by auriferous
quartz-veins which had been largely worked, and the author gave a
description of the former methods of extracting the gold.
    At the S.E. end of the section the schists were found to be much
broken by porphyrite dykes of much more recent origin, most likely
of Tertiary age.      A small granite dyke intersected the Elliot Lode
diagonally, and was considered to be of Upper Tertiary age.
    3. General Observations.       The author described the results of
traverses of other districts; he pointed out the evidences of great
pressure which had broken up the gneissic rocks and compressed the
schists, and conjectured that this might have been produced by the
gradual rise of the Eastern and Western Ghats, and finally called
attention to the great denudation which the Mysore plateau had
undergone.

  An Appendic by Prof. T. G. Bonney, D.Sc., LL.D., F.R.S., F.G.S.,
gave   an account of the microscopic characters of the schists, the

  4. “On the Durham Salt-district.”                     By E. Wilson, Esq., F.G.S.
  In      this paper the author described                the new salt-field                   in the
North of England, occupying the low-lying country bordering the
estuary of the Tees, and situated partly in Yorkshire and partly in
Durham.
  The history     of the rise andprogress of the salt-industry in South
Durham was      given,   since the first discovery of salt by Messrs.
Bolckow Vaughan and Co. at Middlesboro’, in the year 1859.
   The stratigraphical position of the saliferous rocks of the Durham
salt-district was considered in some detail. The diverse views which
have been previously expressed on this head were referred to, and
reasons given for concluding that all the beds of rock-salt which
have been hitherto proved in this field, and the red rocks with which
they are associated, belong to the upper portion of the Trias, viz.
to the Upper Keuper series (Waterstones subdivision).
   The probable area of this salt-field, the limits of the distribution
and varying depths of the chief bed of rock-salt were indicated, and
the extent of     its
                   supplies pointed out.                                                 -
   In conclusion, the author called attention      the waste, to well                of as

is almost   imperceptible   at small potentials, while with greater ones

greater deflections on the contrary, (from 10 to 40 millim.), there

  We are now prepared for the consideration of our special
problem, viz., the reflexion of plane waves at a twin surface
                                                   ...
of a crystal. We suppose that the plane of separation is r=0,
and we assume that there is a           perpendicular to this
(z=0), with respect to which each twin is symmetrical. The
only difference between the two media is that which corre
sponds to a rotation through 180° about the axis of a, per
pendicular to the twin plane.
  In consequence of the symmetry the axis of z is a principal
axis in both media; but the axes of w and y are not principal
axes.   For the relation between force and strain in the first
medium we may take
       P=4tr(Af-Bg), Q=4T (Bf4 Cy),                                      R=4trDh.       . (25)
    In the second medium we may in the first instance assume
    similar expressions with accented letters; but the peculiar
    relation between the two media demands that         C = C,                 A'-A,
    D'=   D,B'-  —B. Thus for the second twin   medium,
      P=4t (Af-Bg), Q=47 (–Bf--Cy),                                  R=4trDh,           .   (26)
the only difference being the change in the sign of B.       B                              If
vanish,    all
            optical distinction between the twins disappears,

    'or a general solution of the problem of reflexion from a
twin plane, we should have to suppose the plane of incidence
to be inclined at an arbitrary angle to the plane of symmetry
(w, y); but we may limit ourselves without much loss of
interest to the two principal cases, when the plane of in
cidence (1) coincides with the plane of symmetry, (2) is
perpendicular to              it.

These equations indicate that the intensity of the reflected
light (M”--N”) is proportional to that of the incident, with
out regard to the polarization of the latter. Again, if the
incident light be unpolarized (M and N equal, and without
permanent phase relation), so also is the reflected light.   But

When the angle                of   incidence        is    small, the intensity                            is   propor

adjustment of wave-lengths now necessary.                At
angles the reflexion may be sensibly total over a band of
considerable width.        All this agrees precisely with Prof.
Stokes's    description of the case            by him to be typical.
The movement of the band towards the blue end of the
spectrum is to be attributed to the increasing obliquity within
the crystal, as in the ordinary theory of thin plates.
     It thus appears that if we allow ourselves to invent a suitable
crystalline structure, there need be no difficulty in explaining
the vigour and purity of the reflexion; but such an exercise
of ingenuity is of little avail unless we can at the same time
 render an account of the equally remarkable circumstances
stated in (1) and (4).       When the incidence is in the plane of
symmetry, no reflexion takes place.        As Prof. Stokes remarks,
 this   might  be expected   as regards light polarized in the plane
of symmetry; but that there should be no reflexion of the
 other polarized component is curious, to say the least.         Not
 less remarkable is it that when the incidence is in the     perpen
dicular plane, the reflected light should show no signs of
 polarization.     The phenomenon being certainly connected
 with the doubly refracting property, we should naturally have
 expected the contrary.
      The investigation of the reflexion from a twin-plane, con
  tained in the preceding paper (pp. 246 et seqq.), shows, however,
  that the actually observed results are in conformity with theory.
  In the plane of symmetry there should be no reflexion of
  either polarized component, at least to the same degree of
 approximation as is attained in Fresnel's well-known formulae
  for isotropic reflexion.      As regards light reflected in the
  perpendicular plane, theory indicates that if the incident light
  be unpolarized, so also will be the reflected light.        Again,
  the intensity of the (unanalyzed) reflected light should be
  independent of the polarization of the incident.       So far there
  is complete agreement with the observations of Prof. Stokes.
  But there is a further peculiarity to be noticed.           Theory
   shows that in the act of reflexion at a twin plane, the polariza
   tion is reversed.                 If
                            the incident light be polarized in the

the reflected light was nearly unpolarized, even when the

incidence or in the perpendicular plane. When, however,
 the angle of incidence was diminished, the expected phenomenon
was observed, provided that the original polarization were                                                               in,

 then sensibly but one wave reflected at the first twin plane.
 On the arrival of the transmitted wave at the hinder surface
 of the twin stratum, a second reflexion ensues, similar to the
 first, except for the reversal of phase due to the altered
 circumstances.        The relation to one another of the two
 reflected waves is exactly the same as in the ordinary theory
 of thin plates, and does not appear to admit of the produc
 tion of anything unusual.                     I
                                      think we may even go further,
 and conclude that in         conformity     with our theory it is im
 possible to find an explanation of the brilliant and highly
 selected reflexion, unless upon the supposition that there is a
 repeated alternation of structure.
     The optical evidence in favour of the view that there are
 a large number of twin planes thus appears to be very
 strong; the difficulty is rather to understand how such a
 structure can originate.         And yet if we admit, as we must,
 the possibility of the formation of one twin plane, and of two
 twin planes at a very small distance asunder", there seems
 nothing to forbid a structure regularly periodic, which may
   erhaps be due to causes vibratory in their nature.
    It would undoubtedly be far more satisfactory to be able
 to speak of the periodic structure as a matter of direct
 observation, and it is to be desired that some practised micro
 scopist should turn his attention to the subject. Er hypothesi,
 we could not expect to see the ruled pattern upon a section
 cut perpendicularly to the twin planes, as it would                   upon,                lie

separate.      When the alteration of wave-length is such that
the phases      of the reflected waves range over a complete cycle,
the resultant vanishes, and a dark band appears in the
spectrum. The same thing occurs whenever the relative re
tardation of the extreme components amounts to a complete
number of periods. At points approximately midway between
these, the resultant is a maximum, but the values of the
successive maxima diminish *.            Near the central band, where
 (when the number of alternations is great) a considerable
fraction of the incident light is reflected by the system of
layers, this way of regarding the matter may cease to be ap
                                                                   |.
plicable, for then the anterior and the posterior layers act under
sensibly different conditions.
    Apart from the magnitude of the complete linear
something will depend upon the manner in which it is divided
between the twins.          The most favourable, as it is also perhaps
the most probable, arrangement is that in which the thick
nesses are equal.          In that case every partial reflexion may
agree in phase.           If  the thicknesses, though regular, are
unequal, we may first form the resultant for contiguous pairs,
and then consider the manner in which the partial resultants
aggregate.
    It will be seen that even if the thicknesses of the twins
are equal, there are still two ways in which a regularly lami
 nated crystal may vary, as compared with the single kind of
variation open to a simple twin stratum.                  These are the
 magnitude of the linear period, and the number of periods.
 Comparison of a number of coloured crystals f seems to
 favour the view that there are important differences of con
 stitution, even when -the colour is the same at a given                in
cidence.
    In many cases the appearances are such as to suggest that
 the periodicity is imperfect. A little irregularity might alter
 or obliterate the subordinate bands, while leaving the central
'band practically unaffected.          Sometimes there is evidence of
 two or more distinct periods, each sustained through a number
 of alternations. If the period were subject to a gradual
 change, the central band in the spectrum of the reflected light
 would be diffused, even at small angles of incidence. The
    * The case is similar to that of the distribution of brightness in the
 neighbourhood of a “principal maximum,” when light of given wave
 length is diffracted by a grating.

    t For a rich collection of such crystals am indebted to Mr. Muspratt.
  He informs me that, though the result of a second crystallization from
  comparatively    pure liquids, the coloured crystals are but rarely found
  when the chlorate is produced by the magnesium process.

mere   broadening of the band might be due to fewness of
alternations; but this case would be distinguished from the
other by the accompanying feebleness of illumination.
   On the whole, the character of the reflected light appears
to me to harmonize generally with the periodical theory.
One objection, however, should be mentioned. It might be
supposed that the total number of twin planes was as likely
to be odd as to be even.     In the former case the layers of
crystal on either side of the thin lamina (which is the seat of
the colour) would be of opposite orientations.     In many crys
tals the character of the  twinning  is difficult of observation,
but I have not noticed      any instance of brilliant coloration
answering to this description.   So far as it goes this argument
is in favour of the simple stratum theory; but, in view of our
ignorance as to how the twin planes originate, it can hardly
be considered decisive.
    I  have also examined a number of what appeared to be
simply twinned crystals, kindly sent me by Mr. Stanford, of
the North British Chemical Works. The light reflected from
the twin plane is not easily observed on account of                feeble                       its

        In these experiments the light entered and left the crystal
   by a face parallel to the twin planes. In one specially well
    formed and apparently simply twinned crystal           I  was able to
   observe a much more oblique reflexion from the internal sur
   face or surfaces. The light here entered and left the crystal
   by cleavage faces making a large angle with the reflecting
   planes, and thus under conditions widely different from those
   considered hitherto, and in the latter part of the preceding
   theoretical discussion.      Three reflected images were seen, al
   completely polarized (the original light being unpolarized), two
   in one direction and the third in the opposite direction. These
   images are coloured, and present tolerably discontinuous
   spectra, giving rise to a suspicion that the twin plane is not
   really single.     These observations were made without special
  arrangements by merely examining the reflected images of a
  candle-flame, when the crystal was held close to the eye.
       I  have made many experiments on the crystallization of
  chlorate of potash in the hope of tracing the genesis of the
  coloured crystals, but without decisive results.           Besides the
  usually small but highly coloured crystals, found by Stokes,          I
  have obtained many larger ones in which the reflexion is
  feebler and less pure. These appear to be distinct from the
 exceedingly thin plates which at the early stage of crystalliza
 tion swim about in the solution.           Mounted in Canada balsam
 the crystals in question show colours of varying degrees of
 brightness and purity ; and under these circumstances the
 effect can hardly be due to the action of the external surfaces
  (in contact with the balsam). The light disappears twice
 during the revolution of the plates in azimuth, just as in the
 case of the more highly coloured specimens. It seems natural
 to suppose that the reflexion takes place from twin surfaces
 relatively few in number, and perhaps less regular in dispo
 sition. Altogether the existence of these crystals favours the
view that fully formed colour is due to a large number of
                                                                ºj
regular alternations.
      Some interesting observations bearing upon our present
subject have been recorded by Mr. Madan”.                  Transparent
crystals, free from twinning, were heated on an iron                  to
the neighbourhood of the fusion-point.             During the heatin
no change was observable, but “when the temperature
sunk a few degrees a remarkable change spread quickly and
quietly over the crystal-plate causing it to reflect light almost
as    brilliantly as if  a film of silver had been deposited on it.”
Subsequently        examined, the altered crystals are found to

into the cavities, and greatly attenuates the reflecting power.
If a corresponding experiment be tried, by wetting the edge
of one of Mr. Madan's crystals with saturated solution of the
salt, no change is observed to ensue.
   Whether there are cavities or no, the fact that during the
preparation the silvery reflexion does not set in until the
crystal has sensibly cooled is of great interest.            I
                                                        have found
that if a crystal  in which the  silvery lustre has   already been
 produced be reheated, the lustre disappears, to return again
 upon a fall of temperature.    The operation may be repeated
 any number of times.
    The existence of twin strata in Iceland spar was observed
 by Brewster", and Reusch f has shown that such strata can
 be induced artificially by suitably applied pressure (fig. 1) in
 rhombs originally homogeneous.                 Fig. 1.
 .
 The planes of these strata trun
 cate the polar edges, i. e. the             A      !       B
 edges which meet     symmetrically
 at the obtuse trihedral angle (0).
 Being desirous of examining
 whether the reflexion from these
 strata would conform to the law           "                      C
 deduced from theory, I submitted
a rhomb to the treatment pre

         Reusch with the effect
of developing several exceedingl             Ib,           D
thin twin laminae (four or                                   t
least) in close juxtaposition.
When light, is reflected from these strata in a plane perpen
dicular to the edge (OD) which they truncate, the brilliancy
is considerable. But the observation which I wished to make
required that the plane of incidence should be perpendicular
tº this, so as to include the truncated edge and the optic axis.
Without much difficulty it was proved that in this plane                        the
ºfferion vanished, reviving          on                        inci  of

levelling-screws.
    At 6°C. the load carried in the pan, when equilibrium
obtains, is 104:660 grammes. A change of load of 1 milli
gramme now causes displacement, and effects the descent or
ascent of the pan.        This balance then estimates the weight of
 100 grammes to an accuracy of 100,000.
      Imust here observe, however, that working the balance to
this degree of accuracy needs some care.                 Where estimation

      GENTLEMEN,
           highly interesting experiments of Hertz, Hallwachs,
      Wiedemann-Ebert, and Arrhenius have proved irrefutably
the influence of ultra-violet light-vibrations on the electric dis
charge of bodies in the air.       Under the influence of light the
potential on bodies diminishes (especially if the potential be
negative); an electric current is even established between the
illuminated body and any other unisolated body. Some time
ago I published two articles", in which I have tested the

XXIX.  On the Influence of a Plane of Transverse Section on the
  Magnetic Permeability of an Iron Bar.    By Professor     A.       J.
  Ewing, F.R.S., University College, Dundee, and Mr.
  WILLIAM Low”.
  T   has been remarked by Professor        J. J. Thomson         and   Mr.
      H. F. Newall (Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc. Feb.                 1887) that
when an iron bar is cut across, and the ends are brought into
contact, the magnetic permeability is notably reduced.
   Our attention was drawn to the matter in experimenting
on the magnetization of iron in very strong fields, by what
we have called the “isthmus” method f, in which a bobbin with
a narrow neck was magnetized between the poles of a large
electromagnet. We found that when a solid bobbin was
used the central neck was much more strongly magnetized
than when the neck was a distinct piece separated by planes
of transverse section from the conical ends ; and we were
forced to ascribe the defect of permeability in the latter case
to the existence of two planes of section at the ends of the
short central piece of metal in which the induction was being
measured.    To examine the influence of transverse section
more fully, and to see how far that influence is modified when
the cut pieces are pressed against one another, we made a
series of experiments in which the permeability of cut and
uncut bars was determined by a method similar to that used
by Dr.  J.   Hopkinson f. The bar to be tested was let into a
massive    yoke of wrought iron, which provided a double path
for the return of the lines of induction from end to end. The
effect of this is to get rid in great measure of the self
demagnetizing influence of the bar's ends, so that the metal
may be tested in a condition approximating to endlessness.
Fig. 1 shows the apparatus: the bar a is sunk in holes in the
#.     bb.   The lower end of the bar abuts against a set screw
c, and on the upper end there is an iron plunger d, through
which a stress of compression can be produced in the bar by
loading the lever e. The diameter of the bar was 0-79 centim.
 (section 0.49 square centim.); the clear length of the bar
between the inside faces of the yoke was 12.7 centims., and
the cross section of the yoke gave an iron surface more than
100 times greater than the cross section of the bar. The

   The last two columns of the table have been calculated on
the supposition that the effect of each cut is equivalent to the
introduction of a film of air, or rather of space the permeability
of which is equal to unity, between the cut faces, with no
alteration in the permeability of the metal itself. They show
the thickness in millimetres which this equivalent air-space
would need to have to explain the observed loss of permeability
on the part of the bar. They are calculated by a simple

   This comparison makes it clear that the reduction which
occurs in the thickness of the apparent air-space as the mag
netizing force is raised cannot be explained as an effect of
magnetic stress in drawing the parts of the bar together.
                       (.
                           2
The magnetic stress          in dynes) amounts to less than 4
kilogs. per square centim. when $8 is 10,000, and to less than
8 kilogs. per square centim. under the highest value of 98
reached in these experiments.       Nevertheless the changes of
98 are associated with a reduction of the apparent air-space,
which is much greater than the reduction effected by an ex
ternally applied load of 226 kilogs. per square centim.     It is
startling to find the apparent air-space in the loaded bar
diminishing from 0.020 to 0:007 millim. as the magnetization
was strengthened, when the pieces of the bar were already
pressed together with a force so great that the additional force
due to magnetization was relatively insignificant.
   In the foregoing experiments the bar was simply cut in the
lathe, without any attempt to make the ends strictly plane.
In subsequent experiments comparison was made of the per
meability of a bar, rough-cut in this way, with that of a bar
in which the cut faces were carefully shaped by scraping and
testing against a standard Whitworth-plane.        For this pur
pose a new bar was taken, and after being tested in the solid
and again in the rough-cut state (cut into two parts), the two
parts were sunk tightly in a pair of cast-iron blocks with
plane surfaces about 3 inches in diameter, so that the end to
be faced true was flush with the surface of the block.       The
faces of the blocks were  carefully shaped to true planes against
each other and against a Whitworth-plane,      the surface of the
block itself and of the bar that was held in it being worked
up together. The bar's permeability was examined by taking
a curve of 98 and $5 in six states:—
    (1) Uncut bar; no load,
    (2) Uncut bar, loaded with 226 kilogs. per square centim.
    (3) Bar cut in two (at the middle).    Ends as cut in lathe
         (rough-cut). No load.
    (4) Ditto, loaded with 226 kilogs. per square centim.
   (5) Surfaces faced true at the cut. No load.
   (6) Ditto, loaded with 226 kilogs. per square centim.
   The results are shown in fig. 3, where four of the curves
are drawn in full, and the remaining two are indicated by
having the experimentally determined points marked sepa

itself do away with the apparent air-space : so long as no load
is applied the apparent space remains. But when the surfaces
are faced true and the parts are strongly pressed together, the
“magnetic resistance” of the joint practically vanishes.

of the apparent air-space when the surfaces were faced to true

cut in the lathe without being accurately shaped into true
planes, and that this film should continue to be present when
the pieces are pressed together by external load. It is less
easy to see how so considerable a film of air should still be
found when the surfaces are true planes, before they are
pressed together.     This, however, is perhaps possible enough;
                                   |.
and the idea that the resistance is due to an actual film of air
gains much probability from the fact that when truly plane
surfaces are forcibly              together the cut bar behaves
almost exactly as if it had not been cut. On the other hand,
it is difficult to reconcile the idea that the “resistance” of a
joint is due to an air-film, with the fact which these experi
 ments clearly demonstrate—that the “resistance” diminishes
   eatly as a state of magnetic Saturation is approached. We
#.    seen that this diminution     takes place under conditions
which make it apparently impossible that the diminution can
have been due to any real increase of closeness in the contact
of the air-surfaces. In the case of a rough-cut bar strongly
compressed we cannot suppose that the actual thickness of
the air-space suffers any material reduction as the bar becomes
magnetized.          If
                   we assume the resistance of the joint to be
due to the simple presence of this air-space, the alternative
would be that the permeability of air, or at least of air in
the condition in which it exists when condensed on the sur
faces of bodies, increases under the action of strong magnetic
forces to a very notable extent, a conclusion too startling to
be accepted on the evidence of these experiments alone.
   Whatever be the explanation of the results, they make it
clear that a joint between two portions of the iron core of a
magnet has in general a distinct magnetic “resistance,”
which is in        all

   It is remarkable that the compounds of oxygen do not show
any similar absorptions.       Angström thought it improbable
                                                                                    .
that oxygen should have a spectrum of such a character, since
he failed to obtain an emission spectrum resembling it; and
suggested that the absorptions might be due to carbonic-acid
gas or to ozone, or possibly to oxygen in the state in which
it becomes fluorescent (Spect. Norm. p. 41). Neither carbonic
acid gas nor nitrous oxide, at a pressure of 50 atmospheres in
our tube, show any sensible absorption in the                    spec
trum ; and the   absorption  of the ultra-violet  rays  by  the latter
gas begins at a higher point, namely about A 2450, than that
of uncombined oxygen. In fact we see the anomalies of the
selective absorption by compounds as compared with that of
their elements when we take the case of water, which has a
remarkable transparency for those ultra-violet rays for which
oxygen is opaque.
   These observations show that                          all

1.
     IF    a powdered substance be scattered over a smooth
          plate, and the plate held near a pair of terminals
between which an electric spark is passing, the powder will
arrange itself in a more or less regular series of concentric
circles. The common centre of these circles (when the spark
is small) appears to be a point directly under that halfway
between the terminals.        The general appearance presented by
these curves will be     apparent  by a glance at the figures in the
Plate which   accompanies     this paper.   These are approximately
of the same size as the original. It will be noticed that the
figures roughly divide themselves into two classes—(1) those
with a clear space in the middle, and (2) those with a circular
   ace, within which the powder is apparently unaffected.
   The first class are obtained by holding the plate near to
the terminals, the distance varying with the energy of the
spark. The cleared space is irregularly elliptical, with                                              its
major axis          right angles
                    at                 the direction  to    the spark,                  of
and the area          of
                      the space increases        the intensity       as
                                                                    the                          of
spark increases.        The second class are formed when the
distance between the spark and plate              increased until the is
elliptical space ceases       maketo   appearance.    its
     2. Mode     ofObtaining the Curves.—The most convenient
arrangement and the one which gives the best results                                             is   as
follows:—An induction-coil has each of its terminals con
nected with      Leyden jar, and with one
                 a                                   the handles           of                     of

universal discharger. The plate with the powder scattered
over      from

 and capable of giving a small spark of about 1% inch long.
 When coupled with the Leyden jars, of course, the length of
 spark was much diminished.            In no case with either coil was
 a longer spark employed than 75 inch.                No change in the
 appearance, regularity, or shape of the figures was caused by
 replacing one coil by another.
    The effect of a difference in condensing-power was tried
 by interposing more jars.            Except that the vigour of the

 identical results.
     5.  Influence           of
                        Contact-Breaker.—It might            supposed,               be                      as
was done            by

 vacuo, that the intermittent character            the currents flowing of
in   the secondary wire caused                               by

primary-coil          the contact-breaker would have some influence
in  producing         regulating the curves. This, however,            not                             is
the case. The         shapes   did not alter                        no

curves was       produced.     Moreover the curves can                                         be
without the use                    of

different powders were examined, and the number of lines in
a certain distance counted.               Several determinations were
made and the mean number taken.                  Although every care was
taken to make these measurements as accurately as possible
and to avoid sources of error, yet, from the difficulties peculiar
to the case,   I do not wish to pledge the absolute accuracy of
the   numbers,     but put them forward as approximate only.
It first became necessary to ascertain if the fineness of the
powder affected the number of lines in a certain length. This
was found not to be the case. Provided the degree of fine
ness was such as to admit of the production of the lines
with such an amount of definiteness as sufficed for their
measurement, the number of lines was found to be unaltered.
The following tabular statement gives the results obtained.
The actual experiment was to count the number in a quarter
of an inch. These have been multiplied by 4, hence the
regularity of the diminution of the numbers given in the first

experiments, in order to confirm the numbers, it was found
that a particular sample of calcic oxide gave 48 lines to the
inch instead of 56, as given in the table.                 Upon examining

 the sample it was found, however, to be an old one, and to be
 partially converted into carbonate.    It was thus a mixture
 of oxide and carbonate. This led to the investigation
 of other mixtures.      It was thus proved that the number
 given by a mixture of two substances was intermediate be

 296        Dr. E. H. Cook on an Undulatory Movement
 a general thing; for in other cases tried, the numbers did not
 vary among themselves and agreed with those obtained with
 the coils.
    The common centre of the circles, instead of being, as with
 the coil, halfway between the terminals, seemed to be a little
 nearer the positive electrode than the negative. Other expe
 riments are, however, necessary before this can be regarded
 as established.
    In experimenting with this machine it is necessary to avoid
 placing the plate too near the terminals, otherwise the powder
 becomes electrified, and the plate also, and the resulting figures
 are combinations of those showing the distribution of the
 electricity upon the plate, and the undulatory effect discussed
 in this paper.
    Most of the figures obtained with the machine were caused
 by the spark passing between knobs. They are imperfect at
 the sides, in consequence of the undulatory effect being pre
 vented from making itself felt in those directions by the solid
 ãº
 body of the knob coming between.         Thus the portion of the
         shown are at right angles to the direction of the spark.
 The figure can of course be obtained from sparks taken
 between points, but it is more difficult.    It was particularly
 noticed in the course of these and some other experiments
 that, whilst substituting a knob for a point in a Wimshurst or
other machine increased the length of spark obtainable, it was
just the opposite with a coil ; for here the spark is consider
 ably reduced if taken between two knobs. The longest spark
with a coil is obtained either between two points, or between
one point and one knob or plate.
    It was also noticed that under the positive electrode the
powder was scattered so as to cause a space. This is some
times, but not always, the case under the negative.
    11. Production of the Cleared Space.—It will be observed
that the more or less elliptical space in the middle of the
figures is not present in all. It is only produced when the
plate is held close up to the terminals and when the vigour of
the spark is considerable. At a first glance at a figure con
taining the clear space, it appears that the lines are crowded
together at the ends of the major axis of the ellipse. Closer
examination and careful measurement will show, however,
that this is not the case, for the number of lines per unit of
length is the same whether measured at the ends of the major
or of the minor axis. In fact the appearance is just that of
concentric circles, formed of the powder, with the material
composing the smaller circles swept up so as to form the
irregular ellipse.

  From this fact, and also that the circles can be produced
without any clearing of the powder, I am led to conclude that
the production of the circles is due to an entirely different
cause to that producing the space, but that both are necessary
accompaniments of the disruptive discharge.
       Discussion of Results.--When these figures were first
     12.
obtained it was imagined that they were due to the sound
which accompanied the spark, and in fact gave a graphical
representation of the sound-waves. This view was to some
extent confirmed by finding that the same substance gave the
same number of waves in the same space.                       this be so,             If
however, then there ought to be no difference in the numbers
obtained with different powders; for the sound of the spark
produced by a coil is remarkably constant, and, if such a term
                                                  it,
can be rightly applied to                     unvarying pitch. This

may occur in some of the individual members, it is hardly
possible that the whole are erroneous.   It will therefore fol
low that undulations of a length of about one sixty-fourth of
an inch (taking the mean measurement) accompany the dis
ruptive discharge.

copied were taken for me by Mr. Dunscombe, of Bristol, and
were printed from the negatives without the latter being
touched in any way.
    Note, June 9, 1888.-Since the above was written, I have
been informed by Prof. Ricker that he has an apparatus in
his possession, made by the late Dr. Guthrie, which gives
somewhat similar results.     This was copied from one exhibited
at the Loan Exhibition of Scientific Apparatus in 1879.        It
consists of an elliptical dish with vertical walls.     Sand is
scattered over the bottom, a glass plate placed over the top,
and a series of electric sparks produced at one focus of the
ellipse. The sand will then be found to arrange itself in a
series of circular curves around the other focus.    The curves
thus produced bear a    striking  resemblance to those exhibited
in the Plate accompanying this paper, and are of course due to
the same cause.
XXXII.       On the Recalculation of certain Specific Heats at
   I<U+017F>iah   Temperatures, and the Specific Heat of Water.   By
   WiLLIAM SUTHERLAND, M.A., B.Sc."
          course of some work on molecular physics I was led
IN tothesearch for some accurate measurements of the specific
heats of liquids at high temperatures, and found that, although
Hirn  had conducted some good experiments, his results had
not been accepted on account of their disagreement with those
of Regnault. Thus, while for the heat necessary to raise
ether from 0° to t Hirn gives the formula
           q=-564t + 000799t”—0,268t'4-0,181t',
Regnault gives
                     q=-529t +.000296t".
For alcohol Hirn gives
         q=-4229t 4-00274t’–0,132               tº   +10,506t",
while IRegnault's formula is
               q=-5475t---00112tº +10,221               tº.
The great differences between the values for the specific heats

           certain Specific Heats at High Temperatures.       299
at 0°given by these formulae have naturally discredited Hirn's
results, seeing that Regnault's values at 0° are certainly nearly
correct.     In the case of CS, and CC!, Hirn's results are in
much better agreement with Regnault's ; but the above dis
crepancies, as they condemned Hirn's method, condemned
therefore the whole of his results.
    But by recalculating the specific heats from Hirn's experi
mental data     I have been able to bring his results at high
temperatures into good agreement with Regnault's at low, and
so to obtain expressions for the specific heats of ether, alcohol,
 CS, and CCI, from 0° up to 140°.
    Hirn (Ann. de Chim. et de Phys. sér. 4, x.) adopted the
method of cooling, but on so large a scale that he was able to
avoid the difficulties usually inherent in that method.       The
 vessel in which the liquids were heated was of about 8 litres
 capacity, and might be regarded as the bulb of a huge thermo
 meter, the stem of which was 11 metres long and was filled
 with mercury; the pressure of the mercury-column per
 mitted the temperature of the volatile liquids to be raised to
 160°.    The size of this apparatus allowed of the introduction
 of an efficient stirring mechanism to keep the whole mass of
 liquid uniform in temperature ; thus the radical difficulty of
 the method of cooling when used on a small scale was avoided.
    When the liquid in the bulb was heated, the overflow of
 mercury at the top of the stem enabled Hirn to measure very
 accurately the expansion of the liquid up to high temperatures,
 and gave him a connexion between the volume and tempera
 ture of the liquid at any moment in the process of cooling.
 In this way he succeeded in measuring the rate of cooling at
 temperatures ranging from 160° to 40°.
    Unfortunately he adopted a cumbersome and inaccurate
 method of treating his experimental numbers in order to obtain
 from them the specific heats.      Instead of estimating the rate
 of  cooling  direct from the  experimental  numbers, he found an
 empirical formula connecting the observed times and tempe
 ratures, and then from this, by differentiation, got the rate of
 change of temperature.        But it is obvious that this method
 becomes    dangerous   at low temperatures; for then the rate of
 change becomes slow, and inaccuracy in the formula which
 may not appear of appreciable importance in affecting the
  absolute value of the temperature at a given time, may
  seriously affect the value of the rate of change.       In other
 words, if the ordinate of a curve is approaching a stationary
 value, a formula may represent the absolute values of the
 ordinates fairly well and yet give large errors in the values of
 the small slope of the tangent.

300                    Mr. W. Sutherland on the Recalculation of
   Although Hirn's formulae represent his experiments excel
lently, yet they introduce in this manner a certain amount of
inaccuracy into his final determinations of the specific heats.
However, it is easy to calculate from his full published data
the correct values.
   The cooling of the large bulb is due to two causes—(1) ra
diation, and (2) introduction of cool liquid from the stem. As
it is the rate of cooling due to radiation only that is required
in the method of cooling, we must calculate this from the
actual rate of cooling.

published numbers can be clearly traced to an error of
copying, which, however, has had no effect on the original
calculations, so that the values of the specific heat at different
temperatures have been found correctly.
    The actual rates of cooling at different temperatures
were obtained from Hirn's data by dividing change of tem
perature by time elapsed during change and taking this as the
rate of cooling at the mean of the extreme temperatures.            The
actual rates thus found were              plotted     and a curve drawn
amongst the points. From the curve were then taken for use
in the formula the values of         v for 140°, 120°, 100°, and 80°.
As   the curves lay very steadily amongst the points down to
80° and not so well below that, it seemed advisable not to use
Hirn's results below that temperature, but to adopt Regnault's
data at lower temperatures.
   The following table contains in the first row for each sub
stance the actual rates of cooling; in the second the rates due
to radiation only in degrees per minute; and in the third the
specific heats.

 these liquids at 0°, I applied the method of least squares to
 Regnault's experiments by the ordinary calorimeter method,

  The numbers calculated for alcohol do not join on in a
continuous manner with those obtained from Regnault's ex
periments, so that a single formula of the above type is not
competent            to represent           both series.
   Regnault's formula has been given at the beginning of this
paper, and may be considered to hold from -10° to 50°; the
numbers tabulated above give for the specific heat of alcohol
from 80° to 140° the formula
                            d/d0=-445                +    002664-0.926.
If the two series of values given by these formulae are to join
on to one another in a continuous manner, there must be a
point of inflexion between 50° and 80° in the curve which
represents the relation of specific heat to temperature.
   Now it is a noteworthy fact that Regnault, in his experi
ments on the total heats of different liquids (that              the                               is,

But at high temperatures the high-pressure steam projected
the hot water with such violence into the calorimeter that it
was difficult to regulate the amount of hot water so that the
free surface of the water in the calorimeter should be within
the graduated neck; Regnault, therefore, had to modify his
method slightly. He admitted enough hot water not to raise
the surface into the graduated part of the neck; but then
added enough of the cold water which he had withdrawn to
bring the level of the water amongst the graduations. This
small weight of water never exceeded 100 grammes;                                                    let  it   be

has been made in this        fascinating     subject   of  Hydrodynamics,        and
so many new problems of interest have been attacked, that the
appearance of the present treatise is very welcome, containing, as
it does, the results of the most important investigations in the
mathematical theory of Hydrodynamics which have been made in
modern times, carefully brought down to date as closely as possible.
    The subject is a difficult one, and taxes to the utmost the ana
lytical resources of the mathematician; and so we find this treatise
bristling with formulas involving                             all
                                                 the functions yet invented;
not    only  the   algebraical     and circular functions              the ordinary         of
elementary text-books, but also the hyperbolic, elliptic, spherical,
 spheroidal, conical, and cylindrical functions               Gudermann, Abel,    of
 Jacobi, Weierstrass, Legendre, Lamé, Bessel, Mehler, and others.

Coordinates:” i. e. take a triangle PAB, ZPAB = 0, ZPBA = p ;
6, 4 are the coordinates of P. Several neat results are obtained;
the method, however, does not seem likely to be of general utility.
   Pages 99–184 are devoted to a very full and interesting account
by the Rev. T. C. Simmons, of what has been called the “Recent
Geometry of the Triangle.” There is nowhere to be found such a
handy account, so that we can recommend those of our readers who
want to know what it is all about to read this article.   If, further,

 computers to draw up these same seven-figure logarithmic tables,
 leaving the teacher to adopt Holiel's suggestions or not. One
 thing our author commends, though he does not yet adopt the
 practice, and that is the use—gradually coming into vogue amongst
 continental mathematicians—of        the logarithms of the Natural
 Series, &c., in place of the so-called Tabular Logarithms.   Several

 French treatises, in addition to the English one by Hymers (Dr.
 Casey does not recognize apparently as independent treatises in
 English any of the more modern works), as well as numerous
         in mathematical journals and college examination-papers,
  ave been drawn upon with the happiest results.      The outcome is
a work admirably adapted for students.        For the use of Physical
students especially the author, though he has been anticipated here,
gives a good systematic account of the Hyperbolic and other func
tions, which “from their great analogy to circular functions are very
interesting, and of great and increasing importance in Mathematical
Physics.”    The generality of English students, we believe, will
come across much that will be new to them in these pages, and
need not fear to find a dish of the crambe repetita.

of that line, which are generally at right angles to   each other, and
are frequently seen upon the same rock-surface.       The direction of
one of these is N. by W. in Antrim and Londonderry; N.W. over
the highlands of Fermanagh; and N.E., N., and N. by W. in
Donegal &c. That of the second set is W. 25° S., swinging round
to W. in Donegal and S.W. towards Galway Bay, and is strikingly
persistent throughout.      Besides these, a very few striations occur
which do not conform to these directions, and are attributable to
local ice-flows.
   The second set of striations was referred to the ice of the Scottish
 Glacial System, and evidence was cited from the researches of Messrs.
Symes and M*Henry, Dr. Geikie, and others in support of this
view, which is confirmed by the relative positions of the boulders
and their parent rocks.       Striae bearing westward have been ob
served at a height of 1100 feet in co. Mayo.
   The effects of the Irish Glacial System have been considered by
the Rev. W. Close, Mr. G. H. Kinahan, and Prof. Hull.           Striations
occur   up  to 1340 feet in  Donegal.     The ice of this  system   flowed
in a general S.E. direction to the S. of the axis.
   With regard to the relative age of the two sets of striae, it is
observable that those bearing northward are by far the most nume
rous; so that although it is reasonable to suppose that a considerable
accumulation of snow and ice obtained in the Irish area whilst the
Scotch system was gathering                            its
                                      maximum strength, the striations

logical point   view. His own collection contains over 600 specimens,
                       of
showing the graduation from unaltered limestones, through various
stages      change into numerous varieties
            of                                   “true metamorphic             of

rocks,” which, in their turn, shade into igneous rocks more and more
approaching the several modifications of the normal cooled magma
of the volcano. Moreover, such rocks come from depths where they
have not been affected by alterations of a secondary nature.
   He then gave a classification of the varieties of ejected blocks.
The Tertiary rocks are but slightly metamorphosed, whilst the lime
stones of Cretaceous or earlier age afford an almost unlimited series
of mineral aggregates.       Physical changes have converted them into
carbonaceous and saccharoidal marbles; next oxides and aluminates
have separated,      and silicates have been introduced. Such rocks
come under the definition of accidental ejectamenta. They are only
ejected when the apex of the crater-cavity, formed by an explosive
eruption, extends below the platform of the volcano into the under
lying rocks. He then traced the history of the eruptions of Somma
Vesuvius through divers phases, showing that it was only at a com
paratively late period that limestone-fragments were blown out,
though this had taken place long before the Plinian eruption.        The
stratified limestones have been chosen for the first part of this paper,
because their original lithological structure acts as a guide as we
proceed from a normal limestone to its extreme modifications.
   Part I.-The character of the limestones which underlie the plat
form of Vesuvius may be studied in the peninsula of Sorrento,
where the mass attains a thickness of 4700 feet. They are mag
nesian in varying proportions.        A table was given showing twenty
seven   analyses,  made   principally  by Ricciardi, the amount of MgO
ranging from 1 to 22 per cent. Silica rarely exceeds 2 or 3 per
cent., whereas in the greater number of limestones it is absent.
The bituminous matter, though a powerful colouring agent, usually
exists in quantities too small for estimation, but sometimes reaches
3 per cent.      Such are the materials out of which the extraordinary
series of   silicate-compounds     have been developed; and as these
materials of themselves could not form peridotes, micas, pyroxenes,
&c., it is clear that the silica, alumina, iron, fluorine, &c. must have
been introduced from without, viz., from the neighbouring igneous
magma. The author then discussed the question of the probable
methods, being inclined to favour the notion of vapour in combi
nation with acid gases.
   The bulk of the paper was occupied with a detailed description
of the microscopic structure of these stratified limestones and
their derivatives.      The author remarked that the same meta
morphic changes may be traced on a much grander scale amongst
the ejected blocks, and hinted at the similarity of these changes to
those of contact-phenomena as seen elsewhere, and even of regional
metamorphism, the two main factors to be considered being the
composition of the rock to be acted upon and that of the magma
acting.
   The changes which ensue in an impure limestone are, in the first
place, the carbonization of the bituminous contents, which are con
verted into graphite; and a kind of recrystallization, approaching
the saccharoidal structure, seems to have taken place, although the

stratification &c. is preserved. A few grains of peridote now begin
to make their appearance, chiefly as inclusions within the calcite
crystals, and thus by degrees the results already recorded are
effected.    In the early stages only is the metamorphism selective.
The order in which the new minerals seem to develop is the fol
lowing:—
     (1)    Peridote, Periclase, Humite.
     (2)    Spinel, Mica, Fluorite, Galena, Pyrites, Wollastonite.
     (3)    Garnet, Idocrase, Nepheline, Sodalite, Felspar.
   Many   of these minerals are crowded with microliths, which there
is reason to believe consist of pyroxene.

    A solution of any paramagnetic salt in a diamagnetic liquid may
be brought to a certain concentration at which it is magnetically
“inactive” in a given field. By the qualitative test alluded to it
was then found inactive in any other field; from this fact an indi
rect verification of the absolute constancy of the susceptibility of
both the liquid and the salt in solution is easily deduced. Various
salts and oxygen were thus tried,                              all

     Ifthe poles of the battery are reversed there is only a small
deflection; it seems that the illumination of the positive armature
is not effective.
   It is clearly the action of the ultra-violet radiation which pro
duces here the flow of negative electricity, as in the experiments
cited, the layer of air acquires a kind of unipolar conductivity.
     Ihave repeated these experiments with batteries of 1 to 100
elements.     For two Daniells, the distance of the disks being 2 to
3 millim., the deflections are 30 to 50 divisions, 1 division corre
sponding to 9 x 10-11 amperes.         With 100 zinc-water-copper
elements traces of a current are obtained even with disks separated
by 10 centim.
   Cleaning the solid disk increases the effect. The intensity of
the arc has great influence.    In order to investigate the laws of the
phenomenon the arc must be kept constant and the comparisons
be made as quickly as possible.
   By observing these precautions
clusions;–

                                        arrive at the following con
   (1)    If
           the surface illuminated is diminished (by covering 3,
3, # of the gauze with a screen) the current diminishes in pro
portion.
   (2) When the distance l of the disk is varied the current varies
also ; but it is not inversely proportional to l, and it seems rather
to follow the law i =          –tº–.
                               a + bl
     (3) When the electromotive force E which charges the disk is
increased the current constantly increases; so long as E is small
(to two Daniells) it is proportional to                       it,
                                                and then increases more
slowly.    The apparent resistance         the layer of   air seems thus   of                                   to
increase with the electromotive force.
 If   the two disks are      different metals, their electrical difference

          be

methods.
  It  would be interesting to extend this research to different gases
and at various pressures. The method started enables us to inves
tigate the electrical effects of radiation under conditions which are
much simpler, and more accessible to measurement, than in the
experiments of the authors cited above".
   The effect of the voltaic arc is enormously increased by intro
ducing certain metals; among those which I have tried, aluminium
is the most effective; then come zinc and lead. These,           think,    I
are the metals of which the ultra-violet     spectrum  is richest; it is
also to be observed that they are the most positive metals in Volta's
Series.
   I have made some experiments by another method.              Having
charged my gauze condenser by a battery, Ileave it insulated under
the action of the rays for some time, and           then measure the  I
discharge-current.     In order to increase the charge and retard the
loss due to the rays, a large and known capacity (standard mica
condenser) is joined to the illuminated condenser.     In this way the
resistance of the  layer of air may  be calculated; the results are in
agreement with those obtained by the first method.         If the disks
are of different metals, the effect of the rays tends to equalize their
potentials; and by connecting the two armatures by the galvano
meter, after a sufficient time a charge-current is obtained corre
sponding to the electrical difference of the metals.-Comptes Rendus,

 INVESTIGATIONS             ON        THE INFLUENCE OF MOISTURE ON THE
    LENGTH      OF CERTAIN               Woods, AND Ivory.   BY RUDOLFF
    HILDEBRAND.
    The results of this research are summed up by the author as
 follows:—
    (1) Within certain limits, the length of woods in the direction
 of their fibres depends on the proportions of water in the cell-wall,
 and with an absorption of water amounting to 20–30 per cent. the
 increase of length may amount to 0-1 to 2 per cent., according to
 the kind of wood.
     (2) The woods are shortest when all water is withdrawn from
 them.
    (3) Dry woods are highly hygroscopic.
    (4) Woods attain their greatest length by absorbing water from
 air charged with          it,        by
                           complete soaking with water.

   (5) The length of the woods increases, from the condition of
dryness, with the moisture.       After the wood has attained the
greatest length the absorption of water from moist air continues,
but more slowly than before.
   (6) Certain kinds of wood, after being completely dried, are
unable to attain the length which they have when air-dried. The
behaviour of plum-tree wood is very remarkable; after reaching a
certain maximum, which is inversely proportional to the increase
of moisture, its length decreases.
   (7) The length and weight of the woods increase with the rela
tive moisture of the air, and decrease with                             it.

    Glass.     By JoHN KERR, LL.D., Free Church Training

            discovered by Sir David Brewster, and studied by
him at some length, about seventy years ago. In the most of
his measurements and specifications of the effects of strain,

Brewster depended upon the observation of tints in the
polariscope, his              means and methods being the same
for strained media as for doubly-refracting crystals.             Plates
of glass were strained, either by ordinary forces or by local
changes of temperature, and were
in combination with          plates   of

quantity.

with a good degree of approximation,                difference of retar
dations of two     oppositely  polarized   rays, which passed through
the strained medium without               being    sensibly separated.

322                      Dr.   J.   Kerr's Experiments on                      the
oppositely polarized.      His immediate object in this fine ex
periment, and in some other work which he has mentioned but
left undescribed, was to dispose of doubts that had been ex
pressed by others, as to the reality of the double refraction
to which the new phenomena were referred by Brewster*.
    The next name that occurs prominently in the history of
the subject is that of M. Neumann, who constructed a mathe
matical theory of this action, based partly on Fresnel's general
theory of double refraction f. For a critical view of this

that Neumann's conclusions are certainly contrary              fact.                           to

 upon other media besides glass.        Among the most important
of  Wertheim's    general  conclusions are the following:—
    (1) The   optical  effects      dilatation and compression are
                                              of
 contrary; and they are equal when the strains are equal.

                               of                   optical effect are  of

thickness,    placed    with      their faces parallel, and principal
sections horizontal.         A pencil “ of lamp-light, through a
       º
vertical slit at    L,  falls first on a Foucault's prism, and is
polarized by it in a plane at 45° to the vertical ; it is then

ray and extraordinary in the crystal A are thus extraordinary
and ordinary in the crystal B ; and the birefringent action of
A is                 by that of B. The light enters A and leaves
 B as a  single  pencil;     but in the space between P and B it
passes as a couple of pencils V and H, about 14 millimetres
apart, and polarized in planes respectively vertical and hori
zontal. The pencil emitted from B is received at E through
a Nicol's prism, which is placed as for extinction with the
 Foucault at L. When the principal sections of A and B are

 fringes, which are due to differences of retardation of corre
sponding rays of the                      W and H.         By fine screw
 movements of the spar        B,   the fringes are widened or narrowed

 of equal thickness, attached to the horizontal axis of a small
piece resembling a Wollaston’s goniometer, and bearing a
 finely divided circle with vernier. The plates are inclined
 to each other at a small and constant angle which is chosen
 by the observer ; and when either plate is vertical, it is tra
 versed normally by the corresponding pencil V or H. When
 the compensator is turned through any angle, the retardations
 of the two pencils in the plates D are changed unequally,

a difference of retardations of the two pencils, true probably

five millionth of an inch of path in air.     Under very favour

 The screw-press being clamped firmly to a                  vertical
 stand, the slit-screen is brought into the course of the two
 pencils of the refractor, as            in section at F in the
diagram of art. 2: the refractor also is supposed to be so
arranged, that a rise of the fringes indicates a relative retar
dation of the pencil V.        Things being thus prepared, the
experimental proof of the proposition extends through the
four following cases, which are got by simple displacements
of the plate-stand.
   (1) W through compressed margin, H through slit ;
strain raises the fringes; V is retarded relatively, and there
fore absolutely.
   (2) V through extended margin, H through slit; strain
lowers the fringes; V is accelerated relatively, and there
fore absolutely.
    (3) H through compressed margin, W through slit ;
strain lowers the fringes; W is relatively accelerated, and H
therefore is absolutely retarded.
    (4) H through extended margin, W through slit ; strain
raises the fringes; W is relatively retarded, and H therefore
is absolutely accelerated.
    I  have reasoned here as if the strains in the margins of the
plate were pure vertical compression and pure vertical tension
 respectively, and also as if there were no strain behind the
slit, in the neutral part of the plate. It is certain that things
are not exactly thus ; and objection may therefore be made
to the proof as wanting in rigour.         If any doubts remain
on this account as to the truth of the      proposition,  they will
disappear very soon.
        e results of these experiments are quite regular. When
 a good plate is put in position unstrained, and the central
fringe is brought on the wire of reference, a quarter turn of
either screw of the press gives a clear displacement of the
fringes, always in the right direction of rise or fall according
to the proposition ; and as the strain is gradually increased,
the displacement of the fringes also increases           regularly,
through one, two, three, or more fringe-widths, till the plate
breaks. The effects are equally clear with different kinds of

    In the course of a few repetitions of the experiments, there
was another important result that presented itself: the four
preceding cases fell clearly into two sets—(1) and (2) as cases
of strong action, (3) and (4) of weak action ; but this de
serves a detached and formal statement.

   The screw-press is a rectangular frame of metal, with two
strong and fine-threaded screws passing through the top, and
bearing on a massive sliding piece of metal which is guided
                                                     i.
by the two sides of the frame. The winged plate stands
vertically between the plane base of the frame            the sliding
}.      being separated from the base by a dozen folds of tin
 oil, and from the sliding piece by plates of wood and india
rubber. When the whole piece is placed in a polariscope,
and the screws are worked forward with proper care, there is
an intense effect of pure vertical compression obtained in the
central pillar, without a trace of effect in either wing.      Pillar
and wings act as parts of one unbroken plate, which differ
only in regard to strain.
     he first use made of this piece, and of a similar plate
arranged roughly for vertical tension, was to revise the proofs
of propositions I. and II. Both propositions were fully verified,
the effects being sensibly neither better nor worse than
those obtained already with the bent plate.              Details are
omitted as   unnecessary.
                           PROPOSITION   IV.
   Things being still arranged as in propositions I. and II., it is
required to measure the strain-generated retardations of the
two pencils, and to show that, for the same strain, the greater
of these effects is eacactly or very nearly twice the less.

some rough measurements            with the bent plate and the

   To analyse the two strain-generated absolute retardations
which are compared in proposition IV., these retardations being
now viewed as composite effects of the strain, due partly to
change of refringent power of the glass, and partly to change of
thickness of the plate.

attempted under the present proposition and the two follow

of the component ray H is produced exclusively by a decrease
of velocity of the component ray V; and similarly, with
change of sign, in the case of vertical tension. This com

338                   Dr.    J.     Kerr's Experiments on the
heating is found, accordingly, to be compression along the
length of the plate, very intense at the heated surface, and
diminishing very rapidly inwards. The effect obtained in the
principal experiment with the heated plate admits therefore of
only one explanation:—a ray along a line of compression is
retarded by the strain".
     This is not such a simple result as it may at first ap
 pear to be : for the observed retardation is the sum of two
 terms, corresponding to e8m and (m–1)öe of the retardation a
 of art. 12, the first due to change of refringent power, and the
 second due to change of thickness of the glass                the rays;
                                                                                  lº,
 and the   experiment     gives  us no information as to the ratio of
 these terms; nor do we certainly know as yet even the sign
 of the first term. In this connexion             must mention some     I
 earlier experiments with a bent plate.
     16. The plate was taken from the same piece of light flint
                <U+017F>º
 as the heated plate of the last article, and was of the same
 length, but narrower; and it was strained in the same way as
 the bent plate of art. 3. It was fixed in the screw-press with
 its faces               so that the two pencils (vertical and very
 narrow) of the refractor traversed it along                length, one                its
 pencil very close          lateral surface, and the other           very                     at

 near the middle        the plate.    The action        this bent plate          of
 was not perfectly regular, the strains being complex, partly
 along the pencils and partly across; but upon the whole, and
 quite clearly, the effects were exactly contrary          those already              to
                 given              by

plate, the compression being really a small dilatation against
resistance, the glass is lengthened along a line of compression,
and the resultant effect for light along that line is a retardation.
   There is one thing, however, that                 I
                                           have neglected here,
perhaps unwarrantably, and that is the variation of index
with temperature (apart from strain) in the heated plate.
                           PROPOSITION         XII.
  For light passing along      the line of strain, as for light per
pendicular to that line, the velocity of transmission is diminished
by the strain in the case of compression, and increased by the
strain in the case of tension.
   17. In seeking for a rigorous proof of this proposition,                      I
have met with greater difficulties than in any other part of the
                                                 I
subject; but now, after many trials, find that the preceding
experiment with the heated plate, when properly modified,
serves the purpose perfectly.           *.
                                        that experiment, as described
in last article,  the observed retardation is a complex effect, due
apparently, but in degrees not known, to these four immediate
causes—(1) strain along the rays, (2) strain across the rays,
(3) local change of temperature of the medium, (4) local
change of length of the plate—difference of actions on the
two pencils being understood for each of the four.
   In the new experiment, the cause (3) is practically elimi
nated thus: the light passes near one edge of the plate, and
the heat is applied for several seconds along the opposite edge,
     .
which is 2 and 2% inches distant from the pencils. The effect
of (4) is eliminated by virtual immersion of the plate in
Canada balsam, this body having exactly the same index (1:58)
as the plate. The effect of (2) may be safely neglected.
   As in the former experiment, the plate is laid horizontally,
and the light passes along         length, one pencil almost grazing
                                  its
the           surface. Close        tothe plate,      frontin  the twoof
ends, and    in the course   ofthe two pencils, there are two small
panes   of  thin parallel glass, which are supported              fixed   in
positions independently       of the   plate,         so   as

the two ends      of  constant and fixed cell; and the interval
                       a

with Canada balsam. When the pieces are placed with proper

rature a little above 100° C., is laid along the remote edge of
the plate for a measured time, 3 to 6 seconds.      The effect in
the refractor is as distinct and regular as possible, and indi
cates a relative retardation of the pencil which is close to the
edge.    Though the temperature of the source is higher than
in the former experiment, the effects are much less intense,

the range of                 of the fringes being much smaller
(one third to two thirds of a fringe-width), and their changes
of inclination much less marked. To explain this decrease of
effect, we have to remember that the compression along the
length of the heated plate is much more intense at the heated
edge than at the opposite edge, and also much more concen
trated, much more rapid in       rate            to its       of

thus, in the ordinary language of Physical Optics. Glass in
a state of directional strain acts on light as a uniaxal crystal,
with optic axis parallel to the line of strain, the ordinary index
and the extraordinary being equal to m(1 + 2) and m respec
tively, where the small number 2 is positive in the case of
compression, negative in the case of tension, and       (it should be
added) sensibly proportional         the strain.

It   issurely not   an  accident, that these optical properties    of

342     Messrs. Trowbridge and Sabine on Wave-lengths
glass, thus inferred, are so remarkably similar to the acoustic
properties of the monochord.
   20.  I  conclude, for the present, with several of the simpler
inferences that may be drawn from the preceding specification
of wave-surface.
    (1) Consider Fresnel's experiment with compressed prisms.
The light in that experiment is refracted in a plane perpen
dicular to the line of strain. We see therefore, by reference
to the diagram of art. 18, that one of the polarized pencils (the
ordinary) is deviated by the strain, and the other not.                 have                       I
not   attempted    to  verify  this inference    directly   by  experiment.
    (2) Consider a plate which is strained in one direction
parallel to        its
                    faces, and       polarized ray which
                                             a                      incident                is
upon   it   inthe principal section, that                       is,
                                                         plane parallel
                                                                      in  a                                to
the line     of strain.    By calculation based            art.         19,   on            18    or       I
find that the difference                of
                                  retardations                      of
                                                     the two transmitted
rays varies directly               as

                                                        of                                                 of
refraction.      By exact measurements with               quartz compen       a
sator, through         considerable
                         a             range                   of
                                                   incidence (0°        70°),                     to
I  have succeeded          verifying
                              in       this inference    perfectly.
   (3) Consider         polarized ray, which
                         a                           incident      the same
                                                                    is                      on
plate  in
       a       plane perpendicular           the line  to    strain.    Both      of
refractions are ordinary, and the difference                retardations       of                          of
the two transmitted rays varies inversely                 the cosine       as
                                                                          the                         of

Academy.'        Communicated

             of Metallic Spectra in  the Ultra-Violet.          343
for 1885 and 1887, is an extremely valuable contribution to
the subject of spectrum analysis; it contains the material for
future generalization in regard to the molecular structure of
so-called elements, or in regard to the harmonic relations
which may exist between their wave-lengths.            Here can be
found in juxtaposition the results of various observers upon
 the metallic spectra of the same metal, and the student can
judge of the relative accuracy of the results. A superficial
 inspection of this Catalogue will show that even distinguished
 observers, like Thalén and Kirchhoff, often differ in their
 results by one part in 4000, or one part in 2500. No observer
 of metallic spectra gives results to more than one tenth of
    ngström's unit, or to more than one tenth of one wave-length.
  Physical science, however, now demands a greater degree of
 accuracy.      Various hypotheses in regard to the apparent
 coincidences between lines of metallic spectra and lines in the
 solar spectrum have been propounded, and can only be settled
  by more accurate measurements of wave-lengths. There are
    so questions constantly arising in regard to the displacement
 of lines of spectra due to the motion of the stars and to
  changes of temperature, which require a greater degree of
  accuracy in the measurement of wave-lengths of gaseous and
  metallic spectra than the results of previous observers afford.
  It may be remarked, that observations upon the metallic
  spectra of metals from the limits of the visible red to the
  limits of the visible violet have become comparatively easy;
  for the solar spectrum can be used to identify the lines of the
  metals, and to ascertain the wave-lengths.       It is only in the
  extreme infra-red region and in the ultra-violet that such ob
  servations become difficult.    In these regions we must trust to
  photography to reproduce, by long exposures of the sensitive
  plate, the feeble lines of metals which may manifest themselves
 there.    In the infra-red region, as far as wave-length 10,000,
 it is possible to photograph the solar lines, and we can com
 pare the spectra of such metallic lines as may exist between
 the A line and the limit 10,000 with the solar spectrum.
  Beyond this limit, and beyond wave-length 2800 in the violet,
  the solar spectrum disappears, and the problem of measuring
  the wave-length of metallic lines which extend beyond these
 limits becomes a difficult one.
     Besides the resolution of the difficulty of measuring the
  wave-lengths of the invisible rays of light with proper accu
  racy, the measurement of such wave-lengths is destined to
  prove a crucial test for various theories which must arise in
  the progress of physical science.     The lines of the metals are
 exceedingly numerous in the ultra-violet region, far more so

344     Messrs. Trowbridge and Sabine on Wave-lengths
than in the infra-red region.   If there are any harmonic rela
tions between the wave-lengths of the spectra of metals, it is
here that one might expect to observe such relations.    Indeed
Professor    Grünwald,   of  Prague,   has lately enunciated a
remarkable hypothesis upon the relations between the wave
lengths of so-called elements, and finds in the observations of
various observers in the ultra-violet a strong confirmation of
his hypothesis. In any theoretical work upon the grouping
of spectral lines, it is of fundamental importance that the
wave-lengths of the lines should be determined with as great
accuracy as possible.    The coincidence of metallic lines with
solar lines is at the best a doubtful piece of evidence.   This
evidence is of moment only when the number of coincidences
becomes great, and is accompanied by characteristic grouping.
A mistake of a wave-length in the question of position is
sufficient to destroy the support which the author of any
hypothesis might claim for                      it.
                Conditions             for Accuracy         of  Measurement.

        Messrs. Trowbridge and Sabine on Wave-lengths
                can be determined by simple linear measure
         Moreover,    it is desirable, as we have said, that the
underlying spectra should be brought to the same focus as the
overlying; for by this means we can compare the wave-lengths
of lines in the spectra of different orders, and halve our errors.
                     .
It is true that some confusion results from having the metallie
lines in the spectra of different orders photographed upon the
same plate;        a little experience enables one to separate the
lines with comparative ease, and the gain in accuracy com
pensates for the additional trouble.
   The apparatus which best answers the requisitions we have
pointed out is that of the concave grating of Rowland, with
 itspeculiar mounting, which has been fully described          the                           in

cated that  light of wave-lengths 4200 to 4800 in the first
spectrum and 2100 to 2400 in the second spectrum would fall
on the plate. The shutter was turned so as to expose only
the lower half of the plate and a photograph of the solar
 spectrum from 4200 to 4800 taken. The shutter was again
 turned, and the upper half of the plate given a long exposure
 to the light of the spark.         Both spectra were in focus. The
 wave-lengths of the metal lines were then found directly, by
 interpolation on the normal spectrum, from the solar lines
 whose values were given in Rowland’s Photographic Map
 and table of wave-lengths".           The interpolation was made by
 means of measurements on a divided engine.                   In order to

              of Metallic         Spectra in the          Ultra-Violet.                           349
     Effect   ofChange        of Temperature of Source of Light on
               Constancy       of Position of Metallic Lines.
    In the progress of the investigation we were much troubled
by a slight shifting in position of the metallic lines upon the
photographs.        This shifting could be observed when the
metallic lines were compared with a solar spectrum taken
upon the same plate.         The amount of this shifting in no case
amounted to more than 1 or 2 of a wave-length.                 At first we
thought it might be possible that there was a change in
refrangibility of the metallic lines due to a difference in
temperature of the source of light, and a long study was
made of the influence of the temperature of the source of light
upon    its  wave-length.       When        metal was burned
                                                                                          no in

                                   Conclusions.
     It   will be observed       that the corrections to be applied to
  the wave-lengths obtained by Liveing and Dewar are pro
  gressive in their nature when compared with those which
  must be applied to the results of Hartley and Adeney. The
  difficulty in identifying lines and determining coincidences
            ...i.
  by employing the tables of metallic spectra in the ultra
  violet,
  our   work;
                         by the British Association, is illustrated by
                  for certain lines measured by Liveing and Dewar,
  which are identified by the committee with lines given by
  Hartley and Adeney, are in reality removed from each other,
  one or two lines intervening.             In certain cases the lines of
  Liveing and Dewar are wholly beyond identification with
  those given by Hartley and Adeney.
     The results of our inquiry into the accuracy of the results
  of previous observers in measuring wave-lengths of metallic
  spectra in the ultra-violet can be summed up as follows:–
     1. We believe that the method of photographing images
  of the slit upon the photographic plate, due to Cornu, in
  order to determine positions, leads to unavoidable errors.

     2. The best method of determining wave-lengths of metallic
                                     mº
  spectra is by the use of concave gratings; for                     Ineasure
  ments are substituted for                     ones, underlying spectra
  are brought to the same focus as overlying spectra, and,
  since a great number of lines are in focus on the same plate,

the conditions are the same for all, viz. breadth of slit, length
of exposure, and source of light.
    3. Hypotheses in regard to coincidences of gaseous and
metallic spectra cannot be safely based upon existing measure
ments of spectra in the ultra-violet.
    4. The limit of the copper lines is extended by our investi
gation.

  XXXVIII.         On Thermoelectric Phenomena.          By J.  PA

                                                        temperature are
 WHEN            two different metals at the same
           put in contact with one another, they          assume a dif
ference of potential, and if a current be made to cross the
junction, a cooling          heating) effect is observed.     These two
facts are    evidently    $.
                          dependent   on one    another,  and a relation
must exist between them; but though the subject of Thermo
 electricity has been frequently considered, a satisfactory ex
planation appears yet to be found.
    Duhem, writing in 1886, says:—“L'analogie des lois qui
 régissent le phénomène de Peltier avec les lois des différences
 de niveau potentiel au contact de deux substances différentes
a porté certains physiciens à chercher une relation entre ces
 deux phénomènes, et a regarder le dégagement de chaleur
 qui correspond au phénomène de Peltier comme proportionnel
 à la chute que subit la valeur de la fonction potentielle.
 L'expérience a depuis longtemps démontré que cette propor
 tionnalité n'existait pas.”
    In this paper a very simple relation is obtained between the
 Peltier effect and the difference of potential.            I  have also
 found the difference of      potential  and the thermal effect at the
junction of two portions of the same metal at different tem
 peratures. Combining these results, we easily find an expression
  .
 for the electromotive force of a thermo-electric couple, and
 obtain an analytical proof of the fact, observed by Magnus,
 that no current is produced by unequal heating in a homoge:
 neous   circuit.
    It is  well known that when a current crosses a metallic
junction kept at a given constant temperature, the heat
absorbed (or given out) at the junction depends only on the
             of electricity that passes, and is independent of the
 strength of the current.

   Take, then, two plates, A, B, of two different metals, say
copper and iron, and connect them by a wire of either copper
or iron.   Parallel and close to these two plates place equal
plates of any metal whatever, as zinc, and connect the zinc
plates by long zinc wires with a large distant mass of the same
metal in the neutral state, so that the zinc plates are constantly
at the zero of potential.

    But the frequency needed to bring about an approximation
 towards the constant resistance is excessive; in copper, we
 require trillions per second.     This brings us to the third
 reason mentioned   ;  we have no  knowledge   of the properties of
 matter under such     circumstances,  or of aether either. The
 net result is that although it is infinitely more probable that
 the resistance should tend to constancy than to infinity, yet
 the real value is quite speculative".   Similar remarks apply to
 sudden discharges, as of lightning along a conductor.                                                                           *.

at the boundary of two layers E is continuous, and also H

continuous.      Equating, therefore, the expressions for E/H in
two   contiguous    media expresses the y of one in terms of the
y of the other. Carrying out this process from the origin

vorticity of e in spherical layers, proportional to V (or v0, in
general).    But it is scarcely necessary to say that these solu
tions in infinite series, of so very general a character, are more
 ornamental than useful. On the other hand, the immediate
integration of the differential equations to show the develop
 ment of waves becomes excessively difficult, from the great
 complexity, when there is a change of medium to produce
reflexion.
   46. Thin Metal Screens.—This case is sufficiently simple
to be useful.    Let there be at r=a, a thin metal sheet inter
posed between the inner and outer nonconducting dielectrics,
the latter extending to infinity.                If
                                        made infinitely thin, E is
continuous, and H discontinuous to an amount equal to 47t
times the conduction current (tangential) in the sheet.        Let
Ki be the conductance of the sheet (tangential) per unit area;

river or stream flowed to the sea; but the sandy beach had
been thrown up as a bank, at about high-tide level, obstructing
what might have been the direct outfall course for the stream
into the sea, and causing the stream to turn to                        right and                 its

to  the  phenomenon    that ignited platinum throws off minute par
ticles, and thus disengages dust, and this irrespective        how the                                     of

                        have been prevented by circumstances from
 completing this investigation.     Very special care was devoted to
 the   dryness of the air. For this purpose it passed through potash
 and   sulphuric acid into a large glass receiver, the bottom of which
 was covered with anhydrous phosphoric acid; the air-thermo
 meter was not filled with this until it had been stored for several
 days. The agreement between the coefficients with the various
 fillings was nevertheless insufficient; it varied for atmospheric
  pressure between 3667 and 3676.
      Iimagined now that the air of the town might contain variable
 quantities of hydrocarbons; in order to eliminate this factor                                      I
 passed the air through a hard-glass tube containing platinum wire,
 which was kept heated by a lamp placed underneath             The air                  it.
 passed afterwards through caustic potash and sulphuric acid into
 the reservoir.   When air was taken from this twenty-four hours
afterwards the coefficient              of
                                  tension was found            3731; air      to       be
taken from the same reservoir six      days afterwards,   3669.      then                     I
made several such determinations,           which        of
                                                      will mention one:I
the reservoir was filled after using the platinum wire; air removed
twelve hours afterwards gave 3767, after three days 3673, and
after six days 3670.
  It  appears thus that air which has passed over heated platinum
has apparently       very high coefficient
                        a                       tension, but after long

standing     loses this property.
              it                    This     explained    isthe fact that         by
particles are detached from the platinum which are            small that               so
they float for    long time

thermometer are partially liberated.       The value      the coefficient    of
of  tension thereby rises too high.   But the gas         ifrest for some    is   at
time, these particles settle down and the air       again pure.        is
      this explanation    correct,              possible     filtering the        by

398                       Mr. C. Barus   on the        Secular
that arch, disintegrate, and if the decomposition be of a kind
that the débris may be chemically recognized, then, by coordi
nating the viscous and the chemical observations, I obtain a
fairly good notion of the molecular mechanism which has
produced the viscous effect. This is the method        applied toI
prove Maxwell’s theory. But partial disintegration or recon
struction of molecules may easily be conceived to occur in
such a way as to escape detection altogether, or at least to
escape detection as much as does a break-up of configurations
of molecular wholes. It may,                  I
                                     think, be reasonably sup
posed that the solid molecule is of the form M, in which n is
variable; and any given value of n will occur less frequently
according as it is proportionately greater or less than the mean
or typical value of n for the solid. The effect of strain, of
change of strain, or even of long continued secular subsidence,
is merely to vary the distribution of molecules M., so that the
general properties of any observably finite part of the solid do
not change".
     I
     will adduce other points of view in succeeding papers;
but the suggestions stated are sufficient, I think, to show the
importance of discerning whether the cause of viscous defor
mation in tempered steel is the type of viscous deformation in
general; or whether, in using the phenomena of annealing
steel to test Maxwell's theory, I have merely interpreted the
exception to prove the rule. The result of such an investiga
tion, besides throwing light on the structure of solid matter,
must ultimately lead to inferences bearing directly on the
questions of fusion, solution, and volatilization.
   This inquiry being essentially a comparison of detail, will

nicate the data separately. The following results on the
secular annealing of cold glass-hard steel essentially sustain
the inferences of my last paper. They were omitted because
of the space occupied by the discussions there given. The
rods to which the data refer are of Stubs’s best steel, tempered
in a special apparatus”, by aid of which the wire heated to
redness electrically is suddenly whipped into water.      Freshly
quenched samples of wire showed specific resistances (0° C.)
as high as s—48.     All the rods were tested for longitudinal
uniformity of temper by stepping off, as it were, the resistance
of lengths of 2 centim. each, for each of the consecutive 3
centim. of wire. The total length being about 25 centim.,
eight measurements were thus made.          A device utilizing
Matthiessen and Hoskin's     method,  and provided   with a suit
able rider, enabled me to do this with reasonable accuracy.
Table I. contains the results as obtained with three batches of
wire, of the diameters 2p=<081 centim., '044 centim., and
‘127 centim. respectively.       The approximate resistance
(microhms) of the 2 centim. of length is designated by r.

  With    the exception of No. 9, the variations are, as a rule,
well within one per cent. of the electrical value of the interval
hard-soft. Where the resistance is larger or smaller than the
mean value, it is possible that the parts were accidentally
splashed by the water immediately before quenching, or
quenched at a different degree of red heat.      But inasmuch as
the series of measurements for each rod takes some time, and
as the effective resistances are necessarily small,    believe that                I
the rods are even more     homogeneous    than Table I. indicates;
for the errors introduced    by variations of temperature, by the
difficulty of clamping the thin, very brittle rods (soldering
would change the temper enormously), and by other incon
veniences    of manipulation, are by no means negligible.
Hence the degree of homogeneity found may be considered
quite satisfactory.
   In Table II.           I
                    give the mass m, length l, and density at
0° C., Ao, of some of the rods. The latter datum is essential
for the determination of the sections.   I shall also use it in
the future in  determining the secular volume-changes   of these
wires.   Rods Nos. 11 to 15 are too thin for direct measure
ment. Hence a mean value of Ao was here assumed.            may                              I
add that in the soft state the   density  of these rods is about
A0-7-80.

     Finally, Table IV. contains the electrical constants of these
 rods made about 37 months after the first measurement.                      It
 also contains the variations, Art, of the resistance per centi
 metre, as well as the variations, Aso, of the specific resistance.
 It will be seen that Aso is negative throughout, whereas the
 effect of atmospheric influence and the unavoidable abrasion in
 cleaning the surfaces of the wires before measurement, would
 produce a positive error. The same bridge and the same stan
 dards of German silver are used both in the measurements of
 Table   III.  and of Table IV. The fact that the wires differ in
 diameter, and therefore very largely in resistance, is a guaran
 tee against the effect of differences of sectional errors of the
                                    i.
 bridge-wire. Again, although Aso is essentially the difference
 of secular change between               steel wire and the German
 silver standards, the fact that two standards (1:0 ohm and
 0 1 ohm respectively) were used, at least partially eliminates

402                      On the Secular Annealing of Cold Hard Steel.
the error due to variations in the standards. Moreover, the
electrical effects of corresponding variations of temper (steel)
and of the drawn strain which the German silver may possibly
carry are enormously different.      For instance, if glass-hard
steel is boiled long  enough the  change of resistance may reach
12 per cent. and more. The effect of boiling German silver
is of the order of some tenths per cent."         Hence   appre                                                              I
hend no serious error in   ascribing  the whole of the observed
variation of so in Table IV. to secular annealing of the glass
hard steel rods under experiment.

404                          Prof. Raphael Meldola on the
         respect to the azo-derivatives of the 8-series, with
      With
which         I
         propose to deal in the present paper, the most striking
feature is the greater stability and the insolubility in aqueous
alkalies of the azo-3-naphthol compounds, a character to which
attention was first directed by Liebermann" as the result of
an observation made by Pfaff.      So also the corresponding                             8
naphthylamine azo-derivatives differ from the 2-compounds
in many particulars. The latter are distinctly basic and, as
previously stated, are capable of being diazotized, these
properties pointing to the presence of the NH2-group in the
compounds in question.     The 8-derivatives, on the other hand,
are less basic ; they form salts only with great difficulty f and
are diazotized with much less facility than the a-compoundst.
There are other points of difference between the two series to
which attention may also be directed. Thus the a-naphthol
azo compounds are readily alkylated S, while the correspondin
8-naphthol derivatives can only be imperfectly alkylated                                 |;
the former can also be easily acetylated, while the latter require
prolonged boiling with acetic anhydride and anhydrous sodium
acetate".
   The first attempts to write the formulae of the azo-compounds
of the 8-series on a different type to those of the 2-series were
made by Liebermann”, the authorff, and Zincke and Binde
wald ft. It is proposed now to consider briefly these different
formulae. The insolubility in alkalies of benzene-azo-3-naphthol
led Liebermann to the conclusion that this and analogous
compounds no longer contained hydroxyl, and he suggested a
formula which may be generalized as follows:–
                                            AH(-)ss X       .

   The formula proposed about the same time by the author
for the B-naphthylamine azo-derivatives was analogous to
Liebermann's, and was based on the assumption that the com
pounds in question no longer contained the NH2-group,
because it was thought at the time that they were non-basic
and could not be diazotized.  The formula was written:-

        Both this formula of Zincke's and that of the author indi
     cate a relationship of the B-naphthylamine azo-derivatives to
     the azimido-compounds of Griess, as was first pointed out by
     the author in 1884 *. These compounds would in fact be,
     according to this point of view, hydrazimides; and in apparent
     confirmation of this Zincke f made the important discovery
    that these and other orthoamidoazo-compounds lost two atoms
    of hydrogen under the influence of oxidizing agents and gave
    rise to colourless products resembling the azimido-compounds
    in appearance and properties.
        This account may be taken as a brief exposition of the views
    which have been, or are still held with respect to the consti
    tution of these 8-azo-compounds.       In accordance with the
    suggested     formulae, these derivatives no longer contain
    hydroxyl or amidogen, and this is considered to account for
    the differences in character which have already been pointed
    out.    According to the old view, the compounds in question
    would be formulated in the same manner as their 2-ana
    logues :—

   This result is considered by Jacobson to indicate the presence
of hydroxyl in the azo-naphthol compound ; but the evidence
is not so satisfactory as could be desired, because the reaction
takes place only at a high temperature (250°) in a sealed
tube.
   The most recent experimental evidence thus, on the whole,
appears to favour a reversion to the old view of the constitution
of the two groups of compounds; but the non-phenolic
character of the azo-naphthol B-derivatives and the other
differences pointed out are certainly not explained by the old
formulae.

410                   Prof. Raphael Meldola on the
difficulty of forming diazo-salts.          When once diazotized this
and analogous orthoamidoazo-compounds form tetrazo-salts,
which differ in so many ways from the corresponding com
pounds of the para- or 2-series that Zincke has suggested" the
closed chain formula:—
                 2N–N      . X/                         : N. X/

   It  would be out of place here to discuss the evidence in
favour of this formula, and I have only to express my con
currence there with.
   The relationship of orthoamidoazo-compounds                     to the
azimides is shown at once         by   the formula now   proposed.     The
oxidizing agent simply removes the two H-atoms:—

   These oxidized products are very stable and are not acted
upon by reducing-agents, a fact also expressed by the formula.
With reference to the azimides, theory indicates the existence
of two isomeric series derived from

    The first of these formulae was proposed by Griess for his
azimido-compounds, and the second by Kekulé and Laden
burg for the same compounds.              I have already given evidence
to the effect that the latter is      probably  the correct formulat, a
conclusion which has since been confirmed by Nölting and
Abtf. It follows, therefore, that Zincke's oxidized products
are not true azimido-compounds, but belong to the isomeric
series.      If the said products were constructed on Kekulé's
type, the orthoamidoazo-compounds would have the formula:—

   The proposed formulae account for the formation of 2-amido
6-naphthol and 8-amido-2-naphthol respectively on reduction.
 The insolubility in alkali appears from the fact that the H-atom
is not hydroxylic, but attached to an orygen atom which forms
part of a closed chain. This explains also why the 8-azo
compounds are more stable, and are so much less readily alky
lated or acetylated than the 2-derivatives.

which show that the energy carried away by the reflected and
refracted condensational-rarefactional waves (62) is very small
in comparison with the activity (63) of the incident distor
tional wave, whatever the angle of incidence.         It is to be
remarked that the   wave-length    of the condensational-rarefac
tional wave, in the upper medium for example, is a/3 of the
wave-length of the distortional wave, while, as we see by
(61), (46), (47), (48), their amplitudes of vibration are
comparable.    Hence if we suppose 2/8 infinitely small, we
must   suppose  the ratio of the vibrational amplitude of the
incident wave to          its
                        wave-length           infinitely small    to      be                              in

         hypothesis of Van't Hoff is based on the fundamental
THEprinciple     that the four valencies of the carbon atom are
directed from the centre of a regular tetrahedron towards the
angles. Without entering into any detailed explanation,                                                                        I
may be allowed briefly to notice that from this fundamental
principle follows the isomerism of bodies containing a carbon
atom combined with four different groups (called an asym
metric carbon atom), and this isomerism is found actually to
exist, and is characterized by possession by the two isomeric
compounds of enantiomorphous crystalline form and opposite
rotatory power. The two compounds are in fact represented
by formulae in space related to one another as the object to
on its
   image, the object being different from and not superposable
         its
       image, though the dimensions      both are the same.                   of
   Further, there follows from the fundamental principle that
there        isomerism
             is       an     different nature from the preced
                                               of    a

   From this it will appear that mesotartaric acid for example
is to be regarded as a geometrical isomer of dextro- and
lavotartaric acids, which two are optical isomers of one
another. Maleic and fumaric acids, again, are geometrical
isomers of which optical isomers are wanting.         This iso
merism, whether optical or geometrical, is due to the
presence of carbon atoms, whose images are different from the
original atoms, carbon atoms in short which are asymmetric.

the case is different, we have no longer a simple repetition of
the dehydrogenizing process.     It is not a mere change from a
single to a double linking which gives us terephthalic from
dihydroterephthalic acid.     The change is much more pro
found.    Hence we are unable to assert that in terephthalic
acid or in benzene we have carbon atoms united alternately
by double and single linkings.
   The constitution of benzene, to which v. Baeyer is led, is
essentially the same as that previously proposed by Prof.
Armstrong (this Journal, 1887, vol. xxiii. p. 108), namely,
that the six carbon atoms are singly linked, and that the six
free affinities react each upon                   all
                                      the rest, and are directed

isomers in general would be identical.    Such isomers in the
case of benzene derivatives we are not acquainted with ; we
might have expected, for instance, that salicylic aldehyd,
which contains two different substituting groups in the ortho
position, and which is also a body occurring in nature, would
have possessed rotatory power, and would have had an isomer
of equal but opposite rotatory power.
    But it may be that the isomerism in question, not being due
 to an asymmetric carbon atom, is one which is not charac
terized by the same properties as those whose isomerism is
due to such an atom, and that the two isomers have always
 been obtained as a mixture in equivalent proportions that we
know no means of separating them, that if separated they
 possess identical properties in most respects, and that we
know of no special property by which they may be dis
tinguished.
      n conclusion,               it remains to
                                  be noticed that the constitution
of benzene, as established      by von Baeyer, or as      have en                              I

And if we examine the properties of naphthalene we do not
find that it sustains the character of a benzene derivative.
The production of phthalic acid from it is not in favour of
such a view any more than the production of terephthalic
acid from succinosuccinic ether is in favour of this latter
body containing a benzene nucleus:
   Against the notion that naphthalene consists of two benzene
nuclei we have the fact of the comparatively easy oxidation
of one of the nuclei giving phthalic acid or naphthaquinone,
contrasted with the difficulty of so oxidizing benzene and

products, such as

difficulty of so reducing benzene.
   And these reactions receive a natural explanation when
naphthalene is considered as an unsaturated fatty compound.

XLIX.       Mean Intensity of Magnetization of Soft Iron Bars of
      Various Lengths in a Uniform Magnetic Field.       By A.
     TANAKADATÉ".
                          [Plates IV. & V.]
Th;      series of experiments now to be described on the
      mean intensity of magnetization in soft iron bars of
various lengths has been carried out in the Physical Labora
tory of Glasgow University, and in accordance with Sir
William Thomson's instructions.
   The experiments consisted in subjecting the piece of iron to
different strengths of magnetizing field, and in measuring
the magnetic moment thereby acquired. The amount of
residual magnetism was also observed by reducing the field
to zero after each magnetization.
   The magnetizing field was obtained as usual by means of
an electromagnetic solenoid consisting of fine insulated copper
wire, wound upon a brass tube. The length of the wound
part of the tube was 11-9 centim., and the total number of
turns 13158, so that the magnetic field due to 1 ampere was
4t 13158/11.9 x 10=1390 in C.G.S. units, neglecting the
effect due to the broken ends.           The current through the
solenoid was varied       by  inserting  resistances by steps.                                 Its
strength was measured                       by
                                 observing the difference      poten                 of

dissipated in carrying different bar-magnets      through the

                    Magnetization of Soft Iron Bars.                                               453
experiment was carried out in the Physical Laboratory of the
then Tokyo Daigaku.           It was very similar to the present one
in its  nature,  conducted,    however, in a different way, in so far
as the   magnetizing     field was kept constant while the mass of
iron magnetized was increased by steps.
    The arrangement of the magnetizing solenoid and the
magnetometer was the same as in the present experiment.
The dimensions of the solenoid were:—length 9:25 centim.;
external diameter 2 centim.; internal diameter 0-86 centim.;
number of turns of wire per centimetre 132-6.                 The length
of soft iron wire was 9 centim. and its diameter 1 millim.
    In the first experiment the magnetizing field of 46 C.G.S.
units was kept constant, and the soft iron wires were put into
the solenoid one by one. At first these wires were sucked
into the solenoid very vigorously, and the magnetometer
 readings were very nearly proportional to the number of wires
 in the solenoid. But when the number of iron wires was
 about 10, some of the wires began to throw themselves out of
 the solenoid, and even when pushed in again with a finger
 would jump out upon                    its
                                   removal.”      They were, however,
 capable       being kept

would be in C.G.S. units.     It thus seems that we may roughly
obtain the moments in C.G.S. by multiplying the numbers in
the y-ordinate of curves fig. 10 by 6:7, and the mean intensity
 of magnetization by multiplying the numbers in y—ordinate
of curves fig. 11 by 10.
    From the curves (Pl. IV. figs. 1 to 5)         construct the                    I
 following curves of mean intensity of magnetization as a
 function of the ratio length/diameter of the bar for differ
ent magnetizing fields. From these curves we see that the
intensity of magnetization falls very rapidly as the ratio
length/diameter diminishes.        As this ratio increases the
curves will bend toward the c-axis, and will ultimately be
parallel to it as long as the magnetization of ring-magnets is
finite.

of magnetization with several wires, the diagram (Pl. W.
fig. 13) of mean intensity of magnetization as function
of length/v/ sectional       area 47, that             what the ratio         is,

with the curves fig. 12, we see that they both show that for
very flat plates the mean intensity will              extremely small;       be

the data we have in the curves figs. 1 to 5. To do this we have
to reduce the bars to some common length and find their
several diameters which will make their shapes similar to the
original ones. Taking their common length, to be 1 cm.,
and finding the diameters and volumes which each of the
bars would come to have, we obtain from the Table given in
page   452:—

    To find, now, the induced magnetic moment due to any
field in any of the reduced bars, we have to take the mean
intensity of magnetization corresponding to that field from
the particular curve which belongs to the original bar; and
multiply that intensity by the reduced volume. The dia
gram (fig. 14) shows the increase of magnetic moment
due to the increase of the section of soft iron bars deduced
in this way.         On the top of the diagram numbers indicat
ing the ratio (diameter/length) are placed for convenience
of reference.         The moment here being given in C.G.S.
units for bars of 1 centim. long, we can find the moment
of induced magnetism due to any field for a soft iron bar of
any given dimensions, supposing the magnetization to be
independent of the absolute size of the bar. For this purpose
we have to take the moment corresponding to the particular
 ratio (diameter/length) of the given bar and the particular
 field required, and multiply that moment by the cube of the
 length. That is to say, within the limits to which the experi
 ments extend.
    The curves are similar in character to those obtained with
 a bundle of wires, only they are not so decidedly asymptotic
as the latter.       We cannot, however, draw a definite conclusion
 as to the real difference between the two cases, on account of
 the difference of the specimens of the wires employed. From
 both sets of these experiments we see that, after the diameter

                    called “the Amphisbaena.”                  459
the atmosphere at the other. A thread of quicksilver occupies
a portion of the tube, the space between the quicksilver
and the closed end being occupied by air. A uniformly
graduated scale, of any convenient dimensions, but whose zero
point is coincident with the closed end, is attached.  Since there
is no escape for the air contained between the quicksilver and
the closed end, this scale serves to determine the volume of
this air at any particular moment. The instrument can be
suspended vertically with the closed end either upwards or
downwards, and in these positions the volumes of the cushioned
air, as indicated by the end of the quicksilver thread, can be
ascertained. It is clear that when the closed end is upwards
this air is subject to a pressure which is the difference between
the atmospheric pressure and that due to a column of quick
silver equal in height to the length of the thread. But when
the closed end points downwards, the pressure of the cushioned
air is the sum of the atmospheric pressure and that due to the
length of the thread.
     hese two observations, then, enable one to find the relation
between the atmospheric pressure and that due to the thread
of quicksilver.
   Let H be the unknown height of the barometer;
        l be the length of the thread of quicksilver; .
        A be the reading of the volume of air enclosed, when
             the closed end of the tube is upwards;
        B be the reading of the volume, when the closed end
              is downwards.
   Then the product of the pressure and volume being the
same in the two cases, assuming the temperature constant,
                        (H–l) A = (H+l) B,
Or
                             _A+B
                          H=ºil.       -
   Thus the following rule applies:—Divide the sum of the
readings by their difference, and multiply by the length of
the quicksilver thread.
   Since the length of the quicksilver occurs as a factor, it is
obviously advantageous that it should be a simple number, as
10 inches.     Where centimetres are required, 25 centimetres
or 50 centimetres would be convenient quantities.
   Here it may be pointed out that the usual correction for
temperature may be made once for all, by having the thread

460       On a New Barometer, called “the Amphisbana.”
of quicksilver, not exactly 10 inches or 50 centimetres, but
such a length as would be 10 inches or 50 centimetres at
zero of temperature Centigrade.        Then, by taking the simple
number for use in the      calculation,  whatever the real length
may, on account of temperature, be, the final result is the
reduced barometer.
   A convenient length for a portable instrument would be
about 20 inches, with a 10-inch thread of quicksilver.
   The diameter of the tube should be small enough to main
tain continuity in the quicksilver.            12 millim. or one
twentieth of an inch answers      very  well.
   The value of an observation made with this instrument
would theoretically not be injured should the quicksilver
thread become, through mischance, discontinuous, so long as
all the liquid remained         the tube, though
                                            in         appears that             it

          first of these books is a fresh and pleasing indication that
 THE mathematical studies have taken vigorous root in the University
 of Buenos Ayres.        The change for the better, due in great part to
 the energy   and enthusiasm of Professor Valentin Balbin, deserves
 cordial  recognition   in this country, whose financial and trade rela
 tions with the    Argentine    Republic are yearly becoming more and
 more   important.     To the supply of text-books Professor Balbin
 has made    important    contributions; and the present work, though
 not  bearing   his name on the titlepage, claims him as godfather.
    As a  specimen   of printers' handicraft it is very satisfactory; the
 page is large (larger than that of Salmon's works), the margin
 is wide, and the type clear and generously spaced. The subject is
treated of in three Sections, viz.:-Determinants in General, occu
 pying 71 pages; Determinants of Special Form, occupying 43
 pages; and Applications of Determinants, occupying 66 pages.
 In all three the arrangement is most methodical : definition,
 theorem, and corollary following in order, with sufficient illustra
tions and examples interspersed to satisfy any ordinary student.
    With the first section very little fault can be found. The his
torical indications are rather seriously inaccurate—a venial weakness,
considering the rarity of such accuracy, and bearing in mind the
fact that the authors do not profess to have made any original
research on the subject. The reviewer, however, cannot too often
point out how misleading it is to say, for example, that Gauss
notably advanced the theory of determinants, that the notation
                                  al   b,    c,
                                  da   b,    C.

is due to Cauchy, that Leibnitz's notation was
or, indeed, that Leibnitz had       any notation     for determinants at all.
These and other such statements the authors should try to verify,

Messrs. Amorétti and Morales are not altogether to blame; they
have committed the indiscretion of trusting too faithfully an un
reliable European guide. We put it to them, however, to recon
sider now and decide whether the “multiple * determinant deserves
their support. To us, the “bag and baggage” policy seems the
only suitable one for such an usurper.

THIS very thick volume consists of numerous Reports and Maps
of investigations and surveys made and carried on under the
superintendence of Dr. Alfred R. C. Selwyn, C.M.G., F.R.S., &c.,
Director of the Canadian Survey. There are thirteen Reports,
lettered and paged separately, relating to various portions of the
Dominion of Canada, from Nova Scotia to British Columbia, and
northward to the Arctic Ocean.
   Report “A” (87 pages) is a summary of the operations of the
Survey for the year 1886, including work done at the Colonial
Exhibition in London; additions to the Library are also enume
rated.    Report “B” (129 pages, with a map) is on a geological
examination of the northern part of Vancouver Island and the
adjacent coasts, by Dr. G. M. Dawson.           Mr. J. F. Whiteaves
describes the fossils; and Prof.    J.  Macoun catalogues the plants
found there. The Meteorology is also noticed.         Report “D"   (41
pages, with a long section), by Mr. R. G. McConnell, treats of a
portion of the Rocky Mountains, chiefly along the line of the
Canadian Pacific Railway.      Mr.   J.  B. Tyrrell gives Report  “E”
(176 pages, with two maps) on a part of Northern Alberta in the
North-western Territory, and the western portions of Assiniboia and
 Saskatchewan.    Mr. J. F. Whiteaves describes the fossils in one
appendix; and Mr. D. B. Dowling enumerates the Lepidoptera in
another; Elevations and Indian names of places are also tabulated.
   Report “F” is preliminary (24 pages), by Mr. A. P. Low, on
the country between Lake Winnipeg and Hudson Bay. Botanical
and Meteorological observations are noted.         Dr. R. Bell reports
“G” (39 pages) on portions of the At-ta-wa-pish-kat and Albany
Rivers (Lonely Lake to James's Bay). Report “J,” by Dr. R.
W. Ellis (70 pages, with a map), relates to a portion of the Eastern
Townships of Quebec, especially to the Counties of Compton,
Stanstead, Beauce, Richmond, and Wolfe.             Report “M” (39
pages, with two maps) is on the Surface Geology of Northern New
Brunswick and South-eastern Quebec, by Mr. R. Chalmers.            Re
port “Nº” (19 pages, with a map), by Dr. L. W. Bailey and Mr.
W. McInnes, treats of portions of the Counties of Victoria,
Northumberland,     and Restigouche in New Brunswick. Messrs.
H. Fletcher and E. R. Faribault in Report “P” (163 pages) deal
with the Geology of the Counties of Guysborough, Antigonish,
Pictou, Colchester, and Halifax in Nova Scotia. Report       “R”   (62
pages, with map) consists of Dr. G. M. Dawson's systematized
notes accompanying a geological map of the Northern Portion of
the Dominion of Canada, East of the Rocky Mountains.             These
notes are supplementary to the sketch and map of the physical

                  Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                                         465
geography and geology of the Southern part of Canada, published
in 1884.
   Report “S” (86 pages) is a statistical account, by Mr. E. Coste,
of the production, value, exports, and imports of Minerals in
Canada during 1886 and previous years. These mineral statistics
deal with—antimony, arsenic, asbestus, coal, copper, gold, graphite,
gypsum, iron, lithographic stone, manganese, mica, mineral pig
ments, miscellaneous metals (lead, zinc, tin, mercury), petroleum
and naphtha, phosphate of lime, pyrites, salt, silver, and structural
materials.     Report “T” (42 pages), by Mr. G. Ch. Hoffmann,
assisted by  Messrs. F. D. Adams and E. B. Kenrick, consists of
chemical contributions to the Geology of Canada from the Labora
tory of the Survey, and treats of miscellaneous native minerals
(magnetic and non-magnetic platinum, arsenic, cinnabar, apatite,
cookeite, uraninite, coracite, uraconite, monazite, and smaltite),
natural waters, iron, copper, and manganese ores, gold and silver
assays, and miscellaneous examinations (shell-marl, carbonaceous
schist, cement-stone, and a saline deposit).
   Topographical, physical, and geological features are of course
carefully described wherever the Reports treat of these conditions
of country; natural-history occurrences are often noted ; and
the minerals and other materials of economic use are recorded
wherever met with.       Frequent and cordial acknowledgments of
help and information received from assistants, friends, and casual
acquaintances interested in Geology and                             its

           ON SOME PHENOMENA                    OF MIRAGE.             BY    J.   L. SORET.
    In travelling by the steamer from Geneva to Evian, between
twenty-five minutes past one and twenty minutes to four, on
June 4, a very hot day, on which the temperature of the air must
have been considerably higher than that of the lake, M. Soret
observed the ordinary variations of refraction in these circum
stances (fata morgana). The banks, which were really low, appeared
as if they terminated in raised beaches; but the phenomenon varied
greatly every minute.         M. Soret observed also for a few minutes
a mirage, described by M. Ch. Dufour (Bulletin de la Soc. Vaudoise des
Sc. Nat. 1854, vol.             iv.
                                129), between Yvoire and Thonon: look

ing   at
       a    sailing-boat coming near this latter place, the higher sails
are seen very white and shining; the lower sails appeared out                                          of
shape, elongated vertically, dark, and looking like two confused
superposed images.
    But the appearance which most struck M. Soret was the follow
ing,  as    hebelieves     has not yet been observed :—Between Yvoire
                           it
and Thonon was         seen,             on
                                   the side       the gulfof    Anthy,       ap  of               an
pearance        as   of
                    white  vapours,    the puffs     which werebyofsuperposed,
and were transported              to
                              the south-west        the wind. These tongues
of   vapour, changing every instant, stood out quite bright                dark              on   a
ground.       The   phenomenon       lasted rather     long  time.a   M. Soret
thinks                                           the layers
                                                          of     air, which

certain places presented conditions favourable for the production
mirage, and gave           partial and dark image

Yvoire and Anthy; further, when the disturbance                 the refraction    of
was less pronounced the image              the coast was not produced, and
                                                     of
these places appearing white had the appearance                        vapours.        of
Speaking generally, the phenomenon should                    manifested whenbe
            at the limit      which mirage         produced, and
                                 of at

ON   THE CHANGES IN THE SPECIFIC HEAT OF LIQUIDS NEAR THE
               CRITICAL TEMPERATURE. B.Y. P. DE HEEN.
   The author used the method of cooling. The steel cooling
vessel is half filled with the liquid in question, and in order to
produce a uniform temperature in the whole mass it rotates
about a horizontal axis. After being heated it is enclosed in a
copper envelope. For ether, amylene, and bromide of ethyle, there
was at the critical temperature a sudden diminution in the specific
heat.

         ELFCTROSCOPE          FOR PURPOSES OF DEMONSTRATION.
                                    BY B. KOLBE.
   This electroscope, which has been specially constructed for pur
  oses of demonstration, is visible on a clear ground at a distance of
30 to 50 feet; and gives large deflections, for, when charged, the
leaves are almost horizontal.              They consist of red silk paper, and
are   hung   in  stirrups   of fine silvered copper wire at the side of the
brass   rod,  the  upper  knob of which has a diameter of 2 centim. The
length of the leaves is 3-5 to 4 centim., and the breadth about 0:4
centim.      The end is provided with a semicircular enlargement
which is twisted at right angles, so that it always presents a surface
to the observer.
    The conducting rod is insulated by a stout ebonite stopper.
    It is important to choose a glass which conducts well, in order to
get rid of the disturbing influence of the glass sides. Moreover the
glass vessel must be so spacious that the leaves, even when charged,
are at a distance of 0:5 to 1 centim. from the glass.                  If the glass
is not a   good   conductor,     the vessel should be so wide that the leaves
(when horizontal) are at a distance of 2 to 2.5 centim. from the
 glass.
    It appears hitherto to have been usual to take a good insulating

 glass for electroscopes, by which these apparatus, especially those
 with gold and aluminium leaves, often fail in dry air; for such
 glass acts like a condenser, and only discharges slowly.            It is true
that good conducting glass is difficult to meet with. Among 184

opposed in the path of the current of the machine.

pends upon the prior history of the iron.      It is certainly so
small as to be negligible compared with the value of 2.

   There is a still more general way of establishing the rela
tion (6). Every dynamo may be regarded as an arrangement
of two circuits, a primary (or field-magnet) circuit and a
secondary (or induced or armature) circuit, between which
there is a coefficient of mutual induction M, which is caused
to vary by mechanically altering the configuration of the
system.            If
             the currents in the two circuits be called respect

perusal of the popular novel.
    The effect of this general craving for excitement is as inju
rious to the mind of the individual as it is to the intellectual
progress of the age.             If
                              the reading were limited to the works
of the   great  masters of   fiction, and the reader strove to study
them with a certain critical sense of their value, the result
might be wholesome; but a morbid appetite for the sensational
literature of the day can only be mischievous.
    Some modern writers of fiction, in endeavouring to be
realistic, introduce scientific details into their work.       If these
details were accurate there would be some compensation for
the injury inflicted in another direction; but they are in
general calculated to give as false views of science, as the
other details are often calculated to spoil the appetite for
more wholesome literature.
    A writer whose works are just now exceedingly popular has
the following astonishing statement, expressed in very ques
tionable grammar:—
    “We perceived a mass of stone was slowly rising from the
floor, and vanishing into the rock above, where doubtless
there was a cavity prepared to receive it.” This stone,
 weighing thirty tons, is supposed to have been lifted by
 means of “some very simple lever, which was moved ever so
little by pressure on a secret spot.”
    In another story by the same author, four persons in a
 canoe in the bowels of the earth receive their supplies of air
from that which a river had previously absorbed and then
liberated.
    But it may be said that the stories in which these events
 are recorded are of the Baron Munchausen species, and are so
 far in keeping with            its
                              method. But the same treatment                      is
 observed   ina  quasi-historical novel             by
                                              the same author, which
 deals with our contest with the Boers, and the cession           them       to

478         Mr. C. Tomlinson on the Weathering of Rocks,
fused way; and the slopes of many of the hills are strewn
with them, while the summits are formed of layers broken up
into separate blocks by weathering.        Some of these weathered
blocks resemble ruined masonry. Mr. Stow says that in the
Kolberg “ these shales have been denuded into a remarkably
shaped shoulder, jutting out, like the front of a portico, from
the mountain-side.       They appear to have been left perfectly
undisturbed upon the more ancient rocks forming the prin
cipal part of the mountain. These latter rocks rise on each
side into kopjes sixty feet high.       Signs of stratification may
be seen   very  distinctly  in the hill to the left.    Here two of
the layers have weathered until their surfaces have assumed
a rude columnar appearance.         The parts above these, and
also those which    cap  the other kopjes,  are composed of rather
more coarsely crystalline rocks. They also show lines of
stratification ; but, instead of the columnar appearance just
mentioned, they cleave into immense blocks, piled one on
the other, and looking in many places like Cyclopean walls
flanking the tops of the hills.”
     It
     appears from the above details that Mr. Haggard, seeing
the weathered mason-like blocks of the hills, supposed them to
be built up from the rounded boulders of the older boulder
bed.  The old boulder-clay is 1200 feet thick; the boulders
are smooth, but are not rounded “like cricket-balls;” and in
weathering or failing-out into the valleys they are often piled
one on the other to no great height, and they are kept in
place by mutual lateral support. The largest are rarely more
than six feet across; in short, there is nothing that can give
any sanction to the statement that in the Transvaal there are
columns formed of ball-shaped      boulders which have been
rounded by the action of water, and which have subsequently
been balanced one on the other. The statement is altogether
misleading, and therefore mischievous, and yet this writer
persists in it to the end ; for at page 330 we read:—“The
moon's first rays         lit
                       upon one     the extraordinary pillars
                                     of                          of
balanced boulders.”
     Inconnexion with our present subject may       be

    granite block, weighing above sixty tons, is so nicely balanced
,   that the strength of one man is sufficient to make it oscillate.
    He explains how granite disintegrates by weathering into
    rhomboidal and tabular masses, which by the further opera
    tion of air and moisture gradually lose their solid angles and
    approach the spheroidal form. The upper part of the cliff
    being more exposed to atmospheric influences than the parts
    beneath, it happens that these rounded masses frequently rest
    on tabular blocks; and as the lesser axes of these rude
    spheroids are perpendicular to the horizon, it is conceivable
    that some of them may be made to rock on their point of
    support.

that there is no room for the circulation of water, &c., a
formation like those near the Cheese Wring will be effected ;
or if a number of slabs be superposed and the lower ones be
more exposed to the weather, so as to catch the dripping and
drifting water from the upper, we get a formation like the
Cheese Wring, each slab being worn away at the edges, and
the lower ones much more than the upper, so that if it does
not topple over it may in time end in a Rocking Stone".
   Another of Mr. Haggard’s statements, given as if from
actual observation, seems to be nearly as erroneous as in the
former cases. He describes a bare strip of reldt as being “a
very dangerous spot in a thunderstorm, but a great safe
guard to the house and trees around it; for the iron-stone
cropped up here, and from the house one might generally see
flash after flash striking down on to it and even running and
zigzagging about         surface.”its  (Page 104.)

first time I noticed this appearance was when a chief was
travelling with me in my wagon. Seeing part of the fur of
his mantle which was exposed to slight friction by the move
ment of the wagon assume quite a luminous appearance, I
rubbed it smartly with the hand, and found it readily give
out bright sparks, accompanied with distinct cracks. “Don’t
you see          said I.
                   this?’   ‘The white man did not show us
this,” he replied  ; “we had it long before white men came
into the country,  we and our forefathers of old.’”            -
   But it is more to our  present purpose  to deal with electrical
phenomena at or     near the earth's surface.   Hence    propose                       I
to describe some remarkable cases of brush and glow dis
charge, both of which, according to Faraday, consist of a
charging of air, “the only difference being that the glow has
a continuous appearance from the constant renewal of the
same action in the same place, whereas the ramification is
due to    momentary independant and intermitting action of
              a
the same kind.”       In other words, a continuous discharge to
the air gives the glow, an interrupted one produces the brush,
and in a more exalted condition the spark.
   The Geneva correspondent of the ‘Times,’ in a letter to
that journal dated June 20th, 1880, and which appeared on
the 24th, speaks of a remarkable electrical phenomenon which
appeared    at Clarens on the afternoon of the previous
Thursday.     Heavy masses of rain-cloud hid the mountains

484            Mr. C. Tomlinson on                     the      Weathering of Rocks,
nous column was seen to descend in the direction of Chate
lard, and it is stated that the electricity could be distinctly
heard as it ran from point to point of an iron railing in the
cemetery. None of the persons referred to were hurt, they
only complained of an unpleasant sensation in the joints as if
they had been violently twisted, a sensation which lasted for
a few hours.
    A highly electrified condition of the atmosphere may thus
produce either the glow- or the brush-discharge.                Professor
James Forbes, while engaged in his remarkable study of the
glaciers of Switzerland, relates that on one occasion near
Mont Cervin, the atmosphere being very turbid and the
ground covered with half-melted snow, while about 1500 feet

alludes to the loud       rattling  or  crepitation      of the stones, due to
electrical    discharges.      On the summit of Piz Surley he notices
certain pricking and burning sensations, and sounds like that

   A very good                       relates the following cases".
During a storm, on the 19th of August, 1880, sparks appeared
to           from some lightning-conductors, some rising singly
and  disappearing   at a small height, expanding into a circular
flash, the light of which diminished from the centre to the
circumference.      In one case two luminous columns rose
simultaneously and parallel, and at a certain height coalesced
at right angles. On August 25th, in the same year, during
a thunder-storm and in full daylight, he saw a very brilliant
 body, slightly elongated (say from 30 to 40 centimetres long
 by 25 cm. broad) and with conical ends, pass from one part
 of a dense cloud to another. He states that he has often
noticed during thunderstorms a band of feeble light moment
arily illuminating a street, and reaching right across or only
part of the width.
   M. Trécul also relates the following curious case —On the
18th of August, 1876, while writing at an open window,
between 7 and 8 a.m., he observed, simultaneously with some
loud thunder, small luminous columns descend obliquely on
his paper, about two metres long and half a decimetre broad
at the widest part ; obtuse at the farther end, but gradually
thinning towards the table. They had mostly a reddish-yel
low tint : near the paper the tints were more intense and
varied.   In disappearing they left the paper with a slight
noise like that produced by pouring a little water on a hot
plate.
   Cases of this sort might be greatly multiplied, as also of
lightning quitting the conductor. The earliest case of this
kind occurs in Franklin's works (vol. i. p. 340), in which an
eye-witness relates that “he saw the lightning diffused over the
pavement, which was then very wet with rain, to the distance
of two or three yards from the foot of the conductor.”
 Franklin very properly remarks on this statement, that “it
seems to indicate that the earth under the pavement was very
dry, and that the rod should have been sunk deeper till it
came to moister earth, and therefore apter to receive and     dis
sipate the electric fluid" (p. 358). #. also gives a curious
case in which the lightning left the conductor on the outside
of a wall to strike the more capacious barrel of a gun resting
against the inside of the wall.
   I conclude with a few remarks on African thunderstorms,
in addition to what has already been said on that subject.

                    and certain Electrical Phenomena.                487
     Thunderstorms seem to be much more prevalent along the
east of Africa than in other parts, and electrical phenomena
are most striking in connexion with winds that have traversed
arid sandy regions. This is shown in the Kalahari desert.
Mr. Wilson remarks”:-“Towards Basutoland, from Novem
ber to April, the N.E. wind blows from the shores of the Mo
zambique and the delta of the Zambesi immense masses of
cloud which sweep heavily over the earth, darkening the sky
and preceded in their course by dreadful peals of thunder.
In the great Namaqua-land, as well as in the desert, rain falls
only from thunder-clouds.           These rise from the N.E.       There
is something terribly sublime in a real Kalaharithunder-storm.
There are the usual premonitory appearances.               At length a
cloud of dust      approaches,    a storm of wind rushes over the
plains, a few large spattering drops are heard, and then, with
an almost simultaneous blinding glare of lightning and deaf
ening crash of thunder, torrents of mingled hail and rain
descend.        In a few minutes the country is flooded. In an
hour the storm has passed.           Moffat states that in this district
            irº,
the lightning is of three kinds : one passing from cloud to
cloud; another, forked, passing
              ;      third,

                                        common,
                                                  the cloud and striking
the earth the                and most              is stream-, or chain
 lightning. It appears to rise from the earth in figures of
various                          zigzag, and obliquef, and sometimes
 like a    waterspout          ;
                        at sea it continues several seconds, while
 the observer can distinctly see it dissolve in pieces like a
 broken chain. The perpetual roar of awful thunder on these
 occasions may be conceived, since some 20 or more flashes
 may be counted in a minute. The lightning may also be seen
 passing upwards through the dense mass of vapour, and
 branching like the limbs of a naked tree on the blue sky
 above.”
      Mann f says of Natal, that the thunderstorms are of great
 intensity, but of short duration ; clouds gather over the hill
 tops and then spread rapidly out into the valleys. The storm,
 for the most part, breaks first in the hills and then moves
 rapidly off towards the east. The lightning is often extremely
 beautiful, the path of the discharge not unfrequently being
 seen upon the background of the clouds as a broad quivering
 ribbon.       Paraboloid and elliptical discharges amidst the clouds,
 with    descending    or radiating lines setting off from them, are

     This completes   the mathematical work. As a check upon
the   accuracy,   we may test satisfaction of differential equa
tions, and of the initial condition, and that the four solutions
join together with the proper discontinuities.
   73. The following is a general description of the manner
of establishing the steady flux. We put on e in the cylinder
when t=0.       The first effect inside is E1 = }e at the surface
and H1=E1/uv. This primary disturbance runs in to the
axis at speed v, varying at           front inversely its    the square                      as
root   of the distance from the      axis, thus   producing     momen

outside is very rapid when the front of E, has moved well out.
Thus, when vi =5a, we have Es=1-022e at r=a, and of
course, just outside, we have E4-022e ; and when vt=10a,
we have Es=1:005e, E, ='005e, at r=a.
   As regards H, starting when t=0 with the value e/2up at
r=a only, at the front of the inward or outward wave it is
E= +/wwH as usual. It is positive in the cylinder at first
and then changes to negative. Outside, it is first positive for
a short time and then negative for ever after.
   74. We can now see fully why the solution for a filament
eo of e can not be employed to build up more complex solu
tions in general, whilst that for a filament fo of curl e can be
so employed.      For, in the latter case, the disturbances come,
ab  initio, from the axis, because the lines of curl e are the
sources of disturbance, and they become a single line at the
axis. But in the former case it is not the body of the fila
ment, but        its
                 surface only, that       the real source, however

                                  4B. e.
Hence the sum of inward push from without and inward pull
from within, on the interface, is
                          3|A'+    3 (B-B)]e.
Hence for stability, or at least lability, it is necessary that
Al-H 4 (B-B') be positive, or at least zero.           Hence if A'-0,
 we must have B-B'.             And if A=0, we find, similarly, by
 considering a case in which a portion of (A, B) solid is
 embedded in (A', B') solid, that B' 2 B is necessary for
 stability or lability. Hence for stability or lability, if A=0
 and A'-0, we must have B-B'. The question does this
 suffice for stability, or at least lability, is not answered by mere
 consideration of the preceding spherical example: but that it
 does suffice follows from $$ 4, 5 of the Article.
     Mr. Glazebrook also yesterday evening showed me that my
 hypothesis of zero velocity for condensational-rarefactional
 wave allows the Stokes-Rankine-Rayleigh            hypothesis of aelo
 tropic effective inertia to become valid for the explanation of
 double refraction with exactly Fresnel's wave-surface, and
 with velocity of propagation depending properly on the direc
 tion of the vibration ; but with the direction of vibration
 perpendicular to the ray-direction : instead of being in the
  tangent-plane to the wave-surface as in Fresnel's theory, and
  as it essentially is in any theory which supposes the ether to
  be an incompressible solid. He promises a paper on this subject
  for the December Number of the Philosophical Magazine.

LVIII.      On Figures Produced by Electric Action on                      Photo
             graphic Dry Plates. By    BRowN*.        J.
                            [Plates      VI. & VII.]
Whº             photographing the electric discharge from an
          duction-coil it occurred to me to try what effect would
                                                                                 in
be produced on the plate by the discharge when taking place
directly on the sensitive film itself.
   A rather rapid photographic dry plate was laid film
upwards on a piece of sheet metal connected to one terminal
of the secondary, whose ordinary discharging points were set
about 3 centim. apart to act as a by-pass to the spark and
prevent it striking over the edge of the plate.          The end of a
wire from the other terminal rested on the centre of the film.
A single discharge from the coil was caused by moving                                its
mercury-break      by  hand, and the plate was then placed          the     in
developer.
   When the terminal wire                at
                                       the centre                 of
                                                        the plate was
negative, and particularly,         if        no
                                         discharge passed over the
edge   of  the plate, the result was like that represented                      at   A
(Plate VI.), which shows the typical negative form consisting
of  beautiful sharply defined symmetrical palm-like fronds                           on
irregular stems branching out from the centre where the
wire rested, together with           mass
                                      a        less distinct irregular

straggling lines also branching outwards, but not reaching                           so
far   asthe fronds.
   When the wire terminal was made positive and              discharge a
 caused under otherwise       precisely similar  conditions, the figure
 was quite different,     as   in   B,
                                  and consisted      the plateon   dark    of
irregular branchings sharply defined except near the centre,

terminal than at the negative; but with the poles not too far
apart they stretched across from one to the other in the form
of confused and irregular lines of flow.
   When the plate was laid as before on a metal sheet and
wires from both positive and negative terminals brought down
on the film, a discharge produced the characteristic figures
under their respective wires. These were best defined only
when no spark discharge crossed between the wires on the
plate ; and there was in this case no branching out of the
positive and negative markings towards each other, the induc
tive circuit sensibly completing itself through the metal sheet
under the plate.
   When the difference of potential was made sufficient to
produce spark-discharge between the terminals on the plate,
the resulting marking depended in several respects on the
presence or absence of a metal sheet under the plate.
   With no metal sheet, and the plate insulated on a block of
paraffin, the discharge took a fairly direct course between the
terminals C (Plate VII.), with only slight crookedness, but
sometimes in a double line.        On this plate the characteristic
 palm-fronds of the negative and dark branchings of the posi
tive pole are wanting, and the lighter tracery forms a rough
indication of confused lines of flow between the poles.
    With a sheet of foil pasted on the back of the plate (leaving
 a margin of about 2 centim. round the edge) and spark
 discharge between the terminals, there is exceedingly little, if
 any, distinct tendency of the positive and negative markings
 towards each other. The track of the main spark is very
 crooked, meandering over the plate in a quite irregular way,
 and making sometimes sharp distinct angles in                  course.          its

    The question now arose as to whether the result was due
 to a photographic effect of the luminosity of the spark, or to
 some more direct action of the discharge on the film—to what
might be called an “electrographic ’’ action.
    As evidence for the latter view came the apparent insuffi
ciency of the light, actually visible when the discharge took
place, to produce the effect.     The lighter branchings were not
                              all
to me visible at         either positive
                              in             negative, and only an    or

    There are also     the  positive
                                in    plate     (Plate VI.) several
intervals        the spark had not been
                as   if                          immediate contact         in B
with the film, but had passed over            leaving only   foggy      it,                       a

                           ofadefined black line. The break                                                 or
interval would scarcely have been            marked      the whole      so              if
effect were photographic only.
   However,      further investigate this question the discharge
                        to

the film to which the edge-marking may be due. There was
also on the   plate                 marking, apparently corre
sponding to the wrinkling of the foil in contact with the film.
   With a piece of gutta-percha tissue between the stencil
plate foil and the film, the result was similar, only the line
round the edges was narrower and the blotching less marked,
hence the initials came out more distinctly. When four thick
nesses of gutta-percha were interposed, there appeared only
blotchy markings on the part under the foil.

   These results would go to show that actual disruptive dis
charge over or in the film is not needed to produce an effect
visible on development, but that the figures are produced
partly at least by direct electric action on the sensitive film
without the intervention of a visibly luminous action, or
what would be usually understood as a purely photo-chemical
cause.    Possibly further investigation may show that we have
here a new          of experimental evidence on the relation of
electricity to light.

     may add that it is necessary, especially in the experiments
with the terminals on the back of the plate, to use rather
sensitive plates; “60 times” plates do very well, while slow
plates give imperfect figures in        cases and show almostall
nothing with the terminals       the back.       on

   Ever since the writer first" investigated the infra-red of the
solar spectrum to the extent of about three microns, he has
assumed, from                all
                       analogy, the probable existence           solar heat                  of
of  still greater wave-lengths, which, however,                has not till                he

recognize.       It is not easy to give an adequate idea of the
difficulties of observation which lead to this apparently para
doxical result, particularly as physicists are so far from having
yet investigated this region that even the barriers which have
closed it to research are themselves of an unfamiliar kind.                                        I
can perhaps best illustrate it by analogy.                  Every spectro
scopist knows how very hard it is to view the lines below A;
and that even A itself, though very large, is not an easy object
to see without special precautions. This arises not so much
 from the fact that the very deep red light here, like that of
dull glowing iron, feebly affects the eye, but, in a still greater
degree, because yellow and orange light exists in relatively
enormous quantity in the neighbouring parts of the visible
spectrum, and that irregularly diffused and reflected portions
of this light reappear where they do not belong and over
 power the radiation legitimately there.              Still we can put a
coloured glass before the slit and cut off the intruding light
in a great measure, and we can see the extraneous light which
comes in, and allow in some degree for                          its
                                                         effects; but here,

spectral region we are about           describe,

lengths; the typical lunar-spectrum heat is greatest in the
long wave-lengths. The explanation of the curious fact that
this particular quality of heat may be more easily recognized
where it exists in a less degree as in the lunar spectrum than
 where it is found in a relatively great degree as in the solar,
 will be still clearer if we consent (in continuance of the
 illustration) to further compare this lunar invisible radiation
 of great wave-length to the deep-red light from a piece of
 scarcely luminous hot iron. This peculiarly deep red is seen
 with little difficulty in the iron in a dark room, but never in
 daylight; yet it is of a quality which we know from theory
 must exist in far greater degree in the daylight itself; nor
 do we, even when we would isolate it in a certain part of the
 solar spectrum, see it there, because it is now obscured by the
 inevitable diffusion or reflexion of part of the neighbouring
 brilliant light which the prism ought to keep wholly away,
  but (owing to inevitable instrumental defects) does not. The
 dull glowing iron carries no white light along with         and                                    it,
therefore               its

between the lines    grows   more and more transmissible, while the

exactly the expression assumed by MacCullagh in his theory
of reflexion, and which Stokes has shown (B.A. Report, 1862,
p. 278) to be impossible as an expression for the energy of a
strained solid, for it leads to the equations Try =  Tyr, &c.,                            –
instead of   Ty-T,    where               T,
                                  means the stress parallel to
9 on a plane normal to a ; how, then, can it represent the
energy of the strained medium ?
   The explanation of this point is simple. The second ex
pression for W only gives the energy of the whole solid under
certain surface-conditions.   Each element of the integral is
not an expression for the energy of the corresponding element
of the solid; to find this we have to take into account the
surface-integrals introduced by the transformation.     These
surface-integrals it is true vanish when the whole medium is
considered; but in calculating the stresses on each element
they are of importance, and when they are taken into account
the true values are found for T., &c.   We cannot get these
values from the transformed expression directly, for that is
only true under certain conditions.

of the aether on either side of the surface.          In the paper this
relation is assumed to       simplify   the  formulae,   the foregoing

530          Mr. R. T. Glazebrook on the Application of the
of the        of the ellipsoid by the wave-front. According
            section
to Fresnel, O P is the direction of vibration in the ray O R.
According to the theory of the present paper this is not the
case.
º
    Let     PY be the tangent at P to the ellipse PN R, and OY
 perpendicular on PY. P. Y is the trace on the plane                                PNR
 of the tangent-plane to the ellipsoid ; and this plane is per
 pendicular to the plane P N R, so that O X is the normal to
 the tangent-plane at P. According to our theory, O Y is the
             of vibration, and moreover OY is perpendicular
to OR.
    Now experiment" shows us that Fresnel's construction for
the velocity is very closely indeed approached to ; and hence
A must be, if not actually zero, very small indeed. We
have, however, no exact experimental evidence on the direc
tion of vibration in a crystal; and it would be extremely
difficult to devise an experiment which would decide between
 Fresnel's result and that of the theory now suggested.            So
far, then, as experimental evidence is concerned we may claim
that the theory here given is in very close accordance with
our present results. It has moreover the extreme advantage
of basing the laws of double refraction on variations of the
property of the aether, on which ordinary reflexion and refrac
tion almost certainly depend.
    Refraction occurs because the optical density of the aether
 is different in different media; double refraction, because in
a crystal the optical density is different in different directions.
    It remains now to consider what is meant by the optical
density of the aether, and how it can vary in different media,
 or in different directions in the same medium. The phe
 nomena of aberration and the other optical effects produced
by the motion of transparent bodies are more easily explicable
if we suppose the actual density of the aether as well as                                 its
rigidity             be                          all

              to   the same          inbodies.    Let      make this
assumption for the present. Now the motion                 the aether
 within     atransparent body        not free    is  addition :   in
                                                                  the               to

persion we adopt the view due originally to Sellmeier" and
developed lately by Sir W. Thomson in the Baltimore
lectures. According to this view it arises from the absorp
         ºãº
tion of some of the light energy by the molecules of the
body, owing to the fact that the period of the light-waves
nearly              with that of the natural vibrations of the
molecules.    The term in U in our equation becomes appreci
able.   Of course in this case we need another equation to
determine the motion of the matter molecules. The forces
retarding this matter motion will arise partly from the reaction
of the aether and partly from that of the matter itself. As to
the expression for the latter we do not know what it            but                                      is,

measurements of refractive index, the above formula with
three terms agrees very closely with experiment from

The greatest difference is .0001 in the value of the refractive

form if we suppose Ai is large compared with A, so that we

   Again, according to Ketteler " , this formula will give the
dispersion in quartz with considerable accuracy from X=2:14

fairly with Langley’s          f

                    X = 2.356 to X = -3440.

   According to the dispersion formula given above, the value
of pº is infinite for A=\l or A=\,. For these values the
light will be absorbed in the medium.    Moreover, for values
of A somewhat greater than M, Hº becomes a real negative
quantity, and the light ceases to be transmitted.     Now the
characteristic   property of substances which show metallic
refraction    is,

the supposition that M is less than the wave-length of
part of the visible spectrum.        Now M is the wave-len
corresponding to the free periods of the matter vibrations.

those for any visible light. The application of the theory to thin

 Boussinesq in a similar manner.
    The consideration of phenomena connected with the rotation
of the plane of polarization must be deferred to a future article.
    It remains now to refer to one point of great importance
 which the theory as it stands will not explain.
    Experiment shows us that in the case of the reflexion of
 light from transparent media Fresnel's tangent-formula does
 not hold.     Some light is reflected near the polarizing angle.
 According to the theory the tangent-law is true at least when
 A   vanishes.
    Now it is clearly true that there must be a thin layer of the
 aether near the separating       surface of two media, air and glass
 say, across which the optical density of the aether changes
 from that of air to that of glass.             If this layer be infinitely
 thin  compared     with the     wave-length,        then the transition is
 practically sudden ; but if the layer has a thickness com
 parable with the wave-length, then effects such as are actually
 observed would occur. And L. Lorenz" has shown that the
 effects of elliptic polarization observed by Jamin would agree
 numerically with the results of a theory of gradual transition,
 if the thickness of the variable film lies between <U+017F>o and lºo
 of a wave-length.

—the light being very faint—hardly be noticed as colour by
an observer who was not specially directing his attention to
that point.                    I
                   hope, however, shortly to investigate this
question by direct experiment.           Such observations of a

siderable quantity from the black spot in a soap-film.          In
fact, if we take Reinold and Rücker's value for the thickness
of the black spot in a soap-film, the quantity of light reflected
from it is much greater than that observed by Jamin near the
polarizing-angle.    For, taking the case of normal incidence,

COMPRESSIBILITY OF THE GASEs oxygeN, HYDROGEN, NITROGEN,
   AND AIR UP. To 3000 ATMOSPHERES.                     BY M. E. H. AMAGAT.
    HAVE      followed the method which           I have already used for study
      ing liquids within the same limits of pressure, but the difficulty is
here far greater; it arises more especially from the smallness of the
volume which a gas occupies when it is somewhat powerfully com
pressed.                                    I
              After numerous trials, have arrived at perfectly regular
and concordant results by using for gauging the platinum-wire
tubes the method of reading by electrical contacts, which then
served to estimate in the same tubes the volumes successively
occupied by the compressed gas.
    I  thus obtained for the same gas with different tubes graphical
traces which are almost absolutely coincident.
    The results which         I  give further on, and which are merely
apparent results, differ materially (numerically) from those at
 which Natterer arrived.            The differences, which are somewhat
 irregularly distributed amount to several hundredths of atmo
                                   º
spheres in the part common to our researches; for the same reduc
tion in the volume of gas           I   find in general pressures far higher
 than those given by Natterer:                 this difference can be easily
accounted for if we discuss the probable and even inevitable errors
 inherent in the method pursued by this physicist.                The following
 results refer solely to high                   ; pressures below 1000 atmo
spheres will be investigated by an apparatus which enables me to
raise the temperature far higher than               I  have been able with very
 high pressures, where        I could only work between 0° and 50°.
    The following table gives for the pressures specified in the first
 column the volumes occupied at 15°, by unit masses of gas, at the
 same temperature and under the same pressure, 76 centim.

    It is interesting to compare the compressibilities of strongly
 compressed gases among each other and with liquids.                 In order to
 facilitate this comparison I have calculated from 500 atm. to 800
 atm. their coefficient of compressibility as usually defined with
 liquids.    The following is the table of results obtained:—

   It will thus be seen that at very high pressures oxygen, nitrogen,
and air have almost the same compressibility; it is of the same order
of magnitude as that of liquids; at 3000 atm., it is virtually equal
to that of alcohol under the normal pressure.
   The compressibility of hydrogen is far greater, almost double :
at 3000 atm., it is almost equal to that of ether towards the normal
pressure.
   It is easy to foresee that these compressibilities, like those of
liquids, should increase with the temperature; that is shown by the
following table with respect to hydrogen.

  The apparent densities are easily deduced from the former
table; assuming provisionally the number generally adopted for the
compressibility of glass, the following results are obtained at
3000 atm.

                  observations on BREWSTER’s NEUTRAL POINT.
                            BY MM.          J.        L. SORET AND C. SORET.

the sun, and which was discovered    Brewster, has been rarely               by

seen and determined,       to judge at any rate from the publications on
this   subject.     We have had occasion to observe it on the summit
of the Righi (height 1800 metres) on the mornings of September 23
and 24, the height of the sun over the horizon being from 20° to 35°.
   On the 23rd, from 8 to 9.40 A.M., in remarkably fine weather, it
was easy to observe, by means of a Savart's polariscope, that in
the immediate neighbourhood of the sun, above as well as below,
the polarization of light was negative; that is to say, that the plane
of polarization was perpendicular to the sun's azimuth.                    Below
the sun the fringes of the polariscope gradually diminished in
intensity, and disappeared at about 14° of angular distance; a little
lower, inverse fringes were seen, the visibility of which increased
to the horizon.      In order not to be dazzled we interposed an opaque
screen in front of the sun, or we placed ourselves in the shade of
the iron column of the balcony.
    Next day the sky was less clear; we have, however, been able
to repeat our observations.
    The angular distance of the neutral point is difficult to measure
owing to the feebleness of the polarization.             We have taken it by
determining by a sextant the height of the sun above the apparent
horizon, formed by distant mountains; then measuring the distance
of the neutral point from the horizon by a special apparatus suffi
ciently accurate to give angles to within 10"; the middle of the
neutral space was sighted, which occupied about 4°.
   The 24th September, by the aid of this latter apparatus, we have
also determined simultaneously the distance of the neutral point
above the sun (Babinet's neutral point).
   The following are the numbers which we have obtained:—
                                             Distance of the neutral point
                                                     from the Sun.

   These measurements for the distance of Brewster's neutral point
from the sun give very high numbers compared with those which

Brewster himself and M. F. Busch found. Is this a consequence
of the altitude at which the observations are made 2 It would be
premature to assert this.-Comptes rendus, October 15, 1888.
