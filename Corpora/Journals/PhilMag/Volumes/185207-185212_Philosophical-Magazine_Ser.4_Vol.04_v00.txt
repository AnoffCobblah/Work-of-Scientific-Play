THEwhich       a number of experimental facts connected with the

they intersect; so that (3) in the case represented in the author's
fig. (20), supposing abstractedly two pairs of interfering rays
(such as BC, AC, and BD, AD), it is evident that the fringes at
D ought to be broader than those at C, not owing to any differ
ence in the routes, but because the angle                             BDA is less than BCA;

            Prof. Powell's Remarks    on   Lord Brougham's
 certain distance there remain only the fringes on the other side,
 or on that of the edge nearest the origin, which diverge further
 into the shadow on that side as the breadth of the effective aper
 ture is diminished.
     In this way, then, the second edge, if beyond the limits of
 distance mentioned, will cause an appearance of fringes on the
 side towards the first edge diverging into the shadow.
     With regard to the bearing of this experiment on theory, it is
 in the first instance necessary to bear in mind, that, according to
 the undulatory theory, neither the formation of fringes, nor any
shifting of those fringes, implies a Flexure in the rays; in this
 theory no such idea is introduced or needed.
     In the particular case in question, when the two edges are at
 the same distance from the origin forming a narrow aperture,
the nature of the fringes is perfectly explained and reduced to
quantitative results by Fresnel's theory.
     When the second edge is placed as in Lord Brougham’s ex
periments, at a greater distance along the ray, this would be
equivalent to a wide aperture placed obliquely to the direction
of the ray, so as to be effectively as narrow as before.          Now this
case is one which has not yet been reduced to calculation.
     The formulas of Fresnel, even in the simplest cases, are con
siderably complicated, and involve integrations which cannot be
generally exhibited in a finite form.          In the cases of a single
edge, or that of an aperture when it is a long narrow parallelo
gram, an equilateral triangle, or a circle, the integration has
been performed in a way sufficient for calculation*.
     In the case of the oblique aperture, at my request, a friend
eminently versed in the analysis of the subject, undertook to
work out the formulas; and he pursued the inquiry far enough
to be able to say that they became immensely complicated; still
it could not be certain that they might not be made to yield to
proper treatment, should anyone think it worth while to follow
up the attempt.
    But further, this particular case has been considered, though
only in a general way, by Fresnelt.          Upon the obvious geome
trical construction he points out the general conditions for de
termining the position of a fringe, and shows that the fringes
will in this case undergo a modification, and will not be symme
trical, but more expanded on one side than the other, which
exactly agrees with observation.

6           Prof. Powell's Remarks on Lord Brougham's
sult: indeed it would clearly be inconsistent with the former
experiments that it should be otherwise,
    Prop.   VI.   appears precisely to express Fresnel's conclusion
 (above referred to), that with two edges at unequal distances from
the origin, the fringes will be broader on the side towards the
 edge most remote from the origin, which is again more precisely
exhibited in Prop. VIII., when the aperture is sufficiently narrow
to give a white centred image; the same regard being had to the
limits in distance as before.
   In Prop. VII. the meaning is by no means obvious; but it seems
to amount experimentally to this, that with one edge only, the
fringe nearest that edge is the broadest; and that when a second
edge acts opposite to it at some distance along the ray, but so as
to give the fringes of an aperture, then among the fringes of each
set, those towards the middle of the aperture are the broadest :
the first being obviously the case of the external fringes; the
second easily verified, and agreeing with the ordinary case of an
aperture with edges at the same distance; while as to the appli
cation of the undulatory theory, we can only make the same re
marks as before.
    In the Additional Observations, (3), p. 254, the truth of the
general assertion, that when fringes are formed by two edges, a
third can affect them only when parallel and not when at right
angles to them, is indeed obvious; but the precise conditions of the
experiment mentioned are difficult to understand. It would seem
to consist in first forming the fringes of a narrow aperture with
a broad white centre in the ordinary way; and then in that white
centre producing new fringes by a third edge nearer to the screen:
these, however, the author affirms, will be formed only when the
third edge is parallel to the aperture and not when at right angles
to it; they are also described as brighter and narrower than the
ordinary fringes. The author cautions us against confounding
them with the ordinary external fringes, and proceeds to argue
that they are of a different nature, for several reasons, but
chiefly because (Exp. 1) they do not increase in breadth when
the aperture is narrowed, and (Exp. 2) because their breadth
increases as the distance of the third edge from the aperture is
diminished, the third edge remaining at the same distance from
the screen.             -
.  The last results (which    I  have fully verified) do not appear
to me to evince any peculiarity: relatively to the third edge,
the aperture may be regarded as a new origin of light, in which
light the third edge gives   itsexternal fringes.
   But with respect     the first part
                        to              of  the proposition, viz. that
these  fringes are only  formed    parallel  to  the aperture, on  re
peatedly trying the experiment,    I   have    uniformly  found them

  “Experiments and Observations on the Properties                                                    of Light.”           7
formed equally, whether the edge be parallel or perpendicular to
the aperture; though in the latter case they may for obvious
reasons be less distinct and conspicuous.
   It might indeed be fully admitted that the rays forming the
white centre may be in some respects under different conditions
from the ordinary rays, and that thus the fringes formed in them
might possibly be different: I can only say that I have never
been able to detect any such difference.
     If,
      indeed, the author's meaning     that these fringes extended        be
in  any degree into the lateral fringes,        obvious that they                 it   is
would     mutually
               be    affected    way  conformable      previous ex

   One other remark        the author deserves especial attention*;

                                                                in   a
ray might       continually bent round
                        be                  opake body; and thus             an                                          a
luminous    object might      seen, though        be

  2. The dynamical theory of heat, thus established by Sir
Humphry Davy, is extended to radiant heat by the discovery
of phaenomena, especially those of the polarization of radiant
heat, which render it excessively probable that heat propagated
through “vacant space,” or through diathermanic substances, con
sists of waves of transverse vibrations,in an all-pervading medium.
   3. The recent discoveries made by Mayer and Joule+, of the
generation of heat through the friction of fluids in motion, and
by the magneto-electric excitation of galvanic currents, would
either of them be sufficient to demonstrate the immateriality of
heat; and would so afford, if required, a perfect confirmation of
Sir Humphry Davy's views.
   4. Considering it as thus established, that heat is not a sub
stance, but a dynamical form of mechanical effect, we perceive
that there must be an equivalence between mechanical work and
heat, as between cause and effect.     The first published statement
of this   principle  appears to be in Mayer's Bemerkungen über
die Kräfte der unbelebten Naturt, which contains some correct
views regarding the mutual convertibility of heat and mechanical
effect, along with a false analogy between the approach of a
weight to the earth and a diminution of the volume of a conti
nuous substance, on which an attempt is founded to find nume
rically the mechanical equivalent of a given quantity of heat. In
a paper published about fourteen months later,  “On the Calorific
Effects of Magneto-Electricity    and the Mechanical Value of
Heat<U+017F>,” Mr. Joule of Manchester expresses very distinctly the
consequences regarding the mutual convertibility of heat and
mechanical effect which follow from the fact, that heat is not a
substance but a state of motion; and investigates on unquestion
able principles the “absolute numerical relations,” according to
which heat is connected with mechanical power; verifying expe
rimentally, that whenever heat is generated from purely mecha
nical action, and no other effect produced, whether it be by
means of the friction of fluids or by the magneto-electric excita

 which he calls “the mechanical equivalent of heat.” Since the
 publication of that paper, Mr. Joule has made numerous series
 of experiments for determining with as much accuracy as possible
 the mechanical equivalent of heat so defined, and has given
 accounts of them in various communications to the British
 Association, to the Philosophical Magazine, to the Royal Society,
 and to the French Institute.
     5. Important contributions to the dynamical theory of heat
 have recently been made by Rankine and Clausius; who, by
                 reasoning analogous to Carnot's on the motive
 power of heat, but founded on an axiom contrary to his funda.
 mental axiom, have arrived at some remarkable conclusions,
 The researches of these authors have been published in the
 Transactions of this Society, and in Poggendorff’s Annalen, du
 ring the past year; and they are more particularly referred to
 below in connexion with corresponding parts of the investiga

     [Various statements regarding animal heat, and the heat of
 combustion and chemical combination, are made in the writings
 of Liebig, (as, for instance, the statement quoted in the foot-note
 added to § 18 below,) which virtually imply the convertibili
 of heat into mechanical effect, and which are inconsistent wit
any other than the dynamical theory of heat.]

    6. The object of the present paper is threefold:—
    (1.) To show what modifications of the conclusions arrived at
by Carnot, and by others who have followed his peculiar mode
of reasoning regarding the motive power of heat, must be made
when the hypothesis of the dynamical theory, contrary as it is
to Carnot's fundamental hypothesis, is adopted.
    (2.) To point out the significance in the dynamical theory, of
the numerical results deduced from                    observations on
steam, and communicated       about two years ago to the Society,
with an account of Carnot's theory, by the author of the present
paper; and to show that by taking these numbers (subject to
correction when accurate experimental data regarding the den
sity of saturated steam shall have been afforded), in connexion
with Joule’s mechanical equivalent of a thermal unit, a complete
theory of the motive power of heat, within the temperature limits
of the experimental data, is obtained.
    (3.) To point out some remarkable relations connecting the
physical properties of   all  substances, established  by   reasoning
analogous          of  Carnot, but founded       parton  the contrary

gine”.     He proved it by demonstrating that a negation of it
would    require the admission that there might be a self-acting
machine constructed which would produce mechanical effect inde
finitely, without any source either in heat or the consumption of
materials, or any other physical agency; but this demonstration
involves, fundamentally, the assumption that, in “a complete
cycle of operations,” the medium parts with exactly the same
quantity of heat as it receives.  A very strong expression of doubt
regarding the truth of this assumption, as a universal principle, is
given by Carnot himself+; and that it is false, where mechanical

from thermal agency *. As yet this has not been done for the
electrical method, as far as regards the criterion of a perfect
engine implied in the second proposition, and probably cannot
be done without certain limitations; but the application of the
first proposition has been very thoroughly investigated, and veri
fied experimentally by Mr. Joule in his researches “On the Ca
lorific Effects of Magneto-Electricity;” and on it is founded one
of his ways of determining experimentally the mechanical equi
valent of heat.    Thus, from his discovery of the laws of genera
tion of heat in the galvanic circuitt, it follows that when mecha
nical work by means of a magneto-electric machine is the source
of the galvanism, the heat generated in any given portion of the
fixed part of the circuit is proportional to the whole work spent ;
and from his experimental demonstration that heat is developed
in any moving part of the circuit at exactly the same rate as if
it were at rest, and traversed by a current of the same strength,
he is enabled to conclude—
    (1.) That heat may be created by working a magneto-electric
machine.
    (2.) That if the current excited be not allowed to produce any
other than thermal effects, the total quantity of heat produced is
in         all
        circumstances exactly proportional      the quantity  work                 to                             of

 that, when an electrical current is continuously produced from a
 purely thermal source, the quantities of heat evolved electrically
 in the different homogeneous parts of the circuit are only com
 pensations for a loss from the junctions of the different metals,
 or that, when the effect of the current is entirely thermal, there
 must be just as much heat emitted from the parts not affected
by the source as is taken from the source.
     17. Lastly 4, when a current produced by thermal agency is
                                                               jºi
made to work an engine and produce mechanical effect, there
will be less heat emitted from the parts of the circuit not affected
 by the source than is taken in from the source, by an amount
 precisely equivalent to the mechanical effect                           ; since
Joule demonstrates experimentally, that a current from any kind
 of source driving an engine, produces in the engine just as much
less heat than it would produce in a fixed wire exercising the
same resistance as is equivalent to the mechanical effect produced
 by the engine.
     18. The equality of thermal effects, resulting from equal
 causes through very different means, is beautifully illustrated by
the following statement, drawn from Mr. Joule's paper on mag
neto-electricityt.
mechanical theory of thermo-electric      currents, in various papers communi
cated to the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and to this Magazine, had been     I
 acquainted with it in time.—W. T. March 20, 1852.]
      This reasoning was suggested to me by the following passage con
tained in a letter which I received from Mr. Joule on the 8th of July 1847.
“In Peltier's experiment on cold produced at the bismuth and antimony
solder, we have an instance of the conversion of heat into the mechanical
force of the current,” which must have been meant as an answer to a re
mark I had made, that no evidence could be adduced to show that heat is
ever put out of existence.      I now fully admit the force of that answer;
but it would require a proof that there is more heat put out of existence at
the heated soldering [or in this and other parts of the circuit] than is
created at the cold soldering, [and the remainder of the circuit, when a
machine is driven by the current, to make the “evidence ’’ be experi
mental.    That this is the case  I think is certain, because the statements of
§ 16 in the text are demonstrated consequences of the first fundamental
proposition; but it is still to be remarked, that neither in this nor in any
other case of the production of mechanical effect from purely thermal
agency, has the ceasing to exist of an equivalent quantity of heat been
demonstrated otherwise than theoretically.          It would be a very great ste
in the  experimental  illustration (or verification,  for those who consider suc
to be necessary) of the dynamical theory of heat, to actually show in any
one case a loss of heat; and it might be done by operating through a very
considerable range of temperatures with a good air-engine or steam-engine,
not allowed to waste its work in friction. As will be seen in Part II. of this
paper, no experiment of any kind could show a considerable loss of heat
without employing bodies differing considerably in temperature; for            in
stance, a loss of as much as '098, or about one-tenth of the whole heat used,
if the temperature of all the bodies used be between 0° and 30° Cent.

 perfectly rigorous manner to the second of the known methods
of producing mechanical effect from thermal agency.       This ap
plication of the first of the two fundamental propositions has
already been published by Rankine and Clausius; and that of
the second, as Clausius showed in his published paper, is simply
Carnot's unmodified investigation of the relation between the
mechanical effect produced and the thermal circumstances from
which it originates, in the case of an expansive engine working
within an infinitely small range of temperatures.    The simplest
investigation of the consequences of the first proposition in this
application, which has occurred to me, is the following, being
merely the modification of an analytical expression of Carnot's
axiom regarding the permanence of heat, which was given in my
former paper*, required to make it express, not Carnot's axiom,
but Joule’s.

     In order to obtain the substance in sufficient quantity for
experiment and for thorough purification, I commenced upon
fourteen pounds of the berries. The kernels (which contain the
fat) were separated by cracking the shells and picking them out
with a pointed instrument, a process sufficiently troublesome and
involving a great loss of time.             The kernels were next beaten
into a     paste  in a warm    mortar,    and after being heated for some
time at 212° in order to melt the fat, they were subjected to
hydraulic pressure between two plates of hot lead.                    In a short

atom of oxide of aethyle.
   Bassiate of Potash.--This salt was prepared by dissolving the
acid in an aqueous solution of boiling carbonate of potash, eva
porating to dryness and taking up with strong alcohol, when the
carbonate of potash in excess is left behind.   The salt on cooling
separates as a jelly, which may be freed from alcohol by squeezing.
It is then redissolved in alcohol, allowed to cool and squeezed
a second time, and the purification is complete.       It is exceed
ingly soluble in hot alcohol, from which it separates as a jelly
when allowed to cool; it is also soluble in aether when a very
small quantity of alcohol is added, and from this solution cry
stallizes in needles when allowed to evaporate spontaneously.
   Bassiate of Soda.-This salt is prepared in exactly the same
manner as the preceding, substituting carbonate of soda for car
bonate of potash.     When dry and in masses, it has a shining

   Bassiate of Silver.—I next attempted the preparation of a
silver salt, and after three or four trials, found that the best
method of preparing it free from excess of acid was to make an
exceedingly dilute solution of soda in alcohol, and also an ex
ceedingly dilute solution of nitrate of silver in the same men
struum.
   The proportions used were about 20 grains of soda salt dis
solved in 5 or 6 ounces of rectified spirit, and about 12 or 13
grains of fused nitrate of silver also dissolved in the same quan
tity of alcohol. The solution of soda salt was added to the solu
tion of nitrate of silver in small successive quantities with vigor
ous stirring in the intervals, and the mixture was made in the
             I
cold; since found that, by mixing them together hot, more or
less decomposition invariably took place.     The white curdy pre
cipitate is allowed to subside in the dark, the supernatant liquid
is drawn off, and the precipitate filtered in the dark, as the salt
blackens by exposure to the light when alcohol is present.       It
was then washed with alcohol till free from excess of silver, dried
first in vacuo and then at 212°.
  Thus prepared, it is a light white powder, without any appear
ance of crystallization; it is highly electrical, insoluble in water,
alcohol, and in aether.      It speedily blackens in contact with
alcohol, but when freed from that liquid it undergoes decompo
 sition much more slowly.
    The following are the results of analysis:–
    I. 6.258 grains of silver salt, prepared as above detailed, gave,
on ignition, 1733 silver = 27-69. 6-825 grains of silver salt, of
the same preparation, gave 1-875 silver = 27:46.—Mean 27-57.

IV.    Additions to the late Mr. T. S. Davies's Notes on Geometry
     and Geometers.     The Swale Manuscripts.     By T. T. WIL
     KINsoN, Esq., F.R.A.S.*
              Professor Davies wrote No. VI. of his “Geometry
            HEN
          and Geometers” (Phil. Mag. Sept. 1850), he adopted
an  opinion of mine, in correction of his own, to the effect that
Mr. William Chapple was the first English geometer who had
formally stated the property, that “the perpendiculars from the
angles of a plane triangle on the opposite sides intersect in the
same point.”                                       I
                 Since that time, have been led to examine the
matter more   fully, and in two papers printed in the Mechanics’
Magazine, Nos. 1430 and 1458, I have shown that not only was
the property published in the “Miscellanies, or Mathematical
Lucubrations of Mr. Samuel Foster, sometime Publike Professor
of Astronomie in Gresham Colledge in London, 1659,” where it
is annexed to a commentary on the “Lemmata Archimedis” by
the Arabian commentator Abi Alhonin Ali, but that it was un
doubtedly known to the ancients, since it is implied in and fol
lows as an easy inference from “Theorema LVII., Propositio LX.”
of “Pappi Alexandrini Mathematicae Collectiones. A. Frederico
Commandino. Venetiis 1589, folio 195 b ;” and that from these
sources probably those geometers derived the property previously
to    its
        being formally enunciated          Mr. Chapple  by  the Mis           in
cellanea Mathematica.     The note      No. VI., page 208, therefore
                                                       to
requires correction, and before entering upon other matters                              it
will perhaps not     out    be
                             place  of  notice one

In  my copy the full title runs thus:—“The Mathematical Repo
sitory: containing many ingenious and useful Essays and Ex
tracts, with a collection of Problems and Solutions, selected from
the correspondence of several able Mathematicians, and the works
of those who are eminent in the Mathematics. London, 1795;”
and as all “Letters for the use of No. II. . . . . . . must come to
hand before the first of January 1796,” it seems almost certain
that the first number was published about the beginning of
October, 1795.
  The “Mathematical Companion” was projected by several
active members of the Spitalfields Mathematical Society, and,
with the exception of the last number, was edited by members                                  its
Messrs. Davis and Hampshire from            commencement        No its                               in

                                             to
was actually printed  with that title; but since the then Editor                                           of
the “Gentleman’s Diary,” the Rev. Charles Wildbore (not Dr.
Hutton), had not been consulted respecting the new publication,
all he
    declared    the Diary for 1798 that
                        in                  “would discourage        he                                   it

               as                                          which                                    to

1809. The reasons for this change are fully stated     the                                    in         “Ad
vertisement” prefixed     the reprint   1809, and must have been

       VI.             Geometrical Papers.
   Several  of the other manuscripts bear evidences of having been
transcribed from some of older date, since they contain original
investigations which had previously appeared in different peri
odicals, and amended      solutions to questions which had been
proposed   in “Burrows's Diary,” and various other mathematical
publications of the last and present centuries. This is more
particularly the case with two of the oldest MSS.; the rest appear
to have resulted from his practice of “spinning geometrical cob
webs” as an amusement during the leisure hours of declining age.
Up to the time when the “Geometrical Amusements” were pub
lished in 1821, no attempts had been made to improve the style
of printing geometrical demonstrations: the old hackneyed form
had been rigidly adhered to by both editor and author, nor had
any geometer appeared who had ventured to deviate from the
established usage of printing entirely across the page. Mr. Swale,
however, had learnt that the eye had something to do in geometry
as well as the intellect, and in his anxiety to aid both, he adopted,
to a considerable extent, the practice of printing each step in a
separate line, which has since been so fully carried out by Mr.
Potts in his excellent editions of Euclid's Elements. The pages
of the “Amusements” therefore presented a somewhat novel
aspect to the mathematicians        of his acquaintance, and this,
rather than his practice of making verses, induced them to banter
him respecting his “poetical geometry.”
   The “Geometry of the Circle,” or as              his
                                                son has not unaptly
endorsed the manuscript volumes, the “Mascheronian Geometry,”
had peculiar attractions for him —several          the MSS. contain
                                                          of
short tracts     the subject, but volumes VIII. and IX. are wholly

34       Mr. M. Donovan                        on the supposed Identity                        of    the Agent
term current being used in a sense which I conceive cannot be
reconciled with the laws of electricity.
    Without examining these opinions separately and in any par
ticular order, it will answer the purpose and save trouble to make
mixed observations calculated to bring what I conceive to be
their defects under observation.
    Whatever difference of opinion may exist relative to the nature
of positive and negative electricity, whether they are states of
one fluid, or two distinct fluids, or vibrations of a peculiar fluid
or of matter, I believe it is a position universally agreed to
amongst electricians, that when equal to each other and at liberty
to act, they mutually neutralize and destroy each other's proper
ties. To quote authorities would be to enumerate                 the authors                        all

8520    pairs     copperof   and zinc   cylinders,  each pair being placed
in   a separate glass vessel well varnished, Mr. Gassiot made the
following observation —“The tension was                  great that the gold          so
leaves    of           an   electroscope             diverged            when that instrument was

must    proportional
         be            the quantity    to                         to!.
                                                                   be      conducted.

        concerned          in the Phaenomena of ordinary Electricity, &c.                                               35
placed within two or three inches of either end of the battery,
or over any of the terminal cells. Advantage was taken of this
to test whether any effect of tension could be observed when the
circuit was completed; but the instant this was effected, the
leaves of the electroscope as instantly collapsed, nor could                 de                                    I
tect, either by the aid of the condenser or otherwise, the slightest
trace of tension; it however immediately reappeared when the
circuit was again broken.”.”
    Thus, it is abundantly proved that as soon as the positive and
negative poles of a voltaic series are brought in communication
with each other, they comport themselves exactly as the positive
and negative poles or conductors do of a common electrical ma
chine;         all
               symptoms        electricity cease.
                                             of                  this moment,  It     is      at
however, and not until now, that the connecting wire                    the vol                        of
taic series becomes magnetic.             there not       this fact something

guished; and the moment that electricity                   made        reappear  is                  to
 by   disconnecting the poles, the magnetism ceases. Professor

   It is no doubt true that frictional electricity has the power of
communicating, reversing and destroying magnetic polarity;
but it never does so while traversing a conductor in the silent
quiescent way which voltaic electricity is known to do.     To pro
duce   magnetic   polarity, it must be in the state of    high  ten
sion, and the circumstances must be otherwise peculiar. In this
state it acts with much dynamic violence, and will communicate
magnetism, as hammering, filing, and other mechanical causes
are known to do.     Of the peculiar condition of electricity in the
state of flash, and how it differs from a current traversing a con
ductor, we know nothing further than that there is a great dif
ference.            -

   concerned in the Phaenomena            of ordinary Electricity,   &c.   37
powerful permanent magnet over either end of the cylindrical rod,
the permanent and temporary magnets thus presenting contrary
poles to each other, ought by the neutralization of the opposite
states of electricity to cause the armature of that end to fall off.
On making the trial with a powerful horseshoe magnet the arma
ture of that end, as might be expected, did fall.
   So far the result corresponded with the hypothesis; but if
electricity be really the agent, the transmission of a stream of
common electricity from the prime conductor of a large and
powerful cylinder machine should act like the permanent magnet
in detaching either of the pendent armatures from the ends of
the temporary magnet.          On throwing a torrent of sparks, which
to the  eye   appeared   a continuous stream of fire from a cylinder
capable at the moment of affording twelve-inch sparks, on the
         º ..
temporary magnet, the pith-balls, hitherto of course unaffected,
diverged to a maximum, but the pendent armatures remained in
their places.
   It will be said by the supporters of the hypothesis in question,
that the             of voltaic electricity passing through the coated
copper wire, coiled round the                    iron rod, was so much
greater than that furnished by the glass cylinder machine, that
the electrical state of the poles of the temporary magnet and of
the armatures was not destroyed, and hence the armatures were
still attracted.     If this be so, it must be inferred, that as the
voltaic electricity of the pole of the temporary magnet was neu
tralized by the opposite electricity of the permanent magnet when
approached, so ought it also to have been neutralized by the
stream of opposite electricity thrown in by the conductor of the
electrical machine. That the quantity of the frictional electricity
was sufficient for such a neutralization, was abundantly proved
by the maximum divergence of the pith-balls with the same
electricity as that of the prime conductor which supplied                  it.
Why then were not the laws            electricity obeyed? Why did not
                                       as of
the armatures fall off      as
                             well    when the permanent magnet was
applied,     the agent      both cases were electricity?

38        Mr. M. Donovan                     on the supposed Identity                    of the Agent
needle.” M. Colladon says that the two electricities unite and
form a current which “produces” magnetism. Professor Faraday
says that electricity and magnetism are “essentially associated.”
From none of these do we learn the nature of the connexion of
the two agents, or the manner in which they reproduce each other.
To have entered on this question would at once have led to the
disclosure that neutralized electric states or fluids cannot exert
any known agency.
   A word has of late years come into common use, which, while
it explains  nothing, conceals the solecism contained in the notion
of neutralized electricities retaining their respective energies.
This word, “the current,” has the effect of keeping out of view
the counter-current, which is the grand difficulty, because it must
antagonize and destroy the current. This modern current cannot
have been derived from the old well-ascertained positive and ne
gative currents of frictional electricity; for these can be seen,
felt and understood.    But the new current consists of both; and
instead of being rendered powerless, as it was formerly the nature
of oppositely electrical currents to be when commingled, it is
only in this state of combination that the positive and negative
electricities are said to be capable of exerting peculiar powers.
The current seems to have been modified to meet the exigences
of recently discovered phaenomena; but in             new acceptation,         its
 no longer harmonizes with those from which our knowledge                                                             of it
the true current was derived.
   The current being now used           the explanationin    every voltaic                  of

               meaning not well-defined,           important       discover

     It is also to be observed that the theory in question assigns
no cause for the assumed progression of forces, or for the current
in a metallic conductor. Admitting that the particles of the sub
jective matter are thrown into a state of electric vibration; ad
mitting also that such a state can be thrown into a progressive
current, however difficult that may be to comprehend, one sees
no reason why the particles should not quietly vibrate, each in
its  respective place,                  no

               -         On the Composition   of Wootz, or Indian Steel.
                                 By T. H. HENRY, Esq., F.R.S.*
                   high degree
                        estimation in which wootz has been held
 THEin this country ofappears to rest more upon the supposition
 that the celebrated scimitars of Damascus were made from this
 variety of steel, than on any results obtained with it here; for
 notwithstanding the late Mr. Stodart, an eminent authority, was
 of opinion that wootz was superior for many purposes to any
 steel commonly used in this country, the attempts to bring it
 into use have not been successful, owing, it is said, to the diffi
                                                      -
 culty of working                    it.
    Under these circumstances,         appeared                                    to
                                                                                                             of to

 ascertain      accurately
this steel, with the hope      throwing some light upon the causes
 of     its
         peculiar physical properties.
    An examination                         of   Dr. Faraday                   by
                           wootz was made                       the                                byin
year 1819t.       The amount                          of
                                 carbon was not determined    him,
the only substances eliminated were silica and alumina; and                                                  he
obtained       two analyses 0.0128 and 0.0693 per cent.
                   in                                       alumi                             of
Inlu In.
    From these results Messrs. Faraday and Stodart drew the
conclusion, that the peculiar excellence          wootz depended chiefl  of
 on  the small quantity                          of
                                 aluminium combined          alloyed                    or              wi
 the  steelf,  and this  opinion  appeared         strongly supported   to   be                           by
ingenious synthetical experiments.
   On the other hand, Karsten could only detect dubious traces
                    wootz; and Elsner attributed the improvement
in of
   aluminium                   in                                   §

Mr. T. H. Henry          on the Composition          of Woote, or Indian                 Steel,         48
           to have produced blades so nearly emulating those of
  amascus, as to allow of their being bent at a right angle,
and capable of dividing a film of gauze floating in the atmo
sphere”.
  I  obtained from my friend Mr.Trenham Reeks of the Govern
ment School of Mines, two samples of wootz, furnished to him
#.
by Mr. Lewis Humbert of the military department of the India
        ; one was in the form of a cake, such as would be produced
by allowing the melted steel to cool in the crucible; the other
was forged into a small bar, about 4 inches long and 1 inch
square, and weighed 4760 grs., or rather more than 11 oz.
These are the forms in which it is imported into this country.                                           I
preferred operating on the bar, for in steel in this form small
particles of slag are often so intimately mixed with the metal as
to defy separation; and it is possible, as      the alumina foundall
by  Dr.  Faraday     in
                     wootz was        insoluble
                                           in   form,
                                                an    that   might                        it
have existed as silicate of alumina.
   The specific gravity     this specimen was 7,727
                                of                      62°F.                       at
                                          Analysis.
  To determine the total amount                     of   carbon, the steel               in      its   soft
state was reduced     meansby   good filesofsuch   minute state to             a
ofdivision that    passed
                     it    through copper-wire gauze containing
8100 holes      the square inch. The files employed were those
                to
used for polishing, being “single cut     they are not    ;”                                  hard       as
the “cross cut”  files, and consist sharp  edges instead
                                                of                                       of sopoints,
and consequently are not             so   liable     to   abrasion;      when used with
care there    is    no
                  danger         of   any particles            of    the file mixing with
the steel operated on.
  It was then burnt with oxide   copper only,   ofKudermatsch                  as
recommends.     believe the most accurate results are obtained
                    I
by  this method.       could not find any iron remaining
                         I                                     the                               in

ash, and    igniting the residue.      I obtained thus 0-312 per cent.
of   graphite;    the solution in caustic potash was acidulated by
hydrochloric acid and evaporated to dryness; the silica remain
ing was equivalent to 0.045 per cent. of silicium; hydrosul
phuric acid afterwards precipitated 0.037 per cent. of arsenic;
not a trace of alumina could be obtained from this solution by
hydrosulphate of ammonia.
    The solution of the iron in hydrochloric acid was treated by
carbonate of baryta, the precipitate redissolved, the baryta re
moved by sulphuric acid, the iron precipitated by ammonia dis
solved in hydrochloric acid and boiled with pure caustic potash:
no alumina was extracted.
    The solution of the steel from which the iron had been sepa
rated was, after separating the baryta, evaporated to dryness in
a platinum dish; the residue did not yield a trace of manganese,
magnesia, lime, cobalt or nickel.
     To determine the amount of sulphur to control the determi
nation of the silicium and arsenic, and also to give me another
opportunity of searching for aluminium, I treated 50 grs. of the
steel in the above minute state of division with pure nitrate of
soda, mixed with a little carbonate of soda, at a red heat, in a
crucible of pure gold”; the action was easily controled, and the
oxidation was complete; the mass was treated with warm water,
the solution acidulated with hydrochloric acid and evaporated to
       ess.   I obtained thus 0.042 per cent. of silicium, and after
wards    by chloride of barium 0.181 per cent. of sulphur, and in an
other experiment 0-170 per cent. of sulphur; the excess of baryta
was removed by sulphuric acid, and the arsenic precipitated by
hydrosulphuric acid gave 0.036 per cent. ; no alumina could be
found in this solution, and only faint traces of phosphoric acid.
I  have not been able to determine the amount of sulphur in steel
or cast iron nearly so accurately, by the methods of Berzelius or
Karsten, as by the above process.
    I was not able to detect alumina in the residue left on dis
solving 500 grs. of this steel in acid, nor on decomposing 117.87
grs. by means of a cake of fused chloride of silver. The residue
left on the cake of silver weighed 3.81 grs., and lost 2-213 on ig
nition, which required to be continued some time before the odour
of arsenic disappeared; if we deduct the amount of sulphur and
arsenic from the loss, this will give 1-660 for the total amount of

   These two would rank        tile ore from the colour, but would

                 Mr.  J. Napier on Copper Smelting.               55
   Each smelter has a resident assayer near the mines.       All the
ores to be put up for sale on a given day are announced; and
two or three weeks previous, the different assayers, or others
appointed as samplers along with the agents appointed by the
sellers of the ore, proceed to the yard where the ores are, and
take samples, which is done by taking a portion from every part
of the heap, mixing them together, grinding the whole fine, and
spreading it out upon the ground.        It is then divided by lines
drawn at right angles thus—
   The two opposite portions, such as 1
and 3, are taken, the others thrown back
into the heap. This is again repeated
with the parts kept until the quantity
remaining be sufficient to allow every
sampler about 1 lb. weight. These sam
ples are carefully examined by the assayers,
each for his own employer.       A few days
before the sale takes place, the assayers
meet, and a list of the lots taken, with
the sellers’ produce, according to assay, is annexed; each assayer
gets a copy of this list, which he sends to his employer with
his own private assays and remarks. The sale is effected by
what is termed ticketing.       On the day appointed for sale, the
purchasers and sellers meet, when a neutral person is appointed
to the chair, who is furnished with a list of the various lots for
sale.   He begins by reading over the number and particulars
of the lot, when each purchaser writes upon a slip of paper the
price per ton of ore he offers, and hands it to the chairman.
These are read out and marked down, and the highest bidder is
declared purchaser; should two or more bid the same, the ore is
divided among them in equal parts. No second bid is allowed,
nor any parcel of ore withdrawn.       By this simple means, many
thousand pounds’ worth of ore are sold in a few minutes. The
question has been put, whether this be a public sale. Certainly no
stranger is allowed to bid. An intended purchaser must give a
month’s notice previously before being allowed to offer, to ascer
tain the responsibility of the party; but what common law would
 say is doubtful were a purchaser present with cash.
    After the sale is over, an account is printed of the particulars
of the sale, containing every offer; by which means, and com
paring past accounts of sales, a very accurate approximation may
be made of the stock of each class of ores which any of the pur
chasers have on hand; this does much to regulate the market,
for a certain class of ores is sometimes of more value to a pur
chaser than at other times; and the object of the other buyers
being to make the ore as dear to his neighbour as possible, the
value of the ore is thus maintained. The following is a copy of a
ticketing paper, which will illustrate our remarks:—

  at each station in 1850 and 1851, and the total number of
  nights in each month in which there is evidence at present to
  show that the phaenomenon was developed somewhere or other
  on the American continent.      The returns will, no doubt, be
  extended, and some observations at present omitted as doubt
  ful be confirmed, and included in the totals at certain stations.

                     Observations           of the Aurora Borealis, 1850–51.                                        67
communicated by Mr. E. C. Herrick, together with any that
were found in the Regent's reports for 1848–49, of which par
ticulars were given, or which occurred at more than one station
on the same evening. Also observations by Mr. Dougald Stewart
at Ristigouche, L. C. The few observations at sea at present
collected, for most of which we are indebted to Captain Oliver
Eldridge, have not yet been included.
   It results from the comparison of the six winter months,
October to March inclusive, 1850–51, that aurora was seen be
fore midnight within the first circle on 88.5 per cent. of practi
cable nights, in the second circle on 80 per cent., and in the
third on only 48.5 per cent., indicating a rapid falling                   the                         off   of
causes producing           distances exceeding 1600 miles from the

of Peel's River, the opposite banks rising precipitously several
hundred feet until they joined the mountains beyond. Having
no time-piece with me,                  I
                            cannot speak positively as to time; but
it would have been probably between 10 and 11 P.M., with a
fresh breeze blowing from N.E. and very cold. The phaeno
menon was evidently very near the earth, for it appeared between
me and the trees on the opposite side of the river, which could not
have been 40 feet above the level of the stream; the trees toward
the top of the hill being high above       Large compact masses   it.
were moving from          W., and bright streamers passing

same direction     quick and vivid

zenith, would from thence spread out        the      and       beau to            N.           S.

colours, until they disappeared altogether and left the sky en
tirely clear.  Every time the streamers passed over me from                                                       E.

terrestrial longitudes.   The room is eighteen feet by twelve, sixteen
feet in height outside, and ten feet five inches inside, and has a flat
and well-leaded roof. The stone piers, six feet high, and cut from
a single block of Portland stone, are erected on a brick foundation
resting on the “live” rock, and the flooring of the room is carried
so as not to touch them.      The transit-clock, by Wulliamy, has two
peculiarities suggested by Captain Smyth: the steel rod of the pen
dulum is immersed six inches in the mercury, that both may be
simultaneously affected by changes of temperature; and the clock
weight consists of separate cylindrical pieces, by which the moving
force may be adjusted so as to produce any required arc of vibration,
Two meridian marks (mounted, characteristically of our author's
antiquarian predilections, one on a representation of the temple of
Janus, the other on a miniature of the façade of the Temple of Con
cord at Girgenti) are placed respectively at the distance of one hun
dred feet north and south of the observatory slit, and by the inter
vention of two lenses of one hundred feet focal length fixed in the
window-sills, are viewed by parallel rays entering the transit tele
scope. This meridian appliance, the theory of which (as we gather
from the statement at the top of page 236) was suggested to the
author by Baron de Zach, has the great advantage of enabling the
observer to ascertain at all times the error of collimation of his tele
scope, without waiting, as in the use of a distant meridian mark, for
a favourable state of the atmosphere. The method of two collima
tors looking into each other, which is that now employed at Green
wich, involves the same principle, and has the further advantage of
not even requiring a reversion of the transit.
    Three years after building the transit-room, Dr. Lee determined
upon enlarging his astronomical means by the addition of an equa
torial. Under Mr. May's able engineering, a tower, solidly built,
and of fifteen feet interior diameter, was surmounted by a hemisphe
rical dome, covered with copper sheathing, moveable on three cannon
balls, and opening by a single shutter extending from the zenith to
the wall-plate.     After some delay, occasioned by the object-glass
purchased for the equatorial being pronounced by Mr. Dollond to
be unworthy of a costly mounting, it was arranged that the telescope
 employed by Captain Smyth in making the observations recorded in
 his “Cycle of Celestial Objects,” being no longer in use, should be
 transferred from Bedford to the Hartwell Observatory.     The object
 glass, one of Tulley's best, is 5-9 inches in diameter, and of 8 feet
 8% inches focal length.    The equatorial is mounted in a very simple
 manner, has hour and declination circles each 3 feet in diameter, and
is moved by clock-work.
    The meridional observations taken by Mr. Epps, late Assistant
 secretary of the Royal Astronomical Society, were begun in the
 early part of 1838 and continued to August 1839, when they were
 interrupted by the death of the observer.     The observations of 315
 of the stars, many of them taken with the moon, are discussed by
 Captain Smyth, and absolute right ascensions deduced from them
 are compared (pp. 256-283) with the Astronomical Society's Cata

nation of longitudes, the object to which the observations were pri
marily intended to be applied. In fact, while absolute determina
tions of celestial positions can only be effectively made in large public
astronomical establishments, the means of private observatories may
be most usefully employed in differential observations, in which class
moon-culminations, limited to the application just mentioned, are to
be included.     In 1842 the observatory was trigonometrically con
nected by Captain Smyth, and his son Henry Augustus, of the Royal
Artillery, with Aylesbury church-spire, and by inference from the
great Trigonometrical Survey,                               its
                                          longitude was found                                               to    be

tini in 1844–46, and again by Smyth in 1849–51.        The two lists of
English observations agree well enough with each other, but differ
in a remarkable degree, and in a large number of instances, from
that of the observations made in Italy. Some of the discrepancies
are adverted to by Signor Sestini in these terms:– “Now, beginning
with the comparison of y Andromedae, we have Smyth emerald
green, and Sestini white; but Herschel and Struve at another date
call it azure. Moreover, observing it again after a lapse of two
years, and four years after Smyth, I find it no longer white, but a
strong blue!”, “Now see B(95). Herculis : according to Smyth,
one is greenish and the other red; but we think them both a golden
yellow; A Ophiuchi, by Smyth, one ruddy and the other pale yel
low; but we take them to be both orange. The contrary occurs in
t Bootis, the components of which by Smyth are both pale yellow;
but we deem one to be orange and the other azure.”
   What can be the cause of such differences? - “The disagreements
between the tints of stars as given by Sir William Herschel and
myself,” says Captain Smyth, “are partly accounted for by his pe
culiarity of vision and the tone of metal in his reflectors. But I am
at a loss why refractors should differ so widely as here shown; and
therefore hope the subject will be more closely pursued than it has
hitherto been.” The explanation proposed by Signor Sestini, viz.
that the colours of the stars vary in consequence of variations of
their velocity, is not admissible.  Neither are we prepared to take
the view which Captain Smyth appears to advocate, viz. that very
minute differences in the velocity of transmission of rays of different
 colour, cause variations of the colours of stars. Certainly on this
 hypothesis, if a new star suddenly appeared in the sky, its existence
 would be announced at successive epochs by the different rays of                                          its
 spectrum, and its colour would not               permanent till the rays, had

reference in the chromatic observation of stars.          Considering, how
ever, the many difficulties that beset this inquiry, it is impossible
not to feel the force of Sir John Herschel's assertion, that “nothing
short of a separate and independent estimation of the total amount
of the red, the yellow, and the blue rays in the spectrum of each
star would suffice for the resolution of the problem of astrometry in
the strictness of its numerical acceptation; and this the actual state
of optical science leaves us destitute of the means even of attempting
with the slightest prospect of success.” (P. 301.) tº Perhaps an ap
proximation by instrumental means to the spectra of the brighter
stars ought not to be despaired of. An instance is adduced(p. 299),
in which Sir David Brewster accounts for the orange colour of th
double star & Herculis by an analysis of its light.”               * ** * ***   ** -
   The “Story of y Virginis” is one of great interest, this bein
perhaps the most remarkable instance in which the components of a
binary star have been shown, by the combination of theoretical cal
culation with observation, to be acted upon by their mutual attrac
tions. Herschel, Encke, Mädler, Smyth, Henderson, Hind, and
Adams, are all astronomical names that have been enlisted in the
theoretical investigation of the orbit of y Virginis.          But no astro
nomer has so diligently observed this object as Capt. Smyth.                  His                       ...

   The fluid portion of human fat consists therefore essentially of
oleine, with which however a small quantity of some other fluid fat
is incorporated, which is distinguished from the former in that the
acid which it contains furnishes on saponification a baryta salt which
is more difficult of solution in alcohol than the oleate of baryta, but
on the other hand is more readily soluble in aether, and which con
tains much more baryta.                  -
    When human fat is      exposed  in the winter during a long period
to a   temperature  about the    freezing-point, the fluid fat separated
from the solid   parts  allowed to stand until the next winter, and
then  again  submitted for a long time to a similar low temperature,
a considerable portion of solid fat will again separate; and the
remaining fluid portion will again present the same phaenomenon in
the ensuing winter. This does not depend on a conversion of oleine
into margarine; but Dr. Heintz found that this solid fat, purified by
pressure and crystallization from alcohol, readily dissolved in a weak
boiling solution of carbonate of soda. Thus, if human fat be left for
a long time in loosely-stopped vessels, a gradual decomposition of
the glycerine will occur and the fatty acids of the fat be set free ;
these are more difficult of solution in the fluid portion than the un
decomposed fat, and occasion this repeated separation.—Annalen der

             NEW ARRANGEMENT OF THE VOLTAIC PILE.
                      BY M. FABRE DE LAGRANGE.
   I have found a means of rendering the current of the voltaic pile
perfectly constant and invariable, even for weeks or months, of what
ever metals the electrodes may be formed, and whether they be set
in action by two liquids, as in the combination of Bunsen, or by one,
as in that of Volta. This continuity of electric action is obtained in
the same way that we obtain the continuity of the calorific action of
a stove, which is furnished below with a grating to let the ashes fall,
whilst we continually add fuel at the top.
   The method which I employ is simple, and fulfills all the conditions

will thus  be continually bathed by the movement of the liquid with
out being inundated, so that the polarization will be suspended and
the bubbles of hydrogen will be freely disengaged through the                                                    in
terstices between the particles; besides which, the lower strata of
the acidulated water, in consequence of the pressure which they
have to support, will filter slowly through the cloth, which will not
be the case to any extent with the upper and middle strata.      Now
these lower strata are precisely those which contain the sulphate of
zinc which it is necessary to eliminate. The result is an electric
current, which is perfectly constant until the entire disappearance of
the zinc, and which is obtained with no more care than that of keep
ing the reservoir filled.
   My method of uniting a number of pairs is as follows:—The stone
ware pots in which they are contained, which are 3 or 4 diameters
in length, and consequently have the appearance of tubes, are united
and cemented into a bundle or block, which is readily transported
from place to place. The upper surface being horizontal, small
gutters are employed to convey the acidulated water to each pot.
With this arrangement, by placing a second reservoir above the pile,
and altering the nature and elevation of the diaphragms, it is easy
to employ a second liquid, which may be made to fall directly drop
by drop on the grains of coke, such as nitric acid;—it may be
used with advantage when very weak, and when it will no longer
serve for the battery of Bunsen from its ceasing to absorb hydrogen.
The liquids on leaving the pots are collected and may continue to be
used until saturation.—Comptes Rendus, April 5, 1852, p. 533.
     ON      THE PREPARATION OF PURE SILVER FROM CHLORIDE OF
                        SILVER.  BY C. BRUNNER,
     Ithas long been known that pure silver for chemical purposes is
best  prepared    by the decomposition of chloride of silver.         This de
composition can be performed in various ways : Puggendorff” several
years ago described a process in which it was effected by galvanism;

XI.  Renewed Inquiries concerning the Spiral Structure of Muscle,
  with Observations on the Muscularity of Cilia.     By MARTIN
   BARRY,       M.D., F.R.S.*
      -     -

This          renewed examinations of muscle, extending over a
        period of many months, were made in the house of the
veteran Purkinje; whose judgement in the matter may be in
ferred, when it is stated that, after what he had seen during
that long period of almost daily demonstrations by the author,
and the devotion of whole mornings to the subject with almost
every kind of muscle that could be obtained,—he translated an
account of the same into German, printing no fewer than sixty
eight pages.]
   Deprived for years of the pleasure of microscopic research by
an affection of his sight, the author finds himself in this respect
so far restored, that it does not appear necessary to deny himself
that pleasure any longer.               If
                                 he has erred in taking up the mi
croscope again, that is to say, should his sight be thereby injured,
he thinks he may well claim to be excused.
   For it could not be to him a matter of indifference that his
researches on the structure of muscle had not met with the
attention he had expected, and which the subject well deserves.
He therefore felt driven to renewed research; and, after nine
months of still more rigid investigation, does not find occasion
to give up his former views.      So far from this, indeed, his
opinion that muscle has no other than a spiral structure has
been even more confirmed. He has met with unexpected states

82          Dr. Barry’s renewed Inquiries concerning the
of interlacement, throwing new light upon the whole; and now
understands how it was that observers did not see what he has
seen.    The attention of some at least appears to have been given
so exclusively to one or to another of those states of interlace
ment, that they remained, as it were, at different stages in their
attempts at explanation.    Probably his double spiral fibril ap
peared to most observers too complicated, perhaps too artificial.
Now, however, having found and figured transition stages extend
ing to complete relaxation, he hopes that there will be some at
least disposed to repeat their examinations, and with more mi
nuteness than before. Then, perhaps, justice may be done to the
author's views, instead of having assigned to them the mournful
honour of figuring somewhere in history as opinions or even
errors. The objects are of extreme minuteness, requiring almost
without exception the highest magnifying powers; and they are
optically so complicated, that nowhere in the field of microscopic
observation is there a subject more difficult than that of muscle.
    The principal facts made known by the author in the Philo
sophical Transactions of the Royal Society for 1842, briefly re
capitulated, were these:–The muscular fibril consists of two
spiral threads, so interlaced as to present a double cylinder, i. e.
the fibril appears as if grooved on each side, a transverse section
of the fibril being represented by the figure (co). The fibril of
a primitive fasciculus having transverse striae is usually so situ
                      it its

the fibrils.   “Transverse cleavage” of the primitive fasciculus
is caused   by the spirals giving way at that part where they offer
the least resistance, viz. at the part where they cross one another
and are in contact.     The sarcolemma arises from the coalescence
of spirals.
   It was by attending to the history of development of muscle,
chiefly in the larva of the large toad of Jersey, that the author
arrived at a knowledge of the foregoing facts.     His observations
published in the present paper were made with one of the large
compound microscopes of Plössl; and it happened that the in
strument was the very last constructed by that justly renowned
optician. The following are some of the new facts herewith
observed; others will be mentioned further on.
   The two spirals of which the muscular fibril consists, run in
the same direction, and not in opposite directions, as the author

employed, as the fibrils become speedily decomposed and indi
stinct.  For such preparations the author prefers a solution
containing Tºnth of nitrate of silver in distilled water, using this
instead of the solution No. 2, but having proceeded as before
with the teasing out in solution No. 1.    It is true that the                                                  ni

distinctness as the solution No. 2, and besides, the preparation
is here and there defaced with a precipitate; but for prepara
tions to be preserved for any length of time, it is to be preferred.
For immediate examination the author especially recommends
the solution No. 2.

stance of the spirals, whereby the outline of the latter becomes
almost invisible.    This is especially the case when the fibril still

88                     Dr. Barry’s renewed Inquiries concerning the
one of them is more drawn out than the other, which becomes
coiled around it as around an axis. Such a state being not un
frequently presented by twine-like muscular fibrils, fig. 9, after
the breaking of them up with needles, it is important that the
observer should be aware how the appearance is produced; for
it may easily mislead him into the belief that he sees a row of
alternately longer and shorter “beads.”

  But what are these “discs”                            of      Bowman? Certainly not what
he thinks, layers     muscular substance, “primitive component
                              of
particles,”             an
                assemblage      which constitutes the primitive fas
                                             of
ciculus.    Bowman's discs are really nothing else than the bright

  as it were, into “6tages” or series. (See fig. 12, where one of these
  ‘étages,’ the lowest, is separated from the rest by the cutting
 of the spirals at their points of crossing.) The dark places in
 the transverse striae correspond to those separating Bowman's
 discs. They are nothing else than the crossing places of the
 spiral threads.     Here the latter come into immediate contact with
 one   another,    can with pressure be made to exercise a cutting
 power, and, as before said, actually to cut each other through.
 This, too, must take place more or less in stories or ‘6tages,’ as
 the points of crossing are for the most part on the same level.
 And when the cutting through has taken place, each story or
 ‘6tage” represents one of Bowman's discs +. (The author here
 points out a difference between merely perspective crossing of
 the spirals, and that crossing where they are in contact; it being
 of course at the latter only that there can be a cutting through.)
     Whence comes it that, as was observed by Bowman, contrac
 tion at any part of the primitive fasciculus (characterized as this
 is by greater nearness of the transverse striae) is attended, both
 before and behind that part, in the longitudinal direction, with
 a separation of the transverse striae : The cause, according to
 the author, is simply this: when the spiral threads extend more
 in a transverse direction at one part than at another, this can
 take place in no other way than at the expense in the longitu
 dinal direction of their continuations, the winds or loops of
 which, thereby drawn out of the transverse direction, assume one
 that is more longitudinal.
     Bowman is right in maintaining that contraction of the primi
tive fasciculus has nothing to do with zigzag inflexions of the
 same.     On the contrary, as Bowman remarks, it has been shown
 by Owen that it is in relawation that these zigzag inflexions may
arise; and not only so, but that in the Filaria they are regularly
 present in relaxation, being there indeed characteristic of the
 relaxed state of muscle. The author inquires, How then does it
happen that such zigzag inflexions may arise in relaxation ? He
thinks it may possibly be in the following manner:—Suppose
the extreme ends of the primitive fasciculus through any hin
 derance to remain fixed, and that the fibrillae, after cessation of the
influence of the contractile force, strive by means of their own
elasticity, and in consequence of the relaxation of their spiral
    * This, however, is not always the case; for at different parts in the
breadth of the same primitive fasciculus the fibrils may be in different de
grees of contraction, and their points of crossing therefore on different
levels.   In such states the transverse striae, viewed with changes of focal
distance, are seen to change their place continually, according as viewed
near the periphery or at greater depth, as was observed by Bowman, and
as every experienced microscopic observer must have noticed,

 90         Dr. Barry's   renewed Inquiries concerning the
 threads, to gain a greater length; but being prevented from
 doing so by the hinderance above supposed at their ends, they
 seek to gain that greater length through lateral inflexions, which
 in such a case must produce a zigzag form. Were an antagoni
 zing force applied, the elongation could follow without the for
 mation of such zigzags.
    We are indebted to Prof. Bowman for many microscopic
 measurements of the primitive fasciculi in different classes of
 animals.    He found the largest in Fishes; they had a less size
 in the  Amphibia,    were smaller in Mammals, and smallest in
 Birds. Bowman's measurements are very numerous, and were
 no doubt made with the greatest care.      He has, however, omitted
 to draw  general  conclusions  therefrom,  and makes no remark as
 to the cause of those differences in size. The author in this
 respect follows the example of Prof. Bowman.         He brings for
ward no   general  conclusions of his own on the  subject, and indeed
 for this reason: because he thinks that we ought first to have
 determined the mean size of the primitive fasciculi in the same
 individual as well as in different individuals of the same species,
according to their different manifestations of activity, before we
undertake to draw general conclusions. Yet he cannot refrain
from here pointing to the following fact, mentioned in a former
part of his memoir. According to his observations, the primitive
fasciculi are at first merely double spirals, i. e. they are no other
than fibrils.   The metamorphosis of fibrils into primitive fas
ciculi is especially observable in the heart, where the young
fasciculi are found, at first flat and scarcely broader than the
fibrils themselves.    The cause of these continued changes in the
muscle of the heart, as already said, it may well be supposed is
no other than the ceaseless activity of that organ. Scarcely is it
to be doubted that the same thing takes place in other muscle
also, though more slowly.      (Certain muscles are then referred
to as affording examples of great activity, and it is remarked
that in different individuals of the human race the primitive
fasciculi in the muscle of certain parts are probably unusually
small.)    Hence it occurred to the author to offer the following
remarks concerning the measurements of Bowman.              In Fishes
the  primitive fasciculi were found the   largest, because of the low
degree of muscular activity required in the element in which
they live (though perhaps the muscles of the fins and gills may
be here excepted, and it is known that they present even exter
nally an appearance different from that of the other muscles).
In Birds, on the contrary, the primitive fasciculi were found
the smallest, as was to be expected from the high degree of
muscular activity of this class.     Amphibia and Mammals pre
sented a middle average size, from their muscular activity occu

pying a middle place; but here it must be remarked, that striking
differences would certainly have been met with had Bowman's
researches been of a more special kind; for it is probable that
the salamanders and other naked Amphibia would have presented
still larger fasciculi than even Fishes.
   Schwann was the first to make us acquainted with the exist
ence of the sarcolemma.        An independent discovery of it was
made by Bowman, to whom it is that we are indebted for an
exact description of that structure and an appropriate name. Its
mode of formation out of spirally arranged cells, the author
believes to have been first seen and published by himself. That
mode of formation of the sarcolemma appears to be as follows:—
At a, fig. 13, is a coil of young cells (once a column of com
pound cytoblast, as at fig. 20                        c).

94            Dr. Barry's renewed Inquiries concerning the
ovum of the Rabbit, after fecundation, the germinal vesicle returns
to the centre of the ovum, and the fecundated hyaline passes to
the centre of the germinal vesicle.     This hyaline, in consequence
of fecundation,   now contains substances of two kinds,-one from
the female   ovum,   the other from the male fecundating fluid.
Through a process operating in the germinal vesicle before fecun
dation, the hyaline of the ovum had prepared a sort of pabulum,_
minute globules of hyaline. With this pabulum, the new hya
line, a compound of male and female elements, proceeds to nou
rish itself; or, in other words, proceeds to assimilate the contents
of the germinal vesicle, whereby there arises a material for the
formation of two cell-germs into which it divides. These two
cell-germs grow at the expense of the remaining contents of the
germinal vesicle, which are nutrimental cells, until the whole
are consumed.       The membrane of the germinal vesicle, the
mother-cell of the whole body, has now disappeared, and there
are seen in the place of that vesicle two young cells, which
together constitute the new organic being. How shall we desig
nate the hyaline of this new being : If we call the hyaline of the
 ovum, hyaline No. 1, and that from the fecundating substance,
hyaline No. 2, we have in the new organic being, hyaline No. 3.
 No. 1 denotes the maternal hyaline, No. 2 the paternal fecun
dating substance, and No. 3 composed of the first and second,
the hyaline of the offspring.       Hence it is that the offspring
comes to resemble both     parents;  for, be the resemblance effected
as it may,  the so  compounded   hyaline   of the offspring will never
lose a constitution inherited partly from the father and partly
from the mother. And how does the hyaline of the offspring
now begin to propagate itself, so that at last a creature shall
arise out of      it,
                    stature and other peculiarities like the parents?

details, the author refers to his researches published in the Phi
losophical Transactions for 1839 and 1840; not deeming it
suitable to the purpose of the present paper to add more, than that
the process through which the first and continually repeated self
division of the hyaline is effected, is no other than a repetition
of the same process which operates in the germinal spot of the
germinal vesicle, as the original cell of the organism; in which
process the operation of certain functions required for an increase
of substance is implied, viz. absorption, assimilation, and secre
tion.      In the cells thus descending from the original mother
cell down to the remotest generation, it is evident that the same
wondrous process is repeated, the same increase of the hyaline;
which at first takes a peripheral station in the cell in order
 through absorption to be newly fecundated (for what in this
 case is absorption, but the fecundation of the hyaline of the cell
 through a relatively external substance maintaining the process of
 division ?) Then, after fecundation at the periphery, the hyaline
 passes into the middle of the cell, there again to divide into new
 generations of cells, which finally arrange themselves so as to
 form the various tissues of the organism.              But the germinal
 spot process continues even here. (Compare the contents of the

the same.   Sometimes, instead of chyle, as the fecundating sub
stance to be assimilated, there reaches the hyaline of the blood

some sort of infectious matter, organic or animal poison, &c.,
whereby there as surely arise diseased processes of formation,
which communicate themselves to the remaining portion of the
blood or to the parenchyma of the organs.
   The author refers to a full confirmation of his observations on
the remarkable process of cell-formation in the germinal vesicle
of the mammiferous ovum, by those of Mr. H. D. S. Goodsir
on a cystic entozoon.    And as this lies at the other end of the

the annular arrangement of cell-germs in fig. 24, b, c, d. Of
such rings of cell-germs, two are sometimes met with, connected
like two links of a chain, fig. 25. Let the diagram fig. 26 c
represent a pile of such pairs of connected rings.          Now rings
such as those in fig. 24 are seen to pass into the state at h in
the same figure. And this change occurring in each ring of the
pile of pairs of rings, fig. 26 c, with a uniting at the extremities
of rings lying one upon another, would produce the twin or -
double spiral d in the same figure”.      Nature, it may be objected,
is a more skilful architect. She does not first form rings in
order afterwards to divide them and unite their extremities in
another way.      All is from the first arranged in spiral order.
Without denying this, and fully admitting that there is from
the first a tendency to arrangement in spiral order, the author
still maintains that rings of cell-germs are constantly met with ;
and that since it is so ordered that spirals shall arise by the
 union of separate cells, it is in perfect keeping with the form of
the cytoblast (fig. 24       that the germs  a), those cells when first       of

cylinder, and so on. All these rows of cell-germs, arisen through
division and subdivision of the nuclei of the primitive cells which
arranged themselves in necklace-like order to form the first
muscle tubes, as well as the germs of those primitive cells them
selves, are descended through division from those substances in
the ovum which again had arisen from the fecundated germinal
spot or nucleus of the germinal vesicle.
    In a brief recapitulation concerning hyaline, the author states
his Researches in Embryology as well as his observations on the
Corpuscles of the Blood (Phil. Trans. 1838, 1839, 1840, 1841),
to have afforded him abundant opportunity for becoming ac
quainted with it”.         He found it in the so-called nucleolus of
cells in general, as well as in the germinal spot of the germinal
vesicle, to be the point of fecundation,--to           be present in the
head-like   extremity   of the   spermatozoon,_to        constitute as glo
bules, immeasurably minute, the foundation of cytoblasts, these
being the real germs of cells. He showed that this hyaline
forms as well the membrane as the contents of the cell,—that to
it belong the functions of absorption, assimilation, and secretion,--
that so long as the vegetative process is in full activity it never
ceases to be in operation, but divides and subdivides to form new
cells, or rather to reproduce itself.        For in the reproduction of
cells, the maintenance, the division, and the increase of the hya
line appears to be the main purpose. It may be asked, What is
there, then, in the organic body which is not formed through
hyaline? Truly nothing.          It is the essentially living substance in
the body, the whole organism is the product of                      its
                                                           formative force.
All  cell-germs   are really, through     repeated self-division,   effected
by a  remarkable assimilative process, descendants            the hyalineof            of

XII.     On the Occurrence of Berberine in the Columba Wood of
     Ceylon, the Menispermum fenestratum      of Botanists. By
     JAMEs D. PERRINs, Esq.”
          following investigation was made in the chemical labo
THEratory      of St. Bartholomew’s Hospital under the immediate
 supervision of Dr. John Stenhouse.    Dr. Stenhouse having had
 for some time past a quantity of the wood of the Menispermum
fenestratum in his possession, suggested to me this investigation.
 I am anxious therefore to acknowledge my obligation to him,
 not only for the material, but also for several valuable sugges
 tions in the course of the inquiry.       -
    Hitherto the chief source of the alkaloid berberine has been
 the root of the barbery, Berberis vulgaris. Bödeker, however,
about four years ago, ascertained              existence its    the columba      in
root   of pharmacy,      the Cocculus    palmatus,      where       occurs            it              in
small quantity associated with columbine. The following remark
is  made       the Chemical Gazette for 1849, vol. vii.
                 in                                                   150:—                p.

 100        Mr.   J.  D. Perrins on the Occurrence of Berberine
 attempted by repeated crystallizations.         It was found, however,
 that a small    quantity   of resinous matter adhered obstinately to
the crystals, causing them to remain of a brownish-yellow colour.
 This brownish tint was ultimately entirely removed by solution
 in spirits of wine and digestion with a little purified animal char
coal, the pure berberine crystallizing from the solution in beau
tiful bright yellow needles. The crystals were found to contain
nitrogen, and their behaviour with various reagents corresponded
exactly with those of berberine.
    As these crystals were very soluble in boiling water, a quantity
of them was dissolved in that menstruum; and on the addition
of the requisite amount of hydrochloric acid, a crystalline preci
pitate was immediately obtained in the form of long, slender,
golden-coloured needles, of a fine silky lustre.
   This salt was dried in a water-bath at 212°F., and subjected
to analysis with the following results:—
   6.25 grs., ignited with chromate of lead, gave 14:398 grs. of
carbonic acid and 3-2 grs. of water.
   The nitrogen was determined by Wills's method. 8:18 grs. of
salt gave 4.94 grs. of the double chloride of platinum and am
InOnlum.
   The chlorine was determined as chloride of silver. 3:59 grs.
gave 13.5 grs. of chloride of silver.

   These results correspond pretty closely with the formula of
hydrochlorate of berberine, which, when dried at 212°F, con
tains 1 equiv. of water, and is consequently C*H*NO”, HCl
 + HO.
    The hydrogen in this determination is considerably too high,
which however is easily accounted for, as the hydrochlorate of
berberine, after being dried in the water-bath, is eminently hy
groscopic, and consequently absorbs moisture rapidly while being
mixed with the chromate of lead.           This observation has already
been made    by    Fleitmann,  who,  while analysing this salt, obtained
 an equally great excess of hydrogen.
   A quantity of the double platinum salt was also prepared by
mixing a solution of the hydrochlorate of berberine with one of
chloride of platinum.         The compound obtained corresponded

but it remains constant at that level; whereas the ordinary wells
sunk into the surface of the lower greensand, fluctuate in this
respect, as might readily be imagined, with every change of
season.
   The bore-holes already executed vary in diameter from two to
four inches, and do not require tubing beyond the first ten or
twelve feet.    Some of the smaller size, of an average depth of
about 170 feet, have been put down at a cost not exceeding £7*.
   The water derived from this subterranean reservoir is of a
slightly chalybeate nature, depositing on exposure to the atmo
sphere a yellowish slime of hydrated sesquioxide of iron.         Its
temperature is 51°F.      The ferruginous taste is at first strongly
perceptible; but this, of course, becomes less apparent when the
water has stood for some time, and I did not hear any complaints
in respect to quality from persons in the daily habit of using the
water for culinary and other purposes.       On the contrary, it was
generally considered to be very wholesome.       Compared, indeed,
to that taken from the   brooks,  in which  organic matter is largely
prevalent, the marked superiority of the deep-well water does
not admit of the slightest doubt.
    When first drawn, it is beautifully clear, but after the lapse of
three or four hours it becomes clouded from separation of carbo

area indicated above.      As these wells do not affect one another,
however, in the slightest degree—and severa of them have been

that the reservoir is capable of yielding a very much larger sup

    There are perhaps few localities in which the subject of Arte
sian wells can be better studied than in this valley between Silsoe
and Barton-in-the-Clay; the latter village lying under the bold
escarpment of the chalk with                        its

This shows that the work really produced, which always falls
short of the duty indicated by Carnot's theory, approaches more
and more nearly to it as the range is diminished; and ultimately,
when the range is infinitely small, is the same as if Carnot's
theory required no modification, which agrees with the conclusion
stated above in § 22.
   27. Again, equation (8) shows that the real duty of a given
quantity of heat supplied from the source increases with every
increase of the range; but that instead of increasing indefinitely

increased without limit.       Hence Carnot's remark* regarding the
practical advantage that may be anticipated from the use of the
air-engine, or from any method by which the range of tempera
tures may be increased, loses only a part of                     its

100°, and then evaporate it at that temperature; and yet either
quantity is expressed by what is generally received as a definition
of the “total heat” of the saturated vapour. To find what it is
that is really determined as “total heat” of saturated steam in
Regnault's researches, it is only necessary to remark, that the
measurement actually made is of the quantity of heat emitted by
a certain weight of water in passing through a calorimetrical
apparatus, which it enters as saturated steam, and leaves in the
liquid state, the result being reduced to what would have been
found if the final temperature of the water had been exactly 0°.
For there being no external mechanical effect produced (other
than that of sound, which it is to be presumed is quite inappre
ciable), the only external effect is the emission of heat.    This
must, therefore, according to the fundamental proposition of the
dynamical theory, be independent of the intermediate agencies.
It follows that, however the steam may rush through the calori
meter, and at whatever reduced pressure it may actually be con
densed.*, the heat emitted externally must be exactly the same
as if the condensation took place under the full pressure of the
entering saturated steam; and we conclude that the total heat,
as actually determined from his experiments by Regnault, is the
quantity of heat that would be required, first to raise the liquid
to the specified temperature, and then to evaporate it at that
temperature; and that the principle on which he determines the
latent heat is correct.   Hence, through the range of his experi
ments, that is from 0° to 230°, we may consider the second of

     accurate experimental determinations of the densities of saturated

   40. Taking the range 30° to 140° as an example suitable to
the circumstances of some of the best steam-engines that have
yet been made (see Appendix to Account of Carnot's Theory,
Sec. v.), we find in column                            III,

440, shown in column III., which is Carnot's theoretical duty.
We conclude that the recorded performance of the Fowey-Consols
engine in 1845, instead of being only 57% per cent. amounted
                                                                                      i.

the same range of temperature; and this duty being .271 (rather
more than }) of the whole equivalent of the         used; we con
clude further, that *w. or 18 per cent. of the whole heat sup
plied, was actually converted into mechanical effect by that
steam-engine.
   41. The numbers in the lower part of the supplementary
table show the great advantage that may be anticipated from the
perfecting of the air-engine, or any other kind of thermo-dynamic
engine in which the range of the temperature can be increased
much beyond the limits actually attainable in steam-engines.
Thus an air-engine, with       hot part            its

            XV.         On the Chemical Constitution of Childrenite.
                            By Prof. RAMMELSBERG+.
      MONG the    rarest crystallized minerals, and one that in a
       chemical point  of view may be said to be hardly known at
all, may be classed childrenite.    This species, which was at first
met with in very minute crystals, many years ago, in piercing a
tunnel near Tavistock, has of late years been found in much finer
specimens   at the George and Charlotte Mine, some of the cry
stals indeed measuring full half an inch in length.    Within the
last twelvemonth,  two specimens  of a peculiarly dark colour have
occurred at Wheal Crebor.     Both these mines are situated near
Tavistock.
    On exposure to heat, childrenite gives off a considerable quan
tity of water. Before the blowpipe, it swells, and puts forth in
sulated branches, tinging the flame distinctly of a bluish-green
colour, and forms a fissured, rounded mass, black in part, and in
part brownish-red on the edges. With fluxes it gives the reaction
of manganese and iron. In the form of a fine powder, the mineral
is soluble by lengthened digestion in hydrochloric acid, leaving
generally a slight residue consisting principally of quartz. The
solution at length assumes a faint yellow colour; ammonia pro
duces in it a voluminous dark blackish-green precipitate, which
turns brown on exposure to the air, and which consists of phos
phoric acid, alumina and the oxides of iron and manganese. The
filtrate contains only phosphoric acid; there is no alkali in                                      it.   A
freshly formed solution                 of   the mineral showed                strong reaction
                                                                                a
of the protoxide    iron;    of             of   the peroxide            the reaction was far
less marked.
     On exposure            to   a   red heat        in a   covered platina crucible, the
powdered childrenite loses        water.     its

copper pyrites,      it is no easy matter to detach a sufficient quan
tity of them in a tolerable state of purity.
    In the first analysis, the mineral in the state of powder having
been exposed to heat, was fused with carbonate of soda and treated
like a silicate. The precipitate thrown down by ammonia was
exhausted several times with boiling potash, and then digested
with hydrosulphate of ammonia to extract the whole of the phos
phoric acid.       After supersaturation with hydrochloric acid, the
phosphate of alumina was precipitated from the potash solution
by means of ammonia, the remainder of the phosphoric acid in
the filtrate was next ascertained; the precipitate, after exposure
to a red heat, was dissolved in acid, and the phosphoric acid was
precipitated with chloride of magnesium.

   In a second analysis, 0-454 grim. was first exposed to a red
heat, whereby the loss of weight amounted to 0.074.
   2:804 grims. were next digested in hydrochloric acid, and left
a residue of 0.113.         The solution, after evaporation in the water
bath, was treated with ammonia and sulphuret of ammonium,
the residue dissolved in acid, the solution oxidized, precipitated
with ammonia, and the precipitate, after exposure to a red heat,
was analysed by fusing          it with silica and carbonate of soda.

exposure  to heat, childrenite may be looked upon as consisting
of 8 atoms R0, 2 atoms alumina, 3 of phosphoric acid and 15 of
water, which constitution is represented by the formula—

XVI.       Remarks   Mr. Dresser's Experiments on the Conducting
                      on
     Powers of Wires for Voltaic Electricity, and on Mr. Joule’s
     Eageriments with a powerful Electro-magnet.     By the Rev.
     J. BASHFoRTH,  Esq.”
            September Number of the Philosophical Magazine,
IN Mr.
   the
            Dresser gave an account of some experiments with
respect to the conducting powers of wires, which appeared to
him to impugn the commonly received laws of their resistances
to the galvanic current.     It is not rare to meet with objections
to well-established laws  arising   from a misapprehension of their
meaning, but objections of this kind are seldom founded on ex
periments so good as these appear to be. . Mr. Dresser has not
explained how he compared the results of theory and experiment;
but on Table I. he observes, “ . . . . it is evident that the often
quoted law of the conducting power of the wire being inversely
as the length does not obtain in short lengths.      But there is an
evident intimation of some other law, and probably different for
different metals.”     Again, “From this Table (II.), compared
with Table      I.,does not appear that with
                     it                            thicker wire there
                                                              a
is any nearer approach           to
                              the old  law, but also that some other
law obtains.”    On Table III.           remarked, that “Increase
                                           it   is                                of
intensity does not appear       approach near
                                      to          the supposed law.”

And   lastly, “This Table (IV.) does not coincide with the law                    of
conduction      of
                wires    different diameters being
                            of                                     as

                 to             these erroneous conclusions spring
from     wrong application

3, &c. feet of wire which is introduced into the circuit for expe
rimental purposes.     It has to pass through the galvanometer
wire, the nitric acid, the porous cell, the sulphuric acid, &c. We
must therefore in our calculations suppose an addition of a length
of wire to that which is used in the experiments, and which
remains constant for one series of experiments.      Thus suppose
E the electromotive    power  of the  battery, R the resistance of
battery expressed by the length of wire (of the same kind as that
used in the experiment), which would offer the same resistance
as the fluids and solids of the battery actually do offer to the
passage of the current.     Let a denote the length of wire intro
duced into the circuit for the sake of experiment.     Then we ex
press the force of the current by E--(It + æ), and not by E--w,
as has been very commonly and very erroneously done.          From
two  observations,  the values of E and R (which      may   approxi
mately be supposed constant for one series of experiments) may
be found; and then by giving to a the values 1, 2,             suc              3...
cessively, we may obtain corresponding calculated deflections of
the galvanometer which may be compared with the results of
experiments.           I
                   have thus calculated     the four tables   all
                                                              expe                 of
riments, and placed the results        theory and experiment side
                                                    of
by side.        The number              of   observations       recorded   the last three
                                                                           in
tables    is   so   small, that they are not              of    much real importance           as
tests.
    As Mr. Dresser thought that                      he
                                       found the greatest deviation
from the commonly received law when                experimented with he

ployed the formula E--a       his calculations. This would amount
                                         in
to
a     supposition, that the current had          other resistances  no                         to

124           The Rev.        J.   Bashforth on the Conducting                  Powers     of Wires
an angle           of 90°, must have been considerable.                                   Mr. Joule
seems to have forgotten, that when a body oscillates under the
action of any force, that force varies as the square of the numbers
of vibrations only under very peculiar circumstances.        In this
experiment a bar of bismuth, 1; inch long, vibrated between
the two temporary poles of the electro-magnet 14 inch apart.
The force which caused the bismuth to vibrate is supposed to
have been dependent on induction; and consequently during
every vibration of the bismuth bar through 90°, the force which
Mr. Joule was desirous of estimating must have gone through
very wide variations.   It is certain that the angle of vibration,
instead of being 90°, ought to have been the least possible for
the purpose of obtaining any satisfactory comparisons of forces
resulting from a variation in the strengths of the galvanic current.
   The number of vibrations per minute observed in Exp. I. with
assumed currents 1, 2 and 4, were 48, 63 and 96.        In Exp. VI.
the number of vibrations with a    strength of current 2 was found
to be 63, as before.   On this Mr. Joule remarks, that these three
numbers are evidently as the square roots of 1, 2 and 4. Now
48, 67.87(=63+4'87) and 96 are really as the square roots of
1, 2 and 4.              If
                 we assume that the forces vary as the square of
the observed number of vibrations, we get 1, 1:72 and 4, instead
of 1, 2 and 4. On plotting Mr. Joule’s results of Exp.                                              I.,

   On Exp.            III.
                 Mr. Joule remarks, that “In this instance we

                               for Voltaic Electricity,                 &c.                           125
notice a slight falling away from the theoretical attraction,”
owing no doubt to the gradual approach to the limit of magne
tizability in the small bar of iron.   And concerning Exp. IV., it
is said that “Here again we have evidences of an approach
towards the limit of magnetizability, for the attractions with a
current of 4 are only ten times instead of sicteen times as great as
those observed with a current of 1.”       Experiments of this kind
are most difficult to perform  in a  satisfactory manner; and cer
tainly these can add little to our knowledge on this point after
the appearance of Dub’s paper on the subject in Poggendorff’s
Annalen”, which furnishes details of very numerous and most
carefully conducted experiments with various cylindrical electro
magnets and keepers.     Much depends on the size and form of
the keeper; for Dub found that, by merely changing the form of
a keeper (the mass remaining constant), the lifting power of the
same electro-magnet varied between limits of 1 and 10 at least.
Again, much must depend on the soft iron of the electro-magnet
itself; and therefore no great confidence can be placed in the
result of Exp. W., which assigns the maximum attractive power
per square inch of surface of an electro-magnet.     Mr. Joule does
not  appear to have tried a sufficient  variety of  forms, both of
magnet and keeper, to warrant him in fixing this limit.
   From Experiments I. and         we see          II.

rents and magnet we find that this     the reason given for the is

         or                                                                                        is

    184. The atmosphere, then, may              regarded      consisting be                        as                     of
two spherical orbs, the lower one positively, and the upper one
negatively electrified; and these two orbs induce towards each
other, leaving the earth neutral.           Now the positive electricity
will, both from conduction and convection, continually travel
upwards. This seems             explain the fact, that the positive elec

maxima and two minima during the twenty-four hours.             The

ence on projecting rods is consequently diminished, a minimum
being at last obtained.
   188. When the sun is about to set, the temperature of the air
near the ground falls, and consequently the positive orb is low
ered, while the sun's rays still heat the upper regions of the air
as at sunrise, and the negative orb is also upborne by the expan
sion previously communicated during the day; and when the
sun is set, the temperature of the air near the ground rapidly
falls.  Here are then the conditions for another maximum.
Lastly, during night, the temperature of the superior regions of
the atmosphere falls, which causes the portion of the negative
orb to descend nearer to the positive, and thus produces a dimi
nished electrical effect; as when the plates of a condenser are
closed.
   189. The annual variation is evidently connected with the
quantity of rain. Thus the quantity of electricity is greater in
winter than in summer, because more rain falls in the autumnal
than in the summer months. As far as                can see, there areI
only two conditions under which rain or hail can ever be pro

which it could be viewed.           Looking end on from below, the
steam-jet caused that part of the heavens obscured by it to appear
feebly orange-coloured—the day was bright, but the sky at this
quarter was overcast.       On looking through the jet of steam from
below upwards, but in a direction inclined about 11° to the axis
of the jet—in which position a portion only of the steam-cloud
could be viewed by the direct light of the clouds, the remaining
portion being sheltered by the side of the window—one part of
the jet appeared orange-red, namely that part which transmitted
the direct light of the clouds, while the other portion was blue.
The blueness of the jet increased with the above-mentioned angle
until the angle was perhaps 30°, after which the blueness some
what diminished, but was far from being extinguished at 90°.

 On now viewing this blue jet under              angle,     before (192.),

 which has shone through columnar arrangement, whose length

      of the properties supposed in the early period of the
ON:history  of galvanism to constitute a difference between
the voltaic and electric agents, was the great power of the former
to cause chemical decomposition, and the total inefficiency, as
was then believed, of the latter.       Dr. Wollaston first showed
that   ordinary electricity could, by peculiar methods, be made to
effect a few   decompositions,  although with difficulty.  Faraday,
a few years since, found means to effect decompositions with
greater facility, thus removing, as he conceived, one of the chief
objections of those who still denied the identity of the two agents.
    It is not necessary to describe Faraday’s experiments in detail.
His general method was to place paper soaked in a solution of
the substance to be acted on between the extremities of two pla
tinum wires, one connected with the positive conductor of an
electric machine, through which the current of electricity entered
the solution, and the other with a discharging train consisting
of the gas-pipes and water-pipes of the street. On passing the
electrical current through the arrangement, he states that the
elements arranged themselves round the wire which transmitted,
and the wire which received the electricity, in the same manner
as they would have done if the same substances had been sub
mitted to decomposition by the positive and negative poles of the
voltaic battery. This he conceived to be further confirmation
of the opinion, that the two kinds of decomposition are produced
by the same agent.
    It appears to me that these experiments go just as far to prove
difference as identity of the two agents.       When a compound
body is to be decomposed by a voltaic series, the polar wires are
placed in contact with the body; the results are, that the ele
ments of the compound separate and arrange themselves into
two classes, and each class collects round            its
                                                 proper pole.         So
constant   result
           a        this division
                      is            bodies into two great orders,
                                           of

                                     it    a
electro-positive and electro-negative.
   Such    is the effect   the two polar wires; but their conjoint
                           of
effectis  indispensable;    remove either, and the other    poweris

The    negative  wire attracts the more numerous denomination         of
bodies round
                it;  but both are equally important. Mr. Gassiot

                    On the Constitution                 of the Electric Fluid.                         131
has strikingly proved the necessity of the direct application of
both poles, if proof were wanted, by perfectly insulating 320
cells of his great water-battery, connecting one pole with the
ground, and the other with solution of iodide of potassium.        In
this state no   decomposition resulted; but when both    polar  wires
were placed in connexion with the iodide, decomposition took
place, and iodine was freely evolved”.      Faraday has given an
other instance: if two insulated voltaic  troughs  be placed in the
same right line, the two adjoining ends being connected by a
wire over which is suspended a magnetic needle, there will be no
deflection; but as soon as the two distant ends are connected,
deflection takes placet.
   In the decompositions effected by Faraday by means of common
electricity, it is remarkable that he made use of but one pole,
and that the positive. The wire connected with the positive
conductor of the electrical machine was the only real and legiti
mate pole concerned.      The wire which carried off the electricity
to the gas and water-pipes was not in the negative state; and if
of sufficient thickness, was not in any electric state; for it trans
mitted to the general reservoir as fast as it received the electri
city, and manifested no electrical properties. It is very true,
that        insulated conductor be approached within a short di
          if an
stance of one that is also insulated and electrified, the former
will become electrical by induction, one end being positive, the
other negative; but if the conductor thus electrified by induction
be made to communicate with the ground,                electrical state     its                            is
destroyed.          In

the negative state caused                      by
                                 induction; for induction can only

134       Mr. M. Donovan     on the supposed Identity    of the Agent
    It is very probable that Professor Faraday was induced to
adopt the discharging train, as a substitute for the negative pole,
by his peculiar views of the nature of voltaic excitement.            In
his theory, it is assumed that the current of electricity is gene
rated by the chemical action of the oxygen of the exciting fluid
on the zinc, a state of polar tension being the result, which is
immediately relieved by the conducting power of the copper plate;
and through this plate the electricity passes off.        Here it is evi
dent that the duty assigned to the copper plate is that of a mere
conductor; and this is precisely the function attributed to the
copper wire attached to the discharging train in the experiments
with common electricity just described.         Such, however, appears
inconsistent with some well-known facts.          On this subject Pro
fessor   Poggendorff   observes,  that were the office of the copper
plate that of a mere conductor, it should follow that, as copper
is the best conductor of electricity, a circle of copper and zinc
should form the most powerful battery, and platinum and zinc
should be much inferior, whereas the direct contrary is the fact;
for if the conducting power of copper be taken according to
Davy's estimate at 100, that of platinum will be but 16}.
   To the argument of Poggendorff        I may add, that if the copper
plate in the series acted as a mere conductor, a stout wire of
copper should answer as well; which is so far from being the
case, that in Wollaston’s battery the power is greatly increased
by the adoption of a plate of copper double the size of what is
commonly used.       The copper is folded round the zinc.; but that
this is not the cause of the increased energy of the battery, is
shown by the experiments of Mr. Binks. This gentleman also
proves, that an increase of the copper beyond Wollaston's double
plate is accompanied by a still greater display of power*.
   There are some facts connected with the decomposition of
chemical compounds by common electricity which seem still
further to dissociate that agent from the voltaic.               Several
eminent authorities have expressed their conviction, that che
mical and electric attraction are different exhibitions of the same
power. This opinion, first promulgated by Volta, was adopted
and amplified by Sir H. Davy, and has been accredited by
Faraday, Berzelius, Ampère and others, with more or less mo
dification. Before  I  proceed to my argument, it may be remarked
that this doctrine leads to some speculations which do not appear
to correspond with notions tacitly admitted, or at least not ques
tioned by these philosophers.         An electric machine will emit
sparks twelve or twenty inches long.          Are these to be consi
dered   sparks of affinity?  can a flash of lightning be otherwise
named a flash of   affinity?  and what is the stream of light into
which a spark passed through the Torricellian vacuum resolves

itself?     Is it affinity independent of matter, separated from and
 no  longer   a property of matter, an existence per se? These are
 questions not devised for the purpose of procuring startling ad
 missions, but difficulties which naturally present themselves and
 demand an explanation.              It answers no good purpose and means
 nothing, to reply that electricity and affinity are different exhi
 bitions of the same power.

  March 18.—A paper was read, entitled, “On the Blood-proper
and Chylo-aqueous Fluid of Invertebrate Animals.” By Thomas
Williams, M.D.
   In this paper the author has accumulated numerous observations,
 founded upon dissection and microscopic inquiry, to prove that there
 exist in invertebrate animals two distinct kinds of nutrient fluids;
 that in some classes of this sub-kingdom these two fluids coexist in
 the same organism, though contained in distinct systems of con
 duits, while in others they become united into one. The author
 proposes to distinguish these two orders of fluids under the denomi
 nations of the blood-proper and chylo-aqueous fluid. The former is
 always contained in definitively organized (walled) blood-vessels,
 and having a determinate circulatory movement; the latter, with equal
 constancy, inchambers and irregularcavities and cells, communicating
 invariably with the peritoneal space, having not a determinate cir
 culation, but a to-and-fro movement, maintained by muscular and
 ciliary agency. He then adduces evidence, derived from dissection,
 in proof of the statement that the system of the blood-proper does
 not exist under any form, the most rudimentary, below the Echino
 dermata; that, in other words, the system of the true blood, or of
 the blood-proper, begins at the Echinodermata.               The author then
 shows that below the   Echinodermata,      namely   in the families of Polypes
 and   Acalephae,   the digestive  and   circulatory   systems are identified,
 and that   consequently   the external medium is admitted directly into
 the nutrient fluids. He considers that this circumstance constitutes
 a fundamental distinction between the chylo-aqueous system and
 that of the blood-proper, into which, under no conditions, is the ex
 ternal inorganic element directly introduced.
     He conceives that his observations suffice to establish the law,
 with reference to the chylo-aqueous fluid, that in every class in
 which it exists, it is charged more or less abundantly with organized
 corpuscles. This is an invariable fact in the history of this fluid.
 His inquiries show that these corpuscles are marked by distinctive
 microscopic characters, not in different classes and genera only, but
in different species, entitling these bodies to great consideration in
the establishment of species.
    The paper then proceeds to demonstrate the proposition, that in
those classes, as in the Echinodermata, Entozoa and Annelida, in
which, in the adult animal, these two orders of fluids coexist, though
distinct, in the same individual, there prevails between them, as
respects their magnitude or development, an inverse proportion; that
while, as instanced in the Echinoderms, the chylo-aqueous fluid
filling the ciliated space between the stomach and integument is
considerable    in volume, the blood-proper and         its  system are little
evolved; that while,     as   in the   Entozoa,   the   chylo-aqueous    fluid
                                                                            is
still the most important fluid element        in   the organism, the blood
system  is  proportionally rudimentary; that       in    the Annelida, espe
cially the higher species     of
                               that  class,  the chylo-aqueous     fluid almost
disappears, while the system       of the true blood acquires, illustrating
the law  of  inverse proportion,   a correspondingly-augmented develop

 ment. The author then states, that the system of the chylo-aqueous
 fluid does not exist in the adult, but only in the larva state of the
 higher members of the articulated series, such as the Myriapoda,
 Insecta and Crustacea.
    In Myriapods and Insects,       he has observed that the peritoneal
 space   is occupied  by a fluid which does not communicate with, and
 is distinct in composition   from, the contents of the true blood-vessels.
    This peritoneal fluid, however, in these classes disappears at a
 subsequent stage of growth. Thus the author thinks that a con
tinuous chain, through the medium of the fluids, is established be
tween the Echinoderms at one extreme and the Crustacea at the
other.      These classes he proposes to connect together under the
designation of the double fluid series, corresponding to the radiate
and articulate series of systematic zoologists.
    Returning to the standard of the Echinoderms, where the system
of the blood-proper first appears in the zoological scale, he shows
that at this point the Molluscan chain diverges from the radiate and
articulate chain, and may be indicated, in contradistinction from
 the latter, as the single-fluid series. The author's observations lead
 him to believe, with Professor Milne-Edwards, that in all Molluscs,
from the Tunicata to the Cephalopods, the chamber of the perito
neal is continuous with the channels of the circulation, and that
consequently the fluids observed in these parts are one and the same
fluid, establishing the singleness of the fluid system of the body; and
this conclusion is corroborated by additional evidence drawn from
microscopic examinations.
    He then recapitulates the results of his researches, and maintains
that the base of the invertebrated kingdom of animals is formed of
all those inferior series which rank below the Echinoderms; and
that this series is distinguished from the Molluscan, in which also
the fluid system is single, by the important circumstance that in the
former, unlike the Mollusca, the digestive and circulatory system
are identified, or confounded into a single system; that at the Echino
derms the series divaricates into the double-fluid series and single
fluid series, the former coinciding with the radiate and articulate
class, and joining the Vertebrata through the Crustacea; the latter
running parallel with the Molluscan order, and connecting itself to
the Vertebrata through the Cephalopods.
    The fluids of the zoophytic series are invariably corpusculated,
but the corpuscles cannot yet be reduced to any definite type of
conformation.       In the Medusan series these bodies become more
definitively organized. The author then demonstrates, that through
out the whole radiate and articulate classes, wherever it is found,
the chylo-aqueous fluid is richly corpusculated, or in other words,
charged with floating morphotic elements, which, from the constancy
of their characters in different species, become grounds for specific
distinctions.     It is stated, that, throughout the Echinoderms, En
tozoa and Annelida, in which, even in the adult animal, the blood
proper and the chylo-aqueous fluid, though separate, coexist, the
latter fluid only is corpusculated, the true blood being invariably

limpid and perfectly fluid (incorpusculated), and almost always the
seat of the colour; the latter existing as a substance dissolved in
the fluid, while in no instance does colour develope itself in the
chylo-aqueous fluid.
     The paper then shows, that at the point where the chylo-aqueous
 system disappears, namely at the Myriapods, the true blood becomes
the vehicle of the corpuscles.
     And lastly, the author adduces a great variety of observations in
 confirmation of the statement, that throughout the whole Molluscan
 series without exception, coinciding with his “single-fluid series,”
 the fluids are richly charged with corpuscles.
     The paper is accompanied by numerous illustrations, displaying
 the characters of the morphotic elements of the circulating fluids of
 the Invertebrata.
     April 1.—A paper was also read, entitled, “On the Electro-che
 mical Polarity of Gases.” By W. R. Grove, Esq., M.A., F.R.S., &c.
     The author refers to the experiments of Faraday on dielectric
 induction, to those of Gassiot on the increase of electrical effects of
 tension, according as the chemical intensities of a voltaic battery
 are increased, and to other results, which, though supporting the
 view of a physico-polar state of gaseous substances intervening be
 tween oppositely electrified surfaces, have not hitherto shown any
 change in the arrangement of the gaseous particles dependent upon
 their chemical characteristics.
     The electric or voltaic disruptive discharge has hitherto presented
 only one phenomenon which offers any analogy to electrolysis, viz.
 that observed by Mr. Gassiot and others, of the positive terminal
 being more intensely heated than the negative, when the voltaic
 discharge passes between metals.        With the voltaic arc the effects
  of heat and the destruction of the terminals so interfere with any
 effects properly due to the transmission of the electric current, that
  it is next to impossible to eliminate the latter; on the other hand,
  with the electric spark from an ordinary machine, the quantity of
  matter acted on is too minute to give satisfactory evidence of the
  changes taking place.      Mr. Grove sought an intermediate degree
  of electrical action, and by the aid of an apparatus of Ruhmkorf for
  producing a powerful secondary current, the results detailed in this
  paper were mainly obtained.
     A polished silver plate is laid on the pump plate of a good air
  pump, and a metallic point is attached to the rod passing through a
  collar of leathers at the top of the receiver, the point being adjusted
  at from one-eighth to one-fourth of an inch distance from the plate.
  Caustic potash is kept suspended in the receiver, and a mixture of
  oxygen and hydrogen, or atmospheric air and hydrogen, allowed to
  enter it, and then attenuated until the barometer stands at half an
  inch; the discharges from the secondary coil are now made to pass
  between the point and the plate, when if the latter be positive it is
  oxidated, if negative the spot of oxide is reduced.
      If there be excess of oxygen and little or no hydrogen, oxidation
  takes place, whether the plate be positive or negative, though in

                                    Royal Society.                                  151
different degrees; and if the gas be wholly or mainly hydrogen,
reduction takes place whether the plate be positive or negative.
   At certain intermediate states of mixture rings or zones of alter
nate oxidation and reduction are shown, quite distinguishable from
the ordinary succession of colours of thin plates, and showing
alternations or periods of interference of electrical action.
   The author then gives the results of experiments with several
other metals, of which bismuth was the only one he found to produce
effects anything like equal to the silver, though other metals showed
them in some degree.
   He also varied the gas or gases employed, and details the results
obtained with several gases; among them carbonic oxide is the
most worthy of note, as with it effects are produced similar to those
with the mixture of oxygen and hydrogen, viz. oxidation when the
plate was positive, and reduction when it was negative.
   The author's theory or mode of explaining the results is as follows.
The discharges are successive, not continuous, and antecedent to
each discharge the intervening gas is thrown into a state of chemical
polarity, similar to that which takes place in an electrolyte anterior
to electrolysis; by this means the positive terminal has in juxta
position with it oxygen or an electro-negative gas; the discharge
takes place, and by the superficial ignition the layer of oxygen com
Dines with the metal in contact with it.
   Conversely, when the oxidated surface is negative and in contact
with an electro-positive gas, the heat of the discharge produces re
duction. The fact of oxidation only taking place when air or oxygen
alone are present, and reduction only when hydrogen is present, he
considers irreconcilable with the effects being attributable to the dis
charge itself, or to their being regarded as analogous to electrolysis;
 while these phenomena are corroborative of the view he puts forth.
   The author refers to the experiments of Priestley, Karsten and
 others, in which spots or marks have been shown to be produced by
electrical discharge, but which do not otherwise bear upon the ob
jects sought to be elucidated by this paper.

for their sum four times the mean temperature of the day, whatever be
 the commencing hour; and thus travellers and voyagers observing at

 2 p.m. Hence, from the communications of the captains of Merchant

 by means of the carbon which it contains, and would at the same
 time form sulphurets: this supposition I found confirmed by experi
 ment.   In fact, I have obtained the sulphurets of boron, silicon,
 magnesium and aluminium, by submitting boracic acid, silica, mag
 nesia and alumina, to the action of sulphuret of carbon at a high
  temperature.       To facilitate the reaction, and remove the sulphuret
  from the     decomposing    action of the alkalies contained in the por
  celain tubes, it is sometimes useful to mix the oxides to be reduced
  with charcoal, and to form them into little balls similar to those
  which are used in the preparation of chloride of silicon.
      I have ascertained by analysis that these sulphurets correspond to
  the oxides from which they have been derived.
      I will now say a few words of the sulphurets obtained by the above
  method.       The sulphuret of silicon had been obtained in small quan
  tity by Berzelius in the reaction of sulphur upon silicon, and by
  M. Pierre in the decomposition of chloride of silicon by hydrosul
  phuric acid. I have obtained this substance with the greatest ease,
  by passing the vapour of sulphuret of carbon over pellets of charcoal
  and gelatinous silica placed in a porcelain tube heated to bright red.
  The sulphuret of silicon condenses in the tube in beautiful white
  silky needles, which are not very volatile, but are readily carried
 along by the vapour.
     To show the interest which attaches to the examination of this
 substance, it will suffice to mention here two of its reactions.         When
 sulphuret of silicon is heated in a current of moist air, it is decom
 posed, and furnishes silky crystals of anhydrous silica; it is evident
 that we may explain by means of this experiment the natural pro
 duction of certain filamentose crystals of silica.          The sulphuret of
 silicon in the   presence   of water is   decomposed    with a brisk evolution
 of hydrosulphuric acid into silica, which remains entirely dissolved
 in the water, and is not deposited until the liquid is evaporated. It
 is impossible not to connect this curious property with those natural
 conditions under which certain mineral waters and siliceous incrus
tations are formed.
     As the sulphuret of silicon is probably produced in                      all
                                                                    those cases

   The sulphuret of magnesium I obtained by passing sulphuret of
carbon over pure magnesia; in this case the presence of charcoal
does not appear to be of any use.  This sulphuret crystallizes, and
is soluble in cold water; when its solution is kept at the ordinary
temperature, there is but a feeble disengagement of sulphureted
hydrogen; but when heated to ebullition, a lively effervescence of
sulphureted hydrogen takes place, and there is an immediate depo
sition of magnesia.-Comptes Rendus, July 5, 1852.
ON    THE EXISTENCE OF ORGANIC MATTER IN STALACTITES AND
     STALAGMITES, FORMING CRYSTALLIZED AND AMORPHOUS CRE
     NATE OF LIME.   BY DAVID A. WELLS.
   In the eighth chapter of Liebig's Agricultural Chemistry, edited
by Playfair, there is given the result of some examinations of sta
lactites from caverns in Germany, and from the vaults of old castles
upon the Rhine, made with the view of ascertaining the fact of the
presence or absence of organic matter in these bodies, either com
 bined or uncombined.
    The result may be stated in the words of the author, Prof. Liebig.
 The stalactites from the caverns “contain no trace of vegetable
 matter, and no humic acid, and may be heated to redness without
becoming black.”      In the stalactites from the vaults and cellars of
old castles, he says, “we could not detect the smallest traces" of
 humic acid. “There could scarcely be found a more clear and
convincing proof of the absence of the humic acid of chemists in
common vegetable mould.”      Under the term humic acid, Prof.
Liebig undoubtedly       means to include                 all
                                                  those organic acids arising                             .
from the    decomposition           of
                                   vegetable     matter,  and which have re
ceived the names       ofcrenic, apocrenic, geic and humic acids.

 lactites of a deep yellow colour, highly crystalline and uniform in
 character, and in the portions examined perfectly homogeneous and
 free from layers, or intervening bands indicating different periods
 and changes in deposition.    As the presence of iron could not be
 found in the acid   solution, it is inferred that the colour of these
 yellow stalactites must be owing in great part to combined organic
 matter, existing as crenate of lime.   In specimens like the spar or

   Damour deduces from his analysis the formula3ThC) + SiO2+2HO.
Berzelius assumed that thorite consisted of several silicates, but prin
cipally of a silicate of thorina of the formula 3ThC) + SiO2+2HO.
Damour is of opinion that Berzelius's analyses do not lead to any
definite proportion; but they prove that orangite and thorite are
identical, and that the metal donarium must be struck from the list
of simple bodies.
   Berlin also calculates from his analysis the formula
                          3ThO + SiO3 +2HO,
and is likewise of opinion that orangite is only a purer thorite. He
also draws attention to a peculiar property of thorina.      It is stated
that calcined thorina is insoluble in acids. This is correct as far as
regards the earth obtained by calcining the hydrate, but not for that
obtained by igniting the oxalate, which dissolves slowly in hydro
chloric acid.—Central Blatt, June 23, 1852.
      ON A NEW MODE OF MEASURING          HIGH TEMPERATURES.
                        BY MR. JOHN WILSON.
   After referring to, and describing briefly the pyrometers at
present in use, the paper explained the method employed by the
author to measure high temperatures.        According to his plan, a
given weight of platinum is exposed for a few minutes to the fire,
the temperature of which is required to be measured, and then
plunged into a vessel containing water of a determined weight and
temperature.    After the heat of the platinum has been communi
cated to the water, the temperature of the water is ascertained; and
from this is estimated the temperature to which the platinum was
subjected.   Thus, if the piece of platinum employed be 1000 grains,
and the water into which it is plunged be 2000 grains, and       tem          its
perature 60°, should the heated platinum when dropped into the
water raise    by temperature      90°, then 90°–60°=30°; which,
                                        to
multiplied     2 its
                 (because the water      twice the weight
                                              is             the pla     of
tinum), gives 60°, that         an
                             equal weight            of
                                               water would have been
raised. Again; should the water           another case gain 40°, then

40° x2=80°, the temperature measured by the pyrometer.                  To
convert the degrees of this instrument into degrees of Fahrenheit,
we must multiply by 31:25, or 31}.          Thus, 80° x 31} would give
2500° of Fahrenheit. And 60°x 313 = 1875°. The multiplier 31-25
is the number expressing the specific heat of water as compared with
that of platinum, the latter being regarded as 1.

tions similar to those required in determining the specific heat of
bodies must be taken ; that              necessary         is,

      This assertion, however, has been refuted                             by   Dr. Stenhouse             in

      have occasion       to     refer.
         The pyromeconic acid employed           the following experiments

      meconate       lime twice with hydrochloric acid, which, though
                    of

      semifused mass, Stenhouse recommends pressure between folds
      of filtering paper, redistillation, and frequent crystallization from
      boiling alcohol.       found, however, that simple pressure, and

to a higher temperature, it burns with a slight deflagration

     Pyromeconate of Lime.—This salt is obtained in the form of
  small colourless silky needles when a warm ammoniacal solution
 of pyromeconic acid is added to acetate of lime in excess. It is

 from which it deposits itself

  Pyromeconate of Copper.—The ammonio-sulphate of copper
mixed with a warm aqueous solution of pyromecomic acid causes
an immediate precipitate of this salt in bright green crystalline
needles, which are extremely brittle and easily pulverized. This
salt has also been examined by Stenhouse+, who prepared it by
boiling the acid with hydrated oxide of copper, and allowing the
filtered solution to cool.  The crystals require a considerable
amount of hot water for their solution, and are very slightly
soluble in cold water or alcohol.
   The copper was determined as oxide by heating the salt to
redness, and then igniting the residue with nitric acid. It loses
nothing at 212°.
   6:00 grains substance gave 1-66 oxide of copper, which calcu
lated per-centage gives 27-66 of oxide of copper, the number
27-79 being that corresponding with the formula
                                 CuO, C10H8O3.
   Pyromeconate   of Iron.—Dr. Stenhouse has observed in the
paper   before mentioned,  that when pyromeconic acid is boiled
with hydrated peroxide of iron, and also with the persulphate,
it combines with the oxide and forms a brownish-red powder,
which when neutral is very little soluble in cold water.  It may
also be   obtained, and  perhaps  more   conveniently, by adding
perchloride of iron to a hot concentrated solution of the acid in
water, when the cinnabar-red crystals begin to make their ap
pearance, adhering firmly to the sides and bottom of the vessel.
   Its properties have been so fully described by Stenhouse, that
further remark is unnecessary.
   The crystals were well washed with cold water, until the fluid

   6:53 grains substance gave l'32 peroxide of iron.
  The per-centage calculated from the number is 20:21, while

    Products of decomposition of Pyromecomic Acid—If some
 crystals of the acid be moistened with strong nitric acid in the
cold, they immediately assume a white gelatinous appearance,
and bubbles of nitrous acid are soon evolved; by the application
of a gentle heat the action becomes excessively violent, and con
tinues so even though the heat be withdrawn, with the produc
tion of oxalic and hydrocyanic acids.      Sulphuric acid in the cold
has no action on pyromeconic acid; but when gently warmed, it
dissolves it to a colourless fluid, which upon cooling deposits the
pyromeconic acid again.
    Several experiments were made by passing chlorine into a
solution of pyromeconic acid with the view of obtaining a chlo
rine substitution compound, but without success, that reagent
acting too powerfully on           Complete decomposition always

Which show that they consist of an acid produced by the sub
stitution of an equivalent of hydrogen in pyromecomic acid by an
equivalent of bromine.
    This acid is of sparing solubility in cold water, more so in hot,
and reddens litmus slightly.     Boiling alcohol dissolves it readily,
from which it crystallizes in beautiful fibrous plates; and if the
cooling be carefully effected, in short prisms. It imparts to
persalts of iron a deep purple colour, quite distinct from the red
produced by the original acid.      Nitric acid decomposes it with
effervescence, but sulphuric dissolves it without any apparent
decomposition.      Submitted to destructive distillation, it fuses
and then blackens, hydrobromic acid being evolved in large
quantity; after the continuation of the heat, a white crystalline
 substance begins to collect on the cool part of the tube, but in
                                                                     -
quantity too small to admit of examination.
    It gives no precipitate with nitrate of silver, neither when
boiled does it reduce the oxide to the metallic state.     It causes
 no  precipitate in solutions of chloride of barium, calcium, or sul
phate of magnesia, even in the presence of ammonia.     Ammonio
sulphate of copper, though producing no effect in the cold, gives
when heated a precipitate of a bluish tint.
   Bromo-pyromeconic acid, like pyromecomic, is monobasic,
forming only one series of salts. The salt employed for con
trolling the analysis and establishing the saturating power of the
acid was that of lead.
   Bromo-pyromeconate of Lead.—A warm alcoholic solution of
the acid gives with acetate of lead, also dissolved in alcohol, a
white precipitate of small dense crystalline needles which rapidly

XXVI.    Renewed Inquiries concerning the Spiral Structure of

A*        his previous observations had led him to expect, cilia were
        found to be no other than his twin or double spirals.                    No
man, he thinks, will do him the injustice to suppose he maintains
the possibility of discerning a double spiral in the minutest cilium.
He is as far from maintaining this as he is from asserting the
possibility of seeing a double spiral in the minutest muscular
fibril.     But he does maintain that those who undertake the
examination of cilia in the way in which they should set about
the examination of                   all

how     they  originate,    what         the historyis      their development,    of
will certainly find that the double spiral                the fundamental form   is
of all cilia the structure of which can be reached with the micro
scope, and therefore probably                             of
                                            the most minute.        Indeed under

178              Dr. Barry's renewed Inquiries concerning the
   Before detailing his observations, the author states what others
should do who may be disposed to repeat the examinations. A
small piece, about a square line, having been cut from the mar
ginal edge of the gill and placed upon glass, he adds to it a drop
of the fluid, which, on the mussel being opened, collects in the
shell, gently and to a small extent separates the bars from one
another with fine needles, and places them under the microscope
without the addition of any covering such as glass or mica.        It
is soon seen that some of the bars, wedge-like   in their transverse
sections, present the thicker of their edges to the eye, fig. 37,
while others are lying on their sides, figs. 41, 36. Both should
be examined     with especial reference to the cilia on the two sides
of the bar. Of these cilia there are three sets, and not two only,
as hitherto supposed; one set uppermost when the thicker edge
of the bar is directed towards the eye, and marked m in the
figures just referred to ; the second occupying a middle place,
and marked n in the same figures; the third lowest, and marked o.
   Concerning these cilia, the author states the following as new
facts:—In the first place, these cilia, and from analogy probably
all cilia, consist     of
                       double spiral threads, and thus have         struc              m,
ture like that        of
                    the muscular  fibril; secondly, the cilia     fig. 36,               a

They contained at the margin numerous cells.                      The middle
space presented none.         On the nature of these large fragments
the author has for the present nothing further to remark, than
that they afforded him an invaluable contribution towards the
history of development of cilia; for of that development they
presented with distinctness a very early stage.            The minute cells
in their interior seemed destined to          give    origin  to cilia, which
here and   there,  fig.  29,  were seen to have been         already    formed
and to have burst through the membrane of their cells.                   One of
these, the interior of which was seen with rare distinctness, is
represented on a larger scale in fig. 30.          The young cilium here
drawn consisted of two spirals, within the winds of which was a
pellucid substance corresponding to that which the author above
and elsewhere has termed hyaline.             At the extremity the two
spirals passed into one another, and were bent over hook-like
towards one side.       At the base they separated, to bestride, as it
were, the contents of the cell in which the cilium had been
formed*.      Perhaps these two separate threads may be considered
as the radical ends of the cilium, in which growth first of                                             all
takes place somewhat           the following manner:—The extremity

            these two threads draws into itself new substance from
the nucleus          of
                  the cell.     And now       the cilium      asalternately     is                      in
the states     twisting and untwisting,

a sortof tunnel, through which water is driven by their vehe
ment movements.    So much for conclusion No. 3*.
   On the subject of functions it is also to be remarked, that the
pellucid space, fig. 36 h, over which these two lines of cilia, n
and o, move so vehemently, belongs to the membrane of the bar
(known to be considered as a vessel of the gill), which membrane
is probably destined to absorb oxygen from the water and com
municate it to the blood. This would be materially assisted
were the stream of water accelerated, and a fresh supply of
oxygen constantly afforded.
   It must further be remembered, that, as is known, the direc
tion of the current in neighbouring bars is different.           in one                                            If

184                    Dr. Barry’s            renewed Inquiries concerning the
showed in their movements a shortening and lengthening.      No
definite order, however, such as that implied by undulation, was
observed.      Perhaps a disturbance had occurred through mani
pulation.]
    It is important, the author thinks, to have seen these undu
latory movements performed by the cilia m, fig. 36; for, as suc
cessors to the cilia n, the cilia thus undulating were about to
arrange themselves in one of the two lines above mentioned as
combining to form a sort of tunnel, through which by their ex
tremely vehement movements to drive a rapid current.                           And
the following occurred to him as possibly sufficient to explain
the appearance presented by these movements,                   which have been
aptly compared to the rapid flow of globules of a fluid.                        The
cilian, fig. 36, are            bent    all  the same direction; they are

     new Polarizing Crystals produced from Quinine. By WILLIAM
     BIRD HERAPATH, M.D.”
     N the March Number of this Journal                the author announced
       the discovery of a peculiar salt of quinine, which possessed
the power of polarizing a ray of light with even greater inten
sity than the tourmaline; and at certain angles of rotation it also
depolarized light, and acted as selenite would do under similar
circumstances.
   He then stated that the qualitative analysis showed this salt
to be a compound of quinine, iodine, and sulphuric acid; and
although the relative quantities of these constituents had not at
that time been estimated, he gave it the name of iodide of di
sulphate of quinine.        In the present communication, the results
of the quantitative chemical analysis of this compound will be
detailed; and it will be evident that a new idea of its constitu
tion will be elicited, which will render another name necessary,
and more in accordance with the results specified.
   Before attempting the analysis, it was of course necessary to
invent a process which would furnish a large quantity of this
substance at one operation; after several attempts, with more or
less success, the following method was adopted, which at the
same time served as a means of corroborating the results of the
future analysis, as it enabled the experimenter to account for                       all

     On the new Polarizing Crystals produced from Quinine,             187
times with acetic acid at    40°Fahr., which had been previously
found to have little solvent power on this compound at that
temperature.       The crystals having been well washed, were dis
                                                            º
solved in    boiling  alcohol, spec. grav. 838, and on cooling they
recrystallized; this operation having been repeated,          were at
length obtained pure from any admixture of disulphate of quinine.
Having been drained on a filter and washed with cold spirit,
they were dried at 90° Fahr., then over sulphuric acid, and
weighed: 66.6 grs. were obtained by this operation.
    The acid mother-liquid, together with the first washings, were
then examined for iodine; upon allowing a few drops to evapo
rate spontaneously on a slip of glass, polarizing crystals formed
around the edge of the liquid; consequently the compound is
slightly soluble in cold acid. The acetic acid having been nearly
neutralized by ammonia, nitrate of silver was dropped into the
solution as long as any iodide of silver was deposited; this was
then carefully collected on a filter, washed repeatedly with di
 stilled water, then with ammonia to remove any chloride, again
 with distilled water, dried and ignited; it weighed 2:00 grs. =
iodine 1:08.
    The alcoholic mother-liquids and washings were then examined
 for iodine, and crystals were similarly obtained upon sponta
 neous evaporation.       In order to precipitate the iodine, a silver
 salt was   used,   and  dropped   into the solution as long as any
 cloudiness was produced; the whole thrown on a filter, and the
 precipitated iodide of silver, washed with diluted nitric acid to
 remove any quinine, and subsequently with ammonia to take
 up any chloride, and then with distilled water; dried and ignited,
 it weighed 3.63 grs. =iodine 1951.
     It now remained to examine the distilled liquids for iodine,
 as it existed in these in the free state dissolved in alcohol; they
were    mixed   together,   and placed   in   a   counterpoised     matrass
with metallic zinc.    After prolonged digestion, a little water
added to facilitate the operation, the iodine was converted into
iodide of zinc.; the fluids were then distilled off, the iodide of
zinc dried at 212° and weighed; 3:35 grs. =iodine 2-6715 grs.
were obtained.
   Now, if any substitution compound had been formed by the
action of the iodine on the quinine, it was probable that hydriodic
aether would be produced; if so, it wouldbe found in the distilled
fluid; this was carefully examined for this substance, but none
detected. Subsequent experiments showed that none could have
been produced, or if any, so small a quantity, that           its
                                                           presence
would    beimmaterial,  for   all
                               the iodine used, with the exception
of 2.56 grs, can     be
                      accounted for thus:—

 188        Dr. Herapath on the Chemical Constitution of the
  21-7375 iodine in   the   66-6 grs. of crystals at 32.63 per cent.
   1.0800 iodine in   the   acid mother-liquids (as crystals).
   19510 iodine in    the   alcoholic mother-liquids (as crystals).
   2-6715 iodine in   the   distilled fluids as free iodine.
  27.4400
   2.56      grs. iodine lost in drying the crystals by expression
                  between folds of bibulous paper.
  Had a substitution compound been formed, one-half the iodine
should have formed hydriodic acid, the other half should have
been in the crystalline compound; therefore it is evident to me
 that no such substitution base can be the result.
    One other question arises, Does the iodine exist in the com
 pound as hydriodic acid : Some of the crystals were dissolved
 in diluted alcohol boiling, and starch was added to the hot liquid;
 instantly an abundant precipitation of the blue iodide of amidine
 occurred; starch was added in excess, and until no further indi
 cations of iodine were evident; the fluid was then separated by
 decantation, and tested with nitrate of silver; not the least trace
 of hydriodic acid or any soluble iodide was apparent; similar
 results were obtained when the crystals were dissolved in hot
 acetic acid and tested with starch; but if they were dissolved in
 hot rectified spirit of wine, 838 spec. grav., there was no evi
 dence of iodine; on cooling, the crystals again formed, the rea
 son being that the chemical attraction of alcohol for iodine was
 greater than that of iodine for starch, whereas it was less than
that of the iodine in the compound.            It has therefore been
proved satisfactorily that the iodine cannot exist in the com
pound as a substitution base or even as hydriodic acid.
    The iodine separating in the free state so readily upon dissol
ving the crystals in alcohol or in acetic acid, rendered it a some
what difficult matter to estimate it correctly.       Starch was first
used as the   precipitant;  the resulting  iodide of amidine was de
composed by sulphuretted hydrogen, the hydriodic acid produced
neutralized by ammonia, then precipitated by nitrate of silver,
and the resulting iodide of silver estimated; but accuracy was
very far from being attained by this method, in consequence of
iodine distilling during the heating of the fluid and solution of
the crystals.
   At length it was found, that by passing a current of washed
and pure sulphuretted hydrogen through acetic acid, in which
a known weight of crystals had been placed, and applying heat
to the mixture, as soon as gas commenced being evolved, the
iodine was converted into hydriodic acid upon      its being liberated
from the   crystals;  the decomposition   being  perfect and the ope

          new Polarizing   Crystals produced from Quinine.       189
ration finished, the excess of sulphuretted hydrogen was expelled
by boiling, testing with acetate of lead paper occasionally, the
precipitated sulphur removed by filtering, washed well with di
stilled water, and to the filtrate ammonia added, nearly to neu
tralization, but short of precipitating the quinine ; then the so
lution boiled and the iodine precipitated by nitrate of silver,
 collected on a filter, washed with distilled water, then with
 diluted nitric acid to remove any quinine (which falls with iodide
 of silver even from an acid solution), and lastly dried and fused
 by ignition in a platina capsule; 25 grs. of crystals gave by this
 method 15:14 grs. of iodide of silver = 8-1523 grs. of iodine
  = 32.6092 per cent.
    The solution after the separation of iodine was then, together
 with the washings, treated with acetate of baryta until no further
 deposition of sulphate occurred; it was boiled to hasten the sepa
 ration, filtered, washed, dried, ignited and weighed; it gave 7.76
 grs. BaO +SO"=2-653 SO’= sulphuric acid per cent. 10-612.
     The liquid after the separation of iodine and sulphuric acid
 was then acted on, first by sulphate of ammonia to remove ex
 cess of baryta, then with hydrochlorate of ammonia to remove
 the excess of silver.
     To this fluid, concentrated by evaporation to about 3 fluid
 ounces, was added ammonia in excess; an immediate deposition
 of alkaloid was the consequence.        Aºther was now added in suf
                 iºn
 ficient quantity to dissolve the alkaloid, the supernatant aethe
 rial fluid was            into a counterpoised flask, the operation
 being repeated as often as necessary; the aetherial fluids mixed
  were then distilled; the residue, dried at 212°Fahr., weighed
  7:533 grs.
     The aqueous and ammoniacal solution, upon evaporation to
  dryness in a water-bath, again treating with aether as long as
 necessary, and distilling as before, furnished a second quantity
  of alkaloid, weighing, after drying as before, 3.14 grs.
     Then 7:533+3:14-10-673 alkaloid equal to 42,692 per cent.
     This analysis, therefore, accounts for—
                                                  Per cent.

     The loss of 14:0868 was probably water of crystallization,
 but it now became necessary to perform an analysis to make
 this point certain; after several attempts, the following process
 was adopted, and furnished correct results.
     Having arranged an apparatus for preparing a current of dry
 hydrogen gas, the stream was passed through a flask containing

iron filings; these were then heated red-hot, the organic mat
ters were decomposed and reduced to pure carbon, and the oxide
of iron was reduced to the metallic state; when the gas issuing
from the exit-tube of the apparatus burnt with a steady, yellow
flame, the operation was discontinued; at least the spirit-lamp
was removed and the iron allowed to cool, still in an atmo
sphere of dry hydrogen gas, and when cold, removed and well
secured in a small stoppered bottle.
   To the same apparatus for generating the dry hydrogen was
adapted a counterpoised test-tube (a), and to the exit-pipe from
this was connected a tube containing chloride of calcium, this
tube, with          its
               contents, being accurately counterpoised.     Into

exposing an alcoholic solution to spontaneous evaporation in a
test-tube; around the edge of the liquid a thin radiating plu
mose crop is produced, being more distinctly acicular than the
disulphate.    It is therefore not quinidine (8-quinine), but as
similates  probably    to that variety of quinine recently called
y-quinine, a monohydrate of the organic radicle C*H*NO”, of
which a-quinine is the tri-hydrate, and 8-quinine the bi-hydrate.
However, further researches are necessary to establish this fact;
for the present we are justified, from the reproduction of the
polarizing crystals from the alkaloid separated from the green
polarizing compound, in considering that the alkaloid quimine
enters into the composition of the crystals, but in the character of
an iodo-base; not a substitution base, as has been previously shown,
but a compound analogous in              constitution   its iodo-codeine,               to

                        Mr.   J.   Napier on Copper Smelting.                                    193
in the metallic portion or mat exceeds 50 per cent, the slag or
scoria obtained will contain some copper, and there will therefore
be a loss.    The mat should not contain more than 40 per cent.
of copper in order to get clean slag.           The assayer therefore
 arranges his samples according to their quality as determined
 by the eye. Those full of mundic, having much sulphur and
iron, and containing arsenic, are kept apart, in order to be sub
jected to a dull red heat for a short time to expel a portion of
these impurities before adding flux.
    A portion of the sample to be assayed is weighed off. The
assayers have special weights divided into 100 parts, termed cents
or centners, with 3, 4, #, Tºth ; 100 parts or cents are generally
taken; and if no excess of sulphur or arsenic be present to re
quire a slight roasting previously, the ore is mixed with a quan
tity of flux composed of lime, borax, fluor-spar, a little salt and
nitre; occasionally a little soda or potash is used, and ground
window-glass. The nitre is termed the operating flux, as it
purifies the ore by supplying oxygen to the arsenic and other
impurities present; the quantity of the flux added is not very
precise, generally about twice the weight of the ore used, but
sufficient to cause the perfect fusion of                           all
                                                    the silica present.
The flux and ore are intimately mixed and put into              clay cru              a
cible having     clay cover, then placed
                   a                             furnace and brought

contains a little copper, and is ground up and fused. This is
generally done along with that from the reducing operation, and
the prill from the two added to the assay.
    When the     ores to be assayed are rich in copper, such as          sub
sulphurets, oxides, and carbonates, there is generally added to
the first fusion, when separating the gangue from                  i. metallic
portion, a quantity of sulphur, in order to form a regulus or mat
of    the desired quality, as stated above, which is proceeded with
as already described.           To fuse carbonates and oxides with sul
phur, and then be at the labour and cost of calcining to get quit
of the sulphur again, seems ridiculous. And when these ores
have little earthy matters in them, it is unnecessary; but when,
as in many cases, there are upwards of 50 per cent. of earthy
 matters present, in fusing these with a reducing flux, the liability
 of  the oxide of copper to combine with the silica and remain in
 the slag is so great, that it is found better in practice to take
 the apparently longest method in order to obtain the most correct
 results.
     The above is a mere outline of the general method by which
 the ores of copper are assayed.           The following may be said to be
 a  general  rule followed in       suiting   the fluxes, &c. to the kind of

   By the results of the assays both the buyer and seller of the
ores are guided, and the regular agreement of the various assay
ers in their results is a proof of general accuracy.     When, week
after   week,  not less than a dozen  assayers, every  one separatel
assaying the same sample of ore two or three times over, are all
found to agree within Tºrth of a per cent., it must be a source of
confidence to            all
                   parties. Nevertheless many      the assayers know                     of

                        Mr.   J. Napier    on Copper Smelting.               199
provides himself with three bottles or glass tubes of equal                      di
mensions, and a measure graduated into 10 or 100 divisions; a
common alkalimeter answers the purpose: 2 grains of pure
copper are weighed off and dissolved in nitromuriatic acid, then
excess of ammonia added.     This solution is made up to two
measures exactly of the graduated glass or alkalimeter. Two of
the bottles or tubes are filled with the solution, and well-stopped
and placed upon a frame.       To test an ore by this method, 20
or more    grains are digested  in nitromuriatic acid, as previously
described, ammonia added and then filtered; the blue solution
is now tried by filling with it the remaining third tube, or bottle,
and placing it between the other two in the frame and comparing
the colour; it is diluted carefully until the tint is exactly the
same as the tubes outside; the whole is then measured in the
alkalimeter, every measure of which being equal to one grain of
copper, the per-centage is soon ascertained.     A little practice in
this method gives     tolerably  accurate results with expedition;
however, they are generally too high to serve as a guide in pur
chasing the ore. By making up test-bottles of different strengths,
such as #, #, #, Tº of a grain, the process is well adapted for test
ing slag and refuse of furnaces or other products, and should
form a part of the operations in every assaying-room or smelting
works, a subject we may have occasion to refer to again.
   Similar methods have been recommended, but in which,
instead of judging by the colour, a solution of another salt is used
that destroys the colour, such as the sulphurets of sodium and
potassium; solutions of these salts of such strength are employed,
that a given measure is equivalent to a given weight of copper. Mr.
H.  Parkes has recommended a solution of cyanide of potassium as
follows:—“Take      a given quantity of pure copper (say, for instance,
10  grains),  place  it in a flask, and dissolve in nitric acid; add
ammonia in     excess,  and then make it into a bulk of about 2500
grains by measure by the addition of water, although this is not
absolutely necessary.       Dissolve 1          oz.

   This process may be variously modified; and when care is
taken, gives accurate results, but far too complicated for ordinary
use. We shall have occasion to allude to this process again in
reference to large operations.
    A   variety of other methods                 for determining the quantity of
copper       in    ores have been recommended by different
                    copper
parties,      all
           more      less depending upon careful manipulation.

have been advocated.

well worthy of transcription; but the complexity of the requisite
diagrams renders it impossible, whilst the enunciations would be
unintelligible without them.    Indeed one of the peculiarities of
Swale's geometry is the complexity of his diagrams: he almost
invariably uses more lines than any other investigator; but this
disadvantage is more than counterbalanced by the elegant sim
plicity of his reasonings, and the vast number of collateral pro
perties which he developes in his processes.    In these respects
I know of no    geometer  who has so  nearly equalled him as the
late Professor Davies, whose diagrams have frequently presented
such a similarity to those used by Mr. Swale as to lead some of
the friends of the latter to suppose that Mr. Davies had access
to these MSS. long before he even knew of their existence.    The
Swale MSS. were not seen by Professor Davies until “October 5,
1850,” and he had only time to write the few notes respecting
them contained in No. VII. of this series of papers before his
progress was arrested by the hand of death.
    “A Collection of Problems by the Compasses alone” occupies
pages 292–332; but since they are principally of an elementary
character, they need not be further particularized.               His son
appears to have been very expert in such constructions; for on
page 296, after giving an elegant determination of “the centre
 of a given circle,” he adds, “this method, which is more simple
 and elegant than Mascheroni’s, was discovered by J. H. Swale,
junior, 19th February 1829.” The solution of isolated problems
 by ordinary geometry is again resumed at page 332, and is con
tinued throughout the remainder of the two volumes.                 In the
page just cited, a theorem occurs which appears to have been
 “sent to Professor Leybourn, 6th Dec. 1830," but did not find
 its way into the Repository;          furnishes      ready proof      the       of

    The  problems       “Tangencies,” already mentioned, occur                        in
 pp. 383-386; the fifth and sixth cases being first constructed
 from the principles              of
                            the poles        similitude, and afterwards

                                        is
plication  of  the problems already alluded                 preparatory
                                                                 to    as             to

204            Mr. T. T. Wilkinson’s Additions  to the late
 them under the name of “Original Theorems on the Circle,”
 and appears to have taken more than ordinary pains to complete
the demonstrations, and apply the properties deduced to pro
blems corresponding to the theorems and others related to them.
 The latter portion of this MS. is fully prepared for the press:—
five theorems are distinctly enunciated, demonstrated, and applied
 to the solution of ten collateral problems under the extended
 title of “Original Theorems on the Circle, with their use in the
 determination of some Geometrical Problems.”         Mr. Davies's
 attention had   evidently  been drawn to this remarkable portion
 of the   MSS.,   for his  pencilled autograph occurs at the head
 of the page, indicating that what follows is a repetition of
 the preceding theorems and problems.        An earlier manuscript
 appears to have been destroyed in order to form this; and as
 such is the case with several of the remaining ones, we may
reasonably account for the absence of those of earlier dates:—no
 doubt the contents of those destroyed had already found their
 way into periodical works and his own Geometrical Amusements,
 and hence could readily be dispensed with after transferring what
 was considered worthy of preservation to the manuscripts still
 remaining. Volume IV., which is endorsed “Geometry, and
 Algebra,” commences with a few problems on Loci, which he
 notes as having been “sent to Mr. Shepherd, 12th Nov. 1830.”
The general problem of Inclinations occupies pages 2, 89,91, 93,
 of which a “General Analysis and Construction ” are given;
other portions of the volume are devoted to the consideration of
 isolated geometrical problems from various sources, some of which
 are noticed as sent to him by Messrs. Whitley and Shepherd;
 pages 101 to 132 contain a connected series of forty-two geome
 trical exercises originally compiled as “Lessons” for his son ;
 and amongst these are interspersed solutions of some difficult
 Diophantine problems, one of which is Question 310 of the Ma
 thematical Repository, where the “Prize Medal” is awarded to
 “A Lady” (Mrs. Somerville) for her solution. An obituary
 notice of Mr. William Hilton, editor of the Liverpool Student,
justly designated by Professor Davies as “a work of rare merit,”
occurs in page 102, where he is stated to have died “ of Apoplexy,
at Liverpool, on the 8th of May 1826.”
    The fifth manuscript volume is entitled “Mathematical
 Scraps,” and commences with a variety of methods for drawing
tangents to a given circle, so as to be divided by a line given in
position and the point of contact into parts having a given ratio.
 Pages 20 and 21 contain no fewer than eight methods of drawing
 “through a given point P, a line that shall tend to the point of
concourse of two other lines AB and CD given in position;” a
problem, for whose ready solution, by draughtsmen, the “Centro

linead” was expressly invented.     The eighth method being re
markably simple is here transcribed:—
   “Draw PH, PK, parallel to AB and CD; and the required
line PQ will pass through L the point of bisection of HK.”
   “Some problems (19) on the Maxima” and their application
occupy pages 32–45, one of which is noted as “sent to Whitley,”
and another difficult theorem “to puzzle Shepherd;”—a “new
Theorem from Mr.Whitley” and a “Locus from Mr. Shepherd”
are merely enunciated whilst the rest are constructed only. The
latter portion of the MS. contains solutions to some of the most
difficult equations in Bland's algebraical problems, several of
which exhibit a ready command of algebraical artifice, and the
remainder is filled up with extracts from works having no relation
to mathematical subjects.
   The title of volume VI. almost sufficiently explains        con                                 its
tents:—it      “Memorandums,

 given quantities;” each successive variation unfolding new pro
 perties of the illustrative diagrams, and affording additional
 proofs of the extensive powers and ingenuity of their author. A
 question from the Mathematician proposed “about 1750, by John
 Turner, who had a school at Heath, near Wakefield, Yorkshire,”
 is considered on pp. 327–8; and a case of “Apollonius on            In
 clinations” appropriately closes the volume, which, from internal
 evidence and the title affixed to the geometrical portion, most
probably contains the latest efforts of Mr. Swale's untiring mind.
    I have been the more particular in describing the contents of
 these manuscript volumes, partly in consequence of their number
 and extent, but mostly from the extreme improbability of even a
tithe of them being ever given to the public.          Portions occur
here and    there, like oases in a  desert, which   might   be selected
for publication in a separate form did the taste for the ancient
geometry warrant such a proceeding; but since such is not likely
soon to be the case, the probability is that an immense mass of
Mr. Swale's speculations must ever remain in an incomplete and
unprofitable condition,--a notable monument of misdirected
energy and useless expenditure of valuable time.        His systematic
researches on   tangencies,  maxima and     minima, the inscription of
polygons in circles and in each other, printed in his Apollonius,
afford convincing proofs of how much he was capable when his
extensive powers were directed to regular subjects of inquiry;
for the elegant methods of research employed in these papers,
and the simplicity and beauty of the results obtained, must ever
command the admiration of geometers.           His fertility of inven
tion and originality of conception were inferior to those of no
contemporary geometer; and had he directed those energies to
systematic inquiries which he expended in the solution of some
thousands of isolated and comparatively uninteresting questions,
he might have systematized scattered topics or originated new
theories, in which he would have rivalled Carnot in transversals,
Davies in spherics and porisms, or Chasles in anharmonic ratio,
and have secured for his own name a permanent place in- the
history of modern geometry.
    What will ultimately become of the MSS. is of cotrse beyond
conjecture. That they will be almost religiously preserved b
his son during his life no one will doubt who is acquainted wit
the profound veneration he entertains for the memory of a kind
and indulgent father; but when we call to mind that a second
generation has deliberately burnt the MSS. left by the Stewarts,

XXX.        Theorems in the Doctrine                  of      Combinations.              By the Rev.
   Thomas P. KIRKMAN, A.M., Rector of Croft with Southworth.
      To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
         GENTLEMEN,
      WOULD      beg your permission to enunciate the following
       theorems in your Journal:—               -
    A. With 7 symbols can be formed 21 triads, so that every
 duad shall be thrice employed.
    B. Two distinct systems of 7 quadruplets each can be made
                                                                    be all
 with 7 symbols, both exhibiting twice         the     duads.                      21
      C.   system
           A                 of   21
                         quadruplets can        made with    symbols,                     7
 so  that every possible duad shall      six times     be
                                                   employed.
      D. With          13
                  symbols can       made three different groups
                                                be                                                         of
 triads, each group once containing         the duads.        all

         With              different triads can        made,                 4, be             8, so       to
                                                                             5,                9, as
 exhaust the possible duads, once, twice,                         10,        6,           7,
 11, 12,         or   13   times.
       With (12n+3) symbols can
      F.                         formed triads                be                          so
                                                                                               + as

      G.   With        27
                    symbols triads can                        be
                                          made, till the duads have
 been      all

XXXI.     On the supposed Identity of the Agent concerned in the

I     HAVE  in a former part of this essay made some observations
   on the evidence afforded by the deflections of the galvanometer,
and will now offer some additional considerations on the same
subject, believing that it involves the whole question, namely,
whether these deflections are metrical indications of the opera
tion of one undecomposable because uncompounded electric fluid
or agent, always the same in    nature, varying only     its
                                                        quantity                                        in
and intensity;                 or
                     are there conditions       the electric fluid differ      of
ing from each other         respect                         composition,
                                                               of                             or

                                        constitution
which, independently        quantity     intensity, are far more pow or
erful than ordinary electricity      producing deflections?

                                         that deflections and voltaic
phaenomena        general are inexplicable according
                        in                                   the doctrine                      to

tude, not     the hope       proving anything, but merely with the
                                          of
intention       of in
              submitting       the judgement  to     the reader whether             of
such striking effects can result from            ordinary electricity,         an
feeble that          its

 considerable whirl of the needle took place.     In further proof
 that the whirl of the needle twice round was due to the chemical

 deflection    was      trifling.

    Such are a few of the objections which have occurred to me
in considering the explanation of voltaic phaenomena.                I now
conclude this essay, calling to mind an observation of the eminent
philosopher whose name                        I
                                   have been compelled to introduce
more   frequently   than             I
                             could have wished.       He says, “as every
man who has the courage, not to say rashness, of forming an
opinion of his own, thinks it better than any from which he dif
fers, so it is only deeper investigation, and most generally future
investigators who can decide who is in the right*.” Should
any one hereafter think it worth                while       his
                                                           prove that my        to

  Magnitude of the Diurnal Motion                              of the Magnetic          Needle.             221
    The divergence, according to this, is least in the month of
January and greatest in the month of May.
    It is generally believed that one principal cause of this diurnal
change is to be traced to the warming of the earth.         I will not
 venture to decide what    part is played by the temperature   in the
 production of these regular alterations; true it is that a minimum
 of the declination occurs in the morning nearly at the time when
 the temperature is lowest, and that a maximum occurs in the
 afternoon about the time when the temperature is highest. But
the magnetic declination attains a second minimum between 10
and 12 o'clock at night, and a second maximum between 2 and
4 o'clock in the morning; that is to say, two regular maxima
and two minima in the day, while in the temperature only one
minimum and one maximum occurs.           If the heat were the only
or even the chief cause of the  magnetic   variation, the magnitude
of the daily variation of the declination must proceed side by side
with the increase and decrease of temperature during the year,
which is not proved by the observations which have been thus
far made.    True it is that the said magnitude is least at the time
of lowest temperature; but at the time of highest temperature
(July) it has already decreased, having attained        maximum                       its                       in
the month       of   May.
   But another remark involuntarily suggests itself when the
foregoing results are reflected upon —
   The magnitude          of
                     the daily variation    the declination through of
out the months          of

    I am   unable to explain the connexion of these phaenomena,
 but will leave it to other investigators to follow up this highly
 interesting fact which has resulted from our observations.
    At the end of his paper Dr. Lamont remarks, “that the
 diurnal deviation of the horizontal intensity is subject to a con
 siderable change; but whether of the same period as that which
 I have proved to exist in the declination,              I  am not yet in a posi
tion to   pronounce,      &c.”                          -
    The investigation of the hourly deviation during a day proves
that two maxima and two minima occur, and moreoverasfollows:–
    Between 6h and 7h P.M. mean stand.
    Between 10" and 11h P.M. a maximum (the least during the
day).                                                      -
    #.
    Between 12" and 15 A.M. a minimum (the least during the
day, greater than the mean horizontal intensity).
               3"and4"A.M.a maximum (the greatest during the day).
    Between 6h and 7h A.M. mean stand.
    Between 9" and 11" A.M. a minimum (the greatest during the
day, less than the mean horizontal intensity).
    The times of the maxima, minima, and mean magnitude of
the horizontal intensity occur at earlier hours in the warm months
than in the cold ones.
    The horizontal intensity during the hours of the day is regu
larly smaller, while during the hours of the night it is regularly
greater than the mean horizontal intensity.
    In order to ascertain whether the horizontal intensity is subject
to a periodical alteration, I chose from our observations, which had
been made three times a day, those made at 8" A.M. and at 8"

   Magnitude of the Diurnal Motion of the Magnetic Needle.                                                                                        223
P.M.    The first falls somewhat before the lowest stand (the great
est  minimum),    the other a couple of hours before the evening
maximum; the difference of both therefore does not give the
entire magnitude of the diurnal change in the horizontal intensity.
   The deviations, expressed in decimal parts of the absolute
horizontal intensity, are as follows:—
    Alteration of the Horizontal Intensity from 8 o’clock A.M. to
    8 o’clock P.M. Göttingen time. Difference =8| P.M.–8h A.M.

XXXIII.     On the unequal Heating Effect of a Galvanic Current
   while  entering   and emerging from a Conductor.       By RICHARD
   ADIE, Esq.
    To the Editors     of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,                                 Liverpool, July 5, 1852.
             Supplementary Number for July,                   I
INa yourpaper by Prof. W. Thomson, wherein
                                                     p. 529,     observe
                                                     he alludes to M.
Peltier's experiment on the supposed absorption of heat by a
bismuth and antimony joint while conducting a feeble galvanic
current passing (on the supposition of there being one current
only) from the bismuth to the antimony.           In the year 1843, I
made some experiments connected with this subject, and as I
came to conclusions which gave a different explanation to M.
Peltier's researches,    I should be glad to avail myself of the me
dium of your Journal briefly to notice them.
   Among the metals bismuth stands as the most imperfect con
ductor of electricity; and as the heat developed by an electrical
current passing along a bar is in proportion to the resistance to
conduction, it follows that, in compound metallic bars of uniform
sectional area throughout, the bismuth portion is more heated
than the other parts. In a compound bar composed of antimony,
bismuth and antimony, again, when a feeble galvanic current is
made to pass through this arrangement, the conditions required
for observing M. Peltier's experiment are supplied; for at the
one end of the bismuth bar the current through the joint is
from antimony to bismuth, while at the other end of the bis
muth bar the passage through the joint is from bismuth to an
timony.     To ascertain the temperatures at these joints, two
delicate thermometers are attached and enveloped with a little
dry cotton wool. A galvanic current made.to pass through this
arrangement elevates the thermometer where the electricity enters
the bismuth more than the one where it quits the bismuth; the
difference between these two thermometers            varying with the
changes in the battery from which the electrical current is de
rived.    Now, according to Peltier's views, the thermometer at
the joint where the current passes from the bismuth to the
antimony, should, during the conduction of a feeble current,
stand lower than the temperature of the atmosphere; to ascer
tain this point    I have frequently repeated the experiments with

 invariably showed a different temperature, the one where the
 electrical current quitted the bismuth to enter the antimony
 being the lower, but always above the temperature of the sur
 rounding air.        This property found in the bismuth bar, which
 was  directly    derived from the examination of Peltier's law, ex
 tends to   any   other kind of matter, whether in the gaseous, fluid,

 required for the experiment being that the current be brought
 to the body tested by conductors which offer less resistance to
 its passage than the body itself                          +.

           E  have long wished to see an English abstract of the researches
              of M. du Bois-Reymond, and the book before us answers to
  the wish. It commences with a brief but extremely interesting historic
  introduction, in which, as might be expected, Galvani and Volta
  are the principal figures.      Comparing these two celebrated men, the
 author observes,
     “No one who wishes to judge impartially of the scientific history
  of these times and of its leaders, will consider Galvani and Volta as
  equals, or deny the vast superiority of the latter over                  his oppo                   all
 nents     orfellow-workers, more especially over those                the Bologna               of

                                  were combined           Volta. He possessed      in
 that “incomprehensible talent,’                          as

the introduction of a cylindrical or prismatic piece of muscle, one of
the transverse sections of which is caused to abut against one of the
cushions, and the other transverse section against the opposite
cushion.     The circuit is now complete, the muscle playing the part
of a little  battery;    the galvanometer is included in the circuit; and
if a current be     produced,   it will exhibit itself at the galvanometer.
In the above     arrangement,     however, no current is produced.           Let one
of the ends of the muscle remain in contact with the cushion, as
before, and let the muscle be bent up and caused to rest with                                                      its

through. The animal was then poisoned                                        by

 gave rise      the discussion before alluded to,

of the frog, while he strongly contracted the muscles of the other
arm.    The expected result at once exhibited itself, and a consider
able deflection was obtained. This result has been abundantly cor
roborated; the writer may perhaps be permitted to contribute his
personal testimony, he having on a first trial obtained a deflection of
thirty degrees. The sense of the deflection depends upon the arm
contracted; on changing the arm, the deflection is in the opposite
sense.
   The electric deportment of the nerves has often been a subject of
anxious inquiry. A nerve possesses a current which exhibits itself
in a manner precisely similar to the muscular one. The arrange
ment of an experiment with the nerve is in substance the same as
that applied to a muscle, and the direction of the current follows the
same law.     It proceeds from the transverse section through the con
necting wire to the longitudinal section.    It is an error to suppose
that the various tissues of the animal  body are electromotive towards
each other.    If the current due to each particular be shut out, Du
Bois-Reymond shows that no possible combination of muscle, nerve,
tendon, skin and bone, can produce any electric action.
   Some slight alterations will probably suggest themselves to the
translator in the preparation of a second edition.    The name of the
author—not an easy one to English organs—occurs too often; and
the polemical tone of the book might, in certain places, be soft
ened down with advantage.        In a work of such intrinsic value no
such seasoning is required.    The letters referring to the diagram at
page 33 need a trifling correction; and in one or two cases the word
“observation,' although the correct equivalent of the German Beo
bachtung, might be changed for some other word which would not at
the same time answer to Bemerkung.        On the whole, however, the
translation has been carried out with care and fidelity; and the
English investigator must feel indebted to Dr. Bence Jones for pla
cing such a valuable work within his reach.

time to time to the Mechanics' Magazine by the author, and doubt

obscurity.   The avowed design of the work is to explain the causes
of certain effects whose hidden springs have eluded the researches

  Light and air are regarded by our author as the two great powers
which uphold the universe.   In his opening paragraph he naively
inquires, “Is not the agitation of boiling water caused by air which
enters through the bottom of the vessel, and which rising up
through the water causes the bubbling called boiling " We really
imagined that Mr. Woodhead, in stating the case thus, had conde
scendingly placed himself in the position of some interesting little
prattler, standing at his nurse's knee, and putting to the said nurse
the above philosophical query; and that Mr. Woodhead, in his own
benign way, was going to set the little questioner right. But no—
this is Mr.Woodhead's own opinion. He believes that the air actually
enters in the manner described; he believes that light is air in a state
of radiation; and his theory of caloric                                is,
                                                    that light penetrates bodies

of light and is inclined so that the reflected rays shall make a small
angle with the surfaces.          Near the speculum the axis of reflected
rays coincides with that of the direct rays, but at a greater distance
the two discs are separate. The speculum being placed horizontally
across the pencil, coloured fringes appear both on the upper and lower
side of the reflected disc. These two sets of fringes are alike in their
colours and in the order of their colours, but the upper fringes are
narrower than the lower, and they diminish in breadth with their
distance from the disc, while the lower ones increase in breadth with
their distance.      If only one edge of the speculum is in the pencil
there are only fringes on one side of the disc.
    It appears that the breadth of the fringes is in some inverse pro
portion to the breadth of the speculum.              When the speculum is a
triangle with a very acute angle, the broadest fringes, and those most
removed from the disc, answer to the points of the speculum where
it is narrowest, and they increase regularly towards the point which
answers to the acute angle or apex of the speculum.               Their form is
hyperbolic.
    When the edges of the speculum are parallel, the disc near to it
is filled with groups of fringes which vary in number, in breadth and
                        a all
in colour, at        the distances from the speculum.          At one distance
they form only       dark line running through the disc, and this            deep                           is

   Though the phenomenon seem to indicate a crossing of the rays
both in flexion and reflexion, at or near the distance at which the
dark or deep purple line is formed, yet the author has never been
able to observe that an obstacle placed between that point and the
speculum (or the bending edges), made the fringes on the opposite
side of the disc at the screen to disappear, but only the fringes on
the same side with itself.

    From    the discussion of the magnetic observations made at Toronto
and Hobarton in the years 1843, 44, 45, the author in a former
paper adduced evidence of the existence of periodical laws by which
the principal disturbances of the magnetic declination appeared to
be regulated. Having since had occasion to examine the disturb
ances of the Declination at the same two stations in the three suc
ceeding years 1846, 47, 48, he states that he had the satisfaction of
finding that the observations of these years confirm every deduction
which he had ventured to make from the analysis of the disturbances
of the former period; whilst new and important features have pre
sented themselves in the comparison of the frequency and amount
 of the disturbances in different years, apparently indicating the
 existence of a periodical variation, which, either from a real or causal
 connection, or by a singular coincidence, corresponds precisely, both
 in period and epoch, with the variation in the frequency and magni
 tude of the solar spots, recently announced by M. Schwabe as the
 result of his systematic and long-continued observations.
     The method pursued in examining the laws of the Declination
  disturbances in 1846, 47,48, is the same as that adopted in the three
  preceding years.      Every hourly observation which was found to
  differ a certain amount from the mean value of the Declination in
  the same month and at the same hour was, as before, separated from
  the rest.    The number of observations thus separated in the period
  commencing July 1, 1843, and ending July 1, 1848, was at Toronto
  3940, and at Hobarton 3469, being respectively 1 in 9:43 at Toronto,
  and 1 in 10:55 at Hobarton, of the whole number of hourly observa
  tions. The disturbed observations being distributed into the several
  hours, months, and years in which they had occurred, their numbers
  and aggregate values in each particular hour, month, and year, were
  ascertained. They were then divided into easterly and westerly deflec
  tions, and the same process of distribution was gonethrough with each
  of the divisions. The mean hourly, monthly and yearly number and
  aggregate values in the whole period were then taken as the respec
  tive units, and the ratios to these units computed for each of the hours,
  months and years; whereby the relations, whether of numbers or
  of aggregate values in different hours, different months, and different
  years, were shown.
     The results thus obtained are discussed separately in the follow
  ing order:—
     I. Inequality or variation in the number and aggregate values of
  the disturbed observations in different hours. This examination is
  made by classing together—1st, easterly disturbances at Toronto
  and westerly at Hobarton; and 2nd, westerly at Toronto and east
  erly at Hobarton.
     From the first classification, it appears that at both stations there
  are fewer disturbances, and their aggregate values are less in the
  hours of the day than in those of the night; that 9 P.M. is the hour
  of the maximum of frequency and also of value at Toronto, and
   11 P.M. at Hobarton; and that the periods of minima are between
  2 and 3 P.M. at Toronto, and between 5 and 6 A.M. at Hobarton.

234                                       Royal Society.
It appears   further that the average value has a similar law of varia
 tion to that of the number and aggregate value.
    The second classification shows that at Hobarton the contrast both
in frequency and aggregate value is still between the hours of the
 day and those of the night, the ratios being, however, in this case
 greater than unity during the former hours, and less than unity during
the latter, contrary to what takes place with the easterly disturb
ances: at Toronto the contrast is between the hours from noon to
 midnight, and those from midnight to noon, the ratios being greater
 than unity during the latter hours, and less than unity during the
 former.    In both cases the variation in the ratios appears to be de
 pendent on the hours of local, not on those of absolute time.
    From a table showing the ratios of easterly aggregate values to
westerly at Toronto, and of westerly to easterly at Hobarton, it ap
pears that, at both stations, the deflection (due to disturbance) of
the end of the magnet of the same name as the magnetic latitude
is to the west during the hours of the day or from 5 A.M. to
5 P.M. : at a little before 6 P.M. at Toronto, and a little after 6
at Hobarton, the deflections pass through zero (or the undisturbed
position of the magnet) into easterly deflections of that end. The
magnitude of those deflections rapidly augments to a maximum at
9 P.M. at Toronto, and at 10 P.M. at Hobarton; they again pass
through zero between 4 and 5 A.M.; and attain the westerly maxi
mum at 7 A.M., the variation in the magnetic direction due to the
disturbances depending, like those of number and value, on the hour
of local time.

from 0-60 in 1843 to l'43 in 1848, and the ratio of the value from
O-52 in 1843 to 1.51 in 1848, the variation in each having much
 more the aspect of a periodical inequality than of an accidental va
 riation.   Looking to the theoretical importance of the existence of
 a periodical inequality of this nature, affecting at the same time, and
 in the same manner, parts of the globe most remote from each other,
 the author refers to the confirmation it may obtain from contempora
 neous observations at other stations.        Pending such confirmations
 he remarks that this progressive increase in the amount of disturb
 ance at Toronto and Hobarton, between the years 1843 and 1848,
 derives great additional interest and importance from its apparent
 connection with an equally remarkable progressive increase which
 took place at the same two stations, in the magnitude of the diurnal
 range of the Declination in the same years. From the mean magni
 tude of the diurnal variation of the Declination in each month, tables
 are deduced showing the mean magnitude or ranges in the four
 months constituting the respective seasons, and in the twelve months
 constituting the year, in each year from 1843 to 1848, both at To
 ronto and at Hobarton.      From these tables it appears that at each
  station, for each of the seasons and for the whole year, the diurnal
 range of the Declination had a progressive increase during that
  period; the increase for the whole year being from 8'90 in 1843 to
  12'-04 in 1848 at Toronto, and from 7' 66 to 11'43 at Hobarton.
  In support of the opinion that these progressive increases in the
  range of the diurnal variation at two stations separated from each
  other by nearly half the surface of the globe are independent and
  corresponding measures of a general phenomenon, the author ad
  duces the results obtained by Dr. Lamont from the observations at
  Munich. From these it appears that the mean range of the diurnal
  variation in monthly periods at Munich increased progressively from
  7-82 in 1843 to 11’ 15 in 1848.
     The author remarks that the increase so distinctly marked in the
  two classes of phenomena between the years 1843 and 1848 tends
  to indicate a causal connection subsisting between the disturbances
  and the regular diurnal variation.      If we suppose the diurnal varia
  tion to be divided into two   portions,   one of which is nearly uniform
  in amount    throughout  the  year  (at the same station), whilst the
  other has a  hemispherical  phase,  developed in either hemisphere ac
  cording as the sun is in the northern or the southern signs,—it is the
  former of these two portions which sustains the variation consistent
  with and apparently related to the variation in the number and values
  of the disturbances.
     That the progressive increase in the mean monthly diurnal range,
  from 1843 to 1848, was not confined at Toronto and Hobarton to
  the Declination only, but took place likewise in the diurnal variations
  of the Inclination and Total Force, is shown by the tables which are
  given.
     In conclusion the author observes, that “in our present ignorance
  of the physical agency by which the periodical magnetic variations
  are produced, the possibility of the discovery of some cosmical con

         ON   THE INDIRECT BLEACHING POWER                                              OF STIBAETHYLE.
   During the last year Prof. Löwig and myself made some experi
ments in the laboratory at Zurich upon stibaethyle, in order to test
its power of bleaching, and it turned out that this remarkable body
destroyed the colour of indigo-solutions still more energetically than
even phosphorus.    We added a small quantity of stibaethyle to a
comparatively large amount of indigo-solution, shook the whole with
atmospheric air, and found that the colour was destroyed in a few
seconds.
        There can             that stibmethyle, kakodyle and similar
                          be no doubt
compounds would act like the stibaethyle. These substances are so
oxidizable that they take fire in atmospheric air even, at the ordinary
temperature; and it may be inferred that they are more powerful
exciters of oxygen than phosphorus, and consequently possess a
great power of bleaching.—Ibid.

applied by Professor Dove.     The inquiries in which these inven

    M. Dove’s researches have reference chiefly    the stereoscopic to
combination of colours.    In 1841 he showed that the stereo

                         the complementary colours         polarized       of
rays produced white light.     He now makes use      drawings   with of
coloured outlines, the colours being either dioptric      catoptric:      or
the former      he

one and the same straight line.        But it is altogether impossible
to obtain a relief in this case. A hexagon embracing a six
pointed star is always obtained, the sides of which           consist               all                of
red and blue lines running alongside each other                 contact.                 in

cide, but will project themselves in directions which cross each
other upon a surface which does not pass through the point of
intersection of both directions.
   M. Dove next goes on to consider the cause of the glistening,
which, for example, is observed on the surface of varnished
pictures, and which may be destroyed by quenching the
polarized rays with a Nichol’s prism. In every case in which a
surface appears thus shining, there is a reflecting layer, more or
less transparent, through which another body is viewed ; the
glistening owes      origin    its
                               the combination to   the rays reflected        of
from the surface and those which      pass  through   the transparent
layer from the body behind. This         increased when the number

246    Dr. Tyndall    on the Progress   of the Physical Sciences:
distinct vision the blue flame is larger than the red one; and so
also beyond this distance, the white object on black ground
appears larger than the black object on white ground.      In this
way the phaenomena of irradiation are connected by a chain of
experimental facts with chromatic phaenomena, which directly
point the way to the explanation of the former. The complete"
explanation is embraced by the proposition, that for a given         di
stance the capacity   of accommodation     of   the eye is different for
white and black.
   In a recent paper M. Dove has added some proofs to those
already given of the fact, that blue and red are plainly visible at
different distances.  Beyond the point of distinct vision, a micro
meter drawn in black lines upon a white ground appears as a gray
spot, when drawn in white lines on a black ground it appears as a
bright one.     If a series of parallel white lines be viewed through
a blue glass, the observer gradually receding until the lines run
into each other and are no longer distinct, from this distance the
lines, if observed through a red glass, will appear quite distinct.
The reader may in this way easily satisfy himself that the distance
of distinct vision is considerably greater for red than for blue.
In the same way it may be plainly shown that the distance for
white is also greater than for blue. It is difficult to obtain pig
ments of such equal intensity that their combination shall ex
hibit lustre, but the lustre can be readily obtained as follows:—
A drawing in white lines upon a black ground is combined in
the stereoscope with another in black lines upon a white ground,
and viewed through a coloured glass held before both eyes.
With the ruby-glass and bright light the relief appears like
polished copper.       In this way we learn that the results, as
regards lustre and irradiation, obtained with white and black, are
also true for any colours whatever.
    It is known that a green spot on a red field, which is moved
quickly hither and thither, appears to oscillate.          Wheatstone
has shown that a red heart on blue ground appears to oscillate
still more quickly; hence the appearance is not to be referred
to the action of complementary colours, but to a difference of
refrangibility.    Sir David Brewster was the first to observe on
geological maps that blue and red do not appear in the same
plane, and the reason of this M. Dove considers to be rendered
completely evident by his stereoscopic experiments.          His expla
nation of the fluttering heart is as follows:—When the sheet is
 moved in  its  own plane, the heart and the ground         on which  it
 rests describe  tangents of   the same absolute     length,  but with
 radii which the eye regards   as  different. The angular velocities

of both    thus appear to be different, and hence the object seems
to oscillate upon the plane which bears                                          it.

of the vibrations causes the most perfect summation of impres
sions, because the interferences which take place when the times
of oscillation are different then fall away.      This uniformity
renders the tone  pure, and,  in the case of colours, renders them
homogeneous.     Blue stands in the same relation to red that a
higher tone occupies with regard to a deeper one. With blue
the vibrations of the retina are more frequent than with red, as
the vibrations of the tympanum are more frequent with a high
tone than with a deep one. Now it is proved that with deep
tones the limit of sensibility becomes contracted when the tones
become weaker; and this is completely analogous to the case,
that by decreasing brightness, the limit of sensibility for the red
rays should become narrower.              Hence with weak illumination,
red, as a colour, disappears; while blue, on account of the greater
frequency of             its
                      vibrations, remains longer visible.

where F(q) represents a small correction dependent on the
angle p. You consider that this correction, and that due to the
torsion of the fibre, may be neglected through the extent of an

    This result of your calculation does not agree with the results

XXXIX.     On the state of Static and of Dynamic Electricity during
  several heavy Showers observed at Brussels on the 14th of June
  1852. By A. QUETELET, Membre de l'Académie Royale de
I
    Belgique”.
       KNOW  but few observations made simultaneously during
     rains and storms on the static and the dynamic electricity of
the air. These two meteorological elements are, notwithstanding,
of the greatest importance, and rarely march together; that is
to say, during powerful electric tensions it often occurs that no
current is observed; and, on the contrary, very decided currents
sometimes exist while the electrometer exhibits nothing extra
ordinary.
   The showers of which               I     am about to render an account                      have
presented some peculiarities which appear to me to be worthy of
attention.   The dynamic electricity was observed by means of a
very sensible Gourjon’s galvanometer; one of the wires was con
nected with the earth, and the other with a conductor placed on
the roof of the observatory.  The static electricity was observed
by means of the atmospheric electrometer of Peltier; the obser
vations were made on the summit of one of the turrets of the
observatory, and on a small platform placed at an altitude higher
than the surrounding objects.
   On the 14th of June 1852 it had rained at different intervals
 during the morning; 2.55 millimetres of water were collected.
 Towards noon thick clouds floated in the inferior regions of the
 atmosphere, between which portions of the heaven and of cumuli
 were visible, whose splendid white contrasted with their gray
 and slightly copper-coloured hues.     The Centigrade thermo
 meter marked 13°6 and the barometer 739.73 millimetres. The

   I ought to remark, that during the showers not a single peal
of thunder was heard, and not the -smallest flash of lightning
was visible.
   The example which I have just cited shows how, during the
same shower, according to the instant at which an observation is
made, we may obtain either positive or negative electricity; this
electricity is very energetic during the showers.       If the obser
vation is made at the moment when the sign changes, it may
appear to be nearly null; these inversions, it may be remarked,
are always of short duration.

    is assumed in this communication that the undulatory
           of radiant heat and light, according to which light
is merely radiant heat, of which the vibrations are performed in
periods          certain limits of duration, is true. “The che
mical  rays,” beyond  the violet end of the spectrum, consist of
undulations of which the full vibrations are executed in periods
shorter than those of the extreme visible violet light, or than
about the eight hundred million millionth of a second.        The
periods of the vibrations of visible light                   lie

the earth's atmosphere               is about eighty-four                 foot-pounds per
second.
    Mechanical effect of the statical kind might be produced from
the solar radiant heat, by using it as the source of heat in a
thermo-dynamic engine. It is estimated that about 556 foot
pounds per second of ordinary mechanical effect, or about the
work of “one horse power,” might possibly be produced by such
an engine exposing 1800 square feet to receive solar heat, during
a warm summer day in this country; but the dimensions of the
moveable parts of the engine would necessarily be so great as to
occasion practical difficulties in the way of using it with oecono
mical advantage that might be insurmountable.
    The chemical effects of light belong to the class of mechanical
effects of the statical kind; and reasoning analogous to that                                in
troduced and experimentally verified in the case of electrolysis by
Joule, leads to the conclusion that when such effects are produced
there will be a loss of heating effect in the radiant heat or light
which is absorbed by the body acted on, to an extent thermally
equivalent to the mechanical value of the work done against
forces of chemical affinity.

work;     by which it appears that probably as much as # of the
whole work of     the chemical forces arising from the oxidation of
his   food during   the twenty-four hours, may be directed to raising
his   own weight, by a man walking up-hill for eight hours a day;
and perhaps even as much as # of the work of the chemical forces
may be directed to the overcoming of external resistances by a
man exerting himself for six hours a day in such operations as
pumping.       In the former case there would not be more than 3,
and in the latter not more than       ;  of the thermal equivalent of
the    chemical action emitted as animal heat, on the whole, during
the    twenty-four hours, and the quantities of heat emitted during
the times of working would        bear much smaller proportions re
 spectively than these, to the thermal equivalents of the chemical
 forces actually operating during those times.
     A curious inference is pointed out, that an animal would be
 sensibly less warm in going up-hill than in going down-hill, were
 the breathing not greater in the former case than in the latter.
     The application of Carnot's principle, and of Joule's discoveries
  regarding the heat of electrolysis and the calorific effects of mag
  neto-electricity, is pointed out; according to which it appears
  nearly certain that, when an animal works against resisting force,
  there is not a conversion of heat into external mechanical effect,
  but the full thermal equivalent of the chemical forces is never
  produced; in other words, that the animal body does not act as a
  thermo-dynamic engine; and very probable that the chemical forces
  produce the external mechanical effects through electrical means.
     Certainty regarding the means in the animal body by which
  external mechanical effects are produced from chemical forces
  acting internally, cannot be arrived at without more experiment
  and observation than has yet been applied; but the relation of
  mechanical equivalence, between the work done by the chemical
  forces, and the final mechanical effects produced, whether solely
  heat, or partly heat and partly resistance overcome, may be as
  serted with confidence.     Whatever be the nature of these means,
  consciousness teaches    every individual that they are, to some ex
  tent, subject to the direction of his will. It appears, therefore,
  that animated creatures have the power of immediately applying,
  to certain moving particles of matter within their bodies, forces
  by which the motions of these particles are directed to produce
  desired mechanical effects.

and the heat, or galvanic currents, or other mechanical effects
produced by chemical combination, but in no other way at pre
sent known.      Hence the stores from which mechanical effect may
be drawn      by  man belong
                        -        to one or other of the following
classes:—
   I. The food of animals.
  II. Natural heat.
III.   Solid matter found in elevated positions.
 IV. The natural motions of water and air.
  W. Natural combustibles (as wood, coal, coal-gas, oils, marsh
         gas, diamond, native sulphur, native metals, meteoric iron).
 VI. Artificial combustibles (as smelted or electrolytically depo
         sited metals, hydrogen, phosphorus).
    In the present communication, known facts in natural history
and physical science, with reference to the sources from which
these stores have derived their mechanical energies, are adduced
to establish the following general conclusions:—
    1. Heat radiated from the sun (sunlight being included in this
term) is the principal source of mechanical effect available to man”.
From it is derived the whole mechanical effect obtained by means
of animals working, water-wheels worked by rivers, steam
engines, and galvanic engines, and part at least of the mechanical
effect obtained by means of windmills and the sails of ships not
driven by the trade-winds.
    2. The motions of the earth, moon, and sun, and their mutual
attractions, constitute an important source of available mecha
nical effect.    From them all, but chiefly, no doubt, from the
earth’s motion of rotation, is derived the mechanical effect of
water-wheels driven by the tides.          The mechanical effect so
largely used in the sailing of ships by the trade-winds is derived
partly, perhaps principally, from the earth’s motion of rotation,
and partly from solar heat.

                                          of is,

from them       very inconsiderable, compared with that which

    These numbers agree very well with the formula C19H70, or
C*H*O",         taking the number of atoms of carbon at 40, the
number to which the composition of so many of the other resins,
both fossil and recent, seems to be referable.            By calculation
from this formula the resin should contain in 100 parts,

    This mineral approaches amber (as a single compoundC*H*O")
in composition more nearly than any of the other fossil resins,
differing from it by four atoms of hydrogen if the higher number
of equivalents of carbon be adopted for both, or only one atom
if we   take the smallest numbers expressing their constitution.
    From the hardness of the mineral exceeding that usual in
others of the same class in a considerable degree, it might be
called Scleretinite (a.k\mpös-Émtivm) in the absence of any more
appropriate term.

               On the Fuel suitable for Copper Smelting.
    T has been remarked, that wherever iron ore abounds, coal
        and lime as fuel and flux are contiguous. The opposite
 relations with regard to the fuel is observable in the case of ores
 of copper; where these ores are abundant, coals are not found;
 it is therefore of great consequence that a coal district be sought
 so contiguous that the cost of transit of either coal or ore should
 not interfere with the full development of the mineral wealth of
 either locality.    Such is eminently the condition of the Swansea
 coal district in relation to the Cornwall and Devonshire copper
 InlileS.
     What first induced the old copper smelters to erect their
 works in Swansea rather than Cornwall, we do not at present
 know. The average per-centage of copper in the ore being 8,
 and 20 tons of coal being required in the early period of smelting
 to produce one ton of copper, it was cheaper to take 12# tons
 of ore to Swansea than 20 tons of coal to Cornwall. And Corn
 wall requiring coal for domestic purposes and her tin smelting,
  which by law must be smelted in the county, ensured a back
 freight. These were no doubt some of the causes which deter

district is of the best for smelting purposes.
   Smelting of copper ores commenced in Swansea upwards of
120 years ago, and has since steadily increased.         About 30 years
ago there were 8 smelting-works in and around Swansea; now
there are 15, and 1 in course of erection, having in               about                          all
500 furnaces        operation.

and free burning coal; they give        very great heat and consider

that both qualities of coal should be used; therefore a judicious
mixture of the two is a matter where oeconomy in the production
of copper can be practised, and, as we shall have occasion to

   The advantages of this method of keeping the fire are obvious.
The clinkers are bad conductors, which, with their thickness
from the lowest part to where the fire is active, and the current
of air passing up through them, prevents the heat from being
radiated into the ash-pit.  Moreover the air in passing through
this mass of clinker gets heated, an advantage of no little im
portance in large fires.
   The clinker being thus brought nearly level with the bridge,
and the fire reaching to the roof, it will not burn upwards, but
horizontally; so that when the furnace is in operation, it may
 be looked upon as a blast or cupola laid upon                                                    its   side   to   prevent
 the materials mixing with the fuel.

Should, for instance, the copper be in a certain stage of manu
facture, and the coal contain much sulphur, the copper will be
deteriorated if too little                      air
                                 passing; the sulphur will

sublimed from the coal, and will combine     readily with the copper.
Should there                    be
                    sufficient air, the sulphur will       burned                                    be                  or

                              Mr.      J.   Napier on Copper Smelting.                            271
     Our remarks apply particularly                               to fusing-furnaces.            There
are other furnaces for calcination where a lower heat is required,
and where currents of air are admitted to the chamber otherwise
than through the fire, producing actions and reactions within
the chamber differing from those in the fusing-furnace, which
will be noticed when describing the process of calcination; but
the fuel and the principles of firing are the same, except that
the weakest free burning coal may be used.                 For refining the
metals   generally,    the best coal alone is    used, and that known to
contain no sulphur.
   A fusing-furnace in constant work and of the ordinary size,
consumes about three tons of fuel in twenty-four hours, but the
consumption of fuel varies with the size of the furnaces; a fair
average may be given at two tons of coal for five tons of stuff
melted.
    Patent fuel, which is culm or small coal mixed with pitch or
tar and made into a cake by pressure, then baked at a high heat,
has been tried, but does not compete either in price or quality
with coal in this country; but not being subject to deteriora
tion in a ship's hold, it is found to come into competition with
coal exported from this country.
    Many trials have been made both at home and abroad with
 a mixture of coal and wood, but they have not proved favour
 able to          its
               use.     Coal and wood, and patent fuel and wood,
 have been    extensively    tried abroad against coal alone and patent
 fuel alone,      their effective powers for fusing

      XLIII.       Pendulum      Eaperiments.            By Thomas G. BUNT.
      To the Editors      of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
I
      GENTLEMEN,
     HAVE lately been repeating M. Foucault’s experiment in
      my own house, and endeavouring to ascertain with what
degree of accuracy it may be performed on a comparatively small
scale, and at a much less expense of time and labour than        had                  I
bestowed on it on a former occasion.        I have accordingly   sus
pended, in different parts of my house, three different pendu
lums, and now send you the results of the experiments I have
made with each of them.
   My longest and heaviest pendulum was erected in my stair
case, where, by making an aperture in a landing-place,      obtained         I
a length of 19 feet.     Here             I
                                 suspended from a strong piece of
timber fixed across the angle of two walls, the leaden ball of 53}
lbs. weight, with which              I
                            experimented last summer in the spire
of St. Nicholas, and enclosed it in a glazed case, (having a small
aperture at the top for the wire,) in order to protect it from cur
rents of air.   The azimuth circle, 7 inches in diameter, was fur
nished with vertical and horizontal adjusting screws, and usually
brought within about ºth of an inch below the point of the wire
projecting from the ball. Parallel lines, gºth of an inch asunder,
were drawn across the circle, by means of which the ellipticity,
or semiaxis minor (b), was read off and recorded, in each experi
ment, to the gºndth of an inch. The advantages of short arcs
(which    I
          first perceived and pointed out last summer) have now
become more than ever apparent; so that in the greater part of
my recent experiments I have seldom drawn my pendulum more
than 1 inch from the perpendicular. Commencing with a semi
arc of this magnitude, my 19-feet pendulum will keep up                                    its
vibrations,    so
                that they may                 be
                                   seen, and their azimuthal direc
tion ascertained within
                                 3degrees, after
                                 or           4    period     a                  of   35   or
 40 hours.     I have  not, however,   introduced into my present
series any experiments        long period, but confined myself
                                     of                                                    to
those    which the mean ellipticity has been observed and re
        of
corded.

which the elliptic motion gradually changed from one direction
to the opposite one.         My 19-feet pendulum, when approaching
one of these nodal        lines, would frequently, as in the example
above   cited,  vibrate for hours without any perceptible ellipticity.
   The latitude of my house being about 51° 27'-8, the mean
azimuthal motion per hour, according to Foucault's theory, would
be 11°764, which exceeds only by 0°.025 the mean of these
three experimental results.
   It thus appears, that if sufficient care be taken in the construc
tion of the centre of suspension, and the arc of vibration be con
fined within very narrow limits, this beautiful experiment may be
successfully performed with a pendulum of very moderate di
Inensions.

XLIV.      Report on     M. PASTEUR's      Researches on Aspartic  and
                      Malic Acids.      By M. Biotº.
THEbefore   investigation of which we are about to lay an account
                  the Academy is essentially appertaining to mole
cular chemistry. It is the examination of a case of isomerism
the most extensive and intimate that has been yet observed,
and it is accompanied by striking peculiarities of an entirely
novel character.       The phaenomena of isomerism are in themselves
among those which are most capable of affording an explanation of
the mechanism of chemical reactions, by giving us an opportunity
of investigating by comparison what are the molecular conditions
which render these reactions so different in substances consisting
of the same chemical elements united in the same proportions of
weight.      But these abstractions, which include the whole science,
cannot be deduced from known facts except by a train of mecha
nical and physical reasoning; the first term of which commences
with their most simple phaenomena, and the last terminates with
their most remote causes. We are therefore compelled in the
present case to introduce the principal links of this logical chain,
for the purpose of proving that the researches of M. Pasteur
have added new elements to our knowledge of these phaenomena.
If the rapid exposition which we are about to give should appear
in the first instance to be a digression from our proper aim, we
plead as an excuse that we have ineffectually endeavoured to dis
cover any other method by which it could be attained, consist

ently with the time which is allowed for the treatment of the
subject, and without sacrificing that precision of argument which
the subject demands.
   The first step towards the solution of a scientific problem is to
state it with perspicuity. We shall apply this principle to the
one of which we are about to treat.     According to the general
conception of chemical phaenomena, and it is necessary to take
a speculative view of them to be able to arrange them in the form
of a science, the substances between which they take place are
considered as so many corpuscular systems of different natures,
the constituent molecules of which are more or less complex.
Some of them do not undergo any alteration under the influence
of any operations to which they have hitherto been submitted.
These belong to that class of substances which are called simple.
Others, on the contrary, and they constitute the most numerous
class, are capable of being separated by chemical processes into
molecular groups of a less complex order, which in their turn
are ultimately resolvable into molecules which belong to the
class of simple substances.     Such molecules as are chemically
separable constitute the substances which are called compound.
   In   allthese systems the constituent corpuscles are individu
ally imperceptible      to
                         the senses       consequence
                                                in           their minute
                                                                      of
ness.    Nevertheless,   with this extreme     minuteness,    they are con
                        to all
sidered  to possess        the  properties      tangible
                                                      of   matter.     Thus
they are assumed                 be
                             extended, possessed        figure, and
                                                               of                     to   be

distinct minute   bodies,    possessing,  like the planets,       attractivean
force proportional        their mass and reciprocally

of  their distances, which manifests itself           their weight when

rapidly, which they would exercise conjointly with the former,
and which we must distinguish from the first-mentioned force                               by
their apparent modes        action, although they might

stances upon which chemical influence is exerted; they are the
mechanical expression of their actual mode of existence, such as
it presents itself to our observation.  But the vital organism
gives rise to a number of compounds, the parts of which chemi
cally similar have an intimate, and, as it were, natural correlation
with each other, which is due to their physiological mode of ge
neration. These substances are called organized. The chemical
corpuscles of which they are composed, being considered inde
pendently of any relative coordination, are called organic bodies,
in allusion to their natural origin, without, however, attributing
to their simple elements any other properties than those which
they evince in the generality of combinations into which they
enter.     Can it be that the delicacy of the processes by which
these invisible corpuscles are united, impresses upon them a
peculiar interior organization ? We are unable to answer this
question. Hitherto the rotatory power of molecules has only
been established in that class of substances elaborated by vital
organisms.
    Without being acquainted with the nature of the particular
forces which emanate from the separate corpuscles of which each
substance is composed, experience has proved that those which
chiefly determine chemical actions exercise influences, the inten
sity of which decreases very rapidly when the distance is increased;

ally approach within these limits occasionally combine                  sepa       or
rate into corpuscular systems differing from                existing before.
These mechanical actions constitute what are called the chemical
combinations and decompositions. Probably only                     imperfect  an
conception would                                                 comparing   by

actions. The first class of phaenomena would depend solely upon
the particular nature and the total mass of the different ingredients
contained in the corpuscles of each substance, as also upon the
special properties which might naturally appertain to each of
these taken as a whole. The latter class of phaenomena would
depend, further, upon the position which each ingredient might
occupy in the corpuscle, upon their relative arrangement, and
upon the configuration of the entire corpuscle.
   These two orders of effects of attractive forces are realized with
the greatest strictness in the motions of the planetary bodies
which compose our planetary system; and they can be easily
observed there.    The general motions of revolution which the
planets execute in their orbits, and the occasional derangements
which they undergo, take place without any appreciable differ
ence, as if their masses were individually concentrated into a
mathematical point coinciding with their centre of gravitation.
This, then, is the first order of phaenomena.       But the relative
situations of the elements of mass which compose the bulk of
each planet have a sensible and determinate influence upon the
oscillations of the fluids which cover them, and upon the various
motions which each executes round                 centre    its

in all others.
     This problem becomes solvible by a very natural analogy,
 when the substances under consideration, being placed in similar
 circumstances, form combinations with other substances, the
 products of which are constant and clearly defined, and do not
 differ in their composition except with regard to the relative
 masses of dissimilar matter which are respectively associated to
 a given weight of the isomeric substances which are compared
 together.        The equivalents of weight, and consequently the
 specific masses of the corpuscles, are then proportioned to these
 relative quantities, which process gives the common factor by
  which their symbolic formulae are to be multiplied in order to
  retain them constantly in this proportion.
      It is thus, for instance, that the four isomeric compounds of
  cyanogen with oxygen, which are called cyanic and cyanuric acids,
  cyamelide, a neutral substance, and fulminic acid, are character
  ized by a distinct factor.         The difference in the nomenclature
  thus   applied   to these four bodies is evidently unassailable when
  it is employed as a symbolic representation of the observed facts.

weight.     Crystallography has pointed out the conditions of iso
morphism; and it is certainly a circumstance no less curious than
 instructive, to observe how a science which is concerned solely
with the study of form, has been able to render assistance to that
which is exclusively occupied with that of molecular phaenomena.
But the separation which has been made between these two
branches of investigation, in order to facilitate their comprehen
sion, is merely an artificial one, and they are really very inti
mately connected.      The word isomorphism, in the sense in which
it is  employed   by chemists,   expresses a triple analogy of proper
ties, which are very frequently, though not invariably, presented
by substances having the same chemical formula, that is to say,
those in which the sole distinctive feature consists in the differ
ent nature of their constituents, simple or complex, expressed by
their literal symbols.    Among those substances having similar
formulae, a large number spontaneously aggregate when the
crystallize separately into geometrical solids, the forms of    wº
are identical with each other, or vary very slightly. They also
crystallize conjointly by their united action when they are dis
solved together in all manner of proportions; and then if the
operation is well conducted, the crystals which are formed pos
sess a continuous structure and a homogeneous             composition
throughout their entire mass, still presenting the same relations
of form with each other and the preceding crystals, except some
trifling inequalities in their angles; as if the corpuscles of differ
ent kinds which constitute the mixtures, when they aggregate in
crystalline groups identical with each other and of heterogeneous
composition, were brought by their mutual reaction to take rela
tive positions, differing very slightly from those which they would
have done when arranging themselves separately.          It is not dif
ficult to conceive in what manner the analogies so closely de
pendent upon the molecular forces can have been of service to the
science of chemistry.      It is these analogies which have afforded
to it the means of    explaining   and reducing to the comprehensive
law of definite combinations by simple multiples an immense
number of natural and artificial products, the complex and irre
gular composition of which appeared to constitute an important
exception to that law.       Moreover, inasmuch as compound bodies
must, according to this principle, be analogically related or op
posite in character according as they may be isomorphous or not
with each other, very strong arguments have hence been deduced
for the purpose of distinguishing, by comparative examination,
those bodies which ought to be arranged in the same order or in
different orders of atomic combinations; which has furnished
theory with a new groundwork and novel conditions of coordina
tion.    Finally, as always happens by the alliance of sciences, the

principle of isomorphism has not only benefited chemistry, but
mineralogy has also received a fresh impulse from this discovery ;
for it then became possible in that science to form a conception
of, and define by precise formulae, the abstract types of many
mineral species which scarcely ever occur naturally in a state of
purity, because they are constantly met with mixed with sub
stances isomorphous with their principal elements, which can
and, indeed, must necessarily, exist with them in propor
tions more or less abundant when the combination took place.
Thus, in an analogous case, geometricians have a perfect idea of
a circle, although neither nature nor art ever presents such a
thing as an absolutely perfect circle.

investigation of the intimate constitution of bodies, wherein
lies its future development,         cannot it    other than gain

   Three general classes of facts have resulted from this mode of
treatment belonging to the three points of view under which the
subject was considered.      We shall class them in his own man
mer, indicating for each the proofs on which it rests, and the con
sequences deducible from them.

natural aspartic acid possesses is communicated to              salts,                    all   its

the case in astronomy. At the time of Ptolemy, the differences
of observation, which did not amount to more than three or four
             º
minutes, were neglected, and the results thus obtained were false.
Tycho directed his attention to the investigation of those phae
nomena which were within these limits of determination, and he
detected clearly-defined inequalities.       Bradley narrowed these
limits to          of a degree, and within these seconds of variation
he found two of the most important phaenomena which have been
discovered by astronomers, the nutation of the earth's axis and
the aberration of light. In the same way, though the chemists of
the present day have become able to recognise, to control, and to
characterize comparatively the results of the actions exercised by
different substances taken in sensible masses, the investigation
of the specific properties attached to the imperceptible corpuscles
of which they are composed is the most urgent requirement of
modern chemistry, and one which offers a prospect of the most
important discoveries.     This course                  is,

   After having so long taken up the attention of the Academy
with the question of isomerism, which was the principal object
of the memoir of M. Pasteur, we must give a more brief sum
mary of the second part, in which he has presented in a few
pages some comparative remarks upon the molecular constitution
of the malic and tartaric acids. It is not because he did not
find very great analogies and very curious phaenomena that the
author has had reason to mention them. Thus he has proved
that the malic acid                  is,
                           like tartaric, very considerably affected                                               by

first seen was at the altitude of 33°, and when last seen at an
altitude of 30°, and in azimuth 22}^ E. of N. at both times.
     WI. From Swansea.         Matthew Moggeridge, Esq., favoured
me with the     following   particulars:—
    “On August 12, at 9h 22” P.M., sky clear, wind W., while
walking in the garden at the Willows, our attention was caught
by a sudden glare, and turning round I saw a meteor approach

by a fiery streak 5 deg.        Motion at first that of a rocket; dura
tion 3 minutes 40       seconds,   of which perhaps one second was
occupied by              its
                    transit across      degrees     15the heavens, from of
the  point   where     appearedit over the trees     the east end       at

slightly varying       position from the contortions which continued,
                               in

   Therefore the altitude of the meteor as seen from Swansea
was about 40°, and                   its
                            azimuth about 45°            N.

rect, but  I think forming too small an angle with the horizon—
probably it was about 30°–certainly not so much as stated by
George Fosbery Lyster, Esq. The centre of the object was as nearly
as possible 34° in altitude, and, as may be seen by the diagram,
nearly N. by W.           I
                       have not heard of any one having seen the
body which produced the illumination; and it appears to me un
accountable that the appearance should continue so long visible,
and its resolution into distinct luminous masses, which has been
described to me by other observers agreeing with my own per
ception; and these had not wholly disappeared until nearly ten
minutes had elapsed.
   “The observation of Mr. Lyster could not, I think, be correct
as to the position of S.S.W., as my attention was directed to it
immediately after the flash of lightning, and it was then, as
above mentioned, N. by W.”

azimuth of the meteor was       certainly  not W. of  N., but a little
E. of N. Its position was marked by me with reference to Polaris

                                   it        faded   away;   before finally
disappearing    it resolved into three portions.
   “The streak       of meteoric light was nearly north, and                             at   an
elevation of about 65° above the horizon.”
   The estimated altitude          is   too great.

               Mechanical Energy.    By Prof. W. Thomson *.
Th;       object of the present communication is to call attention
       to the remarkable consequences which follow from Carnot's
proposition, that there is an absolute waste of mechanical energy
available to man when heat is allowed to pass from one body to
another at a lower temperature, by any means not fulfilling his
criterion of a “perfect thermo-dynamic engine,” established, on
a new foundation, in the dynamical theory of heat.            As it is
most certain that Creative Power alone can either call into exist
ence or annihilate mechanical energy, the “waste” referred to
cannot be annihilation, but must be some transformation of
energyt. To explain the nature of this transformation, it is
convenient, in the first place, to divide stores of mechanical
energy into two classes—statical and dynamical.         A quantity of
weights at a height, ready to descend and do work when wanted,
an electrified body, a quantity of fuel, contain stores of mechani
cal energy of the statical kind.       Masses of matter in motion, a
volume of    space  through    which undulations of light or radiant
heat are   passing,   a  body   having thermal motions among                                               its
particles (that          is,
                    not infinitely cold), contain stores     mechani                         of

                    of           kind.

       energy) created by the friction? is considered, and the following
       conclusion is arrived at:—
            Let S denote the temperatureof the steam (which is
       the same in the boiler and  steam-pipe, and in the cylinder till
       the expansion within it commences);  T the temperature of the
       condenser; u the value of Carnot's function for any tempera
       ture t; and R the value of

t 2.   condenser.    The value of 1–R. has been shown to be not more
       than about 4 for the best steam-engines, and we may infer that
       in them at least three-fourths of the work spent in any kind of
       friction is utterly wasted.
           In connexion with the third proposition, the quantity of work

of thermometers, I shall first describe generally the method pursued
in the graduation of standard instruments.
   The plan of operations hitherto adopted has been that proposed
by M. Regnault, and consists essentially of the following steps:—
1st. Calibration of the tube: 2nd. Graduation of the scale: and
3rd. The determination of the scale coefficients.
     1. Calibration.—A tube having been selected as being tolerably free
  from all visible defects, a short column of mercury, generally less
 than one inch in length, is introduced.             The tube is then attached
 to the frame of Perreaux's dividing-engine, and by means of flexible
 tubing is put in connection at both ends with india-rubber bags, the
 pressure upon which can be regulated by means of screws. The
 mercury is then brought to the part of the tube where the gradua
 tion is proposed to commence. The cutting-frame of the engine
 carries also a small microscope with cross wires in                      focus; on               its
 turning the dividing-screw, the microscope-wire                 brought        coin  is                     to
 cide with the first end        the mercury, and the screw
                                        of                             then turned             is
 forward until the wire reaches the second end; the length
                                                                                                              of of
                                                                                  the
 column       thus given
               is              revolutions
                                    in          the screw.       By means
                                                                of                the
 india-rubber bags, the mercury           made         move along the tube until
                                                       is             to
 the first end coincides again with the microscope-wire;                 the length
of   the column       again measured, and the mercury again moved for
                              is
 ward; the same process being repeated until the column has been
 measured for each length           itself through the whole extent

of the scale.    If there should be any irregularity, a table of correc
tions may   readily   be formed. It will generally be found, however,
that if the  operations   have been performed with care, and the tube
is not very   faulty,  no correction will be necessary. The divisions
are cut with a fine    needle-point upon a coating of engravers' varnish,
and afterwards etched with fluoric acid.       The required dimensions
of the bulb may be found approximately by weighing a measured
length of the mercurial column, and from the known expansion of
mercury and its specific gravity computing the capacity of the bulb.
   3. Determination of the scale coefficient.—The thermometer having
been filled with mercury, we have an instrument the divisions of
whose scale represent equal increments of the volume of the fluid,
but are entirely of an arbitrary value. If now we determine the
points of the scale at which the mercury stands in freezing and boil
ing water, we can immediately convert the arbitrary scale-readings
into degrees of the ordinary scales of temperature. If a be the scale
reading for the freezing-point, and b that for the boiling-point, the
temperature by Fahrenheit's scale corresponding to any reading
n=(;=;) so-32.                      The freezing-point       is determined by placing
the thermometer in finely-pounded ice, from which the water is
drained off as it melts. The boiling-point is ascertained by the form
of apparatus employed by M. Regnault; the temperature observed
is that of steam, whose elasticity is the same as that of the atmo
sphere.   A small siphon water-gauge communicating with the                             in
terior of the vessel gives notice to the observer when the ebullition
is being carried on too rapidly. The steam is generated from                            di
stilled water. The height of the barometer is observed at the time
of the experiment, and the correction to a uniform height of 30
inches (reduced to 32°) is found from Regnault's table.             In deter
mining the fixed points, the stems of the thermometers are kept
vertical ; if the subsequent comparisons with other instruments are
made in the same position, no error will arise from the expansion of
the bulb caused by the pressure of the column of mercury.               how    If,
ever, the thermometers are intended                to

the tubes near the freezing-point, and the reading with reference to
this short arbitrary scale taken from time to time in melting ice.
The period elapsed since the construction of the thermometers has
been too short to afford as yet much information as to the probable
constancy of the freezing-points.       They have, however, already
shown generally a tendency to rise, in some cases to the extent of
nearly 0°3 Fahr., but in most of them it does not yet exceed 0°-1
or 0°2. Another peculiarity in connection with the freezing-point

               dimensions of the agitator are so arranged, that no part of it can
               possibly touch the thermometers when in operation.               The vase,
               containing water, the stand with thermometers, and the agitator,
               is mounted upon a wooden revolving stand. The depth of water in
               the vase is always sufficient to include the whole of the column of
               mercury, the scales being observed through the water.            In taking
               the   observations,  the  observer, after agitating  the water   briskly for
               some time, turns the revolving stand till each thermometer is brought
               successively opposite to his eye, reading off the scales as quickly as
               possible to an assistant, who writes down the numbers.          Proceeding
               in this way, I find that six thermometers can be read off and recorded
               easily in 20 seconds.      It is of course desirable to make more than
               one set of readings for each temperature; and in order to avoid as
               much as possible the changes which may occur during the reading
               off, it is well to reverse the order of observing the instruments, that
               is,    read them alternately in-the order one
                      to                                            six, and six     one.                                               to                              to

   The thermometers “Kew No. 4" and “Kew No. 14,” were
graduated on the stems by myself with arbitrary scales: the bulb of
No. 4 is spherical, and is about # inch diameter; that of No. 14 is
cylindrical,     inch long and     inch diameter, and very sensitive.
“Fastré No. 231      (Regnault)” is a standard by Fastré of Paris, also
graduated on the stem with an arbitrary scale according to Reg
nault's process. This instrument was examined and approved by
M. Regnault; the determination by him of the scale coefficient
agreed closely with that afterwards made at Kew.         The bulb is
cylindrical, about 1% inch long and # inch diameter. “Barrow,
E.I.C., S 7, No. 4,” is one of a number of thermometers made for
the East India Company and sent to Kew for examination. Its scale
is of brass divided to degrees. “Newman (Makerstoun)” is the                                       in
strument which was supplied to the Makerstoun Observatory as a
standard, and to whose indications the results of the temperature
observations made there since 1841 have been “corrected.” It was,
at my suggestion, sent to Kew by Sir Thomas Brisbane for compa
rison with our standards. “Troughton and Simms (Royal Society)"
is a standard belonging to the Royal Society.     As     scale extends            its

   “On the Graduation of the Thermometers supplied from the Kew
Observatory for the use of the Arctic Searching Expedition under                                                   :

   These instruments were twelve in number, seven mercurial and
five spirit thermometers, graduated for low temperatures, The pro
cesses adopted for the two kinds of instruments being different,                                              I
shall describe them separately.
   I. Mercurial Thermometers.—These were divided into degrees of
Fahrenheit's scale in the following manner:—The tube was first
calibrated in the way already described in my former report on the
construction of thermometers (dated March 22); marks being made
on the tube at each extremity of the calibrated space. The bulb was
then made and the mercury introduced by the glass-blower, the di
mensions of the bulb and the quantity of fluid being made as nearly
as possible to correspond with the scale proposed to be made. The
thermometer was then placed in melting ice and the freezing-point
approximately set off with an ink mark; a similar mark being also
made for a temperature of between 95° and 100°. A short arbitrary
scale of four or five divisions was then divided at each of those points.
The thermometer was then again placed in ice and the freezing
point determined accurately with reference to the lower short scale;
and comparisons with two standard thermometers in water deter
mined the value of the upper short scale.       Let OP be the calibrated
portion of the tube, O being the point of commencement, F the
           O                                F                                              H              P

stated above, the graduation of the spirit thermometer was proceeded
with   as   follows.
   The process of calibrating the tubes was the same as for the mer
curial thermometers; as in these, also, the freezing-point and a tem
perature of 90° or 95° were determined with reference to short
scales on the stems; the distances OF, OH (figure, page 312) were
also measured; and by comparing these measurements with the
numbers obtained by calibration, they were expressed in terms of
lengths of the calibrating column.
   The equation (1.) may be put under the form N=A(T+6T) by
making
            0=}.            Let   f and    h be the distances       OF, OH    expressed    in
steps of the calibrating column; FH=h—f.      I.et T. be the number
of degrees above 32° corresponding to H, and let a, be the value, in
terms of a calibrating step, of one degree at the temperature 32°:
we have then, according to the fundamental equation (1.),
                             h—f=&o            (T-H 6T,”) or       *=TijFF        -
     We may in general, without sensible error,assume that the value
of   one degree is uniform throughout the length of a single cali
brating step, or if the column of mercury has been rather too long,
we may subdivide the steps by interpolation.    From the value of ao,
now obtained, we can find with sufficient exactness the temperature
corresponding to the middle of the step f. It will now be convenient
to make use of a table, derived from the values of A and B, showing
the relative lengths of one degree at different temperatures on the
supposition of uniform capacity of the tubes. The following are the
values for every ten degrees, from —70° to +100°Fahr. :--

the length of the step in which a occurs, and K, the equivalent
number of degrees.            A table can then be constructed, showing the
lengths of each successive degree, commencing from the point O, by
the aid of which the graduation may be performed. The scales ex
tend to —75° Fahr.
    The time at my disposal was scarcely sufficient to test the ther
mometers supplied to the Arctic Expedition so completely as I should
have wished.         The mercurial thermometers were after their gradua
tion compared incidentally at two or three different temperatures,
and found to agree generally to 0°l Fahr. They were all placed in
melting ice, when it was found that four of them read exactly 32°,
the other three, viz. Nos. 34, 46, 47, were about 0°l too low.                        In
a few of these thermometers the column of mercury could be
readily broken: when this column was moved to different portions
of the scale, it was found to occupy precisely the same number of
divisions. This was the case with four of the instruments; the other
three not having been tested in this way.
    The five spirit thermometers were compared at four different tem
peratures with a standard mercurial thermometer.                    The comparison
at 0°   being     taken in ice and       salt,  is not  very   trustworthy.     Their
errors were as follows:—

The numbers in the column “Mean of errors” seem to indicate
little error of a systematic nature.             In the case of Nos. 2 and 7, the
index error is      very large;    this, it is believed,   is owing to some of the
vapour of alcohol having become condensed in the upper portion of
the tube before the fixed points were determined, and having escaped
my notice; in fact the greatest attention is required to avoid errors
from this source.         These spirit thermometers cannot by any means
be considered as        standard,     although they are doubtless more trust
worthy than most of those usually made. The limited time at my
command for the completion of the instruments, prevented the pos
sibility of rectifying any blunders into which I might have fallen,
owing to my inexperience in such work, and the intricacy of the
                                 -

  ON THE ABSORPTION OF HEAT BY A BISMUTH AND ANTIMONY JOINT,
           To the Editors       of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
             GENTLEMEN,
        In writing his remarks on the “supposed absorption of heat by a
  bismuthand antimony joint,” which occur in your last Number,
 Mr. Adie appears to have forgotten the experiment of Lenz, in which
 water was frozen at the point of junction, and the Centigrade ther                                           :

               ON THE PEROxIDE OF SILVER.                               BY F. MAHL.A.
        This substance, discovered by Ritter in 1804, is formed in a solu
 tion of nitrate of silver upon the positive wire of a galvanic couple,
 while crystals of metallic silver are deposited upon the negative wire.
 With the exception of the process described by Schönbein, by means
 of the still very mysterious substance called ozone, it cannot be
 obtained in any other way.     Wallquist assigned to it the probable
 formula of AgO"; but some time afterwards Fischer pointed out,
 that even when perfectly washed, this body gave off red nitrous
vapours when heated, and consequently that this formula could not
be correct.    He moreover came to the conclusion that it contained
both nitric acid and water, 4AgO2+AgO NO3 +2HO.           Mahla has
recently examined this body in Wöhler's laboratory.      He obtained
it in the form of octohedral crystals, brilliant, but with curved
planes, which were frequently grouped together in the direction of a
principal axis in a prismatic form, and sometimes in narrow prisms
an inch long, which appeared at first to belong to a quite different
system.    He never obtained it in tetrahedrons, which form it has
been stated by Grotthuss to assume. The crystals are of a grayish
black colour, have a strong metallic lustre, and are very brittle.
Specific gravity 5.474.   Heated to 240°F. they evolve pure oxygen
suddenly and with a kind of deflagration, at the same time falling to
powder.    Further heated, red vapours of nitrous acid are given off,
and white metallic silver remains.    Sulphuric and nitric acids con
vert it into ordinary silver salts of these acids with evolution of
oxygen.    It is dissolved by ammonia with violent evolution of
nitrogen.   It appeared possible that this body might consist of true
                                                                       to its
peroxide of silver, which, in consequence of      rapid formation, had
mechanically enclosed some nitrate      silver,  which the red vapours
                                                         of
observed      on
             heating   were owing.
                               it     However, Fischer and      Gmelin                         L.
have shown that, even                by
                            the most careful washing, all the nitrate
cannot be removed.       Mahla has also found this        be the case;                to
likewise that during the washing there           feeble disengagement
                                                                  is   a
    oxygen; and      considers that the crystals are

       L.  On the Early History of Infinitesimals in England.
                      By Professor De MoRGAN*.
     EFORE       stating the subject of this paper,        I make the fol
        lowing addition to what appeared in June last, in proof
of Newton having written the account of the Commerc. Epist. in
 Phil. Trans. No. 342. I there considered Pemberton as a wit
ness, because, for reasons given,        I could not imagine how Dr.
Wilson could have neglected to notice his dissent, if indeed he
had dissented: I considered that Pemberton had allowed Wilson,
in 1761, to affirm Newton's authorship. I have since found
that Pemberton also, and perhaps more distinctly, allowed Robins,
in 1735, to make the same affirmation. In the Present State of
 the Republic of Letters for 1735 and 1736, and the IWorks of the
Learned for 1737, will be found more than twenty articles of the
Analystt controversy, between Robins, at first anonymous,
   * Communicated by the Author.
   f The most complete list I can give of the pieces of this controversy
may be made thus.      To the twenty-six articles headed Analyst Controversy
in the catalogue of the Astronomical Society’s library (1850) add the fol
lowing. I. Walton, Vindication of Sir I. N's Fluxions, Dublin and London,
1735, 8vo.—I. Walton, The Catechism of the Author of the Minute Phi
losopher fully answered, Dublin and London, 1735, 8vo.—A second edition
of the same, with an appendix in answer to the Reasons for not replying
to Mr. Walton's full answer, Dublin, 1735, 8vo.—Robins, Remarks on
Euler, Smith, and Jurin, Lond. 1739, 8vo.—Jurin, Reply to the last, Lond.
1739, 8vo.—Robins, Full confutation of the last, London, 1740, 8vo.—
Jurin, Letter to         Esq. in answer to the last, London, 1741, 8vo.
From Walton's second edition it appears that there was a third tract by
Berkeley, entitled Reasons for not replying to Mr. Walton's full answer.
This I had never seen nor otherwise heard of: but I find that it has been
    Phil. May. S.   4.  Vol. 4. No. 26. Nov. 1852.                   Y

322                  Prof. De Morgan           on the   Early History
Dr. Jurin under the name of Philalethes Cantabrigiensis, and,
finally, Pemberton himself.       Now though Robins again and
again affirms Newton's authorship, and though Pemberton ap
pears in the controversy expressly to state his own personal
knowledge of Newton's meaning and motives on certain points,
and to support Robins in the view he had taken of them, yet
Pemberton does not in any way contradict what Robins had
advanced as to the authorship in question.       Dr. Jurin, though
not knowing on what foundation the paper in question is ascribed
to Newton, affirms that, whether written by Newton or not, it
was no doubt agreeable to his sentiments “as having been some
years afterwards republish’d in Latin with his consent and ap
probation.”     (Rep. of Lett. July 1736, p. 51.)    This addition
is here made more for completeness+ than for any need which
there is of it: so far as I can judge, the conclusion of my last
paper will remain undisputed.
   My present subject is the early history of the principle of the
differential calculus in England:                 I
                                       mean the principle of infi
nitely small quantities, as distinguished from that of prime and
ultimate ratios or of limits.    By the time the excitement of the
great controversy had subsided, the continental mathematicians
were well accustomed to the symbols of Leibnitz in connexion
with the infinitesimal principle; the English to the symbols of
Newton in connexion with both principles.        But as to how the
matter stood in England previous to the controversy, there has
not been much inquiry.       I here propose to collect notices of
some points which the historian of fluxions will find to require
his attention.
   Up to the year 1704, and so far as algebraical calculus was
concerned, Newton himself used infinitely small quantities; and
nothing else in any document yet published. The prime and
ultimate ratios, or limits, appear in the Principia, but are aban
doned in those places in which fluxions are alluded                    to.   I     proceed
to establish these assertions   detail.   in
       Newton’s earliest papers published
      In                                                     by
                                             Rigaud (Hist. Essay
 on Princ.  App. pp.  20–24) the relocities are only differential

with Leibnitz, the relation of the infinitely small increments is
itself the object of determination. That the difference between
the two did rest mainly upon a difference in the idea generationis
quantitatum   is perfectly true: the fault to be found with the
alteration of the scholium is that the reader is left to infer that
the difference of the ideas of generation of quantity was as visible
to Newton as the difference of symbols, from the moment
when he received Leibnitz's communication.       This might easily
have   escaped  notice in   making  the alteration.   The fluxional
idea was not, so far as I can find, in the mind of Cavalieri, Fer
mat, or Leibnitz: I shall have occasion elsewhere to notice                                                               its

326                   Prof. De Morgan on the Early History
ton has had the goodness to communicate in manuscript.                This
 assertion corroborates itself, for Craig does use the binomial
theorem, which at the time he was writing had not been in print:
 Wallis's Algebra was not published till the very end of 1684.
 His account of the second difficulty is as follows:—
    “The second difficulty is when the value of the ordinate has
 irrational terms [asymmetris]; for analysts well know that it is
very laborious to free an equation from irrationality of more
than four terms.       But a most excellent remedy has been applied
by the celebrated geometer G. G. Leibnitz in his new method of
finding tangents published in the Acta Eruditorum of last year:
in which an easy method is shown of finding tangents without
removing the irrational terms, be they ever so much involved in
the equation.”      Craig then proceeds to use the differential cal
culus under the     symbols   of Leibnitz, but with some elementary
mistakes. We see here the singular indifference which Newton
at that time, and long afterwards, showed towards his own cal
culus.     It appears that when he communicated to Craig, for
help in the quadrature of curves, his binomial theorem, at the
very period when Leibnitz had just announced the differential
calculus, he never gave a hint that he himself had had long pos
session of a similar method, and had exchanged communications
with Leibnitz on the subject eight years before.

calculus, and Leibnitz, Sluse, Barrow, Gregory, &c. are frequently
mentioned. This, under                all
                                   the circumstances, we may suspect
was Newton’s own doing.          And am strongly inclined
                                                 I                   think                to
that  it   was this  very  tract      Craig's
                                            of which  immediately     sug
gested       Newton the progress which the views
            to                                             Leibnitz were   of
making, and induced him               to
                                   forward     Wallis the extracts from

    My copy of Craig's     second tract has written on the title-page
 “Is.  Walton Domum Authoris. Jun : 7. 1693.”               The form of
 this inscription, especially   the date,  shows that it was made by
 the receiver, and not by the giver. Supposing this receiver to
 be I. Walton, who afterwards took part in the Analyst contro
 versy, the book was in Ireland on the 7th of June, and had most
 probably been published many weeks before.              The imprimatur
 of Wallis's second volume is dated August 28, and the preface
 July 12. The volume has 880 pages; the printing began, as
 the preface informs us, in 1692, and Newton's contribution (a
 most evident interpolation) is at page 390.             If Craig's tract
 were seen   by  Newton,   as would seem most      likely,  at the end of
 1692, an immediate communication to Wallis would have arrived
 in sufficient time to appear where it actually does. Further,
 Craig is mentioned in Newton's contribution as having written
 to Newton for a series which was to be communicated to David
 Gregory.     Now Craig, in the preface of 1718, gives an account
 of this  correspondence,     as some months posterior to the exami
 nation of his   manuscript     by Newton; consequently, Newton's
 contribution to Wallis is posterior to his having seen Craig's
manuscript.      I conclude, then, that Newton, seeing the progress
the differential calculus was likely to make in England, procured
the entire suppression of his own name in Craig's tract, and
made up his mind to insert a part of his own treatise in the
forthcoming work of Wallis.         This will explain why Craig did
not then mention either Newton’s examination of the manuscript,
or his supply of examples: the tone in which he attacks Tschirn
hauss is so acrimonious, that we may be sure Newton would have
desired not to appear, even indirectly.        It is true that Newton
 (Edleston, p. 176) speaks of the contribution as sent in 1692, at
Wallis's request.     That it must have been the very end of 1692,
which is quite consistent with my suppositions, appears from
this, that the contribution itself, or a parenthesis of Wallis, refers
to previous letters of August and September, from Newton to
Wallis, apparently on series.
    Craig continued to write in the Philosophical Transactions,
and he uses the differential calculus in 1701 in No. 268, in 1703
in No. 284, in 1704 in No. 289, and in 1708 in No. 314. In the

second of these papers, he treats the differential calculus as uni
versally established: ut omnibus notum,      zy-f    : ydz=    : zdy. He
also wrote one or more papers in the Leipsic acts.             His third
separate publication followed the great controversy: it is De
calculo fluentium libri duo. Quibus subjunguntur libri duo de optica
analytica. London, 1718, 4to (pp. viii-H 92).              We have now
nothing but fluxions; not a word of the differential calculus:

appear.
   De Moivre took his idea of fluxions direct from the Principia,
and (Phil. Trans. 1695, No. 216) uses the infinitely small mo
ments.      His fluxion of an area, for instance, is an infinitely
small   rectangle.     Halley, in his paper on logarithms in the same
number, uses infinitely small ratiunculae and differentiolae in a
manner which must have astounded every beginner who ever
saw the reprint in Sherwin's Logarithms.

I  have spoken in the Companion to the Almanac for 1852 (p. 15).
Both used infinitely small quantities.              Hayes adopts infinitesi

of air at a standard temperature and pressure which has passed
through the apparatus.    If the aspirator be applied to the deter
mination of the amount of aqueous vapour, or other absorbable
constituent in the atmosphere, it will be necessary to find also
the mean temperature and pressure of the air during the course
of the experiment. With these data, a simple calculation will
give the exact weight or volume of the aqueous vapour in the air.
   It is unnecessary to point out the many applications which an
aspirator affording an absolutely uniform current of air may
receive.   In the chemical laboratory it will frequently be found
a very convenient instrument of research, and may even be ap
plied in some cases to quantitative experiments.    But it is
chiefly in atmospheric inquiries that this aspirator will find                                                its

iron has been really deposited in the metallic state, and that the
singular mineral submitted to his examination presents the first
well-established instance of the occurrence of terrestrial native
IrOn.
   Among the points on which M. Bahr bases his opinion, may
be cited the following:—
   The specimen of fossil wood in question was detached on the
28th of August 1798 from the thick end of the trunk of a tree
that was met with on the floating island in the lake of Ralang
in Smaland. This island, after being submerged for four years,
had risen to the surface the evening before.   At the end of the
trunk there were two plates of copper, bearing an inscription
commemorative of the date when Gustavus          visited this sin       III.

by the Greek letters in situ shall always preserve the same sign.
Hence we derive two geometrical formulae concerning the pro
ducts of polyhedrons, viz.
  (1.)       ABCD x EFGH =ABCEx FGHD–ABCF x GHED
                        + ABCG x HEFD–ABCH x FGED.
   (2)       ABCD x EFGH =ABEF x GHCD + ABGH x EFCD
                         + ABEG x HFCD + ABHF x EGCD
                         + ABEH x FGCD + ABFG x EHCD.
    These formulae give rise to an exceedingly interesting observa
tion.    In order that they shall be numerically true, we must
have a rule for fixing the sign to be given to the solid content
represented by any reading off of the four points of a tetrahe
dron, i. e. we must have a rule for determining the sign of solid
contents of figures situated anywhere in space analogous to that
which, as applied to linear distances reckoned on a given right
line, is the true foundation of the language of trigonometry,
and the condition precedent for the possibility of any system of
analytical geometry such as exists, and which, not altogether
without surprise, I have observed in the pages of this Magazine
one of the learned contributors has thought it necessary to win
dicate the propriety of importing into his theory of quaternions.
    Various rules may be given for fixing the sign of a tetrahedron
 denoted by a given order of four letters.        One is the following:
the content of ABCD is to be taken positive or negative, accord
 ing as to a spectator at A the rotation of BCD is positive or
negative.     Another, again, is to consider AB and CD as repre
              i.
 senting, say two electrical currents, and to suppose a spectator
 so placed
 axis of his  body
                  the current AB shall pass through the longitudinal
                     from the head towards the feet, and looking
 towards the other current CD; the sign of the solid content of
 the tetrahedron (and, indeed, also the effect, in a general sense,
 of the action of the two currents upon one another) will depend
 upon the circumstance of this latter current appearing to flow
 from the right to the left, or contrariwise in respect of the spec
 tator.    Last and simplest mode of all, the sign of the solid con
 tent of ABCD will depend upon the nature (in respect to                         its
 being   a right-handed          or

   These brief descriptions will enable us now to consider the
nature of the materials best fitted for forming the different parts
of the furnace; and although modifications and improvements
have been proposed in the construction of some of these furnaces,
which will be referred to afterwards, they do not affect the pre
sent inquiry.
   The hearth or chamber of the furnace may be looked upon as
a large crucible, in which the ore or other matters undergoing
the process of manufacture are melted; it will therefore be
obvious that the matters forming this crucible must be capable
of withstanding a higher heat before melting than the sub
stances put into      Lime, silica, alumina, &c. alone, will stand
                             it.
any degree      heat before fusing; but
                   of                       mixture     these             a                   of                at   a
high heat would combine and form fusible substance; hence            a
the relation    the materials forming the lining
                    of                                the furnace                           of
with the matters              to     be heated             in   it   has also          to   be considered.
Thus, were          we
                     lineto  furnace with pure silica, which
                                        a                          fur                                     no
nace heat would    touch,   and heat       that furnace lime, oxide
                                                                in                                                   of
iron, oxide     copper, &c., the silica and these oxides would soon
                   of
fuse and form glass;         that great care required
                                        so                 prevent this  is                  to
combination         of
                  the bricks with the substances    undergoing  fusion.
Thus some kinds                    of
                          brick will answer for one sort       furnace                              of
and not for another; one kind may stand well            the fire-place,                 in
and not      suited for the hearth, and vice versd.
             be                                           Some kinds
will stand     the melted matter that will not stand on the roof
               in
exposed     the fumes; bricks with much alumina
             to                                              them will                        in
not stand exposed              melted copper.

   The first  analysis   given   is of a   large     piece  of brick  ground   up,
and which may      i.  taken as a sample of the mass; but the quan
tity of lime and clay is not sufficient to bind the whole silica,
were they intimately mixed; but the silica being in pieces about
the size of an ordinary pea, the alumina and lime causing their
adhesion is in proper proportion to form clay, and is very plastic.
If  only a small portion of such bricks be taken for analysis,
nearly pure silica may be obtained, as shown in the third column
of the above table. The matters composing these bricks are
obtained from a quarry in the neighbourhood of Neath. These
matters are crushed under a stone, the materials are then wetted
and the mould for the brick filled.              As the plastic ingredients in
these bricks are     mechanically      mixed,     not in chemical union with
the quartz, we believe that ground or crushed quartz mixed with a
small portion of alumina and lime, as shown in the above analysis,
or good fire-clay, would serve the same purpose.                  Indeed in Chili
such has been tried with success, and it might be much more
extensively adopted.        These bricks expand by heat more than
other   fire-bricks;   but they do not contract to the same extent,
which is a valuable property in reference to maintaining a solid
 and close lining.
    Some Dinnas brick from the roof of a refining furnace much
 exposed to the escape of oxide of copper, and also to metallic
 copper being spurted upon them during poling, and which was
 consequently corroded and left spongy, gave by analysis—

the bricks, which is generally composed of sulphur, arsenic, an
timony, iron and copper; but in the fusing-furnace the bricks
are often consumed and worn quite thin.       The destruction of
the bricks is greatest when fluxes are used; and if these contain'
chlorides, soda or potash, the corrosion of the building extends
a good way along the stack or culvert. Where copper is exposed
in the furnace, the oxides burning       often combine with the       off

     Itthus appears, that by means of observations of the excess
of the mean temperature of rivers above those of the atmosphere
and of the soil, we may test the soundness of the supposition
that that excess is wholly or partly produced by friction; and if
that supposition be found to agree with the facts, we may calcu
late, from observations on different streams under different cir
cumstances, the numerical values of the constants C and C'.
   In order that the observations may be capable of yielding
satisfactory results, they should be made upon a variety of streams
of different forms of section, inclinations and velocities; and the
part of each stream at which the temperatures are observed
should have a form of section, an inclination, and a velocity, as
nearly as possible uniform.
   The following quantities should be observed:—

     OME time     since we were led to undertake a series of expe
         riments on the properties and composition of the chloride
of   arsenic, with the view partly of testing the accuracy of the
researches that have been made for determining the equivalent
of arsenic, and partly of ascertaining the availability of this sub
stance for the separation of arsenic from other metals, as well as
from organic matters in toxicological inquiries. The publication
of some of our results has been anticipated by Dr. Fyfe's excel
lent paper “On the Detection of Arsenic,” published in the Phi
losophical Magazine for December 1851. There are, however,
several points connected with the chemical history of this inter
esting compound which have not yet been noticed, and we
therefore trust that a brief statement of our investigations may
not be altogether unacceptable to the Philosophical Society of
Glasgow.

of chloride of arsenic, with the results of       analysis     Dr.        its                   by        J.

this test, as thus applied, for the detection of bichromate of pot
ash has been fully shown in the fourth volume of the Quarterly
Journal of the Chemical Society of London. Taking the mean
of two well-executed experiments, it results that 100 parts of
chloride of arsenic correspond to 54.5 parts of bichromate of
potash. In order to deduce from this ratio the proportion of
arsonic existing in the chloride, similar cyperiments were made
with pure arsenious acid, which gave very nearly the proportion
of 100 of arsenious acid to 100 of bichromate of potash.      From
these numbers it is evident that chloride of arsenic contains
41:25 per cent. of metallic arsenic.
   The amount of chlorine was estimated in the usual manner as
chloride of silver.
   The following table shows the composition of the chloride:—
                                                                      Theory.        Experiment.

    It may be as well to mention, that the chloride prepared as
above had the specific gravity of 2:1766.    It was strongly acid
to litmus paper, completely  soluble in alcohol and in aether; and
it was also observed to have the power of dissolving a very con
siderable proportion of arsenious acid.
   The action of water on the anhydrous chloride is particularly
remarkable.    It is stated by several writers, that the addition of
the proper quantity of water converts the anhydrous chloride
into a hydrate, having the formula AsCl”, 3HO.        Our attempts
to obtain this hydrated compound proved unsuccessful.   A known
quantity of the anhydrous chloride was mixed with a sufficient
proportion of water to convert it into the hydrate referred                                           to,
and the two liquids well agitated.    The mixture became per

added, the mixture being allowed       cool after each addition. to

 of water amounted         aboutto     equivalents     18

of the two fluids, containing respectively 18 and 36 equivalents
of water, an account of which we reserve for a future commu
 nication.
     With respect to the heat evolved on mixing anhydrous chlo
ride and water, we may state that in a particular experiment, in
which 117 grains of the former were briskly agitated with a
quantity of the latter corresponding to 18 equivalents, the tem
perature rose from 60° to 113°F.     Then on allowing this mix
ture to cool, and pouring  in 18 additional equivalents of water,
the temperature increased from 60° to 94°.
   From our experiments on this part of the subject, it appears
to us very questionable whether such a hydrate as AsCl*, 3HO
has been obtained.
   Several experiments were made for the purpose of ascertaining
the precise conditions necessary for the production and volatili
zation of the chloride from a heated mixture of arsenious and
hydrochloric acids.       The most important result was, that chlo
ride of arsenic   may   be detected in the distillate as soon as hy
drochloric acid itself distils; and further, that this result obtains
cven with very minute quantities of arsenious acid. With strong
hydrochloric acid (containing upwards of 20 per cent. of real
acid), anhydrous chloride collects at the bottom of the receiver
distinct from the other products.         But with acid below 20 per
cent., the chloride is found in the distillate in the state of solution.
    It may appear singular that chloride of arsenic should so
readily distil over with a liquid which boils at 230°F., when
is its
     own boiling-point       274°. This apparent anomaly, however,
                             is
   explained      by
                  the fact, that the chloride distils freely         tem        at a
perature very much below               its
                                    point          of
                                              ebullition.
     In evidence   ofthe extreme facility with which arsenious acid
yields the chloride when heated with hydrochloric acid,               may            we

metallic arsenic in Reinsch's process appears to depend almost
entirely on the ready production of chloride of arsenic, which is
instantly decomposed on contact with copper.
     As the formation and escape of chloride of arsenic appear
therefore to occur with certainty when arsenious and hydrochloric
acids are heated together, it became interesting to inquire whether
similar results would obtain in presence of organic matters.
   Half a grain of arsenious acid was mixed with an ounce of
porridge, and an ounce of hydrochloric acid being added, the
mixture was distilled.   The moment the mixture began to boil,
a slip of copper ribbon previously placed in the neck of the flask
was coated with metallic arsenic.     Nearly an eighth part of the
mixture was distilled  over, one-half of which gave with sulphu
retted hydrogen   the well-known effect of a solution of arsenic.
   Again, two-tenths of a grain of AsO" were mixed with an
ounce of porridge and three-fourths of an ounce of HCl, and the
mixture distilled as before.     Three drachms of the distillate,
when tested by Marsh’s process, afforded brilliant stains of
metallic arsenic.   The distillate gave also a yellow precipitate
with sulphuretted hydrogen.
   Similar experiments were performed with cow's liver and with
common broth.         The results were equally satisfactory.
   The   foregoing    experiments     plainly indicate the availability of
the chloride of arsenic in          medico-legal    investigations for the
separation of the metal from animal and vegetable matters; and
we are induced to think that            its

                      AH : BH :: CE : CI).
   But as HBA is less than HAB, AH is less than BH, and
therefore CE is less than CD, and therefore CED is greater than
CDE; that is to say, CAB less K is greater than CBA plus K,
and therefore DAB less K is greater than EBA, i. e. ADE is
greater than ABE, and therefore the perpendicular from A upon
DE   is greater than that from E on AB, which is easily proved
to be absurd.     Hence, as before, the triangle is proved to be
isosceles.   This proof, it is obvious, remains good for        cases                                all        in

decomposing substances.
     If
     two similar bodies unequally heated be placed together, one
expands and the other contracts until an equal volume is attained
by each.
     If
     two bodies of equal volume be placed together, and then
pressure be applied to one, the other becomes heated or expanded
in proportion to the pressure or diminution of volume of the
former.
     If
      any substance expand, it deprives some other of heat or
volume, as in the solution of salts, &c.
   In the foregoing molecular changes of matter, it is evident,
that, to whatever cause they may be attributed, there are equal
movements            simultaneously               occurring in opposite directions                        (No.   1).

 of particles must be a lessening (for if it were an expansion, the
bodies would not come to an insensible distance at all, or at
least could not be brought nearer than the very bounds), the
heat of chemical action is the necessary simultaneous, equal, and
opposite molecular movement or expansion.                It follows, also,
that  every  atom,  or, not to speak  hypothetically,    every combining
particle of one element must necessarily unite with a particle of
 the other in the combination of the two bodies; for as the distance
between the particles of the opposite kind is smaller than that
between the particles of the same kind, the relation of the space
to the nature of the matter could only be fulfilled by that
arrangement.
      If
       two simple bodies therefore combine, the distance between
the elements of each compound particle being less than that
between the particles of either body in the uncombined state,
heat or expansion in some other substance must be produced;
just as when the particles of iron, for example, contract or come
together from pressure or any other cause, expansion in another
 substance is the result.     I proved in the October Number of
the Philosophical Magazine, 1851, that the opposite effect, or
cold, is the consequence of the expansion among the particles in
the decomposition of a compound.
    The value of external circumstances in chemical combination
may be estimated by the fact, that although at first the com
pound particles may absorb the expansion or heat produced by
combination, yet other bodies in the end take it up; and this
equal and opposite movement must be modified by them.
     If
      it be true, then, that the distance between the particles of
a body depends on the matter composing it (No. 2), and that
chemical combination depends on a lessening of this distance, or
rather consists therein, it follows that affinity results from the
circumstance that when two bodies are mixed together the nature
of the mixed matter requires a smaller distance between the par
ticles than that of either body separately; and elective affinity
is, that when three bodies are brought together                 at
                                                                insensible
distances, those two which require least distance between the
particles always must unite. And             the opposite movement
                                            as                         or
expansion always accompanies the       combination,    the heat produced
                                                                 by

isa  measure   of the affinity;     or heat       be

simple with  a  compound body,   it if shows that the      former  decom
posed and united with      an element    of the latter.    Notwithstand
ing that the decomposition      of the latter produced cold, yet the
combination that takes place      at the same time produces more
heat than counteracts      that  cold,  because      that were not the
                                                       if

   To account, then, for chemical action, and the heat produced

   1st. That the distance between the particles                 bodies has                           of
some   dependence       the matter on composing    them.
   2nd. That any change           this distance      inone     necessarily           in              is
accompanied              by

will have no effect    otherwise.

                                                              Parsonstown,    August 1852.
    The reasons spoken of in the preceding paper having led me
 to the opinion that the heat of chemical combination is not
 the result either of opposite electricities uniting, or the disen
 gagement of any subtle fluid, or any affection of matter which is
 not met with in simple bodies, but the compensating, or accom
 panying and opposite movement among particles, whereby the
 loss of volume or distance between the particles uniting is ba
                                                          I
 lanced; and judging from the theory advanced, that in a mix
 ture of bodies those particles which could come the closest toge
 ther would unite to the exclusion of others, or in other words,
 would have the greatest affinity,+I concluded that as the heat
 or expansion is equal, although opposite to the contraction of
 the combining bodies, it would be a measure of the affinity ex
 erted between different substances.      I accordingly endeavoured
 to ascertain the amount of heat liberated by the combination of
 several substances with oxygen, in order to find whether those
 which produced most heat were likewise the strongest bases.
 The method I adopted is partly founded on the inference I drew
 in the paper published in the October Number of the Philoso
 phical Magazine, 1851, from the fact I there proved, “that
the decomposition of a compound body gives rise to as much
cold as the combination of its elements produces heat.”            said                      I
 (12) that “it    might  be made the means of        determining    the
amount of heat produced by the combination of bodies, as the
loss occasioned by their decomposition shows the gain by their
combination.”
    Knowing, then, the amount of heat produced by the combi
                                                 I
nation of hydrogen with oxygen, knew that if water were de
composed a like amount would be absorbed; and therefore if
any body were placed in contact with water, and could decom
pose it by joining with           its
                               oxygen, the amount        heat     such   of             of

                                        adding the heat absorbed                                  by

            Combination  of several Metals with Orygen.           377
The amount     of Heat produced by the Ovidizement of an equiralent
                             of Sodium.
    3 grains of sodium by dissolving in water raise the tempera
ture of 60 grains 15.4°F., decomposition of water to supply 1
grain of oxygen absorbs 130°; therefore the 3 grains of sodium
(or 1 equivalent) raise the temperature of 60 of water 154+130
 =281°F. by combining with oxygen.
                              Potassium.
    5 grains of potassium raise the temperature of 60 grains of
water by dissolving in it 126°5 F.; add 130° for the heat
absorbed by the decomposition of the water, and 256°-5 F. is the
amount of heat liberated by the combustion of 1 equivalent of
potassium.
                                 Zinc.
    The solution of 4 grains of zinc in sulphuric acid (dilute) pro
duces heat sufficient to raise 60 grains of water 72°F.           The
combination of the oxide formed and the sulphuric acid developes
in the same quantity of water 42°2 F; this must therefore be
 subtracted from the 72°, as it is not due to the oxidizement of
the zinc, and there then remains 29-8; but to this quantity
must be added 130° absorbed by the decomposition of the water,
and 159°8 F. is the amount of heat that the combustion of zinc
 would produce in 60 grains of water.
                                Copper.
    Copper will not decompose water; nitric acid was therefore
 substituted for the dilute sulphuric acid.        396 grains, or 1
 equivalent of copper, by dissolving in nitric acid raise the tem
 perature of 60° grains of water 77°22 F.; but in this is included
 the amount of heat produced by the combination of the oxide of
 copper with the nitric acid, which is 35° F.      Subtract this sum,
 therefore, and 42°22 remain; but as the decomposition of suf
 ficient nitric acid to give one grain of oxygen would absorb as
 much heat as would lower the temperature of 60 grs. of water
 30°4 F., this must be added to the 42°2 F., and we obtain
 72°6 F. as the amount of heat produced in 60 grains of water
 by the combustion of copper.
    The manner in which I found that the decomposition of nitric
 acid absorbs the above amount of heat was by dissolving 4 grains
 of zinc in 180 grains of the acid; it liberated heat sufficient to
 raise 60 grains of water 171°7 F.       As this included the heat of
 combination of the oxide of zinc and nitric acid, 42°2 must be
 subtracted, and there remains 129°8 F.; but in the former ex
 periment with the dilute sulphuric acid, it was shown that 4

378           Dr. Woods on the Amount of Heat produced by the
grains of zinc being oxidized would raise the temperature of 60
grains of water 159°8; therefore the difference between 159°8
and 1297-8, equal to 30°4        absorbed                F.,

380            On the Temperature of a Bismuth and Antimony Joint.
  The length to which this paper has run prevents me remark
ing on the foregoing table as fully as I would wish. It will be,
however, seen that those metals which are capable of displacing
others from neutral solutions produce more heat by their combi
nation with oxygen; or, according to the vicw I take of chemical
 combination, require less distance between their particles and
 those of oxygen than do the other metals.                Thus when a salt of
 silver in solution is     poured    on  copper,   oxygen,    silver and copper
 are brought together at an insensible distance, mechanically for
 the first instant forming one body, their particles lying together,
 perfectly passive with respect to each other; but as we deduce
 from experiment that oxygen and copper                  more closely together lie
 than  oxygen     and   silver,  the  particles      the oxygen and copper
                                                                      of

in   conjunction with         colder one, the particles being separated
                                    to

     GENTLEMEN,
                      1st October, Dr. Tyndall has cited the ex
IN    your Journal
     periments    M. Lenz  of proof
                                    of
                                       the power    infeeble gal     of                     of
                                                                                             a

                          to                 bismuth and anti                of   a

mony joint below that of the surrounding atmosphere.           In the
notices of Lenz’s experiments, I can find no allowance made for
the reduction of temperature by evaporation.       Now in repeating
some of  them,  I have found a   hygrometric   effect to the extent of
1 and 1:5 of Centigrade; and                          I
                                   conceive that the omission of the
correction required for evaporation in a drier atmosphere may
be taken for a reduction of temperature by electricity.        But in
my experiments I have never met a fact which in the least
encourages the view that electricity reduces temperatures; and
as it is exceedingly    hostile to        that                  all
                                                     hitherto known               is

     Having submitted your letter with                                its   enclosures               to   the     Presi

 382                         Royal Society.
dent and Council of the Royal Society,       I am directed to convey to
 you the following reply.
   With reference to the subject of well-directed and systematically
conducted meteorological observations generally, and to the encou
ragement and support to be given to them by the governments of
different countries, the President and Council are of opinion that
they are highly deserving of much consideration, not only for their
scientific value, but also on account of the important bearing which
correct climatological knowledge has on the welfare and material
interests of the people of every country.
   With reference to the proposal for the establishment of a uni
form plan in respect to instruments and modes of observation, the
President and Council are not of opinion that any practical advan
tage is likely to be obtained by pressing such a proposition in the
present state of meteorological science.        Most of the principal
governments of the European Continent, as Russia, Prussia, Austria,
Bavaria and Belgium, have already organized establishments for
climatological researches in their respective states, and have placed
them under the superintendence of men eminently qualified by theo
retical and practical knowledge, and whose previous publications had
obtained for them a general European reputation.          Such men are
Kupffer, Dove, Kreil, Lamont and Quételet; under whose direction
the meteorological observations in the above-named countries are
proceeding; the instruments have been constructed under their care,
and the instructions drawn up and published by them under the
sanction of their respective governments.      The observations as they
are made are sent to them, are reduced and coordinated under their
superintendence, and are published at the expense of the govern
ments.     Every year is now producing publications of this nature in
the countries referred to, and by the rapid intercommunication          of
these, the results of the experience of one country and the modifications
and improvements which experience may suggest, become quickly
known to all. To call on countries already so advanced in systemati
cally conducted meteorological observations to remodel their           in
structions and instruments, with a view of establishing uniformity
in these respects, would probably, if pressed, elicit from other
governments also the reply which Her Majesty's Government have
received from Prince Schwarzenberg, conveyed in the Earl of West
moreland's letter to Viscount Palmerston, viz. the transmission of a
copy of the instructions which have been given to the Meteorological
Observatories, forty-five in number, in the Austrian dominions, and
a reference to the results obtained at those observatories, which are
stated to be in regular course of publication.
   In an earlier stage, when these establishments were either form
ing or were only in contemplation, it was considered that advantage
might arise from a discussion of the objects to be principally kept
in view, and of the instruments and methods by which these might
be most successfully prosecuted.        For this purpose, a conference
was held at Cambridge, in England, in 1845, which was attended
by many of the most distinguished Meteorologists in Europe, and

                                               Royal Society.                                                            383

                                              their respective governments. The
impulse communicated                this  by
                                          assemblage      was without doubt highly
beneficial, and the influence              the discussions which took place may
perhaps        be
                traced             in

researches          different countries are now proceeding; but
                   in                                                                 the                          in
stage   to  which they have advanced,                 may      doubted whether any
                                                                   it              be
measures are likely                  to   be
                                     more beneficial than those which would
increase the facilities                cheap and rapid intercommunication
                                        of   a                                                                            of

charts of the winds and currents, and the sailing directions which
are formed upon them, corrected up to the latest period.
    Short as is the time that this system has been in operation,
the results to which it has led have proved of very great importance
to the interests of navigation and commerce. The routes to many
of the most frequented ports in different parts of the globe have
been materially shortened, that to St. Francisco in California by
nearly one third : a system of southwardly monsoons in the equato
rial regions of the Atlantic and on the west coast of America has
been discovered; a vibratory motion of the trade-wind zones, and
with their belts of calms and their limits for every month of the
year, has been determined : the course, bifurcations, limits and other
phenomena of the Great Gulf-stream have been more accurately
defined, and the existence of almost equally remarkable systems of
currents in the Indian Ocean, on the coast of China, and on the
North-western coast of America and elsewhere has been ascertained :
there are, in fact, very few departments of the science of meteorology
and hydrography which have not received very valuable additions;
whilst the more accurate determination of the parts of the Pacific
Ocean, where the sperm-whale is found (which are very limited in
extent), as well as the limits of the range of those of other species,
has contributed very materially to the success of the American
whale fishery, one of the most extensive and productive of all their
fields of enterprise and industry.
   The success of this system of cooperative observations has
already led to the establishment of societies at Bombay and Calcutta,
for obtaining, by similar means, a better knowledge of the winds,
currents, and the course of the streams of the Indian seas.
    But it is to the government of this country that the demand
for cooperation, and for the interchange of observations, is most
earnestly addressed by the government of the United States; and
the President and Council of the Royal Society express their hope
that it will not be addressed in vain.      We possess in our ships
of war, in our packet service and in our vast commercial navy,
better means of making such observations, and a greater interest in
the results to which they lead, than any other nation. For this pur
pose, every ship which is under the control of the Admiralty should
be furnished with instruments properly constructed and compared,
and with proper instructions for using them : similar instructions
for making and recording observations, as far as their means will
allow, should be sent to every ship that sails, with a request that
the results of them be transmitted to the Hydrographer's Office of the
Admiralty, where an adequate staff of officers or others should be
provided for their prompt examination, and the publication of the
improved charts and sailing directions to which they would lead;
above all, it seems desirable to establish a prompt communication
with the Hydrographer's Office of the United States, so that the
united labours of the two greatest naval and commercial nations of
the world may be combined, with the least practicable delay, in
promoting the interests of navigation.

been submitted to   them,  and more especially to the “Explanations
and  Sailing Directions to accompany   wind and current charts” pre

system of cooperative observations, and of the grounds upon which
they have ventured to make the preceding recommendations.

   “Second Appendix to a paper entitled ‘Discovery that the
Veins of the Bat's Wing (which are furnished with valves) are en
dowed with rythmical contractility.’” By T. Wharton Jones, Esq.,
F.R.S., &c.
   The author states that, from a microscopical examination of the
blood-vessels and circulation in the ears of the long-eared bat, he
has ascertained that, different from what he had discovered to be the
case in the wings, the veins of the ears are unfurnished with valves,

   May 27.-The reading of Mr. Huxley's paper, “Upon the Mor
phology of the Cephalous Mollusca, as illustrated by the Anatomy
of certain Heteropoda and Pteropoda,” commenced at the last meet
ing, was resumed and concluded.
    In the present memoir the author endeavours to determine, upon
anatomical and embryological grounds, the true homologies of the
different organs of the Cephalous Mollusca, and thence to arrive at
some idea of the archetypal form, as definite modifications of which
the existing molluscous forms may be considered to have arisen.
   The Pelagic Heteropoda and Pteropoda, from their small size and
extreme transparency, are peculiarly favourable subjects for the ana
tomical part of this investigation, and it is from a detailed examina
tion of those systems of organs which are of importance for the pur
pose that the author deduces the following conclusions:—
    1. In the Heteropoda the intestine is bent towards the dorsal or
 harmal side in consequence of the development behind the anus of
the visceral “hernia,” which is therefore called a post-abdomen.
   2. In the Heteropoda, the “foot,” in                     its
                                                  most perfect condition,
consists    three portions,
                of             propodium, mesopodium and metapodium.

                                            of      the post-abdomen.

expanded wing characteristic         the group.

to the former division, and that the Cephalopoda and Pulmonata
belong to the latter.
   8. Anatomical evidence shows that the Heteropoda have a haemal
flexure of the intestine, the Pteropoda a neural flexure; and it is
almost certain that when their development is traced, the former will
be found to have a post-abdomen, the latter an abdomen; there will
then be two great divisions of the cephalous mollusca.
   a. Those which develope an abdomen —Cephalopoda, Pteropoda,
Pulmonata.

results of either course of development.

    “On the Change of Refrangibility of Light.” By George G.
Stokes, Esq., M.A., F.R.S., Lucasian Professor of Mathematics,
Cambridge.
    The author was led into the researches detailed in this paper by
considering a very singular phenomenon which Sir John Herschel
had discovered in the case of a weak solution of sulphate of quinine,
and various other salts of the same alkaloid.          This fluid appears
colourless and transparent, like water, when viewed by transmitted
light, but exhibits in certain aspects a peculiar blue colour.         Sir
John Herschel found that when the fluid was illuminated by a beam
of ordinary daylight, the blue light was produced only throughout a
very thin stratum of fluid adjacent to the surface by which the light
entered. It was unpolarized.        It passed freely through many inches
of the fluid. The incident     beam,    after having passed through the
stratum from which the blue      light  came, was not sensibly enfeebled
nor coloured, but yet it had lost the power of producing the usual
blue colour when admitted into a solution of sulphate of quinine. A
beam of light modified in this mysterious manner was called by
Sir John Herschel epipolized.
    Several years before Sir David Brewster had discovered in the
case of an alcoholic solution of the green colouring matter of leaves
a very remarkable phenomenon, which he has designated as internal
dispersion.    On admitting into this fluid a beam of sunlight con
densed   by  a lens, he was surprised by finding the path of the rays
within the fluid marked by a bright light of a blood-red colour,
strangely contrasting with the beautiful green of the fluid itself when
seen in moderate thickness.          Sir David afterwards observed the
same    phenomenon    in various   vegetable  solutions and essential oils,
and in some solids.     He conceived it to be due to coloured particles
held in suspension.      But there was one circumstance attending the
phenomenon which seemed very difficult of explanation on such
a supposition, namely, that the whole or a great part of the dispersed
beam was unpolarized, whereas a beam reflected from suspended
particles might be expected to be polarized by reflexion.             And
 such was, in fact, the case with those beams which were plainly
 due to nothing but particles held in suspension.        From the general
 identity of the circumstances attending the two phenomena, Sir
 David Brewster was led to conclude that epipolic was merely a par
 ticular case of internal dispersion, peculiar only in this respect, that
 the rays capable of dispersion were dispersed with unusual rapidity.
 But what rays they were which were capable of affecting a solution
 of sulphate of quinine, why the active rays were so quickly used up,
 while the dispersed rays which they produced passed freely through
 the fluid, why the transmitted light when subjected to prismatic
 analysis showed no deficiencies in those regions to which, with
 respect to refrangibility, the dispersed rays chiefly belonged, were
 questions to which the answers appeared to be involved in as much
 mystery as ever.
    After having repeated some of the experiments of Sir David

                                             Royal Society.                                                        389
Brewster and Sir John Herschel, the author could not fail to take a
most lively interest in the phenomenon. The firm conviction which
he felt that two portions of light were not distinguishable as to their
nature otherwise than by refrangibility and state of polarization, left
him but few hypotheses to choose between, respecting the explana
tion of the phenomenon.         In fact, having regarded it at first as an
axiom that    dispersed  light of any particular refrangibility could only
have arisen from     light  of the same refrangibility contained in the
incident   beam,  he was led by necessity to adopt hypotheses of so
artificial a character as to render them wholly improbable.         He was
thus compelled to adopt the other alternative, namely, to suppose
that in the process of internal dispersion the refrangibility of light
had been changed. Startling as such a supposition might appear at
first sight, the ease with which it accounted for the whole pheno
                                                                                                                     to its
menon was such as already to produce a strong probability of
truth. Accordingly the author determined            put this hypothesis     to
the test     experiment.

circumstances two dusky bands were seen still further on.             Several
circumstances led the author to conclude that in all probability fixed
lines might be readily seen corresponding to still more refrangible
 rays, were it not for the opacity of glass with respect to those rays
 of very high refrangibility.
    It is very easy to prove experimentally that the blue dispersed
 light corresponding to any particular part of the incident spectrum
 is not homogeneous light, having a refrangibility equal to that of the
incident rays, and rendered visible in consequence of its complete
isolation; but that it is in fact heterogeneous light, consisting of
rays extending over a wide range of refrangibility, and not passing
beyond the limits of refrangibility of the spectrum visible under
ordinary circumstances.        To show this it is sufficient to isolate a
part of the incident spectrum, and view the narrow beam of dispersed
light which it produces through a prism held to the eye.
    In Sir David Brewster's mode of observation, the beam of light,
 which was of the same nature as the blue light exhibited by a solu
tion of sulphate of quinine, was necessarily mixed with the beam due
 merely to reflexion from suspended particles; and in the case of
vegetable solutions, a beam of the latter kind almost always exists, to
a greater or less degree. But in the method of observation employed
by the author, to which he was led by the discovery of the change
of refrangibility, the two beams are exhibited quite distinct from one
 another.     The author proposes to call the two kinds of internal.
 dispersion just mentioned true internal dispersion and false internal
dispersion, the latter being nothing more than the scattering of light
 which is produced by suspended particles, and having, as is now
perfectly plain, nothing to do with the remarkable phenomenon of
true internal dispersion.
    Now that the nature of the latter phenomenon is better known, it
is of course possible to employ methods of observation by which it
may be detected even when only feebly exhibited.             It proves to be
almost universal in vegetable solutions, that                       is,   in
                                                             solutions made
directly from various parts         vegetables. When vegetable products

gular examples occurs in the case of an alcoholic solution of the
green colouring matter of leaves.             This fluid disperses a rich red
light. The dispersion commences abruptly about the fixed line B,
and continues from thence onwards throughout the visible spectrum
and a little beyond. The dispersion is subject to fluctuations inti

   A high degree of sensibility appears to be rather rare among inor
ganic compounds.       Certain specimens of fluor spar, as is already
known, give a copious internal dispersion of a deep blue light; but
this is plainly due to some foreign ingredient, the nature of which is
at present unknown. But there is one class of inorganic compounds
which are very remarkable for their sensibility, namely, certain com
pounds of peroxide of uranium, including the ornamental glass called
canary glass, and the natural mineral yellow uranite. In these com
pounds the dispersed light is found on analysis to consist of bright
bands arranged at regular intervals.      A very remarkable system of
absorption bands is also found among these compounds, which is
plainly connected with the system of bright bands seen in the spec
trum of the dispersed light. The connection between the absorption
and internal dispersion exhibited by these compounds is very sin
gular, and is of a totally different nature from the connection which
has been already mentioned as occurring in solutions of the green
 colouring matter of leaves.
    There is one law relating to the change of refrangibility which
 appears to be quite universal, namely, that the refrangibility of light
 is always lowered by internal dispersion.         The incident rays being
 homogeneous, the dispersed light is found to be more or less com
 posite.   Its colour depends simply on             refrangibility, having its                                          no

this way the phenomenon seems likely to prove of value in the sepa
ration of organic compounds. The phenomena sometimes also afford
curious evidence of chemical combinations; but this subject cannot
here be further dwelt upon.
   The appearance which the rays from an electric spark produce in
a solution of sulphate of quinine, shows that the spark is very rich
in invisible rays of excessively high refrangibility, such as would
plainly put them far beyond the limits of the maps which have
hitherto been made of the fixed lines in the chemical part of the
solar spectrum.      These rays are stopped by glass, but transmitted
through quartz.       These circumstances render it probable that the
phosphorogenic rays of an electric spark are nothing more than rays
of the same nature as those of light, but which are invisible, and not
only so, but of excessively high refrangibility.     If so, they ought to
be  stopped   by a very  small quantity of a substance known to absorb
those rays with great energy.      Accordingly the author found that
while the rays from an electric spark, which excite the phosphores
cence of Canton's phosphorus, pass freely through water and quartz,
they are stopped on adding to the water an excessively small quan
tity of sulphate of quinine.
   At the end of the paper the author explains what he conceives
to be the cause of the change of refrangibility, and enters into some
speculations to account for the law according to which the refrangi
bility of light is always lowered in the process of internal dispersion.

comparing the expansive force of heat with the extending force of a
weight; or in other words, these values enable us to determine the
mechanical equivalent of heat.       It must not here be forgotten, that

    A  closer correspondence was not to be expected with numbers
which have       been determined by such different observers, and upon
which certainly no slight influence is exercised by the particular
condition of the metals experimented with. I am at the present
time engaged in the determination of two of the values in question
—the elastic constants and the coefficients of expansion by heat for
the same wires—and hope then to arrive at more accurate results.
    The pressure of 224325 Russian pounds acted upon the surface
of it square inches, we have then for 1 square inch 71441 pounds,
or more than 4327 atmospheres.
    The mechanical equivalent of heat may also be expressed in an
other way. The above-mentioned metal cylinder is extended to the
amount of       6  by the gravitation           of one pound; the weight p=}
would then lengthen it one inch ; we may then express the elastic
force of the cylinder by saying it raises the weight p one inch; for
it holds the force p which has sunk one inch in equilibrium.
    If the same cylinder is heated to 212°, it expands to the amount
 of a ; and according to the above hypothesis, it would expand to the
 amount of 2a if the heat acted only in one direction like the weightp.
 The quantity of heat which causes this expansion is w. mS, when we
 represent by w the quantity of heat which is necessary to raise the
 temperature of a cylinder of water of a height and radius equal to
 unity from 32° to 212°. Hence it follows that
                                           w. mS
                                             2a
 is the quantity of heat which would effect an extension of one inch;
 or as forces which bring about equal effects must themselves be equal,

     The quantity of heat necessary to heat the cylinder of water from
 32° to 212° is then capable of raising 224325 Russian pounds one
 inch.     This cylinder of water weighs 0 1 134 of an English pound
  (at the temperature of the greatest density); the number of Fahren
 heit degrees between the freezing and boiling-points of water is 180,
 and a Russian pound = 0.9028 of an English pound; we have then

  Up to the end of the seventeenth and beginning of the eighteenth
centuries the atmosphere was reckoned amongst the few elements
admitted at that time.      In course of time the researches of Van Hel
mont, Hales, Mayow, Bergmann, Scheele and Lavoisier, led to the
knowledge of the fact that the atmosphere is a mixture of oxygen
and nitrogen.    The later chemists set themselves to the task of de
termining these constituents with greater exactitude than was pos
sible to their predecessors.       Thus Cavendish, Davy, Marty and
Berthollet showed that the air had the same composition in all cli
mates.    Gay-Lussac ascertained the same fact with regard to air
obtained by him by means of an air-balloon from a height to which
no one had previously attained.          He, together with Humboldt,
furnished considerable assistance to Lavoisier in his determinations.
Afterwards, in 1822, Despretz made numerous analyses of the air
and arrived at similar results.        Lastly, Dumas, Boussingault and
Regnault have carried the accuracy of the analyses much further by
operating upon larger quantities of air; and it appears that posterity
has nothing more to determine, except whether the ascertained com
position of the atmosphere be constant, whether the causes, such as
combustion, respiration, &c. which lessen            its

IN has
    a series of paperst published by Sir David Brewster, he
        endeavoured to establish a peculiar view which he en
tertains regarding the composition of solar light and the gene
ration of colours. These papers must naturally attract in a high
degree the attention of physicists, both on account of the well
won renown of their author in the domain of optical science,
and of the new facts which he adduces in support of his asser
tions.    According to him, solar light is compounded of three
different kinds of light, red, blue and yellow; and each descrip
tion of light possesses rays of          degrees        all
                                                      refrangibility, but   of
so  distributed that red light contains        preponderance        rays                        of      of
less  refrangibility,   yellow  more  rays     mean            of a

blue more       greater refrangibility; hence

 compound light formed by them must in the prismatic analysis
behave as simple light.         To this Brewster replies, that such rays
may be separated from each other by taking advantage of their
 difference of absorption in coloured media; and he has attempted
by means of this method to prove, that in                   portions       the              all                    of

the view of Brewster. The first dwelt particularly upon the fact
that Brewster, in the method which he applied, had not the
colours changed by absorption simultaneously with the unchanged
colours before him, and could therefore readily make a mistake
in the comparison.                                     I
                       To this Brewster replied, and can corro
borate his statement by my own experience, that in his observa
tions the changes of colour were for the most part sufficiently
striking to be observed without difficulty.    Draper and Melloni
expressed their doubts regarding the purity of the spectrum used
by Brewster, and thought that the single colours might overlap
each other considerably.      From Brewster's statements in reply
to these attacks, it is evident that no such overlapping of the
colours took place; his later experiments on the number of
Fraunhofer's lines in the solar spectrum, show further that he
possessed far more complete apparatus for the separation of the
rays of different refrangibility than even Fraunhofer himself, or
perhaps any other physicist.     A careful repetition of at least the
most important of his experiments, carried out in exact accord
ance with his method, and with every precaution hitherto deemed
necessary, has indeed taught me that the facts which he affirms
to have observed are described with perfect accuracy; indeed
nothing else could be expected from so skilful an observer;        I
trust, however, to be able to show that his explanation of these
experiments is untenable, and thus to remove the apparent con
tradiction of the views of Newton.
  It  is much to be regretted that Brewster nowhere gives a de
tailed description of his method of observation.     Hence it is that
Draper and Melloni might do him injustice by their suppositions,
and hence also, that at the outset    Imust ask his indulgence in
case I also should allude to  possible  sources of error which he
has taken pains to avoid.    Partly from his replies to his anta
gonists, and partly from the description in his Treatise on Optics,
London, 1831, I gleaned the following regarding his mode of
observation.    In the shutter of a dark room he made a narrow
aperture, and looked at this with the naked eye through a strongly
refracting prism; in the spectrum thus formed he was able to
detect the stronger lines of Fraunhofer.       He then introduced
the absorbing coloured medium between the eye and the prism,
and observed the altered spectrum.       Besides this, he repeated
the experiment with spectra in which a number of dark bands
were formed by interference, and the different colours separated
in a still more evident manner.     Brewster does not state whether
it was direct sunlight, or merely the reflected light of the sky
which he permitted to enter through the aperture and fall upon
the prism. We must, however, assume that in most cases he
made use of the former;     forwhen the slit  is sufficiently narrow

to show the lines of Fraunhofer, the coloured rays changed by
the absorbing medium, and to which the experiments had refer
ence, are for the most part so feebly luminous that they can be
clearly seen by direct sunlight only.
   The doubts which impressed themselves upon me during the
repetition of these experiments, refer, in the first place, to the
question whether small quantities of white dispersed light might
not have been mixed up with the spectrum; and secondly,
whether the eye under the given circumstances was not prevented
by physiological influences from forming a correct judgement as
to the colours. With regard to the doubt first expressed, it may
be stated that by the method of Brewster                  light, with the ex    all
ception      that which enters through the aperture, may
                                                                                                           a be

Prisms of rock-salt were not in my possession, and                    can there          I
fore form no opinion as to their completeness.
    The second circumstance to be taken into account is the re
peated reflexion of light in the prism.              In the majority of prisms
used for    experiments       on   dispersion     the two refracting surfaces
alone are    polished,   the other three        being   ground dull.      If such
a prism be placed upon a dark ground so that the dull surface
shall be illuminated, then within the prism a series of reflected
images of this surface is observed.              The two polished sides act
like an   angular    mirror,   which exhibits a series of circular images
of any object placed between                       its
                                             reflectors.                      In

us   the third surface      occupies    this  position,   and we look through
one     ofthe reflectors into the interior.            The reflected images                               of
the third surface appear                exactly the same direction

is  thus created which spreads itself over the spectrum. The
quantity      ofthe reflected light              certainly very small, and
                                                         is                                               in

of the retina than those affected by the regularly refracted light.
To these belong undoubtedly the diffraction of light in the pupil.
When light passes through a narrow orifice, or simply passes the
edge of a dark body, a small portion of it will be always deflected.
Now although the pupil is certainly too large in comparison to
the focal distance of the eye to permit of rings being formed and
a considerable portion of light dispersed, as is the case when a
 very small aperture is held close to the eye, still the diffraction
 is by no means completely annulled. Further, it may be regarded
 as questionable whether the media of the eye are absolutely clear;
 being partly composed of microscopic cells and fibres, as the
 cornea and crystalline lens, and in other places traversed by a
 great number of fine membranes, as in the vitreous humour.
 The presence of little irregularitics in the structure of the back
 ward portion of the vitreous humour is further indicated by the
 so-called midges of the field of view, and perhaps something
 similar is to be found in other portions of the eye.            By these also
light must be dispersed.           Finally, it is proved by the eye-mirror
constructed by me”, that a tolerable quantity of light is sent
from the illuminated portions of the retina to the pupil, and this
must be reflected back again from the forward surface of the
 cornea.     It is therefore to my mind an undoubted fact, that a
portion of the light incident upon the eye is deflected so as to
fall upon other portions of the retina. Whether along with this
an extension of the nervous excitation over the retina takes place,
cannot be decided without further investigation; for our purpose
it   is,

of the glass appeared a dull yellow; through a still greater
thickness it appeared to be a greenish-white; and on introdu
cing other colouring matters, particularly solutions of copper
and red ink, it finally changed into white. This white he further
asserts is not to be decomposed by the prism; but if I rightly
comprehend the meaning of his expressions, he has never tried
this by a second prism—which indeed could not be effected with
out a considerable modification of the method of experiment—
but infers it merely from the fact that this white light has passed
undecomposed through the first prism.
                               I
   The blue glass which had at my disposal showed the phae
nomena described by Brewster in the following manner. Seen
through one plate, the yellow stripe in a spectrum produced by
the light of the firmament was very feebly luminous, and a
greenish-yellow; but in the spectrum obtained from the portion
of the heavens which lay near the sun it was a pure and shining
yellow.    Observed through two plates, the stripe obtained from
 daylight disappeared totally; with direct sunlight it appeared
almost white; with greater intensity of light it verged into
greenish-yellow, and with diminished intensity into blue.                             Ad
jacent to this moderately illuminated band the blue and violet
appeared of course splendidly bright, and the extreme red was
also strongly luminous.        Seen through three plates in direct
 sunlight, the yellow band appeared a bluish-white.         The altera
tion of the colours was somewhat less when the plates, instead
of being introduced between the prism and the eye, were placed
before the aperture, that         is,
                                 between the source      light and the

coloured light which passes unweakened through the plates                              is

 violet.   For the experiment to succeed, it is necessary that the
 breadth of the absorption spectrum shall be much greater than
 that of the paper spectrum.
    By these facts it is plainly proved that subjective changes of
 colour can take place in the spectrum, not only in the same
 degree as when ordinary colours are brought together, but per
 haps more striking and illusive, on account of the greater vivid
 ness of the simple colours.       In other cases these changes cannot
 be referred to the induction of complementary             colours. An
 example of this, to which Brewster refers, is the band in reddish
 orange, which extends about from C to D in the smalt-glass
 spectrum. It is much darker than the red and yellow portions
 which lie next         it,
                      and seems when looked          between these with

  This is most easily observed with violet, which, in the spectrum
  of direct sunlight and by a moderate degree of brightness, appears
  to be a white-gray, retaining only a feeble tinge of violet. Pro
 fessor Moser has shown me that the sun seen through a dark
 violet glass appears as completely white as the strongly illumi
 nated clouds observed on looking past the glass.   In like manner
 blue, of a degree of brightness which may be borne without
 injury to the eye, appears whitish-blue, and, if the brightness be
 increased, appears white.      Green first becomes yellow-green
 before, like yellow, it entirely loses     colour with increased           its
 brightness.       Red exhibits the phaenomenon with more difficulty

the principles of ‘ordinary interference;’ and some time after
wards* I applied the same explanation to the colours of a jet of
steam observed by Prof. Forbes.
   In one point, however, my view diverges from that of Mr.
Reuben Phillips.       He names the water-particles which cause the
interference   “drops    of water,” while                   I
                                                 believe that they are
water-bladders,    for which view I have adduced my reasons in a
separate papert.
   Besides this, I should like to mention two points with regard
to which I have been unable to obtain from the paper of Mr.
Phillips a clear notion of the author's opinion.
   (1.) Among the various colours of the atmosphere there appears
to me to exist only two simple originating ones; namely, the
blue colour in all its shades, from dark blue to white, due to
interference by reflexion; and orange-red colour in the corre
sponding shades, due to interference by transmission.          The other
colours exhibited at times in various      portions   of the heavens,  as,
for example,   purple   or green,  I hold to be due to the     mixing   of
the above two colours in their different shades.
   (2.) When clouds appear coloured,                        I
                                                believe that the colour
exhibited is for the most     part   not formed in the cloud itself,
inasmuch as the little bladders generally differ too much in thick
ness to cause the production of a single determinate colour; but
that the light, partly on      way   itsthe cloud, and partly between
                                                to
the cloud and our eye, assumes                   its
                                           colour; even        the appa    in
rently clear     air
                  there  always   exist bladders,  which,   however,  are
for the most part        so
                        attenuated, that they favour           particular  in
                                                                            a

duced when the warm finger was placed upon the junction.

  Mr. Joule, when          I

account for them.     I think it will be generally admitted that
there can be no such inaccuracy in Regnault’s part of the data,

saturated steam, to prevent the conclusion that p cannot be ex

      Prof. Thomson              on the    Dynamical Theory               of      Heat.            429
researches afford actual tests, which, so far as they go, are veri
fications of the truth of Mayer's hypothesis for temperatures
between 50° and 60°Fahr., founded on two distinct methods,
either of which is perfect in principle, and might be made the
foundation of experiments at any temperature whatever.
    70. The first of these methods consists simply in determining,
by direct experiment, the heat evolved by the expenditure of a
given amount of work in compressing air, and comparing it with
the quantity of heat created by the same amount of work in
Joule's original experiments on the heat developed by magneto
electricity, and by the friction of fluids in motion.
    71. The second method is especially remarkable, as affording
in each experiment an independent test of the truth of Mayer's
hypothesis for air at the temperature used, without requiring any
knowledge of the absolute value of the mechanical equivalent of
heat. In Joule’s actual experiments, the test is simply this:—
 the total external thermal effect is determined when air is allowed
 to expand, through a small orifice, from one vessel into another
 previously exhausted by an air-pump.            Here the first mechanical
 effect produced    by  the  expanding   gas  is                 vis
                                                      viva generated       the                 in
 rushing     ofthe air.    By  the time equilibrium          established, allis
 this mechanical effect has been lost          fluid friction (there being
                                                         in

 each of the two vessels, and round a portion of the tube contain
 ing the small orifice (a stop-cock), has suggested to me a method
 which appears still simpler, and more suitable for obtaining an ex
 cessively delicate test of Mayer's hypothesis for any temperature.
 It consists merely in dispensing with the two vessels in Joule’s
 apparatus, and substituting for them two long spirals of tube
 (instead of doing this for only one of the vessels, as Joule does
 in his third experiment with the same apparatus); and in forcing
air continuously through the whole.    The first spiral portion of
the tube, up to a short distance from the orifice, ought to be
kept as nearly as possible at the temperature of the atmosphere
surrounding the portion containing the orifice, and serves merely
to    fix
       the temperature    the entering air. The following inves
                                          of

      Prof. Thomson on the Dynamical Theory of Heat.                                               433
kept up in the two parts by the middle of the battery being fitted
nearly air-tight in the tube by means of wax, or otherwise; but
this arrangement would not be satisfactory, as portions of the
bars of the battery, if not the ends themselves directly, would
be altered in temperature, even if Mayer's hypothesis were rigor
ously true, on account of the rushing of the air among them.
No part of the battery ought to be exposed to the rushing of
the air in the neighbourhood of the orifice, and therefore the
middle of the battery would have to be external to the tube, the
ends being cemented into the tube by some indurating cement
sufficiently strong and compact to hold perfectly air-tight on the
side where the pressure is different from the atmospheric press
ure. By such means as these, I think a very satisfactory series
of experiments might easily be performed to test Mayer's hypo
thesis for air through a very wide range of temperatures.
   78. Should the differential method of experimenting just de
scribed indicate any difference of temperature whatever on the
two sides of the orifice, Mayer's hypothesis would be shown to
be not exactly fulfilled, and, according as the air leaving the
orifice is found to be warmer or colder than the entering air, we
should infer that the heat absorbed, when air expands at a con
stant temperature, is less than or greater than the equivalent
of the mechanical effect produced by the expansion *.
   79. Calorimetrical methods, like those used by Joule, might
then be followed for actually determining the heat emitted or
absorbed by the air in the neighbourhood of the orifice, or in the
second spiral, in acquiring the temperature of the              the                     air   in
entering stream; and               by
                             careful experimenting,        probable           it   is
that excessively accurate results might                      be
                                              thus obtained for                                      a
wide   range      of
                temperature.

LXIX.         On Indirect Demonstration.                          By Professor DE MoRGAN*
        NDER the            indirect demonstration, mathematicians
                             phrase
        are accustomed to include two things which are quite
distinct.    From this use of language springs confusion between
the different characters of different methods.       Geometers have
seldom been    very formal   logicians; and their   patent of exemp
tion was   signed  by Euclid.
   Indirect demonstration, as commonly conceived, means demon
stration of the impossibility of        contradiction.    But the fol
                                                           all
lowing distinctions are required.        Let the proposition                                                   to   be
proved       Every

as opposed       converse, and
                        to          opposed     indirect,
                                                     as     shall take      to                 I
the correlatives positive and contrapositive, direct and indirect.

     2.The direct contrapositive proposition, identical with the last,
is  Every not-B       not-A. The direct contrapositive proof takes

     3.The indirect positive proof attacks the positive contradic

     4.The indirect contrapositive proof attacks the contrapositive
contradiction, Some not-Bs are As, and taking          not-B assumed                   a

          shows the assumption        have     absurdity for

opposed     the second pair. The latter pair proceed from denial

seems that the contrapositive proposition is often more accessible
than the positive one, because we know more about the negative
terms than about the positive ones: and we have to proceed
from the more known to the less known.         It is surely no great
wonder, and no cause of complaint against the nature of things,
that we should sometimes find ourselves in a position in which
we can only proceed to comparison of equals by previous com
parison of unequals. On the contrary, it seems clear to me that
it should rather be matter of surprise that we are not obliged
to do something yet more specific in the way of departure from
consideration of equality.
    The relations of magnitude (ratios) are infinite in number.                          If
there were a person well versed in the truths of geometry and
arithmetic, but wholly ignorant of their systematic derivation from
each other, and if this person were informed that he must proceed
to study demonstration, he would imagine that his earliest                              in
strument would be — ratio in all its varieties.        He would be
surprised when he was told that, for a considerable time, he
would not be required to subdivide ratio into more than three
cases, ratio of equality, and the two forms of ratio of inequality
 without any specification of the degree of inequality.     But per
haps he would be more surprised if he were told that, after this
renunciation of the different modes of inequality, geometers were
 still unsatisfied whenever they had to reason from inequality to
equality.     And if he were a logician, though by my supposition
one who had not applied his logic in mathematics, he would be
most surprised to know that geometers never made the con
trapositive conversion of the universal affirmative except by an
indirect demonstration, and laid the blame on the essential cha
racter of geometry, instead of laying it on their own neglect of
 the study of the pure laws of thought, as they apply in geometry
and everything else.
     I have been led to offer these remarks at this particular time
by Mr. Sylvester's paper contained in your last Number, as to
which    I agree almost entirely with       that    of all
                                                     Mr. Sylvester’s is

he    holds      common with most other geometers.

mutual action of the parts of a compressible fluid, the pressure
of which varies in the same proportion as the density.

of the fluid so act on each other, that a motion of this kind
results? The absurdity to which, as already stated, this suppo
sition conducts, proves that it is not allowable.     Again, motion
which tends to or from a fixed centre, and is a function of the
distance from the centre, is rectilinear motion, and satisfies the
criterion of integrability of uda --vdy--wdz. The absurdity, how
ever, to which the supposition of such motion conducts proves
that this is not the kind of motion resulting from the mutual
action of the parts of the fluid.    Neither can it be motion tend
ing to or from focal lines; for if this were the general law, no
absurdity would result in the particular case of motion tending
to or from a centre.     Thus the absurd results above cited are
extremely important, as excluding from our consideration the
kinds of motion just mentioned.
   (2.) It remains to consider the case of an aris of rectilinear
motion. The general integrability of udw-Hvdy-Hwdz is in this
case only satisfied by the motion along, or immediately conti
guous to, the axis, the motion at                            all

  fore, be argued, as in Prop. VII., that Jº is a function of s and t,

  integrability of ude--vdy--wdz for small values of u, v, w is
  consistent with curvilinear motion, and may be satisfied by the

We have thus arrived at an equation for determining          which is                                        f

applies to the motion resulting from the mutual action of the

LXXI.     On the relation of Magnetism and Diamagnetism to the
     Colour of Bodies.   By Rich ARD ADIE, Esq., Liverpool*.

         WHILE           with some experiments in the latter part
                           occupied
         of the year 1850, to test the magnetic properties of a
variety of bodies, I was struck with the preponderance of trans
parent or white bodies among the class of diamagnetics;      con                                               I
sequently followed this branch of the inquiry, and in the follow
ing year gave, in Jameson's Edinburgh Journal, a table to
prove that the diamagnetic metals produced a much larger
proportion of colourless compounds than the magnetic ones. In
the present instance I propose to return to the subject, to show
that when the inquiry is confined to the oxides and chlorides, a
similar relation subsists, although among the elementary bodies
themselves there appears to be no connexion  of the sort; indeed
they tend to range themselves in an order opposite to that of the

lity of the copper.     The mines and localities from which the ore
 is          are so numerous, that it would be impracticable to have
a separate yard or compartment in the smelting-works for every
one; hence a more general classification is adopted, such as
highly sulphurous ores, including those containing mundic, fluc
can or clayey ores coloured red or yellow, gray sulphur ores, &c.
Sometimes certain mines or localities are known to produce ores
of a certain quality; for instance those from Hayle have generally
the character of being stiff (difficult to fuse); those from Foey Con
sols, of making inferior copper, &c.; these are        classified: then             all

for Chilian ore, and for Australian ore; besides these qualities,

into the condition of sulphurets in smelting, they are seldom
mixed with the sulphuret ores, but with the calcined coarse
metal from these ores to be described.
   M. F. Le Play, in his Procédés Métallurgiques, has divided
the ores into seven classes, and pointed out their distribution
in the operations in the works as follows:—
1st. Ores containing from 3 to 15 per cent. of copper, mostly
  pyrites, with sulphuret of iron, and much earthy and other
  impurities.
2nd, Ores of the same character as the first, but richer, having
  from 15 to 25 per cent. of copper.
3rd. Ores requiring no calcination, having little sulphur and
   much oxide of copper, the per-centage of copper being between
   12 and 20.
4th. Ores composed of oxides and carbonates of copper, subsul
  phurets with small portions of pyrites, the matrix being oxide
  of iron and quartz.
5th. Same as the first class, but known to have no deleterious
  matters in them, such as tin, antimony, &c.
6th. Ores, principally subsulphurets, having a per-centage of
  from 60 to 80 of copper.
7th. The waste matters collected about the works termed, as we
  have already noticed, cobbing.
   As this author describes ten operations as necessary in the
manufacture of copper, his observations and descriptions must
have reference to a period previous to the introduction of so
much rich foreign ore, and some of these descriptions are there
fore not applicable to the present time, the general routine of
operations being now only six.    The want of a definite rule to
guide the smelter in mixinghis ores is a desideratumwe thinkeasily
supplied by investigation and attention. In the last section we
mentioned that silica, alumina, &c. were by themselves infusible,
but at high temperatures readily combine with other matters
and form compounds that are easily fused; and in these com
binations there are kinds and quantities of these substances much
more easily fused than others.    The first object of the smelter
being to separate the metallic portion of the ore from the earths
with the least expense and trouble, the having a mixture that will
give him an easily flowing scoria, is a primary consideration.
This, no doubt, could be easily obtained in the same way as
shown in assaying, by adding flux; but every addition of flux is
a loss in the smelting of copper, and should always be avoided
if possible.   In        all
                        combinations,         effect perfect fusion

solve 32 grains      of metallic copper in vitriol, it would require 49
grains of the strongest acid, and nothing less; hence 32 and 49
are their relative combining proportions.   The same law holds
good for every substance combining whether by fusion or solu
tion. The equivalent or combining proportion of silica is 46.
In order, then, to form a compound with silica that will be
easily fused, we must employ equivalents of other substances.
The following is a table of the combining proportions of those
matters found in copper ores, or added as flux to fuse                                    silica: —

  With these proportions, and an approximate analysis of the
mixture of ores, a pretty accurate idea may be formed, before the
matters are put into the furnace, of the kind of scoriae that will
be formed.
    For the general character of the ores we refer to the tables in the
first article, where it will be observed that silica is the principal
earth present.    Le Play gives the average composition of          the                       all

    By comparing this with the above analysis of ore, we find that
lime and fluor-spar have been added to assist fusion, which should,
when it is possible, be avoided; it will also be observed that the
oxide of iron is the principal flux for the silica.   The following

taining 30 per cent. of copper; so that here the poorestore gives
the richest mat.   In order, then, to show the principle of mixing,
and to obtain a fusible slag without flux, we will take two parts
of the above rich ore and one of the poor ore, giving a mixture
having the composition—

 If this be calcined to volatilize half the sulphur, the remaining
 half, viz. 12:7, when the ore is fused, will combine thus:—
                     4.6 will combine with                          .        .        18.4 copper,

 producing a mat or coarse metal with 40 per cent. of copper.
 The oxide of iron being equal to 16.5 will combine with the 29.3
 silica, forming the slag. We will enter more fully into these
 combinations further on.
     With respect to the time any mixture of ore has to be calcined,
 the rate at which calcination proceeds has also to be considered,
 and forms a most important inquiry. Thus suppose the above
 mixture of ores lost half of    sulphur            its
                                             nine hours, nine hours                  in

tion of these fumes will cause an immediate decrease in the quan
tity of sulphur in the portion of ore then tested; the gases
above the ore being principally composed of sublimed sulphur,
the admission of cold air, which always follows a rapid evolution
of gas, probably the result of a reacting condensation, causes a
portion of the sulphur to be deposited and absorbed again by
the ore, so that the next quantity tried contains more sulphur.

           After 28 hours                      a mere trace of acid and copper, no iron.
           After 32 hours                      a mere trace of acid and copper, no iron.
           After 36 hours                      trace of acid, no metal.
           After 40 hours                      no trace of acid or metal.
           After 44 hours                      no trace of acid or metal.
        Several other experiments were tried of a like kind with similar
     results, to which we may have recur to in connexion with others
     of a different description in order to arrive at the causes of these
     reactions in a calciner.
         For the purpose of saving time and fuel a compound calciner
      has been tried, and we believe is still in use in some works
      where one bed or hearth is placed over the other. The ore is put
      into the top bed, then passes through holes in the floor to the
      second or middle, and then to the third or lower bed, where it
      receives the highest heat; so that nine hours' calcination is equal
      to three hours in each bed. The first experiments made with
      this sort of calciner had for their object to ascertain the length
      of time required to calcine dead.                                                   The ore was tested for sulphur
      every four hours, allowing sixteen hours in each bed; each sample
      was also boiled in water, and the sulphuric acid determined.

will be more plainly developed.           In the meantime we may refer
to one or two other plans that have been adopted or tried in the
calcination of ores.
    Some smelters have ore-calciners on the top of the ore fusing
furnace, the roof of the furnace being the lowest bed of the calciner
arranged in the same manner as we have described in the case of
the three-bedded calciner. There being two beds for the calcining
operations above, the ore is put into a hopper on the roof and let
into the top bed; it is then passed by a hole through the floor into
the second bed, and from thence in the same way to the fusing-fur
nace.     Thus the ore is being calcined during the time taken for
 fusing two charges; by this means the waste heat of the fusing
furnace is taken advantage of to calcine the ore.              At first sight
this mode may appear to be very oeconomical; but it is subject
to certain practical drawbacks, such as a greater liability in the
furnace to get out of repair, thereby stopping two operations:
the mat obtained is neither so good nor rich in copper.                 From
causes to be noticed as we proceed, these have prevented the
 adoption of this method in the trade.
    Calciners have also been tried alongside of a fusing-furnace,
 so fitted that the waste heat of the furnace passed over them as
 through a flue; also causing the fire from the fusing-furnace to
 pass along a series of flues covered by fire-tiles forming the
 bottom of close-chambers, in which the ore was put to calcine,
 separate chambers being connected to condense the sulphur; but
 all schemes depending upon the employment                        of
                                                           the waste heat                   of
the fusing-furnaces have been found ultimately more costly than
 the ordinary calciner                of
                                one bed.      The close-chamber for cal

price than it does at present.
   Other methods have been tried with success, so far as the fact
of capability goes, to arrange the furnace, the draught, the heat,
and the mixture of ores, so as to convert the copper into the
state of a soluble sulphate; the ore is afterwards boiled in water,
to which, after passing from the ore, is added metallic iron,
which precipitates the copper in the metallic state; but no method
has yet surpassed in point of oeconomy the ordinary single bed
calciner.    However, we must not forget the fact, that at least
30,000 tons of sulphur of the value of about £200,000 pass
into the atmosphere every year in the compass of a few miles,

       the Tides, Bed and Coasts of the North Sea or German
     “On
Ocean.” By John Murray, Esq. Communicated by George Rennie,
Esq., F.R.S.
   The author commences his paper by remarking that great similarity
of outline pervades the western shores of Ireland, Scotland and
Norway, and then observes that the great Atlantic flood-tide wave,
having traversed the shores of the former countries, strikes with
great fury the Norwegian coast between the Lafoden Isles and Stad
land, one portion proceeding to the north, while the other is de
flected to the south, which last has scooped out along the coast, as
far as the Sleeve at the mouth of the Baltic, a long channel from
100 to 200 fathoms in depth, almost close in shore, and varying
from 50 to 100 miles in width. After describing his method of con
touring and colouring the Admiralty chart of the North Sea, he
traces the course of the tide-wave among the Orkney and Shetland
Islands along the eastern shores of Scotland and England to the
Straits of Dover, and along the western shores of Norway, Denmark
and the Netherlands, to the same point. He then remarks that the
detritus arising from the continued wasting away of nearly the
whole line of the eastern coasts of Scotland and England, caused by
the action of the flood-tide, is carried by      and   it,

   The author then takes view   a     the tides, and their effects upon
                                           of
the Baltic and its shores before the course                  of
                                                    the tide-wave was
checked     by
            these shoals and low lands.     He considers that, previous
to these great changes, the flood-tide entering the North Sea between
Norway and Scotland, would make directly towards the German
coast, and necessarily heap           up
                                 the waters     the Baltic considerably

 above their present level, and that a great part of Finland, Russia,
and Prussia bordering upon that sea, would thus every twelve hours
be under water, in the same way as the waters now rise in the Bay
of Fundy, at Chepstow, and other places, much above their ordinary
level in the open sea; that the current outward, on the receding
of the tide which these accumulated waters would occasion, com
bined with the rivers which fall into the Baltic, when checked by
the following flood-tide, would cause deposits in the form of a bar
tailing towards Sweden; and that an increase to these deposits
would form shoals, drifts and islands, and eventually a long sand
bank in outline, like the country of Denmark. He further considers
that the tide being by these means prevented from entering the
Baltic, may account for the subsidence of the waters of the Gulf of
Bothnia better than can the upheaval of the northern part of Scan
dinavia.
   The author then remarks that the great shoal of the North Sea is
                                                                                                                             by

in many instances the formation of those systems.     These spaces,
produced by absorption, are called by the authors Haversian spaces.
Unlike the Haversian canals which are surrounded by their own
laminae, these spaces are bounded by parts of several systems which
have been encroached on by the process of absorption.
   In examining various sections, or different parts of the same
section, many of these spaces will be found which have become par
tially or entirely occupied by Haversian systems. They are found
in the bone of subjects of   ages.   The fact   all

    3. Lacunae.—In young bone the lacunae are more abundant, larger,
and have more numerous canaliculi;                  older bone they may exist
                                                                     in

 has been seen too that it not unfrequently happens that a series of
 Haversian systems is contained within a common series of surround
 ing laminae.      Sometimes the Haversian systems are rendered quite
 solid   by  the narrowing of the Haversian canal and ultimate develop
 ment of a mere lacuna in the centre of the system. The more re
cently developed Haversian systems, which occupy the Haversian
spaces before described, are seen to be darker in colour than the
older ones, from the greater abundance of canaliculi, and the more
general granularity of the tissue.
    5. Ossified articular cartilage.—This structure the authors have
found in        all
                 the joints which they have examined,               the lower jaw,
amongst others, where Kölliker failed                  detect          Towards the

bone the tissue becomes           general granular and

                                                demarcation between the bone
and the ossified cartilage; but sometimes they graduate insensibly
the one into the other.

is usually designated the nucleus. In transverse sections of bone
immediately below the line of ossification, the lacunal cells may be
seen  presenting different characters under different circumstances.
Where two cells  come into contact, the processes or canaliculi may
be seen extending across from one to the other; but where the cell
is surrounded by intercolumnar tissue, the processes are short and do
not extend beyond the walls of their own cell; or if cells join at one
point while the remainder is invested with intercolumnar tissue, the
canaliculi will anastomose at the point of junction; while elsewhere
they are few, short, and do not extend beyond the cell.
    In the further process of development the cells and intercolumnar
tissue become fused together so as no longer to be recognised as
distinct parts; and the granular cell appears as a perfect lacuna with
a large cavity and numerous large canaliculi.               To bone in this con
dition the term primary bone has been applied. It speedily however
undergoes a change preparatory to the formation of the more per
manent secondary bone. Here and there in the line of ossification
portions are removed by absorption, the spaces left being filled with
small somewhat granular cells, lying in a transparent blastema, and
through the agency of which the absorption has been in                  probability         all

seen some which have accumulated around them a quantity of tissue
which forms a thick investment to them; they then become granular,
and take on in every respect the characters of a lacunal cell. These
are found deposited at intervals along the line of ossification and be
coming blended with the general mass; the granular cell remaining
as a lacuna, and sending out processes amongst the cells in all di
rections.   In old bone the cell character is in great part lost by a
general blending of the constituents, but may in many specimens be
still here and there recognised. Many instances are given in sup
port of the conclusion that absorption of bone and of dental tissue
is effected directly through the influence of cells, but these are ne
cessarily excluded from this abstract; indeed it is impossible to give
any other than a very imperfect account of the contents of the paper

chiefly on the rubian is apparent, since the extract, after it has be

the author next proposed to himself to inquire, by what means this
action is either destroyed, retarded, or promoted, and whether any
means exist of so modifying the action as to lead to the formation of
particular substances in preference to others. From a variety of
experiments undertaken with this object, he draws the following
conclusions:—
  1. There exist no means short of the complete destruction of the
ferment, capable of arresting          action           its              on
                                                   rubian, except exposing                                              it

                                        to               boiling water. Even      of
when     exposed        that  temperature,
                              to             after   having    been previously
dried, its fermenting power            not  entirelyis lost, but merely weak

further heated is soon converted into a white or grey ash.

water dissolving it which effected the decomposition, Löwenthal
made the following experiments.
    A gramme of anhydrous perchloride of tin was treated in two ex
periments with 100 and 60 cubic cent. of cold water.          The one
solution began to lose its clearness after 2 or 3 hours, the latter not
till after 36 hours, then very feebly, and it was not milky until after
a week.     Having thus ascertained the proportion of water which
might be employed without fearing decomposition, he mixed,—
    a. 0.5 grim. perchloride with a solution of 1 grim. crystallized
sulphate of soda in 30 cub. cent, water at 64° F. A precipitate
was immediately formed.
   b. The experiment a. was altered by adding 0-125 grim. hydrochloric
acid, 1-12 sp. gr., to the perchloride of tin. The liquid was at first
turbid, and after one minute the decomposition was complete.
   c. On using 0.25 grm. hydrochloric acid, it was not complete until
after 3 minutes, with 0-375 grim. 10 min., with 0.5 grm.43 min., and
with 0.75    grim. of acid the liquid remained clear for several hours.
   d. 0.5  grm.  perchloride with 0.5 grm. hydrochloric acid and 30 cub.
cent. water   containing   2.5 grims. crystallized sulphate of soda, were
mixed at 64° F. : remained at first clear, and the decomposition was
not completed until after 7 minutes.
   e. The experiment c. with 0.5 grim. acid repeated.             The liquid
at        clear, immediately gave a precipitate when heated to about
    first
108° F.
  f.   0.5 grm. protochloride treated with only 15 grms. water con
taining 1 grim. sulphate of soda. Liquid at first clear, gave a precipi
tate when heated which did not disappear on cooling.
   g. Metastannic acid long digested with hydrochloric acid and the
residue dissolved in water. On the addition of sulphate of soda the
decomposition ensued immediately. It follows from these data that,
    1. The decomposition takes place in the cold only when a certain
quantity of water is present.
   2. In the absence of free acid, with an adequate quantity of water
and with about 2 equivs. sulphate of soda to 1 equiv. perchloride of
tin, the decomposition takes place immediately.
   3. Free acid hinders the decomposition more or less in proportion
to   its
       quantity. Its influence may        removedbe         by
                                                        the careful addition
of  ammonia.      Chloride      ammonium does not cause the decompo

sition     the perchloride.

place more rapidly, the greater the quantity           sulphate

   Although in this equation 4 equivs. sulphate of soda are given, the
decomposition takes place with 2 and even with 1 equiv., but a larger
quantity of water is then necessary.     In this case acid is set free;
however, with a sufficiency of water this does not permanently hinder
the decomposition (in which the tendency of the hydrated oxide of
tin to separate certainly plays an important part), especially at an
elevated temperature.     The influence of this latter condition was
indeed to be expected, since Fremy has shown that the solution of
hydrated oxide of tin in dilute sulphuric acid is decomposed by
boiling.
     It
     now remained to prove that by this means        the tin present                               all
as perchloride was precipitated, and that the separation     the tin                                             of

REMARK on ART, LVIII. (of PHIL. MAG. For NoveMBER) BY
  MR. sylvestER, “That the NoN-ExistENCE of REAL Roots
  IN ANALYTIC GEOMETRY CORRESPONDS TO THE REDUCTIO AD
  ABSURDUM of EUCLID.”
   All imaginary results are expressible by a 4-b                                       V-I-H f-c V-T;
and if c-b, we have a real result.     Hence if we try the case of one
of two presumed equal quantities exceeding the other, this is equi
valent to taking b > c : if less, to b <U+2192> c ; in both cases an imaginary
result would follow.    But if the algebraic treatment resulted in b-c,
we should necessarily find                        V-1
                                    disappear, and the presumed equa
lity would really exist as a +f. This being the geometric process
generally followed in the reductio ad absurdum, may perhaps throw
some light on the verification of Mr. Sylvester's important suggestion.

valent to the work spent in effecting the compression, assumed
by Mayer as the foundation for an estimate of the numerical
relation between quantities of heat and mechanical work, and
adopted by Holtzmann, Clausius, and other writers, was made
the subject of an experimental research by Mr. Joulet, and verified
as at least approximately true for air at ordinary atmospheric
temperatures.     A theoretical investigation, founded on a conclu
sion of Carnot'sf,  which requires no modification $ in the dyna
mical theory of heat, also leads to a verification of Mayer's hypo
thesis within limits of accuracy as close as those which can be
attributed to Mr. Joule’s experimental tests.        But the same
investigation establishes the conclusion, that that hypothesis can
not be rigorously true except for one definite temperature within
the range of Regnault's experiments on the pressure and latent
heat of saturated aqueous vapour, unless the density of the vapour
both differs considerably at the temperature 100° Cent, from
what it is usually supposed to be, and for other temperatures
and pressures presents great discrepancies from the gaseous laws.
No experiments, however, which have yet been published on the
density of saturated aqueous vapour are of sufficient accuracy
to admit of an unconditional statement of the indications of
theory regarding the truth of Mayer's hypothesis, which can
not therefore be considered to have been hitherto sufficiently

482      Mr.        J.   P. Joule and Prof. Thomson on the Thermal Effects
tested either experimentally or theoretically.  The experiments
described in the present communication were commenced by the
authors jointly in Manchester last May. The results which have
been already obtained, although they appear to establish beyond
doubt a very considerable discrepancy from Mayer's hypothesis

tory; but as the authors are convinced that, without apparatus
on a much larger scale, and a much more ample source of me
chanical work than has hitherto been available to them, they
could not get as complete and accurate results as are to be
desired, they think it right at present to publish an account
of the progress they have made in the inquiry.

   times the whole of the narrow india-rubber tube, the wooden pin
   cers, and several inches of the wider tube containing the thermo
  meter, were kept below the surface of the bath, and still the cooling
  effect was observed; and this even when hot water, at a tempe
  rature of about 150°F., was used, although in this case the
  observed cooling effect was less than when the temperature of
  the bath was lower.
       As it was considered possible that the cooling effects observed
  in these experiments might be due wholly or partly to the                                                        air

   According to theory”, the cooling effect for a given tempera
ture would be independent of the kind of aperture and of the
copiousness of the stream, and would be simply proportional to
the logarithm of the pressure, if the insulation of the current
against gain or loss of heat from the surrounding matter were
perfect, and if the thermometer be so placed in the issuing stream
as to be quite out of the rapids.       On this account the values of
the cooling effect divided by the logarithm of the pressure were
calculated, and are shown in the last columns of the tables of
results given below. When this was done for the first two series
of experiments, the discrepancies (see columns 5 of the first two
of the tables given below) were found to be so great, and, espe
cially among the results of the different experiments for the
higher temperature of 160°F.,                                     all

   The numbers in the last column of any one of these tables
show, by their discrepancies, how much uncertainty there must
be in the results on account of purely accidental circumstances.
   The following table is arranged, with double argument of tem
perature and of quantity of air passing per second, to show a
comparison of the means of the different series (Series 3 being
divided into two, one consisting of the first five experiments, and
the other of the remaining two).

   The general increase of the numbers from left to right in this
table shows that very much of the cooling effect must be lost on
account of the insufficiency of the current of air. This loss
might possibly be diminished by improving the thermal insula
tion of the current in and after the rapids; but it appears pro
bable that it could be reduced sufficiently to admit of satisfactory
observations being made, only by using a much more copious
current of air than could be obtained with the apparatus hitherto
employed.
   The decrease of the numbers from the upper to the lower
spaces, especially in the one complete vertical column (that under
the argument 5-6), shows that the cooling effect is less to a
remarkable degree for the higher than for the lower temperatures.
Even from 41° to 65° F. the diminution is most sensible; and
at 171° the cooling effect appears to be only about half as much
as at 41°.
   The best results for the different temperatures are probably
those shown under the arguments 8:4 and 11.2, being those
obtained from the most copious currents; but it is probable that
they   all   fall considerably short
the actual temperatures; and we may consider
                                                       of   the true values

   The great irregularities in the last column of the above table
are owing to the difficulty of keeping the bulb of the thermo
meter    in exactly the same place over the orifice.                           The least varia
tion would occasion an immediate and considerable change of
temperature; and when the bulb was removed to only 4 of an
inch above the orifice, the cooling effects were reduced to the
amount observed when the natural pores alone of the leather
were employed.       There can be no doubt but that the reason
why the cooling effects experienced by the thermometer-bulb

                         By Dr. ANDREws%.
    N the last Number of this Journal,     I observe that Dr.Woods,
       referring to some observations of mine at the late meeting
                                                            I
of the British Association in this place, states that had pre
viously conjectured one of the fundamental truths suggested by
his theory, viz. “that decomposition produces as much cold
as the combination of the elements produced heat,” and after
wards claims “by right of prior publication ” the proof of this
law.     Dr. Woods’s first paper on this subject appeared in the
Philosophical Magazine for October 1851. Now in a paper of
mine on the Thermal Changes accompanying Basic Substitutions,
which was published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1844,
and for which the Council of the Royal Society awarded one of
the Royal Medals, the following passage occurs (p.32):-
    “In the preceding observations it has been assumed, that if
the union   of two substances be attended with the evolution of a cer
tain definite quantity of heat, their separation will be attended with
the absorption of the same quantity of heat.       Although this pro
position in the abstract is very probable, it requires to be demon
strated by direct experiment; and it is the more important to
do so, as it will furnish, if true, a means of verifying the accu
racy of our results. The reactions now described enable us to
test it by experiment in one particular set of cases.         In fact, if
we take three bases, such as potash, oxide of copper, and water,
capable of displacing one another in the above order, and if we
measure the changes of temperature produced when the first and
second, first and third, and second and third bases displace one
another, then the change of temperature arising from the first
substitution should be equal to the difference between the changes
of temperature produced by the two latter. A few examples will
illustrate this point.”
    In  a subsequent  paper, which appeared in the Numbers of this
Journal for     May  and June 1848, I revert to the same subject.
After comparing the quantity of heat produced by the precipita
tion of metallic copper by zinc with the quantities produced by
the combination of those metals with oxygen, and with that due
to the substitution of oxide of zinc for oxide of copper, I proceed
to remark “that this comparison assumes the truth of the prin
ciple (which I have in other inquiries endeavoured to illustrate,
and is indeed almost self-evident), that when, in the course of
any chemical reaction, the constituents of a compound are sepa
rated from one another, there is a quantity of heat thereby

the exact size is immaterial to the consideration of the experi

describe many fruitless ones, but I will place first that which I
consider the most important and fundamental.
    1st. On the plate of a good air-pump was placed a silvered
copper plate, such as is ordinarily used for Daguerreotypes, the
polished silver surface being uppermost. A receiver, with a rod
passing through a collar of leathers, was used, and to the lower
extremity of this rod was affixed a steel needle, which could thus
be brought to any required distance from the silver surface; a
vessel containing potassa fusa was suspended in the receiver, and
a bladder of hydrogen gas was attached to a stopcock, another
orifice enabling me to pass atmospheric air into the receiver in
such quantities as might be required 4. A vacuum being made,
hydrogen gas and air were allowed to enter the receiver in very
 small quantities, so as to form an attenuated atmosphere of the
mixed gas: there was no barometer attached to my air-pump,

 but from separate experiments found the most efficient extent
 of rarefaction for my purpose was that indicated by a barometric
 height of from half to three-quarters of an inch of mercury; and
 except where otherwise stated, a similarly attenuated medium
                                of all
 was employed for         the following experiments.
    Two small cells       the nitric acid battery, each plate exposing
4   square inches      surface, were used

 and the discharge from the secondary coil was taken between
 the steel point and the silver plate.      The distance between these
 was generally =0.1              inch, but this may

an excess of hydrogen as compared with the equivalent of oxygen

one volume oxygen mixed with four volumes of hydrogen, and
attenuated by the air-pump as in the previous experiments.
The plate was made positive, and the point was placed success
ively opposite different portions of the silver plate, at distances
of   ºth, ºths, ºths, ºths,          and 3%ths of an inch. The results
are given, as nearly as      I   can copy them, in the accompanying
Plate V. figs. 1 to 5.
    The colour of the central spot was a yellow-green in the centre,
surrounded by a blue-green, then a clear ring of polished silver,
then an outer ring crimson, with a slightly orange tint on the inner
side, and deep purple on the outer; the exterior portion of the spot
was, as far as my eye could judge, of a colour complementary to the
interior of the external ring, and the central portion of the spot of
a colour complementary to the exterior portion of the ring.           The
colours varied with the time, density of gas and other conditions,
but generally showed this complementary tendency. Symptoms
of a faint polished ring were visible beyond the outer ring, and
could be rendered more distinct by breathing on the plate.              As
the distance between the point and the plate was increased, the
colours became fainter, and the rings more diffuse, and beyond
the distance I have given nearly lost their defined character;
but the first three distances, or those of ºth, ºths, and ºths
 of an inch, gave very beautifully defined rings.             The lumi
 nous   appearance  on the needle in these       experiments    extended
 from three-fourths of an inch to an inch from the point.             Fre
 quently a small polished speck was visible, exactly opposite the
 point of the needle. See fig. 6. When the plate was made ne
 gative, the other conditions being the same, a polished space
 appeared opposite the point of the needle, surrounded by a dusky
 and ill-defined areola;         its
                                colour, when regarded from           point    a
 opposite the incident light, was brown tinged with purple; and

hydrogen, sometimes a little more oxygen or air, to alter slightly
the state of attenuation in the gas, &c.
   The necessarily varying condition of the battery, and the state
of the contact breaker, slight impurities in the gases or on the
surface of the plates would be quite sufficient to account for these
irregularities.    I mention them for the guidance of any one who
may wish to repeat the experiments; a very little practice will
enable any electrician to have the results at his command. When
there is too great a proportion of air or oxygen, oxidation takes
place at both poles; when too much hydrogen, reduction takes
place at both ; and to effect oxidation or reduction by reversing
the direction of the discharge, an intermediate condition is requi
site; so if the gas be not sufficiently attenuated, the oxidation is
too rapid, and the plate too much corroded to bring out the
effects clearly ; if too much attenuated, too long a time is required,
and the effect is feeble and indistinct.

      Mr. Grove   on the Electro-chemical       Polarity of Gases.            509
   Faraday observes, Experimental Researches, 1164, “In an
electrolyte induction is the first state, and decomposition the
second.”                                            I
            My present experiments show, believe, that in induc
tion across gaseous dielectrics there is a commencement, so to
speak, of decomposition, a polar arrangement not merely of the
molecules,   irrespective   of their chemical characters, but a che
mical alternation of their forces, the electro-negative element
being determined or directed, though not travelling in one direc
tion, and the electro-positive in the opposite direction.
   This arrangement is only evidenced at present, as it is in
electrolysis, by the action at the polar extremities or termini of
the dielectric; possibly future researches may show, by the
action of polarized light, by magnetism or some other means of
analysis, that the polarity extends, as we theoretically believe it
does, through the whole intervening matter.
   In the Experiment No. 5 with oxygen and excess of nitrogen,
reduction takes place by the effect of negative electricity and
heat, at least there seems every reason from analogy to believe
that the effect of the nitrogen is only negative, protecting the
plate from oxygen, or at furthest catalytic, aiding the reduction
as sulphuric acid aids the electrolysis of water.        Upon the state
of association of the    gases  in what is generally   called mixture,          I
venture an     opinion  with the greatest diffidence.                 I
                                                             have always
inclined to the opinion that the difference between physical ad
mixture, as it is termed, of gases and chemical union, is one of
degree, and the views of Dalton ever presented to my mind grave
difficulties*.    My present results seem to me in favour of the
chemical    view,  as otherwise we can scarcely imagine electricity
as  effecting  in the instances given a merely physical separation;
it may indeed be said that there is composition and decomposition
produced by the same discharge; but this is very difficult to
conceive, and can hardly apply to the cases of oxygen with
nitrogen and of carbonic oxide.
   In the experiments I have detailed, the flame or visible effect
of the electric discharge coincided with the chemical effect; when
the plate was positive, a small globule of flame of a purple colour
was visible on the part of the plate attacked, and a bluish flame
extended over an inch or more of the needle.            When the plate
was negative, a wider and less-defined disc of blue flame extended
over the part of the plate opposed to the positive point, like a
splash of liquid thrown upon          it,
                                       and    pencil
                                                a         light appeared
                                                                of
 on the  point.    Sometimes,    but not   always,  this flame avoided
the oxidated portion, probably from                 its
                                                   inferior conducting
power; and when this was the case, reduction took place                       in
                                                                              a

experiments             on   the subject last discussed.    Assuming that the

alternations of oxidation and reduction were produced by inter
ference in consequence of the discharge proceeding from suc
cessive points of the terminal or terminals, a difference of effect
might be anticipated if the electricity passed from a point only,
and not from a line as was the case in Experiment 13.           I there
fore sealed a platinum wire ºth of an inch in diameter into a
piece of glass tubing, and then ground the extremity to a flat
surface, so that the section only of the wire was exposed; this
wire was placed opposite, and at 0:07 of an inch distance from
the polished silver plate, in a mixture of one volume of oxygen
with five volumes of hydrogen attenuated until the barometer
stood at half an inch; discharges from the secondary coil were
then passed, the plate being positive, and a round dark spot of
oxide formed represented at fig. 8; the platinum sealed in glass
was then removed and the steel needle substituted for           all else,                 it,
viz.  plate, gas, barometer   height, &c.  being the same    the system              :
 of rings represented       fig.at was now9  produced.
   Another experiment was made, directed            the same point:   to                                a
wire      of
          copper   0.04 inch   diameter, and thread       glass  a   the        of                 of

same diameter were attached           sealing-wax     their extremities    at

  silver   plate, being insulated from the silver       the wax inter       by
posed       at   the extremities.         The gaseous mixture and barometric
height being the same             the last experiment, and the silver
                                     as   in
plate made positive, when the platinum wire sealed                glass was           in
brought near the plate, and the discharges passed, spot similar                      a
to  fig.    was formed; but when the coated point
            8                                                     platinum            of

                                                            at        figure                   a
consisting        of
                 two separated semicircles was     formed,    having   spots
in  the bisection          of
                        the chords,       shown      fig. 10, the portion
                                                       as            at

polished silver. With the glass thread the effect was the same,
but produced with greater difficulty and not             well defined.     so

I  have invariably produced the alternately polished and oxidated
rings from the bare wire, and have not procured them from the
coated wire, except           very slight degree, and under certain
                                   to
circumstances, which,           as a                            follows:—

                                  of
   2nd. When the experiment was long continued,                   when the            or
coated platinum wire had been used for previous experiments,                                            a
set    ofrings, not consisting                  of

       Mr. Grove            on the Electro-chemical                    Polarity of Gases.                     513
polished rings, but of annuli of different degrees of oxidation,
were formed.
   When the experiment               is continued for some time, a dark
deposit is formed on the glass around the extremity of the pla
timum wire, giving an extended conducting surface; and this
may be the reason why such rings are formed, though these
rings, in        all
                 the cases which          have observed, differ broadly from
                                                I
the   rings   formed             by

posed spaces          perfectly bright silver; and
                           of                                      the cases the
                                                                               in       all
difference        effect produced
                  of                                  by
                                            the coated and the bare wire                                          is
very marked;                in    by
                               far the greater number               experiments,        of
when     proper   precautions      are  taken,   not the   slightest   formation
of  rings takes place with the coated wire; with the bare wire,                 the                          in
gaseous mixture last mentioned,               have  always

    Thus there are three systems                 rings which may
                                                             of            formed                   be
 by  the discharge.        First, rings such         those seen     the ordinary

cases        thin plates; these
            of                            have only observed with olefiant

they may              be
                   produced.        Secondly, rings formed            the super               by
position         of
                layers      oxides, possibly arising from the fact that

   When the positive terminal is coated and                                the negative one bare, the dark
space appears on the point of the bare wire,                               the wire itself being surrounded
by a lambent flame; but with the converse                                    arrangement there is no such
dark space. All this is much in favour of                                   interference taking place, the
coincidence of positive and negative phases                                of the discharge producing at
certain points mutual neutralization.

strictly speaking not colours, he mentions four, namely yellow,
green, blue, and red.          The primitive colours red, yellow, and
blue, afterwards generally recognized, have been made the basis
of an experiment of Waller described in the Philosophical Trans
actions for 1686, hence before the time of Newton’s investigations
on the decomposition of white light by the prism, and when no
other method of compounding colours save that of mixing the
colouring matters was known.            In later attempts to classify the
natural colours according to their composition by the three pri
mitive ones above mentioned, Castell, the astronomer Mayer,
Lambert, Hay, and Forbesº, have                taken       basis     their en

number probably because            the analogy which
                                              of              sought between             he

suggested the divisions                  of

     M. H. Helmholtz          on the    Theory      of   Compound Colours.                     521
was compared by Newton to the intervals of the scale.  Besides
this he must have been content with very incomplete apparatus,
and could therefore make but few observations on the artificial
union of two or more prismatic colours; the results of these
seemed, on the whole, to correspond with those obtained from the
mixture of coloured substances.              Besides these experiments he
made others on the mixture of coloured powders.
    Newton always obtained his spectra from sunlight, and did
not apply the methods necessary for the complete separation of
the differently coloured rays; hence it is that he did not ob
serve the lines of Fraunhofer in the spectrum.                   Wollaston*
was the first to obtain a spectrum so pure as to permit of a few
of these lines being seen in              Through
                                        it.            very good flint-glass

prism    he looked with his naked        eye       fine slit, through which
                                                    at
                                                    a
diffused daylight entered, and saw, what indeed under these cir
cumstances may always              be
                                    observed, four well-defined coloured
bands   in    the   spectrum      red,
                                   ;     yellow-green, blue, and violet.
The transitions from reddish         orange    through orange and yellow
into green-yellow, from green into blue, and from blue into
violet, are      so
                  speedy      the flint-glass spectrum, that without the
                              in
help   ofa   magnifying telescope they entirely escape the eye.                                     In
this case the lines         and

the presence          the stronger red and green,
                      of                                       that these two

colours appear immediately contiguous.                  Wollaston therefore
assumes four primitive colours; red, green, blue, and violet.
    Thomas Young accepted Wollaston’s description                    the spec  of
trum, and altered            correspond with
                            to                        his  theory

 red, green, and violet; this necessitates the belief that                 was             he
 aware  of  the fact that from prismatic red and green yellow ma
 be  obtained, and from prismatic green and violet blue. The

      I
     have been equally unsuccessful with Forbes in my efforts to
find among Newton's followers, up to the latest period, experi
ments on the mixture of the single prismatic colours.        It appears
as if the question was regarded as completely exhausted by the
experiments with the mixed powders.         Even the divergent results
given by the rotating disk were insufficient to convince experi
menters that difficulties lay concealed here.

one of the two mixed colours remains standing; or a second
small prism is introduced between the eye and the orifice; and
thus, instead of a single bright spot in the eye-glass of the tele

certain determination of mixed colours which               approach     very

from these colours a clear pure white. If the investigation were
conducted with instruments more complete than those applied
by me, and which would permit of the formation of a larger field
of compound colours, the limits of those rays which produce
white would probably be estimated with greater accuracy, inas
much as the comparison of the hues of large surfaces is capable
of being effected with much more ease and sharpness.
   By the rays which produce white, the whole width of the spec
trum is divided into three sections.   The first of these corre
sponds to the red, and, if we compare the ratio of the luminous
vibrations with those of sonorous waves, answers to about the                                                in
terval of a small third, the middle green section to a great third, the
third and violet section being somewhat smaller than a small
third. Colours of the first and second sections combine to tones
of yellow, with transitions into red, flesh-colour, white, and green;
those of the second and third combine to blue, with transitions
into green, white, and violet; those of the first and third com
bine to purple-red, with transitions into flesh-colours, rose, and
violet.
    With respect to the combination of three simple colours, we
 may conclude that white can only be the result when rays from
the three different sections of the spectrum are suitably united.
 At least it cannot be supposed, although                     possible combi     all

made to balance each other that pure white is procured.   Thus
we obtain white from red, green, and violet, which may be com
bined to three pairs of complementary colours; namely,
            Simple red and compound dull blue-green.
            Simple green and compound purple-red.
            Simple violet and compound dull yellow.
   It is a striking fact, that, while the complementary colours of
simple red and violet are only distinguished from certain tones
of the spectrum by their less saturated appearance, the former
nevertheless give, with simple red and violet, white, the latter
not.
    Newton’s few observations on the combinations of every two
prismatic colours coincide with my results.        He finds that the
primitive colours can be obtained by the combination of the
neighbouring ones at both sides of the former; for example,
orange can be formed from red and yellow; yellow, from orange
and green-yellow; green, from green-yellow and sea-green, and
also, but not so good, from yellow and blue (cyaneum); blue,
from sea-green and indigo.        He has also formed from red and
violet, purple-red.     White he could only obtain from the three
colours, red, violet, and green; and in order to render the ex
periment successful, he even recommended the application of
spectra whose colours were not completely separated.             In this
case more than three single colours are mixed together.
    It will, on the contrary, be observed, that my results on the
action of prismatic colours differ materially from those obtained
by the mixing of colouring substances.      In particular, that yellow
and blue do not furnish        green, but at most a weak greenish
white, contradicts in the most decided manner the experience of
all  painters during the last thousand years. The reason        the con  of

rior surfaces of the uppermost layer of powder-particles, but also
that reflected from the second, third, fourth, &c. Of light per
pendicularly incident, a single glass plate reflects only ºr, two
such plates only 13, very many plates almost the whole.           We
can conclude from this, that of the light which falls upon the
fine white powdered glass, the smallest portion only is reflected
from the uppermost particles, a much greater portion being
reflected by those beneath.      This must also be the case with
coloured powders, at least with those simple rays whose colour
they bear, and which are permitted to pass without absorption;
the greater portion of light of this kind comes from the deeper
layers, having traversed in their passage a number of powdered
particles.
    Let us consider what will be the case when we mix together
powders of different colours, for example, yellow and blue. The
blue particles which                          lie
                           upon the surface will give blue light, the
yellow which      upon the surface will give yellow light; both toge

otherwise, however, with the light which returns from greater
 depths. This must pass through yellow and blue particles, and
 hence from      distance below the surface such light only will
                           a
 return     can penetrate both the yellow particles and the blue

the phaenomena, so far as am able to see, completely; showing
that the mixture of the substances and the combination of their
colours are two processes altogether distinct, and hence that the
results obtained from the former furnish no conclusion regarding
the latter. Only when we have to deal with colours which stand
but slightly separated from each other in the spectrum does the
composition of the coloured light give nearly the same results as
the mixture of the pigments, for then the compound colour is
similar to the tones of the spectrum which             between both the      lie
simple ones.
   There are, however, two other methods           combining the light   of
proceeding from pigments, which yield results altogether              har                               in

 fixed at  right angles to the table at about the distance of distinct
 vision.    The observer looks obliquely through the plate down
 wards towards the table, and places the wafers in a position
 which is suitable for the combination of their colours. The
 nearer both are brought to the imaginary intersection of the
 plane of the table with the glass plate, the more obliquely will
 the rays fall upon the plate, the fewer will pass through, and
 the greater will be the number reflected; so that, in this case,
 the colour of the reflected light will be predominant. Conversely,
 the colour of the transmitted light will be predominant when the
wafers are removed to a distance from the line of intersection;
and in this way it is possible to alter the relative intensities of
the combining colours in any required degree.          In this experi
ment both wafers are placed upon a black ground+; or if whitish
combinations of colour be required, which it is necessary to com
pare with pure white, one of the wafers (the brightest is best)
is placed upon a white, the other upon a dark ground. Observed
through the glass plate, the wafer appears in the compounded
colour upon a white ground.         It is manifest that in this way
the colours of all coloured surfaces whatever, as also those of
coloured glasses, may be combined.
    Colours thus composed are distinguished by their brightness
and clearness from those obtained by the mixture of the colour
ing matters; they do not always agree with the latter, but, on
the contrary, yield the same results as those obtained when the
prismatic colours are united. Blue and yellow, in particular, do
not give green, but white. As the representative of the yellow,
I   made use of paper disks which         I had washed with bright
chrome-yellow or gamboge.         Of blue   colouring matters laid on
disks in the same manner, a beautiful sky-blue cobalt gave, with
both kinds of yellow, pure white; artificial ultramarine, reddish
white; and bright Prussian blue, a weak greenish white. Cin
nabar combined with blue gives rose-colour; the same red colour
combined with green gives yellow, &c. In short, these experi
ments prove, that not only the simple coloured rays of the spec
trum have other laws of action than those hitherto generally
assumed, but that quite similar laws apply to the combination of
the colours of pigments. It does not appear to me doubtful that
these new laws will supersede the old ones which were based upon
the mixture of the colouring substances.
    It is best, however, to commence with the simple colours of

    M. H.    Helmholtz on the Theory    of  Compound Colours.        533
choose the three simple ones which admit of the least perfect
imitation, namely red, green, and violet: we should then obtain
a yellow and blue, which, when compared with the colours of
our pigments, would appear saturated, but which would not bear
comparison with the yellow and blue of the spectrum. These
are the three which Thomas Young proposed as the three primi
tive colours. Red, green, and blue would not answer so well;
for were these three chosen, the mixed violet would appear worse
than the mixed blue of the former three. The three primitive
colours commonly chosen are altogether insufficient, because from
them green can never be obtained.
    According to the above we must also abandon the theory of T
three primitive colours, which, according to Thomas Young, are
three fundamental qualities of sensation.          If the sensation of
yellow by the yellow rays of the spectrum were due to the fact
that by them the sensations of red and green were simultaneously
 excited, and both working together produced yellow, exactly the
 same sensation must be excited by the simultaneous action of
the red and green rays; nevertheless by the latter we can never
 obtain so bright and vivid a yellow as that produced by the yellow
 rays. The same remarks apply to blue, which would be formed
 from the mixture of green and violet; and to violet, which would
 be formed from the mixture of blue and red. To retain in this
 sense the theory of primitive colours, five such, at least, must be
 assumed.     On the contrary, to represent and classify the dull
 and comparatively impure colours of natural bodies, in the sense
 of Lambert and Forbes, three primitive colours would be quite
 sufficient.   But, for a sure and a scientific classification, it would
 be necessary to apply a method of combining colours different
 from the mixing of pigments.
    By the union of every two simple colours we are met by two
 new impressions, namely white and purple-red, with their de
 grees of transition into the simple colours before named.          The
 purple-red belongs to the saturated colours which cannot be
 otherwise obtained than from the extreme red and violet, with
 out a loss of brightness. White, on the contrary, can be obtained
 in an infinity of ways, without the eye being able to distinguish
 one white from the other. We obtain it for example from simple
yellow and blue, from simple red, green, and violet, or from
 these five simple colours taken together; and besides these, from
several more complicated combinations.         In contrast with colours
it is therefore regarded as indifferent light. The remaining
combinations of every two simple colours appear to the eye as
transitions of the simple colours and purple into white; but in
further combinations, as above remarked, they behave in a

manner essentially different from the colours of the spectrum
when the latter are weakened by the addition of white light.
   In conclusion I give the following small table; it furnishes
a general view of the combinations of every two colours, and in
 itsconstruction five colours are assumed,       the union    which     by                  of

learning and ability displayed by him in the adoption of methods for
the construction of his tables. After exhibiting various modifications
of the function     a”", first applied by Mr. Gompertz to these investi
gations,   Mr. Farren makes       use of the calculus of finite differences
for the purposes of interpolation till the age of seventy-one.            After
that age, because “the admissions are too few to admit of the sup
position that the same mixed generic law will continue to prevail,”
                                                r"—l
he has recourse to the formula X'        l-A'l     — l’
                                                         by  means   of which,
and the theory of equations of n dimensions, the remainder of the
table is interpolated.
    Lastly, the means are afforded of tracing, from the original data,
the several values made use of; so that the whole series of opera
tions may be followed, and the connexion between the first and last
values easily confirmed.        As Mr. Farren wisely observes, “all mo
dern publications on these subjects must principally depend, for
even ordinary acceptance, upon the attention paid to such details;”
nothing, he may be assured, was better calculated to secure for his
labours the confidence they so evidently deserve.            He is quite right,
we think, when he says that tables of mortality solely depending for
their adoption on the authority of the authors framing them, will
 eventually be discarded.
Brief Astronomical Tables for       the Erpeditious     Calculation of Eclipses
    in all ages.   By  W.   DREw SNookE.          S. Highley and Son, Fleet
     Street.
    These tables are constructed with the view to enable the histo
 rical student to verify dates by the calculation of eclipses named
 in history.     For this purpose strict mathematical accuracy may
 be   dispensed   with ; and the smaller equations which enter into
 the determination of the times of full and new moon, and the rela
 tive position of the three bodies, may with more or less risk of error
 be omitted from the calculation.          The tables are well arranged, and
 the rules for   using  them   clearly  expressed   and exemplified.
     The author   appears   to handle his    subject  with familiarity; and if
 the correctness of the tables       may   be relied upon,   and the time and
 other circumstances of the phaenomena to which they are applicable
 is capable of being educed from them with that degree of accuracy
 which the author affirms, we think his little book may be found
 useful in supplying a desideratum which is likely to have been felt
 by many of the class of students for whose use it is intended.

Wheal Laity lodes; and for 10 fathoms above and 20 fathoms below,

but immediately when the Wheal Comfort lode and the “Carbona”
separate in descending, each taking its own downward course, the
Iode becomes unproductive, and so also remains as far southward
as it has yet been traced.
   At the northern contact of the Wheal Comfort lode and the “Car
bona" there is a rich mass of quartz, felspar, schorl, and tin-ore, at
least 15 feet in width for about 5 fathoms in length: both south
ward of and below this spot the lode preserves     usual direction and         its
dip;    but the “Carbona" southward bears about                east             5°

    Everywhere eastward the Wheal Laity lode is but a single vein,
of about a foot and a half wide, and composed of quartz, earthy
brown iron-ore, greenish, and in some places brick-red felspar, a
little tin-ore, together with some vitreous copper-ore and iron pyrites.
Westward, however, it consists of at least two separate veins, called
for distinction sake the Wheal Laity north and south lodes; and some
times there is also a third vein. At one spot the third vein is simply
crystallized  felspar, and the axes of the crystals are parallel to each
other, but      across the vein;
                      lie            other parts   in   slightly productive    itis

   (1.) The Wheal Laity and the Wheal Comfort lodes cross each
other; still           at
                some levels there     no evidence       show that either
                                                        is                           to

                                         at
intersects, but also heaves the Wheal Laity lode.           not the least                It   is
remarkable circumstance attending this intersection that the Wheal
Laity lode      single vein everywhere eastward
                      is
                       a                             the Wheal Comfort              of

                             their contact      divided into two, andit   is                                in
some places even into three distinct and separate veins.
   (2.) All these veins are intersected                               by
                                              the Cross-course, and all
are heaved       it; the two larger (the Wheal Laity north and the
                        by
Wheal Laity south lodes)       general from   in       fathoms; the dis    10   to   15

and does not exceed six fathoms and     half.                   a
   Again, notwithstanding the Wheal Comfort lode and the Cross
course have opposite inclinations, they respectively heave the Wheal
Laity lodes            in    the same direction.
      At   a   depth        of 110 fathoms, where the Wheal Laity north lode                                is

for some distance unproductive, whilst the Wheal Laity south lode is
rich in tin-ore on both sides of the Cross-course, and for some fathoms
both  above and below the gallery (level), the Cross-course consists
of a rich vein of tin-ore for the whole interval (five fathoms) between
the eastern portions of the two lodes, as well as of a fine mass of the
same ore at its contact with the western part of the Wheal Laity
south lode.
   (3.) At 130 fathoms deep the Wheal Laity south lode is also
heaved, but in an opposite direction, by a vein of granitic clay (the
Flucan). This flucan is not prolonged to either of the other Wheal
Laity veins; nor, indeed, does it reach any other gallery (level) even
on the same lode.
   (4.) The Wheal Comfort lode and the Cross-course have the
same direction, but, as already observed, opposite inclinations; and
are so situated that they come into contact on the line of their dips
at about 130 fathoms deep. From the point where they first touch
each other they descend perpendicularly side by side for about three
fathoms, each keeping the same relative position it had previously
when separate (viz. the Cross-course on the west, and the Wheal
Comfort lode on the east). At length, however, the lode cuts through
the Cross-course.    After this intersection, though they have changed
sides, and their relative position is reversed, they still proceed
together, but now take the line of the lode's previous underlie for
several fathoms. When they separate, the lode preserves its dip;
but the Cross-course, though it resumes the previous direction of
its inclination, dips eastward far more rapidly than before. It may,
indeed, be generally observed, that a vein which has been displaced
by another, whether the intersection be horizontal or vertical, makes
(if I may be permitted the expression) an effort to resume original                        its
course.

Comfort lode and the Cross-course during their union,           each                       by         of
them when separate; the union, however, has little            influence       or     no
on the extent of the heave.

     ON THE NATURE AND NAME OF OZONE.                                           BY C. F. SchöNBEIN.
      MM. Ed. Becquerel and Fremy” have recently confirmed the ob
   servation, already made by others, that ozone may be produced in
   the purest possible oxygen when this is subjected to the influence
   of electrical discharges. These physicists are on this account of
   opinion that ozone is to be regarded as allotropic oxygen, and pro
  pose to call it “Orygène électrisé.”             I consider this term inappro
  priate, and upon the following grounds:—
      1. Oxygen may be ozonized not only by electricity, but also by
  ponderable substances, as for instance phosphorus, or in other words,
  may be so influenced that it will effect oxidations even at ordinary
  temperature which would not otherwise take place.                   According to
  my opinion there is no disengagement of electricity during the
  modification of oxygen by means of phosphorus, the oxygenization
  of turpentine, &c., whence it appears to me to follow that the forma
  tion of ozone, through chemical action, is unconnected with electri
  cal action, at least directly.         I have recently endeavoured to show
  that under suitable circumstances 1000 grims. of phosphorus con
  vert 1720 grms. of oxygen into ozone, and indeed with tolerable
  rapidity. In order to ozonize this quantity of oxygen by means of
  electrical discharges, the electricity of a thunder-storm would pro
 bably be necessary; for even the most powerful discharges which
 we are able to pass through oxygen or air artificially, produce com
 paratively but an extremely small amount of ozone.                     therefore,        If,                a
 disengagement           electricity took place during the contact
                                of                                             phos                 of
 phorus with oxygen               atmospheric air, and
                                           or                 this electricity was
                                                                                if
 the cause of the formation of the ozone which occurs under these
 circumstances, we might expect                            to
                                             observe the most violent electrical
 phaenomena,              flask where large quantities
                           in   a                                 ozone were pro     of
 duced under the influence            phosphorus. But we are not acquainted
                                                 of
 with anything          the kind; the production
                             of                             ozone goes     ofquietly             on
 and noiselessly, and              signs   no              of
                                              electrical disturbance can        any                    in
 way        be
            detected. Consequently,             ozone can   if  formed from com   be
mon oxygen without the aid                electricity,of  appears      me that the
                                                                           it             to
 term    “Orygène     électrisé"       altogetheris  inappropriate,   and     might                 it

is merely allotropic oxygen, there cannot be any danger of errone
ous impressions being formed as to the nature of the body, from the
use of the name hitherto employed, to which I shall therefore
adhere until a better one than that proposed by these gentlemen is
found.     Although the experiments of MM. Becquerel and Fremy
have not taught us anything essentially new, still some of their
statements have a peculiar interest; for instance, the circumstance
that ozone is produced even in a closed glass tube, filled with
oxygen, when electrical discharges are allowed to strike upon its
exterior. The production of ozone is here evidently the result of an
electrical induction in the oxygen from the exterior and through the
glass.     A similar induction takes place on a large scale on the
occasion of every flash of lightning, a very striking instance of
which I had once an opportunity of observing. Some years since a
small chapel on the Rhine-bridge at Basle was struck by lightning.
All the rooms in my house, which is about a hundred paces distant,
 were filled with a strong odour of ozone at the moment of discharge,
 and the same was the case in all the neighbouring houses, so that
 the inhabitants of each imagined that their own dwelling had been
 struck by the lightning. It is also deserving of especial notice, that
 the smell of ozone was perceived in rooms which were closed, as
 well as in those which were in connexion with the exterior atmo
sphere.   This appeared to me to prove satisfactorily that the ozone
was not carried into these houses by currents of air from the place of
the discharge, but was actually produced in them by induction, and
I have no reason now to consider that this view was incorrect;                      in
deed it is precisely the same fact upon a large scale which the
French physicists have observed on a small one.
   M. de la Rive, in speaking of the investigations of MM. Bec
querel and Fremy, puts forward a new hypothesis for the explana
tion of the alteration effected in oxygen by means of electricity, &c.
He is of opinion that in ordinary oxygen the atoms are not separate,
but combined in groups forming molecules.        Since, in the chemical
combination of bodies, the atoms unite in single pairs, the cohesion
of the atoms forming a molecule of oxygen would oppose their che
mical combination with the atoms of other substances, and thus
account for the chemical inactivity which oxygen manifests under
ordinary circumstances towards other bodies. He regards phospho
rus, electricity, &c. as possessing the power of breaking up the
molecules of oxygen into separate atoms, on account of which its
chemical activity is increased, and it is rendered capable of oxidizing
bodies at the ordinary temperature.
   According to this view, ozone must be considered as atomic and
oxygen as molecular oxygen.       However comprehensible this hypo
thesis  may  be, I cannot avoid some hesitation in giving my assent
to it.
      1.   We must, if we adopt         it,
                                    regard ordinary oxygen       body     as   a
which      is  the same time both solid and fluid. The molecules must
                at
 be   regarded     solid, inasmuch
                     as                they are supposed
                                              as               formedto   be

by the strong cohesion of individual atoms. But as ordinary oxygen
is gaseous, the hypothesis in question must also assume that each
separate molecule acts repulsively upon similar molecules. It might
therefore reasonably be asked, why do the oxygen molecules repel
each other, while the atoms constituting such molecules mutually
attract? When 10, 100, 1000 atoms of oxygen unite together form
ing one molecule, why does not each such number of atoms combine
to form a larger solid body ? Why is the oxygen gaseous
    2. Ozone remains unaltered in the cold; by heat it is converted
into ordinary oxygen, in which condition it remains after cooling.
M. de la Rive must therefore explain this change by assuming that
oxygen, consisting of separate atoms (ozone), again assumes a mole
cular state when its temperature is raised; in fact, that heat faci
litates the cohesion of the oxygen atoms, an action the opposite of
that which is generally ascribed to this agent.
    3. Ozone possesses smell, while ordinary oxygen does not; the
former is a violent poison, the latter an indispensably necessary sup
porter of animal existence. That these great differences in the phy
 siological action of oxygen and ozone should be owing merely to a
 different state of mechanical aggregation of the elementary atoms,
 appears to me very difficult to imagine.
    4. It is known that by chemical union with certain bodies oxygen
 acquires the same oxidizing properties as it acquires when free
 under the influence of electricity or contact with phosphorus.          For
 example, when one equivalent of nitric oxide (NO”) combines with
 two equivalents of oxygen gas, the latter enter into a condition of
 chemical activity precisely similar to that which ozone possesses.
 It would be difficult to explain how passive oxygen had in this case
 been converted into action, according to the hypothesis of M. de la
 Rive. Probably we must assume that NO" breaks up the molecules
 of ordinary oxygen gas, entering into combination with            and con              it,
 vertsit  into the ozonized or atomic condition.
     Some years since, Mr. Hunt put forward           hypothesis  an     the                  la as
 nature of  ozone,  which    precisely
                                is     the opposite     that    De to  Rive;       of            to

             ON    THE QUANTITATIVE DETERMINATION OF OZONE.
                            BY C. F. SCHöNBEIN.
    Since ozone combines even in the cold with silver forming per
oxide, while ordinary oxygen behaves indifferently towards this
metal, I have endeavoured to determine the quantity of ozone in a
given volume of air by means of the peroxide of silver formed.
     If,for example, 60 litres           artificially ozonized air afforded 100

strip of moist iodide of potassium paper into the vessel, and if this is
coloured, add more solution of indigo until the decolorization is
complete, when the quantity of solution employed gives the amount
of ozone in the gas.
    When, for example, 250 grims. of the test-solution are decolorized,
the weight of ozone causing this effect would be 250+-10=25 mil
ligrims., in which amount there is no allowance for the quantity of
air displaced by the 250 grms. of solution.        If the volume of the
tested gas reduced to 32° and 76 centim. bar. amounts to 30 litres,
and the weight of ozone in it to 30 milligrms., this air contains This
ozone, since under these conditions a litre of air weighs 1298 mil
 ligrms, and in this quantity of air there is 1 milligrm. ozone.
    My recent experiments have proved that atmospheric air may be
ozonized to the extent of Tºrº by means of phosphorus; and did not
ozone act so energetically upon phosphorus, a much higher degree
of ozonization might be attained. At this point, however, the pro
duction and consumption of this substance appear to be equal, and
ignition of the phosphorus takes place in consequence of the rapid
oxidation.
    I have already often pointed out the great similarity between the
 effects produced by chlorine and ozone. One instance of this is the
 fact that like chlorine it combines with phosphorus at ordinary tem
 peratures.    There can therefore be no doubt that this body would
 immediately take fire in pure ozone gas, as in chlorine, even in the
 cold.
    As the above-mentioned test-solution of indigo is very dark blue,
 it may be very greatly diluted, and still appear deeply coloured.
 I therefore employ two more dilute solutions of such a strength,
 that 10 grms. of one is decolorized by 1-10 milligrim., and 10 grims.
 of the other by 1' 100 milligrm. of oxygen. By this means it is evi
 dent that even very small fractions of a milligrm. of ozone may be
 detected and estimated.
     With this very delicate reagent I have found that ozone diluted with
 500,000 times its volume of atmospheric air may still be recognised
 by   itssmell, sufficiently proving that the pure ozone must have                        a
 most intense odour.—Ibid.

glass bell into the interior of the porous cylinder, where it terminated
in a plate of platinum or copper.         Outside the porous cylinder
another plate of platinum was placed, and connected with the posi
tive pole of the battery.    The whole stood in a large glass vessel,
which, as well as the interior porous cylinder, was filled with water.
The intensity of the current was measured by a galvanometer.           As
soon as the circuit was closed, the liquid rose in the porous cylinder,
and flowed out from the horizontal tube into a weighed vessel. The
results obtained by means of this apparatus were as follows:—
     1. The quantity of fluid which flows out in equal times is directly
 proportional to the intensity of the current.
     2. Under otherwise equal conditions, the quantities of fluid flowing
 out are independent of the magnitude of the conducting porous
 surface.
     To avoid any uncertainty arising from the laws of the flow of
 liquids through small orifices, Wiedemann measured the intensity of
 the mechanical action of the current by determining the height of a
 column of mercury which would hold the transferring force in equi
 librium. For this purpose a graduated tube or manometer filled
 with mercury was attached to the extremity of the horizontal tube
 above mentioned.      With different currents and porous surfaces of
  different extent, the mercury in the manometer rose to different
  heights.
                       :-
             By the measurements of these heights, the following results
  were obtained
   3. The height to which a galvanic current causes a fluid to rise is
directly proportional to the intensity of the current, and inversely
proportional       to the extent of the free porous surface.
   The mechanical action of a galvanic current may also be referred
to    its
      simplest principles                 by
                            the following proposition
