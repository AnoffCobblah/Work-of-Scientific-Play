  !.  A Synopsis of the principal Elements of Astronomy; de
     duced from M. Laplace's Exposition du Systdme du
     Monde.     Communicated by Francis Baily, Esq.
 T he     following paper possesses no further merit than
 as being a faithful abstract of the principles and facts given
 by M. Laplace in his Exposition du Systeme du Monde.
 It is taken from the third edition of that work (1608),
 wherein the author has given the elements of the planets iii
 a more correct manner than in either of the preceding edi
 tions; and wherein he has revised and amended all his for
 mer calculations by more recent and exact observations.
     The arrangement of the present memoir is somewhat
 new : but many persons have frequently found the want of
 a manual of this kind, where all the different facts, relative
 to astronomy, might be brought under their respective
 heads, without the necessity of turning to a variety of
 works for information.       Much time is often lost in a re
 search of that kind, which it is the object of the present
 abstract to prevent.
     In the original work, the author has universally adopted
 the decimal division of the day, and of the quadrant.     This
 method is here preserved in the Tables of the Elements of
 the Planets (page 6) : but, in the subsequent parts, the
 common sexagesimal notation is adopted, as being more
 easily understood in this country.
     Some other facts, not mentioned by M. Laplace, are in
 serted in this tract, in order to enlarge the view of the sub
ject : but these passages are always kept separate, by being
 inclosed within brackets.
     Vol. 3J). No. 165. Jan. 1818.            A2            The

4                        A   Synopsis   of the principal
                                     The Sun.
    The Sun, which is        the source of light and heat to otif
system,       is the most considerable of all the heavenly bodies j
and governs all the planetary motions.
   Its diameter is 111*454 times the mean diameter of the
Earth : whence its volume is 1384472 times greater than
that of the Earth : but its mass is only 337086 times greater.
Whence we conclude that its density is -j-.^j^-, or about
that of our globe.
   It is surrounded by an atmosphere: and it is oftentimes
covered with spots.    Some of these spots have been ob
served so large as to exceed the Earth 4 or 5 times in mag
nitude.
   The observation of these spots shows that the Sun moves
on its axis, which is nearly perpendicular to the ecliptic:
and the duration of an entire sidereal rotation of the Sun
is about 255 days.
   Whence we conclude that the Sun is flattened at the
poles.
    The solar equator           is inclined 7° 30'      to the     plane of the
ecliptic.
   A body, which weighs one pound at the surface of
the Earth, would, if removed to the surface of the Sun,
weigh 27*933 pounds.          And bodies would fall there with
a velocity of 334*65 feet          the first second of time.
                                        iii
   The Sun, together with the planets, moves round the
common centre of gravity of the system               which centre
                                                             :                is
  early  in  the  centre of the Sun.
   This motion changes into epicycloids the ellipses of the
planets and comets, which revolve round the Sun.
   The Sun appears to have particular motion, which car
                                         a
ries our system towards the constellation of Hercules.
   The apparent diameter of the Sun, as seen from the Earth,
undergoes       periodical variation.

   The nnmber of planets belonging to our system is eleven.
Six of these have been known and recognised from time
immemorial: namely, Mercury, Venus, the Earth, Mars,
Jupiter, and,Saturn.      But the remaining five, which are
not visible to the naked eye, have lately been discovered by
the help of the telescope ; and are therefore called telescopic
planets : namely,
   Uranus, discovered by Dr. Herschel, March 13, 1781.
   Ceres,                    M. Piazzi, .. January 1, 1801.

   Vesta,                    M. Olbers, . . March 29, 1807.
   All these planets revolve round the Sun, as the centre of
motion : and in performing their revolutions they follow
the fundamental laws of the planetary motion so happily
discovered by Kepler ; and which have been fully confirmed
by subsequent observations. These laws are,
   I. The orbit of each planet is an ellipse; of which the
Sun occupies one of the foci.
   The extremity of the major axis of this ellipse, nearest
the Sun, is called the perihelion: the opposite extremity of
the same axis is called the aphelion.    The line, which joins
these two points, is called the line of the apsides.   The ra
dius vector is an imaginary line drawn from the centre of
the Sun to the centre of the planet, in any part of its orbit.
   The velocity of a planet in its orbit is always greatest at
its perihelion.   This velocity diminishes as the radius vector
increases ; till the planet arrives at its aphelion, when its
motion is the slowest.       It then increases, in an inverse
manner, till the planet arrives again at its perihelion.
   II.  The areas, described about the Sun by the radius vector
of   the planet, are proportional to the times employed in
describing tliem.
   These laws are sufficient for determining the motion of
the planets round the Sun : but it is necessary to know, for
each of these planets, seven quantities; which are called
the elements of their elliptical motion.     The first five of
these elements relate to the motion in an ellipse : the last
two relate to the position of the orbit ; since the planets do
not all move in the same plane.-
    1. The duration of a sidereal revolution of the planet.
   2. Half the major axis of the orbit ; or the mean distance
of the planet from the Sun.
   3. The eccentricity of the orbit y whence we deduce the
greatest equation of the centre,

first moment of the present century : namely, for that point

1800, and the 1st of January 1801; mean time at Paris.

    The examination of the first two tables here given will
show us that the duration of the revolutions of the planets
increases with their mean distance from the Sun.                          Whence
Kepler discovered his third fundamental law : namely,
    III. The squares of tiie times of the revolutions of I lie
planets are to eachother as the cubes of their mean distances.
    The ellipses, which the planets describe, however, are
not unalterable. Their major axes appear to be always the
same: but their eccentricities, the positions of their peri
helion and nodes, together with the inclination of their
orbits to the ecliptic, seem to vary in a course of years.
These variations, being sensible* only in a series of ages, are
called secular inequalities.           There is no doubt of their ex
istence: but the modern observations not being sufficiently
extensive, and the ancient not sufficiently exact, there still
rests some degree of uncertainty as to their magnitude.
The following table will show the inequalities that happen                          .
in a period of one hundred years, and are the values that
appear to accord best with the present observations.

     Mercury is the nearest planet to the Sun : its mean dis-
  tance being '387, that of the Earth being considered as unity.
  This makes his mean distance above 36 millions of miles.
     He performs his sidereal revolution in 87d 23h 15' 43"j9
  and his mean sy nodical revolution in about 1 16 days.
     The eccentricity of his orbit is *2055; half the major axis
  being taken equal to unity.
     His mean longitude, at the commencement of the pre
  sent century, was in 5s 23° 56' 27",0.
     The longitude of his perihelion was, at the same time, in
  2s 14° 21' 46 ",9>    The line of the apsides has a sidereal mo
  tion, according to the order of the signs, equal to 9' 43",6
  in a century. But, if referred to the ecliptic, this motion
  will (owing to the precession of the equinoctial points) be
  equal to 55", 8 in a year ; or to 1° 33'. 13", 6 in a century.
     His orbit is inclined to the plane of the ecliptic in an
  angle of 7° 0' 9",1 : which angle is subject to a small in
  crease of about I8",2 in a century.
     His orbit, at the commencement of the present century,
  crossed the ecliptic in 1* 15° 57' 30",9 : having a sidereal
  motion, to the westward every century, of 13' 2",2. But,
  if referred to the ecliptic, the place of the nodes will (on
  account of the precession of the equinoxes) fall more to
. the eastward by 42",3 in a year, or 1° 10' 27",8 in a century,
     The rotation on his axis is accomplished in ld Oh 5' 28",3.
  But the inclination of its axis is not known.

  evening.     His elongation, or angular distance, varies from
                 1
   16° 12' to 28 48'.
     His course sometimes appears retrograde. The mean
  arc, which it describes in this case, is about 13° 30' ; and
                                                                 in

     Mercury changes his phases, like the Moon, according to
his various positions with regard to the Earth and Sun : "but
this cannot be discovered without the aid of a telescope.
His mean apparent diameter is 6",9.

which can only happen when he is in his nodes, and when
the Earth is in the same longitude.           Consequently this
 phaenomenon can take place only in the months of May or
November.        The first observation of this kind was made
 by Gassendi in November 1631 : since which period they
 have been frequent.      The next appearance of this kind will
 be in November 1815.]

 of all the planets.
     Her mean longitude, at the commencement of the pre
 sent century, was in 0s 10° 44' 35",0.
     The longitude of her peiilielion was, at the same time,

gation, or angular distance, varies from 45° to 48°.
   Her motion sometimes appears retrograde. The mean arc,
which she describes in such case, is about 16* 12'; and her
mean duration is about 42 days. This retrogradation com
mences, or finishes, when she is about 28° 48' distant from
the Sun.
   Venus changes her piloses, like the Moon, according to
her position with respect to the Sun and the Earth: which
causes a very considerable difference in her brilliancy.
   Her mean apparent diameter is 17'',0; her greatest ap
parent diameter is about 57",3.
            is sometimes seen to pass over the Sun's disk :

which can happen only when she is in her nodes, and
when the Earth is in the same longitude.              Consequently
it can take place only in the months of June or Decem
ber. Three of these transits have been already observed :
one in 1639, one in June 1761, and one in June 1769.
There will not be another tUl the 8th of December 1874.]
                              The Earth.
   The Earth which      we inhabit is also one of the planets
that  revolve about   the   Sun. It performs its sidereal revolu
tion in 365d 6h 9' 11",5: but the time employed in going
from one tropic to the other is only 365d 5h 48' 51",6.
The tropical year is about 11",2 shorter than it was at the
time of Hipparchus.
   Its mean distance from the Sun is 23578 times its own
semi-diameter : whence it is above 93 millions of miles di
stant from that luminary.          If this mean distance be taken
equal  to unity,   we  shall   have  its distance at the perihelion
equal  to* 9832  j and    its  distance    at the aphelion equal to
10168.
   The eccentricity of its orbit is '0168: half the major axis
being considered as unity. The major axis, therefore, will
be to the minor axis of the orbit, in the proportion of 1 to
99439.
                                                                 Its

                         Elements      of Astronomy.
    Its  mean longitude, at the commencement of the present
eentury, was 3s 10° 9' 13",0.
    Its velocity varies in different parts of its orbit.             Like all
the other planets,          it is   most   rapid   in   its perihelion, and
slowest in      its  aphelion.       In  the  former      point it describes
an arc    of  1°   V  9", 9 in the   course   of a  clay ; and in the latter
point     it describes      an   arc  of   only 57' 11",5 in the same
period.       The    mean    velocity   is 59' 10'',7 each day.
    The mean longitude of its perihelion at the commence
ment of the present century was 3' 9° 30' 5",0.                      But the
line of the apsides has a direct sidereal motion of 1 9' 40",8
in a century : which, being referred to the ecliptic, will
give it a motion (according to the order of the signs) of
 V l',9 in a year, or 1" 43' 10'',8 in a century.               A complete
revolution round the line of the apsides is called the ano
malistic year; and is performed in 365d 6h 14' 2". The
perihelion coincided with the vernal equinox about the year
4089 before the Christian sera. It coincided with the sum
mer solstice about the year 1250 after Christ: and will
coincide with the autumnal equinox about the year 6483.
A complete tropical revolution of the apsides is performed
in   20931 years.
    The axis of         the Earth is inclined to the plane of the
ecliptic     in   an angle of 23° 27' 57"jO : which                 angle is
observed to decrease at the rate of 52",1 in a century.                   But
this variation of ihe angle is confined within certain limits $
 and cannot exceed 2° 42',
     The annual intersection of the equator with the ecliptic
 is oot always in the same point : but is retrograde, or con
 trary to the order of the signs. Consequently the equinoxial
 points appear to move forward on the ecliptic : and whence
 this phenomenon is called the precession of the equinoxes,
 The quantity of this annual change is 50', 1 ; or 1° 23' 30"
 in  a  century.      A   pomplete    revolution is performed in 25868
 years.
     The sidereal day, or         the time employed by the Earth in
 revolving     on   its axis,  is  always the same.         Its diurnal rota
 tion has not varied, the hundredth part of a second, since
 the time of Hipparchus.                If the mean astronomical, or
 civil, day be taken equal to 24 hours, the duration of the
 sidereal day will be 23h 56' 4",1.
     The astronomical, or civil, day is constantly changing.
 This variation arises from two causes : l . The unequal mo
 tion of the Earth in its orbit; 2. The obliquity of that
 orbit to the plane of the equator.              [The mean and apparent
  goiar days are never equal, except when the Sun's daily mo

 12                  A  Synopsis   of the principal
 tion in right ascension is 59' 8". This is tbe case about
 April 1 6th, June 16th, September 1st, and December 25th :
on these days the difference vanishes, or nearly so. It is at
its greatest about November 1st, when it is 16' 16".]
     The astronomical year is divided into four parts, deter
mined by the two equinoxes and the two solstices.                      The
interval between the vernal and autumnal equinoxes is (on
account of the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit, and its un
equal velocity therein) near eight days longer than the in
terval between the autumnal and vernal equinoxes.                   These
intervals are, at present, nearly as follow :

    The nutation of       the Earth's   axis is 19",3.
     Light takes 8' 13",3 to come from the Sun to the Earth.
But in this interval the Earth has moved 20",2 in its orbit.
This motion of the Earth produces an optical illusiou in
the light which comes from the stars             :   and which Bradiey
calls the alerration of light.
     The figure of the Earth is that of an oblate spheroid : the
axis of the poles being to the diameter of the equator as
331 to 332.         The mean diameter of the Earth is about 7916
miles : its equatorial diameter is 7924 miles.
    As a necessary
             '
                        consequence from this circumstance, the
degrees of     latitude  increase in length as we recede from the
equator    to   the  poles.   But different meridians, under the
same latitude, present different results.               The general fact,
however, is well ascertained.
    The density of the Earth is 3'9326 times greater than
that of the Sun, and is to that of water as 1 1 to 2.
     Its mass, compared with that of the Sun considered as
    The centrif ugal force is greater at the equator than at
the poles : in consequence of which, bodies lose part of
their weight by being taken towards the equator.                   If   the
gravity of a body at the equator be represented by unity,
its gravity at the poles will be increased by "00569. A
pendulum, therefore, which vibrates seconds in the higher
                                                               latitudes,

                    Elements  of Astronomy.                  13
latitudes, must be shortened at the equator in order to ren
der the oscillations isochronous.       [A pendulum 39*197
inches long will swing seconds at the poles: but, in order
that it may swing seconds at the equator, it must be re
duced to 39-027 inches.]
   The centrifugal force at the equator is nearly -j-f?1" °f
gravity.    If the rotation of the Earth were 17 times more
rapid, the centrifugal force would be equal to that of gra
vity : and bodies at the equator would not have any weight.
   A rare and elastic fluid surrounds the Earth, which is
called the atmosphere.    Neither the temperature nor density
of this fluid is uniform ; but diminishes in proportion to
its distance from the surface of the Earth, and is also af
fected by other circumstances.
    If the density of the atmosphere were every where the
same and its temperature at zero, and the height of the ba
rometer at 29-92196 inches, the height of the atmosphere
would be 26067 feet; or 3-7 miles.
    The atmosphere is a heterogeneous substance. Out of
 100 parts, 79 are azotic gas, and the remaining 21 are oxy
 gen gas.    This is found to be universally the case, in what
 ever season or whatever climate the experiment be tried.
 This proportion^ is also found to exist in the highest points
 of the atmosphere that have been reached by means of
 balloons.
    A body projected horizontally to the distance of about
 4'35 miles, if there were no resistance in the atmosphere,
 would not fall again to the surface of the Earth, but would
 revolve round it as a satellite ; the centrifugal force being
 then equal to its gravity.
    The rays of light do not move in a straight line through
 the atmosphere ; but are inflected continually towards the
 Earth : so that the stars appear more elevated on the hori
 zon than they really are.
    We find, from the most accurate observations, that the
 refraction, which the atmosphere produces, is independent
 of its temperature, and proportional to its density. But,
 as the density varies according to the temperature; it if
 necessary to attend not only to the state of the barometer,
 but also of the thermometer.
    The humidity of the air produces very little effect on its
 refractive powers, and may therefore be safely omitted.
    The temperature of the whole atmosphere being sup
 posed at zero, its density will diminish in a geometrical
 progression, according to its distance from the surface of
 the Earth : and we find by experience that, the height of
                                                            the

mean state by 7' 49", 2 ; and is in a similar manner dimi
nished by this quantity, at the time of the solstices.
    The height of the tides is also considerably influenced
by all those causes which have been just mentioned ; and
depends on the phases and position of the Moon in her or
bit. It is greatest when the Moon is in the syzigies ; and
is diminished in the quadratures.       The distance likewise of
the Sun and Moon from the Earth, as well as their declina~
tien, has a material effect upon the height of the tides.
     But the state of the tides is so modified by the nature
and position of the coasts, the depth of the channel, the
operation of the winds, and by other causes, that the above
Jaws will not always be found to correspond with the actual
state of the tides, particularly near the coast, or in rivers.
It will however be found, from the mean of a number of
observations, that the inequalities in the heights and in the
intervals of the tides have various periods.        Some are of
half a day and a day ; others are of half a month and a
month ; whilst others again are of half a year and a year :
and some are the same as the times of the revolutions of
the lunar nodes and apsides.

 triple that of the Sun.

 dical revolution in about 780 days, or in about 2M35 years.
     His mean distance from the Sun is 1 -524 ; that of the
 Earth being considered as unity.         This makes his mean
 distance above 142 millions of miles.
     The eccentricity of his orbit is '093 : half the major axis
 being considered as unity.
     His mean longitude, at the commencement of the pre

   As viewed from the Earth, the motion of Mars appears
sometimes retrograde.      The mean arc which he describes
in this case is 16° 12': and its mean duration is about 73
days. This retrogradation commences, or finishes, when
the planet is not more than 136° 48' from the Sun.
   Mars changes his phases somewhat in the same manner
as the Moon does from her first to her third quarter, ac
cording to his various positions with respect to the Earth
and the Sun : but, he never becomes cornicular, as the
Moon does when near her conjunctions.           His mean appa
rent diameter is 9 ', 7 : which augments in proportion as the
planet approaches its opposition, when it is equal to

subject to some inequalities.     He performs his mean syno-
dical revolution in about 399 days.

      His orbit is inclined to the plane of the ecliptic in an
 angle of 2° 29' 38", 1 : which is observed to decrease about
 15", 5 in a century.
     His orbit, at the commencement of ihe present century,
 crossed the ecliptic in 3s 21° 55' 46'',5 : but the place of
 the nodes has an apparent motion in longitude, according
 to the order of the signs, of 27",4 in a year, or 45' 43",5 in
 a century.
     The rotation on his axis is performed in 10h 16' 19",2:
 [and the axis is inclined in an angle of 58° 41' to the plane
of   the  ecliptic]
     [His mean diameter          is 76068 miles: consequently he is

     Saturn     is sometimes marked by zones or belts ; which
are probably obscurations in his atmosphere.                 And   he is
accompanied by seven satellites.
     The most singular phenomenon, however, attending this
planet, is the double ring with which he is surrounded.
     This ring, which is very thin and broad, is inclined to
the plane of the ecliptic in an angle of 31° 19' 12",0; and
revolves from west to east, in a period of loh 29' 16 ",8, about
an axis perpendicular to its plane and passing through the
centre of the planet.
     The breadth of the ring is nearlv equal to its distance from
the surface of Saturn : that is, about ± of the diameter of
the planet.
     The surface      of  the ring is separated in the middle by a
black concentric          band, which divides it into tuo distinct
rings.
     The edges of this ring, being very thin, sometimes disap
pear: and, as this edge will present itself to the Sun twice
in each revolution of the planet, it is obvious that the dis
                                                             appearance

appearance of the ring will occur about once in 15 years;
but under circumstances oftentimes very different.
    [The intersection of the ring and the ecliptic is in 5s 20°
and 11s 20°: consequently, when Saturn is in either of
those signs, his ring will be invisible to us.        On the con
trary, when he is in 2' 20° or 8s 20% we may see it to most
advantage. This was the case towards the end of the year
1811.     Regard, however, must be had to the position of
the  Earth.]
   As viewed from      the Earth, the motion of Saturn some
times appears retrograde. The mean arc which he describes
in this case is about 6° 18' : and its duration is nearly 139
days. This retrogradation commences, or finishes, when
the planet is distant about 1083 54' from the Sun.
   His mean apparent diameter is 1 7",6.
                         Telescopic Planets.
   Uranus      was discovered      by Dr. Herschel, March 13,
 1781,   who gave it the name of the Georgium Sidus.             It
performs its sidereal revolution in 306*88d 17h 6' l6",2; or in
about 84 Julian years : and it is probably situated at the
confines of the planetary system.
   Its distance from the Sun is upwards of 1800 millions of
miles : and its apparent diameter is scarcely 3",9.
   Its mass compared with that of the Sun considered as
unity, is -nmrr-
   Six satellites accompany this planet ; which move in
orbits nearly perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic.
   The elements of the four remaining telescopic planets are
not yet ascertained with sufficient precision.
                              Satellites.
   The number of satellites in our system, at present known,
is eighteen : namely, the Moon which revolves round the
Earth ; four that belong to Jupiter, seven to Saturn, and
six to Uranus.      The Moon is the only one visible to the
naked eye.
   They all move round their primary        planets, as their cen
tre, by the  same   law  sas those  primary ones move round the
Sun   : namely,
   I. The orbit of      each satellite is an ellipse, of which the
primary planet occupies one of the foci.
    II. The areas, described about the primary planet, by the
radius vector of the satellite, are proportional to the times
employed in describing them.

tellites, round their respective primary planets, are to each
other as the cubes of their mean distances from the primary.
                              Moon.
   The motions of the Moon are exceedingly eccentric and
irregular.   She performs her mean sidereal revolution in
 37d 7h 43' \1",5.    But this period is variable: and a com
 parison of the modern observations with the ancient proves
incontestably an acceleration in her mean motion.           Her
mean tropical revolution is 27d 7h 43' 4", 7 : and her mean
 synodical revolution is 29d 12h 44' 2",8.
   Her mean distance from the Earth is 2§,082175 times
the diameter of the terrestrial equator j or above 237 thou
sand miles.
    The eccentricity of her orbit is '0548i53 ; the mean dis
tance from the Earth being taken equal to unity.        But this
eccentricity is variable in each revolution.
    Her mean longitude, at the commencement of the pre
sent century, was in 3s 21° 3ft" 42", 1.
    Her velocity varies in different parts of her orbit. She
is swiftest in her perigee (or point nearest the Earth) ; and
slowest when in her apogee (or point furthest from the
Earth). Her mean diurnalvelocity is equal to 13° 10'34"}Q,
or about 13 times greater than that of the Sun.
    The greatest equation of her centre is 6° 17' 54",S.
   The mean longitude of her perihelion was, at the com
mencement of the present century, in 8s 26^ 6' 5",1 : but
the line of the apsides has a motion, according to the order
of the signs. The period of a sidereal revolution of the
apsides is 3232d 13h 56' 16",8, or nearly 9 years.      The pe
riod of a tropical revolution of the apsides is but 3231d llh
24' 8",6.    But these periods are not uniform : for they have
a secular irregularity, and are retarded whilst the motion of
the Moon itself is acceleiated. The period of an anomalistic
revolution of the Moon is 27d 13u 18' 37",4»
   Her orbit is inclined to the plane of the ecliptic in an
angle of 53 9' : but this inclination is variable. The greatest
inequality, which sometimes extends to 8' 47", 1, is pro
portional to the co-sine of the angle on which the inequality
in the motion of the nodes depends.
   Her orbit, at the commencement of the present century,
crossed the ecliptic in 0* 15° 55' 26'',3 : but the place of
her nodes is variable.    They have a retrograde motion, and
                                                          make

make a sidereal revolution in 6793d 10h 6' 30",0; or in
about 18 6 Julian years. This variation, however, is subject
to many inequalities : of which, the greatest is proportional
to the sine of double the distance of the Moon from the
Sun; and extends to 1° 37' 45",0 at its maximum.         A sy-
nodical revolution of the nodes is performed in 346d I**
52' 43",6.    The motion of the nodes is subject also to a
secular inequality, dependent on the acceleration of the
Moon's mean motion.
   The rotation of the Moon on her axis is equal and uni
form : and it is performed in the same time as the tropical
revolution in her orbit ; whence she always presents nearly
the same face to the Earth.       But, as the motion of the
Moon, in her orbit, is periodically variable, we sometimes
see more of her eastern edge, and sometimes more of her
western edge.     This appearance is called the libration of
the Moon in longitude.
   The axis of the Moon is inclined to the plane of the
ecliptic in an angle of 88° 29' 49".    In consequence of this
position of the Moon, her poles alternately become visible
to, and obscured from us : and this phenomenon is called
her libration in latitude.
   There is also another optical deception arising from the
Moon being seen from the surface of the Earth, instead of
the centre.    This appearance is called her diurnal libration.
   There are other inequalities in the Moon's motion, aris
ing from the action and influence of the Sun. The prin
cipal of these are,
   1. The Evection; whose constant effect is to diminish the
equation of the centre in the syzigies, and to augment it in
the quadratures.     If this diminution and increase were al
ways the same, the evection would depend only on the an
gular distance of the Moon from the Sun : but its absolute
value varies also with the distance of the Moon from the
perigee of its orbit.    After a long series of observations,
we are enabled to represent this inequality by supposing it
equal to the sine of double the distance of the Moon from
(be Sun, minus the distance of the Moon from its perigee.
At its maximum, it amounts to 1° 18' 2",4.
   2. The flirtation; which disappears in the syzigies and
quadratures, and is greatest in the octants.   It is then equal
to 31' 44", 1: whence it is proportional to the sine of double
the distance of the Moon from the Sun.          Its duration ia
half a synodical revolution of the Moon.
   3. The Annual Equation j which follows exactly the same
law as the equation of the centre of the Sun, with a contrary
                                B 3                       sign.

 22                 A  Synopsis   of the  principal
 sign.    For, when the Earth is in its perihelion, the orbit of
ythe  Moon is enlarged by the action of the Sun; and the
 Moon therefore requires more time to perform her revolu
 tion. But, as the Earth proceeds towards its aphelion, the
 Moon's orbit contracts.        Hence the period of this inequa
 lity  is  an  anomalistic    year: and, at its maximum, it.
 amounts to    1 1' 15",9.   It  is subject to a secular inequality.
    The figure of the Moon is that of an oblate spheroid, like
 the Earth.     Her mean diameter is in the proportion to that
 of the Earth, as 5823 to 21332 ; or as I to 3-665. Whence
 her mean diameter will be about 2160 miles.
    Her volume, compared with that of the Earth, is ¦fo: but
 her mass is only «^-.T.
    The apparent diameter of the Moon varies according to
 her distance from the Earth.          When nearest to us it is
 33' 31",1 ; but at her greatest distance it is 29' 21",9.      Her
 mean apparent diameter is 31' 26 ', 5.
    Her mean horizontal parallax is equal to 57' 34",2.
    The phases of the Moon arc caused by the reflection of
 the Sun's light ; and depend on the relative positions of
 the Sun, the Earth, and the Moon.
    An eclipse of the Moon can take place only at the time
 of her opposition to the Sun ; and is caused by her passing
 through the shadow of the Earth.          That shadow is 3£ times
 longer   than the   distance  between   the  Moon and the Earth:
 and its breadth, where it is traversed by the Moon, is about
 2$ times greater than the diameter of the Moon.                The
 breadth of the Earth's shadow, where it is traversed by the
Moon, is equal to the difference between the semidiameter
of the Sun, and the sum of the horizontal parallaxes of the
 Sun and Moon.
     [The Moon cannot be eclipsed, however, if her distance
 from the place of her node, at the time of her opposition,
 exceeds i3° 21': but, if it is within 7° 47'j there will cer
 tainly be an eclipse. The duration of the eclipse will de-
        on the apparent diameter of the Moon, and on the
   readth of the shadow at the point where she traverses it.]
 Jend
    The Sun cannot be eclipsed unless the Moon be in con
junction : and then only when the centres of the Sun and
 Moon are in the same straight line with the eye of the spec
 tator on the Earth,      in such case, if the apparent diameter
 of the Moon be greater than that of the Sun, the eclipse
 will be total: but, if it be less, it will be annular.        Par
 tial eclipses, however, may arise j as in the case of lunar
 eclipse.
     [The Sun cannot be totally obscured for a longer period
                                                                   of -

of time    than four minutes : but the Moon may be hid from
our view for a much longer period.
    [The number of eclipses in a year cannot be less than
 two, nor more than seven.]
    Eclipses generally return in the same order and mag
nitude at the end of 223 lunations.         For, in 223 mean sy-
nodical revolutions, there are 6585'' 7h 42' 3 1",7 : and, in
6385d 18h 41' 45",6 there are 19 mean sytiodical revolutions
of the Moon's nodes.         Therefore,v at the end of 6585d 7h
42' 31",7, the Moon's mean longitude will be only 28' 35"
behind the mean place of her nodes. In 6535 days there
are 18 Julian years and 1 1 days, if there are four leap years
in that period : but if there are five leap years, they form
no more than 18 Julian years and 10 days.
    The atmosphere of the Moon, if it has any, must be ex
tremely attenuated ; and must be more rare than that which
we can produce with our best air-pumps.
     The light of the Moon is 300000 times more weak than
that of the Sun. Its rays, collected by the aid of powerful
glasses, do not produce any sensible effect on the thermo
meter.
    The refraction of theTavs of light, at the surface of our
Earth, must be at least 1000 times greater than at the sur
face  of  the Moon.
    Volcanoes and mountains are discovered on her surface,
by the aid of the telescope.
    A body projected from the surface of the Moon, with
a momentum that would cause it to proceed at the rate of
about 8200 feet in the first second of time, and whose direc
tion should be in a line which at that moment passed through
the centre of the Earth and Moon, would not fall again to
the surface of the Moon ; but would become a satellite to
the Earth.     .lis primitive impulse might, indeed, be such
as to cause it even to precipitate to the Earth.       The stones,
which have fallen from the air, may be accounted for in.
this manner.
                        Satellites of Jupiter.
    By  the aid   of the telescope   we may discover four satel
lites revolving round Jupiter.        The sidereal revolutions of
these bodies are given in the following table: together with
their mean distances from Jupiter, the semi-diameter of
that planet's equator being considered as unity ; and like
wise their masses, compared with Jupiter considered also
as  unity.

     First Satellite.     The inclination of the orbit of this sa
 tellite does not differ much from the plane of Jupiter's orbit.
 Its eccentricity is insensible.
      Second Satellite.     The eccentricity of the orbit of this
 satellite is also insensible.      The inclination of its orbit, to
 that of its primary, is variable; as well as the position of
 its nodes.
      Third Satellite.     This satellite has a little eccentricity;
 and the line of its apsides has a direct but variable motion :
 the eccentricity itself is also subject to very sensible varia
 tions.     The inclination of its orbit to that of Jupiter, and
 the position of its nodes, are far from being uniform.
      Fourth Satellite.      The eccentricity of this satellite is
 greater than that of any of the other three; and the line of
 the apsides has an annual and direct motion of 48' 58", 7.
 The inclination of its orbit, with the plane of Jupiter's or
 bit, forms an angle of about 2° 25' 48" : but this angle, al
 though stationary about the middle of the last century, has
 lately begun to increase very sensibly.           At the same time
 the motion of its nodes has begun to diminish.
     The motions of the first three satellites are related to each
 other by a most singular analogy.            For, the mean sidereal
 or synodical motion       of  the first, added to twice that of the
 third, is constantly equal to three times the mean motion,
 of the second. And, the mean sidereal or synodical longi
 tude of the first, minus three times that of the second, plus,
 twice that of the third, is always equal to two right angles.
      The satellites of Jupiter are liable to be eclipsed by pass
 ing through his shadow; and, on the other hand, they are
 frequently seen to pass over his disk, and eclipse a portion
  of his surface. This happens, to the first and second sa
 tellite, at every revolution : the third very rarely escapes in
 each revolution:       but, the fourth (on account of its great
  distance and inclination) is seldom obscured.
      These eclipses are of great utility in enabling us to deter
 mine the longitude of places, by their observation : and
  they likewise exhibit some curious phenomena with respect
 to light.
                                                               From,

    Prom     the singular analogy, above alluded to, it follows
that (for a great number of years at least) the first three
satellites cannot be eclipsed at the same time: for, in the
simultaneous eclipses of the second and third, the first will
always be in conjunction with Jupiter; and vice versa.
                         Satellites   of Saturn.
    Seven satellites may be seen, by means of the telescope,
to revolve about Saturn; the elements of which are but
little known, on account of their great distance. The fol

volutions, and their mean distances in semi-diameters of

  II. An Account of            the Great Derbyshire Denudation.          By
      Mr. J. Farey         Senior.      In a Letter to the Right Hon.
      Sir Joseph Banks, Bart.             K.B. P.K.S*
  Sir,   I   had but recently entered on the survey of Derby
  shire and its environs, which under your kind patronage I
  was induced to commence in the autumn of 1 807, and had
  only cursorily examined the strata, in my way from Charn-
  wood Forest and Breedon in Leicestershire, in order to meet
  you at Overton Hall, before I perceived clearly, that those
  principles which contemplate the terrestrial strata as ter
  minating or ending in one direction (simple and important
 as they are), which I had learned under Mr. William Smith
  in 1801, and which he has so successfully applied in the
  filling up of his maps of the strata in the south-east and
  east, and some of the middle parts of England, would fail
 me, in their application to the strata of Derbyshire, without
 taking into consideration along with them, not only the
 denudation, or local stripping off, of patches of strata, some
 of immense extent and thickness, and even more consider
 able than those which I had discovered to be missing                      f
 from off the Wealds of Kent, Sussex, and Surry, and had ex
 plained to you, by a rough section across this great southern
 denudation in 1806, and such as the valley of Ashover then
 appeared to present, a more perfect instance of, around us :
 but that previously to such denudations of the Derbyshire
 strata, immense dislocations or vertical derangements of
 very large piles of strata, separated by the fissures, called
faults by the miners, needed also to be taken into account,
 for explaining the appearances of the strata and surface of
 the district, which I was then about to explore : faults, ex
 ceeding immensely in their extent and quantity of lift on
 one side (or sink on the other) any which had occurred to
 Mr. Smith, in the tracing of the south-eastern strata of
 England, where no faults had been discovered, sa consider
 able as to cut off entirely the connection of the strata, or in
 other words, to bring strata in contact on the surface, whose
 places in the series were too distant to be known, and readily
 traced in their order, in the neighbourhood.                  And in con
 sequence, I judged it necessary, on my return to town, when
 the winter arrived, to set about the consideration of strati-

the Board of Agriculture on Derbyshire, the first volume of
which is now in the press*.
   With ideas thus extended, I found, on resuming my
Survey in the spring of 1808, that some conclusions that
I  had formed, and had unfortunately committed to paper,
in a sketch of a section across the county, were erroneous,
and that immense faults occurred, in places where their
existence had not been proved by miners, or generally un
derstood, which combined with the denudations, that were
so apparent in my first journey across the county in the
preceding autumn, offered, as I proceeded afterwards in
filling up my map, a considerably different explanation of
the structure of the country, or section of its strata, from
that which I had previously made, and permitted some per
sons to copyt« The first volume of my Report to the Board
of Agriculture abovcmentioned, has compressed into            all      it,
the most essential particulars of my Survey, which manu
script you did me the honour to examine, and to recom
mend its adoption to the Board; but as the plan of that Re
port did not admit of taking an extended or connected view
of the great faults or dislocations of the district,        have   I
troubled you with this letter, in order to describe them                      :

    undulating     lines,   conformable to the surface, from one sea
   to the other, just as a certain number at the upper part of
   the series have been shown to do, by Mr. Smith's manu
   script maps.        But, after passing the edges of the lias lime
   stones and clay strata, in our progress to the westward,
   from any of the south-eastern and eastern parts of England,
   we find on the surface marks of an immense stratum of red
   earth or marl, which basseting from under the lias clav and
   sand, seems once to have extended over all the remainder of
   the British islands, without being now any where covered
   by patches of upper strata*, much beyond the continuous
   edge of the lias strata abovementioned.                Instead, however,
   of seeing the middle and all the western and northern parts
   of Britain covered by the same red strata, we find now, in
  this space, numerous local and many very large tracts of
  strata, surrounded by vertical and connected jaults, and
  greatly lifted and tilted; from the surface of which lifted
  tracts, the upper red earth, and vast and very unequal thick
  nesses of strata, that lay in regular succession below this
  red earth, have been denudated, " abrupted,"or carried off,
  leaving thus, a great variety of what have been called coal
  fields, or mineral- basins t, in which limited tracts, great
  and most important series of strata, are to be seen basseting
  (owing to the local denudations), of which the basset-edges,
 or continued endings, can no where be traced in these
 islands, as far as I can learn. Large tracts of the interven
 ing spaces, between these denudated mineral basins, are
 still occupied by the red marl, containing local strata of
 gypsum, rock-salt, sand, micaceous grit-stone, &c. &c. in
 its substance, or exposed by denudation; and in others,
 local strata, or nodules of great extent, or rather, perhaps,
 rudely crystallized masses of slate, green -stone, sienite, ba
 salt, &c. &c. fqrming hills or mountains (often intersected
 by mineral veins) from the tops of which masses, the red
 marl has in most instances been denudated.                    It remains a
 task of great difficulty, yet to be accomplished, to ascertain
the lower part of the British series of strata, thus only ex
posed to view, in local and unconnected tracts, or basins,
which are in part often concealed by gravel (frequently so,
near their borders), and towards which investigation, little

has yet been done.        It seems to me, that there are three
distinct series  of   coal-measures,        if not more, separated by
thick strata of   red  earths,    or  marls,   not easily distinguished
from the upper     one  above    the   coal  series,  or that which un
derlays the lias     strata,   as  above    mentioned,     and by thick
strata of limestones ;       each    of  which    red  earths, probably,
produce anomalous and local strata, or crystallized moun
tain masses, in different places, where they form the sur
face ; and the fact of such containing no organic remains,
may not have arisen from their having been formed before
organized beings existed, as those contend who call them
primitive rocks, but because the circumstances proper to
 crystallization, were unfitted to the propagation and life of
 either animals, or vegetables ; and may it not be doubted,
 whether crystallized masses, great or small, are ever the seats
 of reliquia ?
    The northern parts of Derbyshire, and the adjoining parts
 of the surrounding counties, present a denudated tract, and
 partake of this uncertainty, as to what place in the lower
 part of the British series of strata, its strata should be re
 ferred : from many circumstances, I am inclined to con
 sider the coal-field of Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire,                 and
 Yorkshire, underlaying         the    yellow-lime     rock,  as lower  in
 the series than any      others    of  the   coal-measures    alluded  to
 above, and that    the   fourth     limestone     rock,  which   extends
 from Castleton in Derbyshire, southward to Weaver Hill,
 near Wooton and Ramsor in Staffordshire, is the very lowest
  which is known in Britain, and which may account for the
 circumstance, that the mineral veins and the strata in which
 they occur in Derbyshire, present some phaenomena, which
  are said to occur no where else.
     I shall proceed now to describe the circumstances, under
  which this great elevation and denudation of part of the
 Derbyshire strata seems to have happened, which is, by a
  series of three or four separately lifted tracts, one within the
  other, as represented in the small skeich map annexed (PI. J.)
  The outer or least lifted of these tracts is bounded on the
  south by a fault, that I have distinguished by a full line,
  where ascertained, and by slight dots where only inferred,
  and denominated it the great Derbyshire fault, which is
  perfectly defined from near Nottingham across Derbyshire,
  to the north side of Stone in Staffordshire (except in a few
  places where gravel covers it), by having red marl, lying
  nearly horizontal, on all its 3outh side, and different strata
  on its north side, as will be mentioned further on: the
                                                                   eastern

eastern fault or side of this first raised tract is not visible
within the limits of my Survey, like the southern, on ac
count of the vast accumulation of quartz gravel in Sher
wood Forest, and the peaty alluvia north of it : but it
seems      probable to me, that its range is from about the
town of Nottingham, east of Mansfield, east of Worksop
near Bawtry, west of Thome in Yorkshire, and how much
further north this fault proceeds, before it turns to the west,
I am unable lo state from my own observations ; but from
the correspondence of my friend William Smithson, esq.
of Heath Hall near Wakefield, a very able observer, I con
clude, that the boundary fault on the north of the outer
lifted tract, ranging not far from the lower part of the
course of the Wharf river, suddenly cuts off, or terminates
the great Derbyshire and Yorkshire coal-field to the north,
and continues S. of Otley and Keighley* near Colne in
Lancashire and Clilheroe, bounding still the coal-field of
Lancashire to the north.              1 am not sufficiently acquainted
with the Lancashire strata to hazard a conjecture, as to
where this fault turns (or branches perhaps) towards the
southward again ; but on the west it probably passes not
far from Manchester, Stockport in Cheshire, Macclesfield,
Congleton, Church-Lawton Salt-works, and joins the great
Derbyshire fault, or southern boundary of this very large
raised tract, somewhere to the N.W. of Stone in Stafford
shire, as 1 judge, from the information which I have re
ceived, of the red marl occupying the surface withoutside
this raised tract to the westward, in Cheshire and Stafford
shire, as well as south of it in Staffordshire, Derbyshire,
and Nottinghamshire, as above mentioned, and on the east
of it from Nottingham to Thome in Yorkshire, and per
haps further northward.
    This border, or plain of red marl, has the tract within it
so raised, that the yellow, or magnesian lime rock, proba
bly abuts against the marl at the surface of the strata on
    It stems probable, from the accounts which I have received from Mr.
Smithson, of the many small coal-basins, or swillcys, as they are called,
which occur in the space between Keighley, Hawes, and Richmond, viz. on
the N. side of Keighley, on Founton Fell in Craven; Thorpe Fell near
Burnsall, Threshfield near Linton, and Anter-Helghts near Kettlewell, on
the Wharf river; Netherdale Forest near Middlesmoor, on the Nidd river;
Slapettones near Hawes, West-Scrafton S.W. Leyburn N.W. and Braith wait-
Bank near to Middleham on the Yore river; Hudswell Moor S.W. of Rich
mond on the Swale river, &c.thaX all these belong to the lower or calcareous

here another great fault, called the zig-zag fault, intersects
the boundary fault : from Allestry to the S.E. corner of the
Weaver Hills near Wooton in Staffordshire, the second
inner tract, with a vastly greater rise than the first, abuts on
this southern fault, so as to bring the great limetone-shale

marl on the surface ; at this S.E. corner of the Weaver

of the raised tract ; and from this place to the S.W. corner
of the Weaver Hills near Ramsor, a third inner tract, with
 four hundred yards or more of perpendicular rise, in addi

 Derbyshire    fault;   which    here  occasionsa   sudden derange
 ment of the strata (and         acorresponding   denudation    of the
 large  tract of  country     to the  northward   has  taken place),
 far exceeding any thing which has hitherto been mentioned
    by
     authors, or conceived probably        by any one.
     At the S.W. corner of the Weaver Hills above men
 tioned, the great limestone fault again leaves the south
 boundary, or great Derbyshire fault, and proceeds north
 ward, after which      a  corner of the second interior raised tract
 again presents    itself,   and the limestone-shale again abuts
 on the marl, as we pursue the great Derbyshire fault to the
 westward, owing to the rise being less here          by  four or five
 hundred yards, than        it  was in the third interior tract
                                                              ;    hut
 as we proceed southwestward, owing to the dip of the
 measures on the N. side of the great Derbyshire fault to
'
 wards the west, the first grit, the first coal-shale, and the
  second grit rock successively abut against the marl, before
  the gravel covering commences, east and south of Cheadle,
 which prevented my tracing this fault any further, within
  the limits of my Survey.
     It  seems probable, however, that somewhere S.W. of
  Cheadle in Staffordshire,       a branch sets off from the great
  Derbyshire fault, or southern boundary of the lifted tracts,
  and proceeds northward, near to Endon and Bosley in
  Cheshire; the triangular tract beyond which, to the west
  ward, shown in the map, forming the pottery coal-field,             is

Hallam, and Ilkeston in Derbyshire, Awsworth, Greasley,

Alt-Hucknal, Bolsover, Clown, and Barlborough in Der

instances, where the yellow lime strata at the top of these
coal-measures abut against        for short distances, and be

very considerable and unequal on the N. and W. sides,
through its whole length, compared with the other sides, as
I  have particularly shown in my Report to the Board, and
pointed out the great difficulties which this zig-zag fault
has presented, to the right understanding the entire of the
great Derbyshire and Yorkshire coal-field,               by
                                                     the many
very intelligent and able colliers who are found in it.

                                                         faults
 (except, perhaps on the N. where my Survey has not ex
tended), shows no very rapid dips or inclinations of the
strata, except in very limited spots, and presents on the
surface either the yellow lime rock, or the parts of the coal-
measures not very far beneath that rock, compared with the
whole thickness of these coal-measures.
   The great limestone fault (which has been mentioned
above) commences in the town of Cromford                in

inner raised tract have turned a little, and altered their in
clinations with respect to each other and the surrounding
tracts (without any vertical derangement at this hinge), so
that the great limestone fault above described, from Mid
dleton by Wirksworth, round to the westward through
Staffordshire, as above, to Quarters-house near Great Huck-

length the first limestone, before the fault terminates or be
comes too inconsiderable to be readily traced, owing to its
no longer deranging the order of the strata on the surface,
but has the-first limestone on both its sides; and thus it
happens, that the third inner raised tract, or mineral-field,
consisting of the four limestone rocks and three interposed
loadstones, and containing about 105,000 acres, has about
51,500 acres of these on its eastern side, occupied by the
three upper limestones and the loadstones, and the remain
ing 53,500 acres in Derbyshire and Staffordshire is occupied
by the fourth, or lowest limestone rock, in which only a
few mineral veins occur among its numerous open fissure*
and caverns.
    In the sketch map which accompanies this, I have shown
a smaller, or fouth inner raised tract, on which Bakewell is
situated, in great part surrounded by a fault, which 1 have
thence denominated the great Bakewell fault.         [ have se
lected this tract, among other small local raised ones, on
account of its approaching in shape and position to the
others which surround     it,  and because   itexplains several
curious appearances of the strata in these parts, which have
been, and are still likely to be greatly misrepresented.
    The fault to which
                     I    allude, may be said to commence    in
 the limestone shale on the E. side of Beeley, to pass on the
 S. side of the village, across the Derwent and on the S. of
Haddon-Hall, continuing across the pastures to the Lathkil
river about quarter of mile above Alport, then turns S.
              a          a
 past the W. end of Alport to the upper mill, thence W.S. W .
for about one mile, where this fault again turns to the N.
and crosses the Bradford river, and proceeding across the
Meadow-place Liberty, crosses Robinslye Mine and the
Lathkil river above Over-Haddon mill bears then little
                                         ;             a
to the east of the north, and crosses the new Bakewell and
Buxton road at the rise of the hill, passes the N. end of
Bird's-head Mine, crosses the Wye river about     a  quarter of
a  mile above Bakewell Cotton Mill, proceeds near to Row-
 dale, turns E. towards Nether Burchill, then N.E. follow
 ing nearly the course of the brook,   it  continues the same
 direction until about half     a mile E. of Hassop, where   it
 turns to the E. crosses the Derwent again half mile above
                                                  a
 Baslow, and terminates in the limestone-shale    in  Barbrook
 Dale, asit   began.   The western side of this fourth inner
 tract being most raised (similar to the third tract) occasions
 the great elevation of the shale, and its freestone    in  the
 hills E. of Bakewell and N.E. of Haddon-Hall; the sudden
 appearance of the limestone, on which Haddon-Hall stands,

vale of the Bradford       suddenly   cuts  through the first lime
rock, as soon as          has crossed this fault, and shows the
                         it
first toadstone to considerable height up each side of the
                     a
valley, but which declines with the dip of the measures in this
tract, until the Bradford again gets upon the first toadstone,
and then on the first limestone.       In like manner, the greater
rise of the measures at this fault, on the S.W. of Over-Had-
don village occasions the valley of the Lathkil river, which
till then had been excavated in the first lime rock, to enter
abruptly so deep into the first toadstone, as lo lay bare a
patch of the second limestone under               the river, both of
                                                      it

before we get down to the crossing of the Ashburne turn
pike road.
    This fault also occasions the sudden appearance of shale-
limestone on the surface N.W. of                    it,
                                              opposite to first lime
stone on the other side           Bakewell Fields, and_ of the first
                                    in
toadstone on the N.W. of Bakewell Cotton-Ivlifl, almost
excavated through         bythe vale of the Wye river, where                    it
abuts against shale or shale-limestone at the northern end
of this noted patch of toadstone, the situation and circum
stances of which, when compared with those of the other
two patches, at the edge of this same raised tract, as above,
will be divested of much of that singularity which has been
ascribed to     it
                 ; for we see, that each of the three rivers,
which pass on to this fourth inner raised tract, have their
excavations cut through the first limestone, so as to expose
the first toadstone for some distance, until the more rapid
descents of the measures than of the vales, occasion them
again to dip and disappear in the bottoms of each of these
vales.       I    am, sir,

in the use of the levelling-staff on the common construc
tion, oh account of the narrow opening in the vane pre-

venting a distinct view of the whole numbers on the staff,
and rendering it necessary in many instances to remove the
vane for the purpose of reading off, which subjects the
operation to much uncertainty, besides which, there is a
difficulty in accurately bisecting the central stripe on the
vane, the wire in many cases subtending -jl larger angle
than the stripe itself.     Many persons, with a view of ob
viating these difficulties, are in the habit of observing the
top or bottom of the vane instead of the centre, and reading
off from the top or bottom accordingly : this, however, is
more objectionable and uncertain than that of bisecting the
central stripe ; the wire in most levels subtending an angle
of several minutes, and therefore if brought in contact with
the top or bottom of the vane, the error will be equal to
the semi-diameter of the wire, which 1 have found in short
levels to be equal to an inch in a chain.         Others have al
ternately applied the top and bottom of the vane to the
under and upper part of the wire, and taken half the dif
ference between the two readings as the true level point.
This, although an accurate, is a tedious method.
   The vane represented by the inclosed drawing (PI. II.) will
obviate the necessity of having recourse to such modes of
practice in future.      I have tried several forms, and find
this under all circumstances the best.
   The correct bisection of the cross is extremely easy, and
three inches of the scale being exposed, no error can arise
in reading off.
   The vane consists of a circular piece of brass 5 inches
diameter, and T^th of an inch thick, having an opening of
3 inches in length, and ^th of an inch less in width than
the staff : before the opening is made, the cross is carefully
described, and the metal constituting it left entire. That
portion of the cross that falls on the plate itself, as well as
that which crosses the. staff, is to be blacked like the hours
of a clock, and the remainder of the plate silvered, by which
means it will be visible at a quarter of a mile distance, and
 the circle itself will easily be bisected at half a mile.
     There are two thin brass cheeks riveted to the back of
the circle for the purpose of clipping the staff, and for
moving the vane agreeably to the direction of the observer.
    The clamp usually fixed to the front staff should be flush
 with the sides, in order that the vane may have its full
 range without obstruction; which is not the case with many
 of those now in use.

                       To   Mr. Tilloch.
Sir,      That    surprising individual, Mr. John Gough of
Middleshaw,       who though unfortunately deprived of sight,
from    his  infancy I believe, has in a remote corner of the
kingdom, acquired a deep knowledge of mathematics and
natural philosophy, which he often displays in Mr. Nichol
son's respectable Journal, and who in the 1st and 2d octavo
volumes of that work, sueeessfully'combated the subtilties
of a most learned LL.D. and F.R.S. who had shortly be
fore availed himself (rather unfairly) of his facilities of ac
 cess to the PhilosophicalTransactions,     to run down that ex
 cellent and unparalleled work on Sounds, the " Harmonics"
 of the late Dr. Robert Smith of Cambridge; has in the last
 number of Mr. Nicholson's Journal, given a paper, wherein
 he shows by an experiment on a musical string, \one end of
 which was fastened to the top of a table, and the other to a
 small cylinder of wood held in the hand, and by which the
 string was tight pulled, at the same time that it was set in
 vibrating motion, that the pulses excited in the ear by the
 sound, do not proceed direct from the siring, as most if not
 every writer on acoustics have represented to be the case,
 but from the fibres of wood in tlie table, agitated by the vi-
 hration< of the string, analogously to the strokes of a drum
 stick on its parchment cover, or the fingers on that of a
 tamborine, but repeated with extreme quickness and regu
 larity. In further confirmation of this ingenious conclusion
  of Mr. Gough, I beg to mention to your musical readers,
  a fact, which without doubt many of them must have often
  noticed, viz. that a tuning fork gives out no audible sound,
  after th.it excited by the mere stroke given to   it, while held
  in the hand; and that     it   essential, to rest the end of its
                                 is
  handle on    a  table or firm piece of wood to hear its tone;
  and     inorder that this tone may be clear and perfect,  it   is
  best to have the end of the handle of tuning-fork wrought
                                           a
  to  a blunt point, that
                        it    may have only one, and that a   firm
  bearing on the wood, for       ifknobbed or flat at the end, as
  they are too often made for sale, they are apt to chatter or
  give    jarring and interrupted sound.
          a
      Mr. J. J. Hawkins of Great Titchfield-street, is  mentioned
 in   the article Concert Pitch in Dr. Rees's New Cyclopaedia,
   to have applied this principle, ©f the tuning fork exciting
   other bodies to sound, to avoid the disagreeable sight, sound
   and effects of  a tuning-fork when struck on table or other

excited in the teeth and bones  of the jaws of the operator,
which effectually give him   the sound, without its being
audible to any other person, and who has also his two hands
at full liberty for the necessary tuning operations.    Mr.
Hawkins did, and perhaps now does, manufacture these
useful and elegant mouth tuning-forks for sale.
    The above facts tend strongly to show, that improvements
in the strength and quality of tone in our stringed instru

their soundness and perfection of framing and workman
ship,    thing indeed pretty well understood in the trade of
         a
instrument-making,      and not in the temper or quality of the
metallic strings that are used to excite the wood to sound,
as Earl Stanhope has for        long time fondly imagined, and
                                   a
has  I am told, gone so far as to the manufacturing of steel
wire on purpose, at his country seat, for the making of in
struments with single strings that are to out-do those with
two or three that are        common use, and to whom perhaps
                            in
these hints may not be unimportant.
   Mr. William Burdy's Patent Scheme, (see the Monthly
Magazine for last month,            573,) of covering both metal

and specific gravity, with the view " to increase the power
of vibration," though he says "           found, that the purity

platina wire) used,"      Iam inclined to consider as very liable
to fail of its professed object, on the principle above stated            ;

V. On     the Nomenclature   of the New London Pharmacopoeia,
                             Mr. Tilloch.
        I
                         To
Sir,       entirely   coincide with the observations of you/
sensible correspondent, respecting the pedantic affectation of
the Nomenclature of the New Pharmacopoeia, as well as the
danger that must result from the use of appellations so
nearly resembling each other, both in writing and sound,
 applied to substances so very different in their properties.
 Within mv own circumscribed range of observation, I am
 acquainted with two instances where five grains of corrosive
 sublimate were actually taken instead of the same quantity
 of calomel, in consequence of the omission of, or inatten
 tion to. h sub. The persons, being adults, recovered; but
 to a child the consequences would probably have been fatal.
 It is much to be wished that those to whom the care of the
 public health is intrusted by charter, would be more careful
 how they permit the frivolous pretension to neology to in
 terfere with a conscientious discharge of their important duty.
    The absurdity of a proposition may sometimes be il
 lustrated by transferring it to a science different from that in
 which custom has in some measure established it.         It will
 not be denied that the theories of medicine, or the manner
 of talking concerning the causes of disease, are as frequently
 changed as those of chemistry.         Now, sir, suppose the
 College of Physicians, by the authority vested in them,
 were every ten years to change the names of the various
 diseases to which our frail bodies are liable; that gout,
 for example, should be termed tenesmus, hecause it prevents
 its victim from moving, or any other equally absurd alter
 ation, every person must be sensible what confusion would
 be the result.
     I do not deny that the adoption of new appellations has
 tended to the improvement of chemistry, became many per

40                   General Method     for   determining
sons have been        induced to inquire whether these names were
imposed with          propriety.      But why should these changes
be perpetually         introduced into a science the business of
which is with        life; to which chemistry is subservient only
 in a remote degree?           Diseases were cured before chemical
 remedies were invented.            And where is this alteration of
 names to end ? If the discoveries of Mr. Davy are esta
 blished, the names of the alkalies are already absurd. Why
 might not these three substances be termed ammonia, kali,
 and barilla? They are very distinct, and convey to our minds
 no adventitious ideas.           And the substances they designate
 may remain either in the vegetable or mineral kingdom, as
 future experience may determine, without any occasion to
 alter their denominations.
      In looking into Duncan's late edition of the Pharmaco
 poeia, we find five and even six names applied to one sub
 stance; some of which are current in London, others in
 Dublin, and another kind only is understood in Edinburgh.
 Suppose an individual were to pass by a different name in
 each of, these capitals, the law would find it some difficulty
 in recognising him.
     The subs and supers bear some resemblance to the apt
 and the macs and the o's, by which certain nations at
  tempt to indicate family affinities, but every one knows the
  confounding        of individual personality thence resulting;
 and that if you are in search of a Mr. O'Flannagan, you
 must not only designate him by his patronymic, but also
 his christian name, to which it is very requisite to add that
 of the county, the village, and the hamlet where he was
 born, and perhaps his numerical order in the series of births
  of his prolific progenitors.                               Onomos.

                            By M. Laplace*.
 The        present method will be divided into two parts : in the
  first part we shall give the means of obtaining nearly the
  perihelion distance, and the instant of the passage of the
  comet by this point : in the second part we shall determine
  precisely all the elements of the orbit, supposing the latter
  to be nearly known.

other  : we should embrace within four observations an in
terval of 30 degrees, and within five observations an inter

comprehended between the observations must always be the
larger the greater the number, in order to diminish the in

   If the number of observations is an odd one, we should
fix the epoch at the instant of the mean observation, which
will dispense with our calculating the parts independent of
z, in the two preceding formulae ; for it is visible that these
parts     are respectively equal to the longitude and to the la

we shall select the second comet discovered by M. Mechain
in 1781, and the orbit of which he calculated according to
this method : the observations which this learned astrono
mer chose for this purpose, are referred to the same hour of
the day, viz. 8h 29' 447 mean time at Paris : the following

in which «¦is the demi-circumference, or 3,14159265, and Tthe duration of
 the sidereal revolution of the earth, or 365 days 256383. V being given, it
 is easy to calculate t by this formula.     But if t is given, the search for the
 tang { U requires the resolution of these equations of the 3d degree.       In or
 der to avoid this difficulty, astronomers have formed a table of value of I in
a parabola in which D will be equal to unity, and from this table when once
calculated, we may extract the values of U\ t being known.            This is what
we call a table of the motion of comets.         We may supply the place of this
Cable by resolving the equation (1) by some trials.                            As

     46               General Methodfor determining
        As we have in this particular case I7 b, we must employ
     the equations (l), (3), and (4). These three equations give
                            x = 0,39107,
                            y = 2,258355,
                            r = 0,9755798.
        These values satisfy the equation (2) as much as we can
     expect of an equation which cannot be very exact on ac
     count of the little movement of the comet in longitude.
    By substituting them in the expression of P, we find
                         P =  0,185628.
        The negative sign of P makes known that the comet has
     not yet attained its perihelion.    We afte wards find the
    perihelion distance D = 0,9583509, and the anomaly u of
     the comet j equal to 15° 16" 24", which answers to 10 days
    40334: from which it follows that the perihelion passage
    took place on the 29th of November at 18h 10' 34",
    mean time at Paris.     Having thus obtained nearly the pe
    rihelion distance and the instant of the passage of the comet
    by this point, we may correct them by the following me
    thod, which has the advantage of being independent of an
    intimate knowledge of the other elements of the orbit.
    Exact Determination    of the Elements of the Orbit, when
       we know pretty nearly the Perihelion Distance and the
       Instant of the Passage of the Comet by this Point.
        3. We shall select three observations removed from the
     comet: by afterwards setting out from the perihelion distance,
     and from the instant of the passage by this point, deter-
/    mined by what precedes, we shall easily calculate the three
     anomalies of the comet, and the three vector radii corre
     sponding to the instants of the three observations ; let v, if
     and t/' be these anomalies, those w hich precede the passage
     of the comet by the perihelion being necessarily supposed
     to be negative : further let r,        /'   be the corresponding
     vector radii of the comet, rf v and t/'v will be the angles
     comprehended between r and         /  and between r and r1'; let
     U be the first of these angles and U' the second.

    observed of the comet ; 8,      3", its three geocentric latitudes,

    three heliocentric longitudes of the comet; ta,m',vr", its
    three heliocentric latitudes.    This being done,
        We will imagine the letter at the centre of the sun, the

the difference      of the geocentric longitudes of the sun and
the comet ; by afterwards adding the logarithm of the co
sine of this angle with that of the cosine of the geocen
tric latitude 9 of the comet, we shall have the logarithm of
the cosine of the angle STC; we shall therefore know in
the triangle STC, the side ST or R, the side SC or r, and
the angle STC; we shall thus have by rectilinear trigono
metry the angle CST; we shall afterwards have the helio

   The angle TSC is the side of a spherical rectangular
triangle, the hypothenuse of which is the angle TSC, and
one of the sides of which is the angle or ; from thence we
shall easily extract the angle TSC, and consequently the
heliocentric longitude /3 of the comet.
   We shall have in the same manner or', /S', or" and /3", and
the values of      /3', /3" will show whether the motion of

   If we conceive the two arcs of latitude or and or' united
at the pole of the ecliptic, they will there form an angle

     We shall here observe that the calculation of the tri
 angle STC, gives for the angle CST, two different values,
 viz. CST and 180°; 2dly, STC- CST.           We shall thus
 have two different values for each of the quantities    or,                            j3,

48                 General Method for determining
of the comet will make known the value of CST, of which
we ought to make use, particularly if these two angles
are very different;     for then one of them will place the
comet further than the other from the earth, and it will be
easy to ascertain by the apparent motion of the comet, at
the instant of the observation, which of the two ought to
be preferred.     In a great number of cases, one of them
will be negative, and must consequently be rejected ; but
if any uncertainty remains on this head, we might always
determine the true values of                 /3,

for  (3and /3', the two angles which render V very little dif
ferent from U, and to take for              and /3" the two angles

which render          V
                    very little different from U'.

quantity, for example,             by
                               the fiftieth part of its value, and
we shall find out in this hypothesis the values of UV,
               U'-V';

                       wi'=    U-       V,   n'- U'      - V;
finally, we shall form     third hypothesis, in which,

serving  the  same perihelion   distance as in the first, we shall
vary      by

hypothesis, the values of U V and of U'F'; thus,

determined        by
                 the first approximation, are sufficiently exact
to treat as infinitely small their differences from the true                  :

  indispensable in forming these equations, at all times when
  the terms depending on the second differences may be of
  the same order with those which depend on the first dif

 armpits and thighs. In the summer of last year, on coming
 out of warm bath at Brighton, he discovered an insect on

on December 7, 1811, he had daily combed out from the
 armpits, body and thighs, from twelve to between twenty
and thirty living insects ; and some he picked out of the
skin, as they had tirmly attached themselves thereto;
seeming to have partly burrowed into the skin. He was
induced to use a small-toothed comb, from being remark
ably hairy on the body, thighs, and armpits.                I prescribed
flores sulphuris internally, for him to take as much as his
bowels would bear without operating more than once or
twice daily ; and to use externally a lotion composed of a
strong solution of hydrargyrus muriatus.                On the )Oth,
when I visited him, I had the satisfaction to find the re
medies had produced a good effect, the itching having
abated, and the number of insects daily combed out dimi
nished to about half the former number.
   By persevering in the use of these remedies to the end of
the month, he was free from the disorder.
   On a minute examination of the insect, it appeared to
be nearest in resemblance to the pediculus inguinalis ; being
a smaller and more delicately formed insect than that which
infects the head.
   It is to be remarked, that this gentleman, who is very
cleanly in his person, putting on clean linen every day,
does not remember ever having lice in his head, nor on the
groins.
    In the course of a practice     of 30 years,      I  have not met
with   a similar case : and on      looking into       several authors
find it mentioned in such terms as to induce nie to believe
it to be very uncommon, as few cases of the disease are re
lated.

a second species, " Phthiriasis interna : Vermine interne :

the eyes, earsj anus, urethra, and from the orifice made in
venesection.    This case terminated fatally.
   In conclusion, I would remark that, on touching one of
these insects with oil, it was nearly dead in a few minutes :
which circumstance would induce me to recommend the
trial of such an application for this disease.

VIII.     Reply to   Dr. Kelly's Letter (see our last Number)
    on his supposed Discovery    of an Error in the Nautical
    Almanac.         By Mr. Firminger, late Assistant Astro
    nomer at the     Royal Observatory, Greenwich.
                            To      Mr. Tilloch.
Sir, x should          imagine it is generally understood by the
readers    of your valuable Journal, that whatever
                                                 papers ap
pear in that work without signature, or reference 10 other
authors, are either the composition of the editor, from in
formation received by him, or drawn up by persons imme
diately under his inspection. With this natural impression
on my mind I viewed the article in your Magazine for
October, entitled, " On the Error discovered in the Nautical
Almanac of 1812 by Dr. Kklly," and conceived you had
received the information it contains either from the Doctor
himself, or from some other of your correspondents to whom
he might have communicated                 it,
                                    and that, when     appeared    it
before the public, the article with respect to its general tenor
must be considered as your own.        Knowing that this sup
posed discovery was no discovery at ail, but that the Nau
tical Almanac of 1812 actually appeared in the shape in
which its learned author intended                I it,
                                         was induced to send
                                                    I
you an account of such facts as        believed would clearly
show the truth of what      have advanced
                             I                and    considered
                                                         ;     I
I  was at liberty so to do, under the form in which your
                             D         2                  article

52      Reply to   Dr. Kelly's Letter    on his supposed
article appeared, without being thought to have reflected
on the character or writings or' the supposed discoverer, or
indeed on any one else except the editor, whom I wished
to correct not only in what regards the notice respecting
the Nautical Almanac, but in that which it takes of the
French astronomers in their conduct from copying the
ephemeris of the Nautical Almanac into their Connoissance
des Terns.     A recent communication has informed me, and
must also many others of your readers, that what we take
to be written by the editor, may in fact be the production
of some other person, who chooses to consider himself of
fended at any animadversions on his subject, however in
accurate his statements may appear, without declaring such
subject to be his own, till after the animadversions had been
published.      This circumstance we have now witnessed in
the conduct of Dr. Kelly, who has thought proper to de
clare in your last number, that the article above alluded to
was his own production ; and the reason he gives for the
omission of his signature is, that "it has been considered as
a plain, honest, and unassuming statement, that required
neither vouclwr or signature," a criterion by which your
readers will be enabled in future to distinguish whether the
articles they read are the production of the editor, or of a
 correspondent, to whom they may in some parts allude.
     Whatever may be the opinion of the readers of the Phi
losophical Magazine, respecting the tenor of the article in
 question, I much doubt whether they will entertain two
opinions respecting Dr. Kelly's last communication ; they
 will, I am induced to conclude, consider it as a happy display
 of egotism, and an unwarrantable abuse of persons who
 neither knew, nor could be supposed to know, when they
 were animadverting on articles which appeared in the Phi
 losophical Magazine without signature, that they were ac
 tually animadverting on Dr. Kelly's prodtfetions ; at least
 1 can so speak for myself.        But with whatever impressions
 I wrote my     former    article, those under which I write this
 will certainly   not be   easily mistaken; and since I have been
 considered by Dr. Kelly as imprudent, I shall take the li
 berty of freely discussing the merits of his statements.
     Dr. Kelly says, that " neither was the statement dictated
 in terms likely to give offence, and yet it has called forth
  two letters in animadversion, which are not of the most gen
                          I
  tle tone or texture, and shall therefore consider them as a
  kindof' partnership production."   1     do not know how far a
 man may venture       to  publish his opinions when founded on
  the wild delusions of his imagination, so as to keep within

        Discovery  of an Error in the Nautical Almanac.                53
the    proper boundary of prudence: but certainly in the          pre
sent    case     Dr. Kelly   is most completely mistaken ; for   I can
confidently affirm, that Mr. Groombridge knew no more of
what I had written on the subject before it appeared in
print, than did Dr. Kelly himself.          But as the Doctor has
allowed me a right, I shall take an opportunity of occa
sionally referring to Mr. Groombridge's letter, not only be
cause it has been considered a partnership production;             but
also because, from our long and intimate acquaintance, we
have had frequent opportunities of communicating                   our
thoughts    on  astronomical    subjects.    It was  in one  of  these
communications that Mr. Groombridge noticed to me the
discrepancy in the quantity of the obliquity of the ecliptic as
contained in the Nautical Almanac of 1812, from those of
other years ; and my remarks upon it were, that the uncer
tainty arising from the observations of the Greenwich qua
drant were such, as to render the quantity of that datum
doubtful to many seconds. In confirmation of this state
ment, I shall once more call the attention of your readers to
the paper which I published in ihe Philosophical Magazine
of December 1810; and although I noticed this paper in
my remarks upon the subject in question, I have good rea
son to believe Dr. Kelly has not given himself the trouble
to read it; or, if he has read         it,
                                       he has not thought proper
to notice      it,
               probably  in consequence of its militating against
his own supposed         discovery.     I shall therefore copy so
much as relates to the present occasion, which runs thus
" If we look to the account given in the Lunar Tables, pub
                                                                           :

54        Reply to Dr. Kelly's Letter on his supposed
acquainted with Dr. Kelly's pretended discovery, is it likely I
should have there so particularly noticed the uncertainty in
our knowledge of the actual quantity of the obliquity of the
ecliptic, as we'll as of its secular variation ? To every impartial
reader I think the inference will be evident, without any
further declaration on my part, or without my having in
that paper pointed out that Dr. Maskdyne had given the
obliquity of the ecliptic for the year IS12, from the winter
instead of the summer solstice.
    What a fortunate circumstance would it have been for
Dr. Kelly, had the nature of that communication rendered it
necessary for me to have particularly specified the discre
pancy in the Almanac of 1 8 1 2, with either the subsequent or
preceding Almanac, in proof of what 1 had asserted ! What
a labour would he not have saved ! what calculations avoid
ed ! and what anxiety for the consequences which the ho
nour of such an important discovery was likely to heap
upon him would he not have been relieved from ! For not
withstanding all Dr. Kelly has said of his not being in
fluenced by any motives             of'
                                  vanity       ;  however
                                                   it   is    pretty
                                                                   a
strong argument in proof of the contrary, when we find
him taking all possible pains to make not only his supposed
discovery as much known as he can, but to accompany                          it
with remarks of its vast importance; for can we consider the
following sentence        in  any other point of view
                                                            " was
                                                              :        It
not therefore surprising that          the course of such practice
                                          in
an inaccuracy should be discovered which had escaped the
notice of the principal astronomers of Europe !" and also
in whit other sense can we understand the pains which he
lias taken to make the subject so generally known?               He
culled on Dr. Bwrney, and told him of his message to the
Astronomer Royal.          He wrote to Sir Joseph Banks and Mr.
Vince, communicated             to the Earl of Rosse, and in fact
                               it
it appears he told   it in every one he knew; and yet all this
was done, we are told, without vanity              I
    In speaking of our letters, the Doctor savs, " But not
withstanding their manifest disposition, such              the force
                                                              is
of truth, that all the leading facts            the [his] statement
                                                    in
remain uncontroverted;           and, indeed, wholly untouched.

tical Almanac, that the French and American astronomers
have copied    it, and that
                          I      have discovered it."
    In what part of the letter here referred to, let me ask,
have  1  allowed that an error has been committed                the   in
Nautical Almanac of 1818?              have shown that Dr. Mas
                                          I
kdyne took his obliquity of the ecliptic for that year from
                                                                            the

      Discovery     of an Error in      the   Nautical Almanac.          55
 the observations made with the Greenwich quadrant at the
 winter solstice ; and I have further added, that it is probable
 that the obliquity of the ecliptic for that year might not
 differ much from what Dr. Maskelyne had assigned it to
 be in the subsequent Almanacs ; but no where have I said
 it is so. This must be left for Dr. Kelly to decide from
 observations made with instruments in his own observatory,
if they exceed in accuracy those at the Royal Observatory at
Greenwich ; for till we possess more accurate instruments
than the Greenwich quadrant, from which this obliquity of
the ecliptic was inferred, we must remain in doubt as to
its actual quantity.    If therefore I am correct in stating,
 we can prove no error, I must be allowed to deny my hav
ing admitted Dr. Kelly to have discovered one. " They
allow the French and American astronomers have copied it."
With as much truth, founded on the same argument, may
Dr. Kelly say, that I have allowed not only the French and
American astronomers have copied               it,
                                            but that the Spanish
astronomers, the German astronomers, nay, all the woild
have copied it.    In no part of my letter have mentioned      I
the name or even alluded to the American astronomers. My
allowance therefore of their having copied         or any part of
                                                         it,
the Nautical Almanac, must rest upon an allowance of my
not having contradicted Dr. Kelly's declaration of their
 having copied      and the same may be said of all the world,
                   it;
considering that no denial           an allowance of the fact,
                                       is
which I   cannot on the present occasion grant for           must
                                                               ;   I
confess that   I know not what the American Almanac con
tains, not having seen one for that yea;. Dr. Kelly should
therefore have been      little more cautious when criticizing
                         a
on the word fi'st, as used          Mr. Groombridge, which
                                   by                                   I
conceive, and intend to show, will bear        better interpreta
                                                     a
tion than he has given          that he did not run into error
                             it,
himself   by   amisapplication of words, which         negligence
                                                               a
of reading such letters, or misconception of the subject, had
led him to adopt.      But how shall we reconcile what the
Doctor has just said with what follows,  "but these writers
must contradict something, or what was the use or pretence
of their letters?" Dr. Kelly says, just before, we have
contradicted nothing, and immediately afterwards says, we
must contradict something          what interpretation will this
                                   :
bear? That we wished to contradict something, and have
failed, or that we have contradicted something        The Doctor
                                                               ?
must decide this duplicity of meaning.        Again, the Doctor
says, " Tliey therefore volunteer the French cause, and deny
at considerable length, that their astronomers pretend to
                                   D   4                           original

.   56       Reply to Dr. Kelly's Letter   on his supposed-
    original computation in ihe Connoissance des Terns, although
    the contrary is thus stated in the preface to that work.
    "Les calculs ont ele fails, comme a l'ordinaire, sous l'in-
    spection du Bureau des Longitudes, par MM. Marion,
    Lalande," &c. which in English is this: " The calculations
    have been made, as usual, under the inspection of the Board
    of Longitude, by MM. Marion, Lalande," &c.
       Suppose a person should say, he has calculated the time
    when an event will happen at a given place, and it is
    known that he has derived this calculation from a previous
    calculation of its happening at another place, by the al
   lowance of some quantity to reduce it from the time at the
   first place to that of the latter, could this person be said to
   have calculated such event for the place assigned ?      If it be
   allowed that he could under such circumstances be said to
   have calculated such event for the assigned place, I con
   ceive that what the French have said in the sentence which
    Dr. Kelly brings as a proof of his assertion, is as applica
   ble to their having, in the compilation of the cphemeris to
   their Connoissance des Terns, taken it from our Nautical
   Almanac by. an allowance of the difference of longitude, as
   to any other mode of calculation whatever ; for surely a
   man would not say from such quotation, that the French
   had made their calculations from any one set of tables in
   preference to another: he would indeed admit their having
   allowed the calculation to have been made by themselves,
  but from what tables, or by what means, he could draw no
   inference; with much less propriety therefore could he un
  dertake to say, that such calculations were declared, to be
  original.    Yet this is the language of Dr. Kelly, and in de
  fence of it he has copied the above quotation.         It is well
  known that the French are remarkable for their copious de
  tail. Why have they been so sparing in this instance?
  The instrument, therefore, which Dr. Kelly has brought in
  his defence seems rather a stumbling-block in his own way.
  Dr. Maskelync has been very particular in the preface to
  the Nautical Almanac, in describing by what tables, and
  bv what formula, his epheincrises are derived. If such de
  scription can be found in the French Connoissance des Terns,
  then are we able to say with confidence, that the French
 have committed themselves         or not, according as the case
  shall appear: but no assurance of this can be derived from
 the above quotation.       I have been here adducing arguments
 in proof, that, had I said what Dr. Kellv states of me, viz.
endeavoured to show at considerable length that the French
do not pretend to original matter, he has in my opinion
                                                          brought

brought nothing to contradict it : but the fact                     have    I
made no such attempts, but quite the contrary,                    an                    al
lowance that, had the French declared the ephenieris to be
originally theirs,     I  have shown they are declaring nothing
more than facts, since             has been from tables of their own
                                  it
computation,       that  the   Nautical   Almanac has been          great in   a
measure compiled.       I   have likewise said, that " with respect

Magazine,        which    accuses the French of copying from the

that if   they  have   declared    that  those parts  were actually cal
culated   by   themselves, and not taken from the Nautical Al
manac, they are deserving             censure :" and doubtless,
                                                                               by in
                                       of                           such
case they would be deserving of severe censure, as                   that
means they would impose on the world circumstances as
facts, which are not so.              have further added, that
                                       I                           never    I
saw, or heard anv one say they ever did see, such declaration                            ;
and I   must still affirm the same, notwithstanding Dr. Kelly's
quotation, which       I   cannot conceive          any point of view to
                                                           in
contradict     it,though, as he says, the names of the computers
are specified."
    In commenting on Mr. Groombridge's letter, Dr. Kelly
 seems to catch at          alittle oversight which that gentleman
 made in wording his communication, though its true inter
 pretation   is  easily made out.         No person except those who
 wish to quibble on words, can object to his method of expres
 sion in the sense in which he wishes himself to be under
 stood.     He plainly objects to Dr. Kelly's statement            being     in
 the discoverer, as related to the time of communication, and
 not to the lime       inwhich the discrepancy was first observed,
 asis  evident from his saying he had, long before Dr. Kelly's
 visit to the Observatory, made the subject known both to
 Dr. Maskelyne and Mr. Pond.                    But Mr. Groombridge
 did not communicate this observation of his with such cir
 cumstances as should induce these gentlemen to suppose
 that he considered the safety               the British navy as likely
                                                 of
 to be endangered           by

 head, to be at the trouble of calculating new tables of the
 sun's longitude, right ascension and declination,                 either
 for the use of his own observatory, or for the use of the
  public.    Mr. Groombridge                man too well informed on
                                            is   a
  these subjects to consider the discrepancy             question    in

 other point of view than that of its true point of view, viz.
  that  it
        is   of but little importance to either the astronomer or
 6ailor, whether the Nautical Almanac                 computed with an
                                                                is
                                                                            obliquity

    58         Reply to   Dr. Kelly's Letter   on his supposed
    obliquity of   the ecliptic of 23° 27' 40", or 23° 27' 50". In
    saying thus, I do not wish it to be understood that I mean
    it is but of little importance to the astronomer, whether he
    knows the actual state of the obliquity of the ecliptic within
    these limits; I mean only as relates to the use of the Nauti
    cal Almanac.       Nor do I wish it to be understood that I am
    giving praise to the merits of Mr. Groombridge, though
    considered a partner in this concern : his labours are before
    the public, and from them the public will judge for them
    selves.
       But Dr. Kelly tells us, he should not have noticed either
    of our letters, had it not been from Mr. Groombridge having
    stated    he pointed out the discrepancy in question to Mr.
    Pond when      he first came into office, adding that he (Dr.
    Kelly) can affirm with perfect truth and confidence, that in
    the month of September last Mr. Pond professed himself
    wholly unacquainted with any such circumstance ; and yet
    this gentleman modestly tells us directly after, that Mr.
    Pond told him that he thought he had heard something about
    an error in the Nautical Almanac of 1815 or 1816 (he be
    lieved). If Mr. Pond had not been told something about
    this circumstance, is it likely he would have said he had
    been previously informed of some error ? Dr. Kelly can
    therefore say, that Mr. Pond was unacquainted with           it,
                                                                 in
    no other point of view than that the observations with
    which this information was at first accompanied, were not
    sufficient to impress ready recollection of the circumstance.
                           a
    But had Mr. Groombridge told Mr. Pond he should write
    to Sir Joseph Banks, and other members of the Board of
    Longitude, about his discovery,       Iwill engage to say Mr.
.   Pond would not have so easily forgot the subject of the
    communication.        It  does not appear, however, that the
    subject was so completely obliterated from Mr. Pond's
    memory, that he could not recall      it
                                           ; for   appears that Dr.
                                                  it
    Kelly's visit was on the 1th of September, and Mr. Pond's
                               1
    communication to the Admiralty, on the 25th            ;on the
    sight of which Dr. Kelly might have recalled what Mr. Pond
    had told him, that something had been previously pointed
    out respecting some error, and he would have directly in
    ferred from that communication to the Admiralty, the cir
    cumstance which Mr. Pond had told him was the one
    in question, but which he at the lime alluded to did not
    recollect.     cannot conceive
                   I                 itat all surprising that Mr.
    Pond should have forgotten what Mr. Groombridge had
    said to him when Dr. Kelly made his visit, as Mr. Groom
    bridge says his communication on the subject in question
                                                                was

       Discovery    of an Error in    the   Nautical Almanac.             59
was when Mr. Pond first came into office, five or six months
before the time Dr. Kelly saw him. Therefore, unless Mr.
Groombridge's remarks had been accompanied with any ob
servations of their importance, it is not difficult to conceive
a person, situated as Mr. Pond was in coming into that high
office, forgetting such communications made to him in ge
neral conversation;          and thus I believe the mysterious and
delicate question,      as  Dr.   Kelly callsit,    may be settled with
out any very great         efforts  of conception.
   The paragraph in Dr. Kelly's letter which immediately
follows the insinuation, that either Mr. Pond or Mr. Groom-
                                            by
bridge had committed themselves             a         representation of   a
case upon which the plain statement of facts would not
bear them out, informs us of          a     circumstance the most ex
traordinary    in  his   whole    letter,  and    cannot fail to do him
great  credit  in  as much     as  regards  his  industry as calculator
                                                           a
and his ability at discovery.        I     will state the paragraph in
his own words       :   " When first discovered this error,
                                 I                                        I
made numerous calculations to ascertain its extent."
   Now, notwithstanding Dr. Maskelyne's having stated in
the preface to the Nautical Almanac           in    question, the quan
tity  of the  obliquity     of the   ecliptic  used  in the computation
of that ephemeris, and also given the quantity of apparent
obliquity deduced from         it,    which is     put down for every
third month throughout the year, opposite the first page in
the Almanac; and also given the sun's declination at the
two solstices exactly conformable to that obliquity                  ; yet
Dr. Kelly makes numerous calculations to see               if   it  be so
or not, as   if   he could not believe what he saw, and               was
                                                                     it
necessary for him to make calculations, to know whether the
figures he there found did actually represent what they stood
for. I    take it   for granted, that most people any way con
versant with astronomical calculations, know that the sun's
apparent declination at the two solstices          is    equal to the ap
parent obliquity of the ecliptic at that time and    ;        if in look
ing over the Nautical Almanac, any doubt had" existed in
their minds respecting the quantity of the obliquity of the
ecliptic, used in the computation of that Almanac,              it    na
                                                                     is
tural to suppose the first inquiry they would make, would
be to know     if    the sun's declination at the summer and
winter solstice corresponded with the obliquity of the
ecliptic; and they would therefore compare the apparent
obliquity as given opposite the first page of the Almanac,
with the sun's declination at those solstices;           by    which they
would immediately see whether the obliquity used                     inthe
computation       of   the   Almanac       corresponded     to  what  had

60        Reply to   Dr. Kelly's Letter       on his supposed
been stated to have been used, or whether              it did not. If the
declination did not agree with the obliquity, it would be a
clear proof that some mistake existed in either the assumed
obliquity, or the declination computed from it. But in the
case in question the declination at the two solstices agrees
with the obliquity as it ought to do.
    It seems therefore extraordinary, that Dr. Kelly, who
" has been for many years in the constant practice of
teaching mathematical students to compute the columns
of the Nautical Almanac," should not have been aware of
this circumstance, and thereby evaded the trouble of mak
ing such numerous calculations. It is hard to say indeed,
whether the Doctor's joy arising upon the merit that he
conceived would be attached to his discovery induced him
to actually make these calculations, or the desire of com
pleting the sentence in order to recommend his book upon
Spherics, was the motive for such a declaration ; but, per
haps, this inference may appear a little deficient in candour
towards the Doctor.             Should it be so thought, I can only
reply, it is    in  the  Doctor's     own way of considering things,
as I believe     I shall  by  and   by make appear.
    Whatever might         be  the  reason   which induced the Doctor
to   make  these     Calculations    in preference to the simple com
 parison  of   the   stated  obliquity of the ecliptic with the sun's
declination     at  the  two    solstices, is perhaps immaterial : it
may    be of   more     consequence, in the present view of the
 subject,  to  notice    the merits of his book upon Spherics, to
 which our attention has been directed in the latter part of
 this sentence. We are told, that he believes his " work on
Spherics and Nautical Astronomy is the only publication
where such calculations are particularly exemplified."
    The reader, therefore, would be induced to conclude, from
 such statement, that this book must be a valuable acquisition
 to the computers of the Nautical Almanac, that it contains
numerous examples and illustrations of the method of calcu
lating the various particulars contained in the columns of the
Nautical Almanac. Nay, he would fancy he should meet in
 its perusal, with the methods of computing, not only what
 relates to the sun, but certainly to the moon, from its being
a work of nautical practice, and perhaps of the planets also.
But how much would such a reader be diasppointed,               if, when
 he came to read this valuable composition, he should find
 that not a   single example existed     in     the whole book of such
 compulations   !     and   yet,   after all the  boasted panegyric on
it,  nota   single example strictly speaking does exist of such
 computations.                                             '
                                                                I    shall

        Discovery   of an Error in      the -Nautical Almanac.         61
    I  shall take the liberty of copying all that          I can find in
this book, that     bears the least relation to them.          It is con
tained in an example at page ] 25, and is as follows :
     "Example. On the first of May 1795, the sun's longi
tude was 1 sign 1 1° l' 44", and the obliquity of the ecliptic
S30 87' 51".      Required the rest."
    The solution stands as follows :
                       To find   the Declination.
 As rad.    go3 co. arc
To sine sun's long                            41° 1' 44"      9-8171947
 So is sine sun's greatest declination 23 27 51                9*6000745
 To sine    present   declination               15    9   7    9*4172692
                     To find  the    Right Ascension.
 As cot sun's long                    41°    1' 44"     9*9396053 co arc
 To    rad                                            10-
 So    is cos obliq. ecliptic   .. .   23   27   51     9 9625158
 To tang right ascension ..            38 35 51         9-9021211
      Here 38° 35' 51" turned into time, is 2<" 34' 23" 24"', the
  right ascension in time.
      The above calculation is accompanied with the following
  note :
      "See the Nautical Almanac for May 1, 1795. The
  learner should as an exercise take out the sun's longitude
  and declination for any other day to find the rest, so as to
  make his calculations agree with those of the Nautical Al
  manac."
      There are besides the above, two              more examples, but
   these are to find the sun's longitude            either from his right
   ascension or declination ; which I have           omitted, because the
   sun's longitude is always calculated             as put down in the
   Nautical Almanac, from astronomical tables which embrace
   no less than fifteen or sixteen different equations.                The
   apparent obliquity of the ecliptic is also computed from
   astronomical tables ; and from the sun's longitude and obli
   quity of the ecliptic so found, his declination and right as
   cension is computed by a simple case of a right-angled
   spherical triangle.
       In the example above given, we are not informed what
   obliquity of the ecliptic is to be used, mean ot apparent, nor
                                                                         are

 63        Repfy to -Dr« Kelly's Letter on his supposed
 are we told by what means it is to be come at.             By a re
 ference to the Nautical Almanac of 1795, I find the obli
 quity here given is the apparent obliquity for the 1st of
 April, and is found opposite the first page of that Almanac.
    Although the obliquity of the ecliptic is used in both
 parts of the example, yet in computing the sun's declina
 tion in the first part of that example it is called the sun's
 greatest declination.      The inference from which would be,
 thai the sun's greatest declination was always equal to the
 obliquity of the ecliptic, notwithstanding that in the same
 year the difference in the apparent obliquity of the ecliptic
is not less than 2",4. The plain state of the fact is, that
Dr. Kelly, in this boasted work on Spherics, has given a
 bungled example in a simple case of right-angled sphe
rical trigonometry, the data for which he has taken from
the Nautical Almanac ; and which he now                     declares
to be " the only publication he knows of, where the
calculations of the columns of the Nautical Almanac are
particularly exemplified."         On the modesty of this de
claration   I leave the   reader  to  form his own opinion, re
marking only that,      if it be correct, Dr. Kelly's acquaintance
with publications of this nature is not very extensive.
    I now come to the conclusion of the Doctor's letter j and
upon it I cannot help remarking,' that it appears to me the
highest piece of illiberality of sentiment towards Mr. Pond,
that I have ever seen written perhaps against any man ; for,
if it does not directly, it does indirectly, challenge him with
having employed Mr.Groombridge and myself, whom he is
pleased to consider as partners, to write in defence of his
proceedings, in our reply to the statements contained in the
Philosophical Magazine. The Doctor says, " And thus, sir,
the question might have remained at rest had not his (Mr.
Pond's) mistaken friends imprudently interfered."              And
again   he  says,
                  " I want    neither  auxiliaries nor substitutes,
nor shall I hereafter reply to any."
    Here is an insinuation founded on mere chimerical sup
position, without the most distant facts or circumstance
                                                          **
that could possibly lead to such a conclusion.               Facts,

    With respect to myself, I had neither seen Mr. Pond nor
received any letter from him for six months before the ap
pearance of the statements I gave in the Philosophical Ma
gazine; and as a proof that Mr. Pond was totally ignorant of
what I had done, I shall now publish, by his permission,
a letter he sent me sometime after my letter in the Philoso

   "                    I
     Dear Sir, think every person whose curiosity has
been excited by the supposed error in the Nautical Almanac,
must feel much indebted to you for your communication on
the subject, which I accidentally met with yesterday in Til-
loch's Journal.     Your statement is, I have no doubt, per
fectly correct,  and  has, indeed, anticipated the very little                    I
had intended to say, in a note, whenever a new edition of
the Almanac shall be called for.          I never, willingly, could
adopt  the supposition    that  the  supposed error ever proceeded
from any thing like inaccuracy or inattention, and your
explanation has removed the very little doubt I ever had
upon the subject.

                                                         J. PoND."
   I  shall conclude, that Dr. Kelly's letter, amongst a vast
variety of false conjecture and mistatement, is calculated
to do considerable injury to the credit of the Nautical Al
manac; but I hope a new edition of that work will not be
published till the whole of the former edition 19 sold off ;
nay, I thinkitwould be a reflection on the ability and indefa
tigable care of Dr. Maskelyne to do                it,
                                           perhaps scarcely                      al
lowable to make any alteration in     new edition, unless the
                                               a
facts were established upon which such an alteration could
fairly be adopted *.
 I    therefore trust Mr. Pond will, before he adopts such                        a
measure, fully weigh the circumstances under which our
present knowledge of the quantity of the obliquity of the
ecliptic has been derived; that he will not set aside the work
of so great an astronomer as Dr. Maskelyne, without the
best grounds founded on observation to justify his mea
sure; and that he will not suffer the discrepancy between

    I                                                   purchase of the Nautical
 Almanac for 1812, under the expectation of the publication of    a new edition,
 which, they were led to believe from the account in the Philosophical Ma
 gazine, would soon make its appearance, and no doubt but many more have
 been influenced by the same expectation.      But the circulation of this sup
 posed error in the public Newspapers must necessarily tend to render that
 class of people to whom the use of the Nautical Almanac       is  the most im
 portant, dissatisfied, producinga   doubt on their minds of the accuracy of the
 calculations composing that work for the sailor knows not, nor cares not,
                                     ;

 the   Almanac of 1812, and the two immediately preceding
 and following that period, to lead him to an adoption of
 one quantity in preference to the other, because it has been
 considered inconsistent with itself, and with the deductions
 of the astronomers upon the continent.
    I also trust he will always bear in his recollection, that his
learned and profound predecessor never did a thing hastily
 and carelessly ; that whatever was done, was done with
judgement and deliberation, and founded on the establish
 ment of the best facts which the existing circumstances
 could procure j that if errors arose in his work, they were
 such as were unavoidable, or such as could not be removed
 by the means which he possessed ; and that he always ad
 hered to his own deductions notwithstanding they might
 vary from established authority, unless the means which
 gave rise to such authority were in his own opinion superior
 to those from which his had been derived. A close inves
 tigation accompanied with sound judgement, and a posi
tive adherence to his own deductions, were the leading traits
in the character of Dr. Maskelyne : they will speak for him
more than a thousand flimsy panegyrics : they are the cha
racteristics of a sound and well informed mind.

IX. A      Reply to some Observations and Conclusions in a
    Paperjust published, in the Second Volume of the Medico-
    Chirurgical Transactions, on the Nature of' the Alkaline       ¦
    Matter contained in various dropsical Fluids, and in the
    Scrum of the Blood.        By George Pearson, M.D.
    F.R.S. Physician    in  Ordinary to their Royal Highnesses
    tlie Duke and Duchess of York, and their Household,
    &c. &c.
                         To  Mr. Tilloch.
Sir,    I  was favoured a few weeks ago, by Dr. Marcet,
the author, with the above named paper.          In it I have the
satisfaction to find many of the facts confirmed, and none
contradicted, which I have published in the Philosophical
Transactions 1809 and 1810, on Expectorated Matter and
Purulent Fluids; except with regard to the alkaline impreg
nations.      My experiments informed me that expectorated
matters and pus contain potash neutralized by an animal
substance, or by an acid destructible by fire.         I likewise
found, as I prosecuted my inquiries, that there is the same
                                                              kind

    various dropsical Fluids, and the Serum                of the Blood.       65
kind of alkaline impregnation in the blood, in the dropsy
fluids, in the fluid effused by vesicating with cantharides,
in the fluid secreted from the nose owing to a catarrh, and
even in the urine.         And as I did not find the soda alkali in
a similar state, I concluded that hitherto this alkali had,
probably, been mistaken for the potash. (See our preceding
numbers.)        In the ingenious paper, however, which has oc
casioned this reply, it is asserted that the alkali in combi
nation with the animal matter is the soda ; but it is interred
that potash is also present, not in the state I discovered,
but united to muriatic acid.
    It would not be treating the public justly, if I did not say
that the paper before me contains an inquiry conducted
conjointly by Dr. Marcet the writer, and Dr. Wollaston j as
Dr. Marcet represents, I allow very fairly, to enhance the
credit of his statement.            Considering the power of these
allied opponents, the odds are fearful; but confiding in the
assurance       of lord Bacon, that induction by experiment
equalizes* the mental faculties among different men, I shall
with this palladium obey the summons to the arena  at the
worst issue, with such adversaries it would be glorious even
to fall in the strnggle ;

    To enable the chemical public to judge rightly of the dif
 ferent conclusions,         above declared, concerning the kinds
 and states of the alkalies existing in the animal fluids, the
evidence of the opposing parties must be heard.                         The ad
 verse party, however, have not attempted to invalidate my
evidence, by showing that the conclusions are unjustifiable,
 but have merely exhibited their own experiments and con
 clusions.       This mode of procedure, I apprehend, is not ac
 cording     to  the laws of controversy; and it compels me to
 make a statement of at least some of the most decisive ex
 periments for my conclusions, previously to the examina
 tion of the contravening evidence.
     I. 961 grains of exsiccated sputum, on incineration and
  fusion, afforded 45 grains of saline substances consisting of
  35 grains of cubical crystals of muriate of soda, and the
  rest were spicular and uncrystallized salt amounting to ten
  grains.     These ten grains were separated for distinct exa
  mination. They manifested the properties of alkaline mat-

also liquefied, an effervescence      ensued, with      precipitate of
                                                        a

tartrate    of
             potash."       With nitro-inuriate of platina grain  a
or two of this saline matter produced         a  reddish precipitate^
Now    if muriate of potash, and carbonate or sub-carbonate
of soda had existed, the result must have been soda-lartrate
of potash and muriate of soda or tartrate of potash and
                                        ;
muriate of soda.         This latter result   is not so probable as
the former, or account of the verv large proportion of                   al
kali to any other possible salt.         The quantities, too, were
obviously    sufficient    for producing compound salts deter
minable      bythe eye unassisted with glasses.
    II. By digesting 2500 grains of desiccated sputum in four
pints of alcohol ot spirit of wine, the clear tiricture decanted
from off the undissolved matter afforded on distillation 140
grains of resin-like substance which manifested no alkaline

    A portion of this resin-like substance being mixed with
liquid tartaric acid was subjected to distillation        but neither

muriatic nor any other acid was disengaged. This                 con
                                                                  I
ceive shows that no muriate of potash existed.

    Twenty-five grains of this matter were acted upon             by
                                                                  suc
cessive affusions of nitric acid        ;and on boiling to dryness
and ignition, the deflagration which took place produced
a  charcoal-like mass containing potash.           Hence the alkali
had been united to something destructible by fire.
    According to computation, the 140 grains of resin-like
matter contained 28 grains of potash united to matter de
structible       fire, and 18 grains of muriate of soda, with an
                  by
inappreciable quantity of ammonia and phosphoric acid be
sides the animal matter.         The matter undissolved           by
                                                                 alco
hol, in this process, afforded          byincineration and fusion         a
mass consisting of 23 grains of muriate of soda with              very
                                                                   a
 small proportion of potash mixed with 23 grains of phos
phate of lime, traces of magnesia, iron, and          sulphate; also
                                                        a
a  minute portion of utterly indissoluble vitrified matter. If
potash had existed in union w ith muriatic acid,           must have

appeared in the fused mass left undissolved after digestion
in   alcohol  : but potash did appear in          anaked state after
ignition and fusion of the matter dissolved in alcohol.
    III. By digesting 4000 grains of sputum two pints of    in
rectified spirit of wine, the same results were obtained, ex-
ocptine; that the resin-like matter contained            much larger

proportion of muriate of soda and animal matter.
    IV. Twenty ounces of ropy sputum               by

                                                      ^          pints

   Virions dropsical Fluids, and the Serum oj the Blood. 67
pints of distilled acetic acid afforded, by evaporation of the
clear liquid separated from the coagulated matter, asoft ex
tract. This extract deliquesced, partially, on exposure for
a few days to the air; but it manifested ho properties of
alkali.   By exsiccation, ignition, and fusion of a little of
this deliquesced matter, it afforded an aqueous solution
which precipitated abundantly super- tartrate of potash on
adding tartaric acid ; and a reddish precipitate fell on the
addition of platina solution. Almost the whole of this extract
being exsiccated was digested in rectified spirit of wine, af
fording a blackish tincture after evaporation to dryness,
which became liquid by 2-1 hours exposure to the air.           It
was almost entirely acetate of potash.      I believe acetate of
soda neither dissolves in alcohol        nor deliquesces ; but,
independently of these properties, the alkali united was
proved to be potash.
    I shall call no other evidence from a great mass which
remains in my published papers.         If I were to follow the
example of my adversaries, I should also not trouble my
self to examine their evidence; but as the question cannot
be decided without such an examination, I beg permission
to perform this duty.
              I. Of the Fluid of the   Spina lifida.  ,
    In the ten printed pages of experiments      on this fluid by
 Dr. -Marcet, I can only perceive that there      is evidence for
the existence of an alkaline subcarbonate; yet it is said,
"   Soda may be inferred from the effervescence with acids."
The alkaline matter was treated with alcohol ; and thus it
was separated from the muriate. The alcoholic solution be
ing decanted and evaporated to dryness, a residue supposed
to consist of acetate of soda was obtained, which weighed
between 17 and 18 per cent, of the mass."            Oxyrnuriate
of platina produced    no precipitate.
    I remark, that the first result only shows the presence
 of charcoal acid. 2. The acetate of soda is not, 1 believe,
dissoluble in alcohol, but it is well known that acetate or
potash is so. However, if there be the authority of experi-        -
ment for the dissolubility of acetate of soda in this men
 struum, still the experiment is equivocal.       It was easy for
 the adverse party to have decided this question by the test
 of tartaric acid, provided there was an adequate quantity of
matter for the trial.
    3. I remark, that there beinsi no precipitation with the
platina solution seems to me to prove nothing; as the
 whole quantity of matter treated could not reasonably be
                              E  2                       supposed

6S    -On the Nature    of the alkaline  Matter contained in
 Supposed to amount to more than a small fraction of a
 grain ; too small for the detection of potash by means of
 the platina solution, or even probably by the more sensi
 ble test tartaric acid, which was not used.         Yet the inge
 nious writer has not only inserted soda among the impreg
 nating ingredients of the fluid under examination, but also
 boldly denoted the proportion to the centesimal part of a
 grain.    I shall in another part of this communication, I
 believe, demonstrate that this* analysis does not warrant the
 statement of the composition of this dropsical fluid given
 in such precise terms : for, on the ground of cogent analogy,
 I cannot doubt that one pr more ingredients are present, nut
 not inquired for by experiment, nor enumerated.            Hence,
 not only is the analysis objectionable with respect to the
 ingredients but the proportions.      It is true, in a subsequent
 part of the investigation the deficiency seems to have been
perceived and acknowledged ; but if so, it will not be an
 easy task to justify the publication of perhaps an inaccurate
 analytical statement, in opposition to my experiments which
have not been refuted.
        II. Of the Fluid of the   Hydrocephalus inlernus.
    A few grains of the saline matter of this fluid consisted
of cubic     crystals mixed with spicular and opake globules.
The assertion is several times made, that the spicular cry
stals and opake globules were carbonate of soda  that most
of the cubes were muriate of soda ; but some of the smaller
ones were found to be muriate of potash.            The proofs for
the assertion are from the two reagents I employed in the
same inquiry; namely, tartaric acid and platina solution
for the potash; and " the carbonate of soda was identified,
not only by tests indicative of the absence of potash, bnt
also by its forming rhomboidal instead of prismatic cry
stals, when treated with nitric acid.
    Now, I apprehend our judges will deem this evidence
unsatisfactory ; and that much more decisive proofs will
be reasonably expected.      I beg permission to ask, whether
or not the laborious experiments upon a large scale, which
I instituted, to exhibit evidence of the exclusive existence
of the potash alkali, are to be disproved by the rhomboidal
figure of the crystals, in place of prismatic, seen perhaps
only by a magnifying glass in the quantity of a grain or
two dispersed over a comparatively extensive surface; and
whether or not the absence of potash, indicated by tests
operating upon minute quantities, is unequivocal evidence,
and ought to counterpoise experiments, with quantities af
                                                           fording

  various dropsical  Fluids, and   the Scrum  of  the Blood.    69
fording products, of which no doubt can be entertained.
I do not question the accuracy ; but I hope it is proper to
take a further objection against the competency of the ex
periment asserted, for the presence of soda and absence of
potash.      On the most important point which occurred in
the inquiry, the kind of alkali existing in the fluids, I do
conceive that more experiments, and particularly detailed, are
necessary to effect the dis-proof of what I have published,
and to command assent, that soda and not potash is pre
sent. Is it satisfactory to affirm, that soda was identified,
because the tests did not indicate potash ?      It is quite su
perfluous for me to say to such learned adversaries as I have
the honour of addressing, that an experiment might have
been instituted to have afforded unquestionable proof of
the existence of soda. Such a proof would be the compo
sition of a binate salt, possessing the known properties of
a compound of soda and the acid employed.
    With respect to muriate of potash, that this is present,
is supported only by the observation of smaller cubic cry
stals among larger ones; otherwise it is a mere assertion.
    My last argument is of a different kind from those above
stated.     If carbonate of soda in a large, and muriate of
potash in a small proportion be present, on the addition of
tartaric acid, it is obvious that it is scarcely possible to-
avoid compounding soda-tartrate of potash, and certainly
muriate of soda.      If the learned opponents had produced
these compositions, I must have conceded, at least, that
carbonate of soda existed ; but still it would require other
experiments to determine the state of the potash.
 3.  Of   the  Fluids of Ascites, Hydroihorax,     and Hydrops
                            Pericardii.
    A  saline mass amounting to 4-8 grains, obtained by the
 processes above mentioned,      exhibited clusters of crystals,
 partly cubic, partly octohedral, interspersed with others of
a feathery     or radiating appearance.    The feathery saline
 matter effervesced briskly with acids, and yielded no per
manent precipitate, either with tartaric acid or with oxy-
muriate of platina.        The cubic crystals and octohedral
yielded precipitates with either of the two tests just men
tioned.
    I do not conceive that these observations authorize the
adverse party to contravene my experiments and conclu
sions.     I know from experience, that it is probable the
 feathery crystals even of potash would elude detection, on

"0    On the Nature      of ihc alkaline Matter          contained   in
cipitate, but not permanent. The question naturally arises.
What     was that non-permanent precipitate ?                  I have no
doubt the quantity was too small to enable the question to
be answered even by the hands that performed the expe
riment.
    But the cubic and octohedral crystals yielded precipitates
with either of the two tests ; and hence potash is interred
to exist united to muriatic acid.            I again must appeal to
chemical judges, to determine whether or not the conclu
sion is warrantable; for, 1. Here is no proof of muriate
of potash. 2. It is not even certain that the precipitate
was supertartrate       of potash. 3. Granting that supettar-
trate of potash was produced, it remains to be proved in
what state this, alkali subsisted.
                  4.  Of   the Serum    of   the Blood.
    The saline matter procured from this fluid did not, with,
the platina solution, " produce a precipitate sufficiently di
stinct to be conclusive as to the presence of potash ; but,
by means of tartaric acid, a distinct though not abundant
precipitate was produced."           Further, with nitric acid this
saline matter yielded crystals of a " rhomboidal form."
Again : this matter dissolved in acetic acid, being evapo
rated to dryness, was treated with alcohol and again evapo
rated : " the residue, contrary to my expectation, exhibited
traces of potash ; but the same residue, with nitric acid,
yielded rhomboidal, and no prismatic crystals were seen;"
whilst " potash was easily discoverable in the residue, which
had now lost its deliquescent quality."              I wish to avoid re
petition   of   objections already      offered,      although they are
applicable    in   this place,    and  will   only   remark   : 1. That I
cannot admit the figure of such minute crystals, as a deci
sive properly ; but the kind of nitrate compounded might
have been ascertained by the test of tartaric acid.                 2. The
dissolution    of  the  acetate   in alcohol     is the  most   conclusive
experiment given in the paper before me; and it has pro
duced apparent embarrassment.               Even as performed it is
pretty  determinate,      and   might   have     become an experimen-
tum cruets by prosecuting it a little further.                  We know
thjil acetate   of  potash   is dissoluble    ip  alcohol,   and   there is
no proof that soda united to acetic acid is present ; even
jf such a compound be dissoluble in alcohol. It has been
thought right, however, to assume an hypothesis, or more
 truly two hypotheses, to account for the potash in the men
struum of alcohol ; viz.  1. To imagine that muriate of
potash is present.       9. That it is dissoluble in alcohol.            If
                                                                    potash

 important to have exhibited the state in which it existed.

 posing  it be judged right to receive these experiments .is

                                       the adverse party,      beg                   1
 to claim the right also of opposing the contravening evi
dence above delivered,         stating the results of
                                in                          similar              a

    From this representation,       submit to our judges, whe
                                     I
 ther or not  I  am entitled to object to the enumeration of
 subcarbonate of soda as one of the impregnating ingredients
 of serum, and especially to the proportion denoted in cen
 tesimal parts of    agrain, in     mass amounting to seven or
                                      a
 eight grains, consisting of seven different substances.
 Having communicated merely the information of the
senses* through the intermedium of experiments, the che
 mical world will determine whether or not the opposing
party have demonstrated errors in observation, or illegiti
mate conclusions.        Iam of opinion, that the best founded
 conclusions are but provisional, and of course, that che
 mistry has not yet attained the rank of           science, or at  a
 least not of   a demonstrative science. This opinion seems
just, from    a retrospective view of the varying states of che
 mistry during the last hundred years.       Many of the theo
ries of the illustrious Stahl were for half century admitted   a
as demonstrations of the agency of phlogiston.         That these
doctrines were erroneous, was evinced                          by
                                                  the succeeding
discovery of the agency of oxvgen, especially manifested
by   the ever- to-be-lamented Lavoisier.     And the pneumatic
doctrine   in some parts has lately been rendered doubtful,
if  not exploded, by the wondrous achievements of profes
sor Davy.        Contemplating the prospect of the progres
 sion of this branch of natural knowledge,               offer the           I
 conclusion, that potash, and not soda,          the alkali united
                                                               is

 visional.   That potash does also exist      these fluids, united

    1 cannot close this communication            until I shall have said
a few words concerning the high encomiums on microsco
pic chemistry, accompanied by the bitter philippic against
"   the dismal, large, subterraneous laboratory."             Chemistry
must now, we are told, be transferred to " the comfortable
fire-side of the drawing-room ;" from Vulcan's foul stithy
to my lady's chamber.               This elegant change is to give
"   new impulse to the advancement of the science, and new
schools are to arise under new auspices."                   Most happy
shall I be to find these Eutopian prospects realised.                   It
seems,      however, more than probable, that the successful
impulses already given by the schools of "my very learned
and approved good masters," Cullen, Black, and Fordyce,
will retain the cultivators in the paths now opened. And
with regard to the scene for operations, the privilege of
taste will be asserted ; for that indeed is not disputable either
in chemistry or elsewhere. Becher's taste was opposite to
that of the ingenious new advocates : " Nec quicquam prce
carbonibus, venenis, fuligine, follibus, et furnis valere po
test."  Pliys. Suiter. Prccf. The lord high chancellor of
England not long ago declared in court, that he would                      ,
not pay sixpence for the rapturous notes of Mara or Cata-
lani. This also was a matter of taste, and no one dis
puted : it was only observed by a large majority, that his
lordship had " no music in his soul, and was not charmed
by concord of sweet sounds."  No more.
   The value of a tree is best known by its fruits : and ac
cordingly to inform the judgement of the public by practical
examples ; and as some return for the notice with which
my papers have been honoured, I shall, with your permis
sion, offer for your next number a few remarks on the
publication in general which has produced this communi
cation ; in which, whatever differing opinions may subsist,
I assuredly must admire the ingenuity, and respect the
knowledge, of the honourable antagonists.

Jan.   o and 16.       The       conclusion    of Dr. Herschel's paper
on ihe late comet            was  read.    The Doctor entered into a
very minute investigation of the nature and extent of the
                                                               luminous

luminous matter which surrounded it at some distance from
the planetary b"dy in its centre ; this matter he supposed to
be of a phosphoric nature ; the length of the tail he esti
mated at an average, about the beginning of October,
to be above 100 millions of miles; he described it as
very variable both in length and breadth, and as being a
hollow cone, emitting light on all its sides ; the inner side
he supposed might illumine the planetary body in a manner
somewhat similar to that in which the ring docs Saturn. The
planet which he discovered in the place of its nucleus, he
concludes, shines with its own light, and not with one bor
rowed from the sun. His chief reason for this conclusion,
was the extensive dark space which intervened between the
 cometary envelope and the planetary body. From the great
alterations which took place in the nature and dimensions
of the tail, he was inclined to conjecture that comets may
be formed of nebulae, that those nebula? undergo conden
sation in their approach to our sun, or to some of what are
called the fixed stars, and that in process of time they may
 become regular planets.     On contrasting the appearance of
 the late comet with that of 1807, he was inclined to sup
 pose that of 1811 a much younger comet than the former.
    Jan. 23. A paper by Mr. Campion (communicated by
 Mr. Davy) was read, on the structure of the eyes both of
 man and birds, particularly in relation to that faculty of
 the eye which enables it to adjust its focus to the distance
 of the object. The author examined the different conjec
 tures and theories which have been proposed to account
 for the circumstance, and explain how the eye can have
          images of objects at very different distances. It has
   een generally agreed, that the eye must have some con
 Cerfect
 tractile power ; but the existence of any organ capable of
 such a function has never been ascertained. Mr. C. in ex
 amining the eyes of an eagle, was led to discover the ex
 istence of a small muscle attached to the sclerotica and
 capable of contracting the eye, in a manner equal to effect
 the necessary change in the focal distance. The same organ
 he discovered in some other birds, and hence he inferred
 that something analogous exists in the human eye.           He
 observed, that images pass before the eyes of maniacs as
 vividly and distinctly without any sensible objects, as they
 do over those of some persons from objects within the
 focal distance of their eyes.
    A paper by Count Rumford was also read, on the na
 ture of light. The Count, firmly persuaded that it is of
 great commercial importance to increase the quantity of
                                                           light

  light for men's use,   and that this luminous nothing has no
   more distinct existence than sound, proceeded to make a
  number of little experiments on wax tapers and a photome
  ter. He began by weighing the combustible matter con
  sumed or transformed during a given time, and compared
  the quantity of light emitted in proportion to the wax
  burnt.    In nine such experiments he satisfied himself that
  the light emitted bore no invariable proportion to the quantity
  of combustible matter consumed, but that with small
  tapers, which yielded very little light, there was a very con
  siderable increase of heat.     Here he was induced to make
  some observations on the nature of heat, or heated bodies,
  so far as their luminous qualities were concerned ; all of
 which, he thought, tended to confirm his opinion, that there
 is no such matter in existence as light, and that philoso
 phers may for ever torture their imaginations about its na
 ture and qualities, without ever being a tittle the wiser.
 He observed, that no person ever looked for the nature and
 properties of sound in fulminating powder, and it is equally
 idle to look for those of light in combustible bodies. He
 has however a very philanthropic      and important discovery
 to make, namely, a new invention of his own, a polyflame
 lamp, consisting of a number of burners, with wicks flat
like a ribbon, and so placed one at the side of another that
 the air can pass between them, at the same time that they
 are duly supplied with oil.     The flat wicks arranged in this
manner, side by side, supplied with oil, and covered with
 a large glass which rose several inches above the flame,
yielded as much light as 40 candles ! The Count concludes
with expressing his own liberality in thus publishing his
discovery, and declares himself ready to give every pos
sible information in his power to any person who may
wish to construct such lamps ; but modestly adds, that his
own is not made quite so well as he could wish, and that
his apparatus is still capable of further improvement.
    The Society then adjourned over a week, to meet again
on Thursday the 6th of February,
                      ROYAL   INSTITUTION.
       Mr. Davy's   Lectures on the Elements    of Chemical
                           Philosophy.
    Mr. Davy   delivered  the introductory lecture on this new
coursennSaturday,Jan. 25. He slated, that in former courses
of lectures lie had been in the habit of dwelling more upon
the imperfections than the perfections of the science, coiii

sidering its state as that of infancy, rather than of matu
rity ; but that he was now happy to be able to say, that the
time was arrived when some principles of chemical philo
sophy at least might be considered as fixed, and some im
portant resuits anticipated; that it had gained relations to
the doctrines of quantity, and its experiments were capable
of being submitted to those laws of calculation which can
not deceive, and which had already produced such grand
results in their application to astronomy.
    That if the substances belonging to our globe are con
stantly undergoing changes in their forms and their sensible
qualities, and one variety of matter is, as it were, trans
muted into another, such changes, whether natural or ar
tificial, slowly or rapidly performed, are called chemical.
The object of chemical philosophy is to ascertain their
causes, and to discover the laws by which they are govern
ed.    The ends of this branch of knowledge, said the Pro
fessor, are the applications of natural substances to new,
uses, for increasing the comforts and enjoyments of man,
and the demonstration of the order, design, and intelligent
arrangements, of the system of the earth.
    In taking an extended view of the plan of the lectures,
Mr. Davy said, he should first consider the active powers
producing the phaenomenon of chemical change, and after
wards the substances on which they operate.         The expan
sive power or heat, chemical and electrical attraction, arc
the great causes of decomposition and combination.             In
discussing   the doctrines  of heat, he said  he should  compare
the mechanical hypothesis of its consisting in motion of
the particles of bodies with the idea of its being a specific
 kind.  The first opinion was sanctioned by the authority
of the greatest philosophers of this country, is equally ap
           '
 plicable to the explanation of the phaenomenon, and in
volves the supposition of fewer unknown causes.  Chemi
cal attraction, he said, he should consider as a definite
 power, combining bodies in definite proportions, capable
 of being expressed by numbers.       Electrical attraction pro
 duced many of the same effects as chemical attraction.; and
 electricity, as exhibited by the Voltaic apparatus, is capa
 ble of being made a general instrument of decomposition.
 Mr. Davy referred to the extraordinary effects produced by
this wonderful invention, which, he said, had done as much
 for the higher departments of chemistry as the air pump
 for pneumatics, the microscope for natural history, and
 the telescope for astronomy ; and which had not only pro
 duced, new views in the science to which it particularly
                                                        belonged,

belonged, but which likewise promised to enlighten the
whole philosophy of terrestrial nature.
    In treating of the substances which undergo chemical
changes, he said, he should first consider radiant or ethe
real matter, those which are known only in motion, or by
their effects.   He said, he should discuss particularly the
polarity of light advanced by Newton, and confirmed by
the late experiments of Malus. The solar rays produce
that light and chemical effects, and there is an analogy be
tween the powers of the two solar beams and electricity ;
and crystalline bodies have certain relations to light, like
those of different electrified surfaces; and from new inves
tigations on this subject, the Professor said, he anticipated
a more intimate connexion between chemical and mecha
nical philosophy.
    He divided ponderable undecomposed- substances into
two classes, empyreal and inflammable supporters of com
bustion and combustible bodies; and from ten different
combinations deduced all the phenomena of composition.
They unite, he said, according to uniform laws ; form
definite compounds,      generally crystallized,  and which
may be represented by numbers resulting from the addition
of the numbers representing their elements. As in the
system of the Heavens, gravitation and the projectile force
acting according to constant laws produce the regular and
harmonious motion of the planets, so in the terrestrial cy
cle of events, the repulsive and attractive powers of matter
are in uniform operation, occasion a series of events flow
ing in a happy order, and constantly subservient to the
purposes of life.
    Mr. Davy concluded- his lecture by some observations
on the uses of the science, and the advantages resulting
from the study. From the earliest sera of society, he said,
when metals were produced from rude ores to the know
ledge of the bleaching liquor, chemistry had been con
stantly subservient to cultivation and improvement in the
manufacture of porcelain and glass, in the arts of dyeing
and tanning, and has added to the elegancies, refinements,
and comforts of life.      In its application to medicine, it
has removed the most formidable of diseases ; and as lead
ing to the discovery of gunpowder, it has changed the in
stitutions of society, and rendered men more independent
of brutal strength, less personal and less barbarous. There
is, said Mr. Davy, a double source of interest in chemistry,
that whilst it is connected with the grand operations of na
ture, it is likewise subservient to the most common pro
                                                       cesses

                             Intelligence.                      77
cesses as well as the most refined arts of liFc.         New laws
cannot be discovered in it without increasing our admira
tion of the beauty and order of the system of the universe 
no new substances brought to light without being, sooner
or later, applicable to some purposes of utility.         The per
fection of chemical philosophy is connected, said the Pro
fessor, not only with our national riches but with our
national glory.        All new knowledge leads to new power,
and physical and moral science are ultimately connected.
An accurate acquaintance with the laws of nature leads to
a deeper feeling of the power and wisdom of the Author of
nature, and philosophy thus becomes the exalted instru
ment for connecting faith and reason.

XII.      On the Locallliss of certain Reliquia,                 or extraneous
    Fossils, found in Derbyshire. By the late                 Mr. William
    Martin, F.L.S. &c.
                                 To   Mr. Tilloch.
          T
Sir,     In     the work, which         I have recently published on the
Petrifactions        of Derbyshire*, the localities of the species
described are given with as much exactness as appeared to
me, at the time of writing, necessary for the general intor-
mation of the student and collector of these bodies. Thus,
in the first part of the volume, I have constantly noted the
mineral tract and usual geographic situation^ of each fossil,
as,    "  common in limestone near Buxton;"  " found near
 Chesterfield, in beds of argillaceous ironstone," ike. And
in     the second part, which contains the systematical ar
rangement of the species, I have been more particular in
 pointing out the nature of the seat in which the petrifaction
 has been found, as " Sedes : strata vetusta, calcaria." 
 " Sedes: strata vetula, argillacea, ferfifera, &c. &c. It
 has occurred to me, however, since the volume was printed,
 that something more might have been added, with advantage
 to this part of the undertaking;                 and that, in a geological
 point of view, notices of the particular situations, {locaspe-
 cialia,) as well as of the immediate stratum, in which the
 fossil has been discovered, will be found useful appendages
 to the specific diagnosis, or general description of the species.
 All, who have attended to extraneous fossils in the field, as
  well as in the cabinet, must have observed, that the different
  species, as I have elsewhere remarked J, abound in particular
  Rocks, especially of those which are properly denominated pe
  trifactions, and though not wholly confined to, are more com
  mon in, particular strata than in others, though of the same
  substance and constituting a part of the same soil, or series of
  mineral beds : thus in Derbyshire the shells, corals, &c,
  which abound in the first limestone stratum, or that which
  immediately follows the shale tract, are by no means frequent
  in the second limestone, or that which lies under the first
  toadstone.         Nor are the petrifactions of the second limestone
  common to the first or third, &c. ; though all these strata
  are evidently constituent parts of the same formation.
  Again, in the coal soils of this county the constituent strata
   of gritstone, ironstone, shale, &c. may all, I think, be
   characterized by their respective                 vegetal fossils.         That
   much practical utility in geology and mining might be the
   result of this circumstance, when the diffeient species of

have lately had with your most ingenious correspondent
Mr. Farey, whose knowledge of the stratification of this
         J.
island       unquestionably great.
              is                        This gentleman has well
pointed out to me the utility as well as the practicability
of distinguishing the various strata in a soil, or series of
strata,       by
             their organic contents.     And regret, that in the
                                                   I
first volume of the publication above mentioned             have not   I
paid more particular attention to this point that is, not          ;
only      bynoting the immediate stratum (whenever              have        I
ascertained it), in which the species has occurred, but also
the particular situations (loca specialia) where               to be   it   is
found     ;as these in many instances would give others an
opportunity of determining the immediate, where have                        I
only been able to speak as to the general soil.           In the se
cond volume of the work in question, which                  am now I
 preparing   for  the  press,   will
                                 it  be my  aim   to  give the geo-
1ogical  as  well  as the  geographical situation   with  more pre
cision.     The following additional remarks to the localities,
enumerated in my first volume, may not only be useful to
the purchasers of the work, but also induce geologists to
pay some attention to         subject, that has been hitherto so
                               a
much neglected.                am, sir, your obedient servant,

     I  hope that geologists will not in future be content merely to say,
                                                                                           '
that such a rock " abounds in Belcmnites, Terebratula, Echinites, ice."
or that such        aformation of strata " contains Ammonites, &c." Such in
formation can be of little use, unless the species are well characterized.
This, in many instances at least, maybe done with accuracy; and                      it   is
evident, that almost every practical inference that      isto be deduced from
a knowledge of reliques, will depend in     a   great measure on their being
specifically distinguished.
 f    [On an application to Mr. Farey, and a reference to his Correspondence
 with the able and lamented Author of this Letter,  it  appears, that the draft
 of it was prepared between the 17th of July and the 7th of August 1809,
 although only part of the first page seems to have been transcribed by Mr.
 M. in the copy lately sent to me by his Friends: which suspension and delay,
 seem to have originated in the wish that Mr. M. had, first to avail himself
 of the information to be derived from the manuscript Mineral Map and
 Section of Mr. Farey's, since mentioned in the Note p. xxi. of the Pre
 face to Mr. F.'s Derbyshire Report, vol.   i.  and on which account also, he
 countermanded       aSection that had been engraven (before he knew Mr. F.)
 and suspended his other proceedings with respect to the promised Supple
 ment to the 1st vol. of " Petrificata Derbiensia,"  (as appears by his Letters
 to Mr. F.), but unfortunately, he did not continue in health or live to re
 ceive the Map and Section alluded to.     I   have thought these particulars
might be worth stating respecting this worthy man, in addition to the Me
 moirs of him in the " -Monthly Magazine" for January last, vol. xxzii. p. 556.
I  have availed myself of Mr. Farey's assistance in three or four corrections
or suggestions (in parenthesis) as to the identity of particular strata ^.and             I-
gladly embrace this opportunity further to mention, that Messrs. White and
Cochrane, in Fleet-Street, who continue to sell Mr. Wm. Martin's two work*

        the gravel was probably their original bed.                   About
        four years ago my friend, the late Mr. S. Buxton,
        surgeon, showed me some specimens of woodstone,
        which a miner had brought him from a level near Cas-

        stated, that theEntrochitae occur more or less through
        out our limestone tracts.           This remark, though per
        haps literally true, ought to have been given with cer
         tain limitations. The great mass of Entrochal remains,
        found in Derbyshire, belongs to our first limestone, and,
        I believe, chiefly characterizes the lower beds of that
        stratum ; yet none of the other lower strata, consti
        tuting what may be called the great ancient limestone
        tract*, are wholly destitute of Entrochites, as far as
        my own observations have extended.                    I have found
        Entrochites in the second limestone in beds of dun-
        stone, east of the Clump of Firs on Masson Low near
        Matlock, in the rock at the back of the old Hall, at
        Matlock Bath: and in the third limestone stratum, in a
        small quarry nearBuxton, between the Lover's Leap and
        the Ashburne road (3d or 4th stratum?); in the quarries
        near Hasling-House, on the right hand of the road from
        Buxton to that place (3d stratum ?).              I have memoran
        dums, which note my having found Entrochites in the
        4th limestone, between Bakewell and Buxton, and on

smallest of the positive angles to which it can belong.       In

observe that <p and tang p ought to be positive, and thus,

will be the position of the ascending node if the motion of
the comet be direct ; but if this motion be retrograde we
                        order to have the position of this node.

above, equal to 0,958359, and the instant of the perihelion

 retrograde   motion.
    We shall afterwards form a second hypothesis, in which,
 by preserving the foregoing inslant of the perihelion pas
 sage, we shall increase the perihelion distance by 0,003.
 We shall find in this hypothesis
                 ml   33' 53", n' =  12' 54".
    Lastly, we shall form a third hypothesis, in which, by
 preserving the same perihelion distance as in the former, we
shall vary by od 25 the instant of the perihelion passage,
 which will thus be fixed on the 29th of November at 12h
 10' 31"; this hypothesis will give
                   m" = 48' 18", n" = 27' 13";
 we shall extract from these values the two following equa
tions,             3102 . u  1829 -t = 1069,
                    1760  . u     617  -t  1016,
which    gives
                  U = 0,881406, t = 0,910400 :
hence we conclude
           the true perihelion distance = 0,9609951,
and the true instant of perihelion passage, the 29th of No
vember at I2h 42' 46" mean time at Pans.
    In order to ascertain if these elements are very accurate,
we may calculate the corresponding values of m and n, and
see if they are null or very small ; now we shall find that
in the present case these values amount only to a small
number of secoods ; for the corrected elements give, for in
stance, for the first and last observation,

                                        j
accurate, we shall extract from them by means of the for
mulae (e) and (/) the position             of the ascending node,
and the inclination of the orbit, and we shall find
         Place of the ascending node = 770 22' 55".
            Inclination of the orbit         = 27° 12' 4'*.
    In order to determine the place of the perihelion, we shall
observe that Cj= 269° 15' 58", from which we extract
269° 20' 50", for the distance from the comet to its node,
reckoned on tht: orbit, at the instant of the third observa
tion : on adding to this distance the anomaly v'' which the
comet has traversed by a retrograde motion since Us peri
helion passage, we shall have 298° 40' 12", for the distance
from the perihelion; reckoned on the orbit, to Us ascending

 The motion of the comet is retrograde.
    The supposition of the parabolic motion of the comets is
not rigorous; it is even infinitely little probable, consider
 ing the infinite number of cases which give an elliptic or
 hyperbolic motion, relative to those which determine the
                                                                   '
parabolic motion.       A comet moved either in a parabolic or
hyperbolic orbit     will  only be visible once ; we may sup
 pose, therefore,    with   probability, that comets which de
 scribe these curves, if some of them exist, have long ago
disappeared, so that nowadays we only observe those
which, being moved in re entering orbits, are incessantly
brought back to intervals more or less large, in the regions
adjoining the sun.        If they have been observed with pre
 cision, and the visible arc of their orbits be considerable,
we may determine wiih tolerable accuracy, by the following
method, the time of their revolution.
    For this purpose let us suppose that we have four excel
lent observations which embrace nearly the whole visible
part of the orbit ; and (hat we have already determined by
the foregoing article, the parabola which nearly satisfies
these observations.       Let v, v, v", v'", be the anomalies cor
responding    to  these   observations; r, r', r'', r*", the corre
sponding    vector  radii ; take also
            V-v=U,         v"-v = U', v"'- v = U".
This being done, we shall calculate by the foregoing ar
ticle, with the parabola w hich nearly represents these obser
vations, the values of U, U', U", and those of V, V't V "j
take therefore
       U-    r=m,       V   -V     = m; 17"    -V     = m".
We shall afterwards vary by a very small quantity the
                     n, U"   -V
perihelion distance in this parabola; take then
         U- V-                       = n, U"    -   V" = n".
We shall afterwards form a third hypothesis, in which,
by preserving the same perihelion distance as in the first,
                                                                we

                        the Orlils of Comets.                     89
we shall vary by a very small quantity the instant of the
                             -V=                - V"
perihelion passage : take in this hypothesis,
         U-     V=   p,  U'             p',  U"         = p".
This being done, with the perihelion distance and the
instant of the passage of the comet by this point, found in
the first hypothesis, we shall calculate the angle v and the
vector radius r, in the supposition of a very eccentric el
lipsis ; so that by calling e the relation of the eccentricity
of this ellipsis to its half great axis, the difference 1  e
is equal to a very small quantity, for instance to -jL-. In
order to have the angle v, in this supposition, it will be
sufficient to add to the anomaly v, calculated in the para
bola, a small angle, the sine of which is
         -rV (I  e).tang £ v. (4 3.cos* $v 6.cos<    | v) ;
    The new anomaly v being thus known, we shall substi
tute it in the equation
which    is the expression of the vector radius in a very ec
centric ellipsis : by this means we shall have the corre
sponding vector radius r. We shall calculate in the same
way v', r'; v", r" ; v", r'"; from which we shall extract
 U, U', U", V, V,       V;    in this case take
           U-    V= q,     U'-     F'= q\ U"-F"= q".
    Finally, let us call u the number by which we ought to
multiply the supposed variation in the perihelion distance,
in order to have the true one; t the number by which we
ought to multiply the supposed variation in the instant of
 the perihelion passage ; and & the number by which we
 ought to muhiplv the value supposed for 1 e; we shall
form the three equations
     u.(n m     ) + t.(p m       ) + l.{q m ) + m = O,

     u.{n"m) + t.(p"m") + S.{q'  m") + m"= O.
    We shall have, by means of these equations, the values
 of «, i and S, from which we shall extract the true perihe
 lion distance, the true instant of the passage by this point,
 and the true value of 1 e.         Let D be the perihelion di
 stance,   and a the semi great     axis;  we shall have a   =  -
from which it is easy to conclude, that the time of the re
 volution of the comet will be equal to the number of sidereal
years expressed     by          -.   We shall    have   as   in page
                                                                 85 j

ascending node and of the perihelion.
   When the arc observed of the orbit of a comet is con
siderable, and particularly when it extends beyond 90° of
anomaly, where the ellipticity begins to become perceptible;
it will be desirable that we should have four observations
made with all the precision which we ought to expect from
modern astronomy, taking care to verify the position of the
stars to which we refer the motion of the comet.
   Whatever may be the precision with which we strive to
make these observations, they will always leave some un
certainty as to the time of the revolution of comets : the
most accurate method for determining                      it,

the resemblance of the elements of the two parabolic orbits
determined        these observations, will make known the
                 by
identity of the comet, and we shall have,         the difference by
of the instants of the perihelion passage, the time of its re
volution and its grand axis.       was thus that the period of

sided ; had taken no medicine.         About the 28th, reddish
spots appeared on her arms, and small tumours scattered
over her thighs, which disabled her from walking.              So
complained of profuse perspiration on her breast, particu
larly at night.    I directed the warm bath with alteratives.
    August 7th. Notwithstanding the treatment, the sym
ptoms became much aggravated ; the reddish spots had
spread upon her face.        1 requested  my friend to confess
whether he had not contracted the venereal disease; to which
he answered in the most solemn manner in the negative.
    On the 14th I required a consultation, and met one of
the most eminent physicians in Dublin.           After examining
the patient, he mentioned our suspicion to the mother of
the lady, that the disease was venereal.           It was deemed
advisable to have a surgeon in consultation, and that we
should meet the following day.        In the evening I visited a
patient convalescent from fever, from whom 1 heard that a
 Mrs. M. was dangerously ill, not only from a disease which
 she had contracted at the time of her iying-in, but also
from a very sore mouth.        On inquiry, it appeared that she
was attended in her accouchement by the same gentleman
who attended my patient.
     On the 15th we met; and that consultation removed
 every doubt of the nature of the disease; and as she did not
 receive it from her husband, 1 suggested to the medical
 gentlemen that the accoucheur might have conveyed the
 infection by his hand. That mode was deemed possible,
 though not very probable ; and our opinion to that effect
 was communicated to the accoucheur.
     18th. All that train of misery incident to supposed con
 nubial infidelity, aggravated by the sufferings of a loathsome
 disease, must have been the fate of my patient, if she and
 her husband had not had proper mutual confidence and a
 friendly reliance on my further investigation.        I met Mrs.
 M.'s brother, with whom I was acquainted ; and anxious to
 vindicate the character of my patient, I told him my su
 spicion of his sister's disease ; and asked him, whether I
 could with- propriety mention my suspicion of the disease
 to Mr. M. He answered in the affirmative, and introduced
 me to Mr. M. I related to that gentleman the situation of
 my patient, and requested to know the disease his wife was
 labouring under, and the time of her delivery.            He said
 he lay-in on the 22d of May 1810, that the accoucheur
 was treating her at present for cancer in the womb, or a
 liver complaint.       I submitted my opinion that it was the
 venereal disease, and also that she might have been infected
                                                                at

    92         Remarkalle   Cases  of Venereal Infection.
   at the time   of her delivery, the accoucheur conveying the,
   infection by his hand.      He added, he suspected her dis
   ease to be venereal, and had mentioned that suspicion to
   his wife frequently.   I was introduced to the lady; and after
   examining her, I became more confident in my opinion (as
   there were buboes in her groins). I advised Mr. M. to have
   a conversation with the accoucheur, as to the nature of the
   disease.   In consequence of this, he (Mr. M.) called a
   consultation of the same medical gentlemen, with the ac
  coucheur, who met on the 19th. The surgeon before the
  consultation called me out of the room, and communicated
  what the accoucheur had informed him of that morning;
  namely, that he had contracted the venereal disease in his
  finger in the course of his practice, and had conveyed this
  disease in that manner.      It was deemed advisable, and even
  indispensable, for the accoucheur to confess that he was the
  cause of this severe ailment to those ladies; which he com
  plied with by letter, not only to these ladies, but to others
  who had been diseased in like manner.          Meaning to view
  the subject merely as an instructive medical report, suf
  fice it to say, that upon a full and legal investigation, it was
  deposed on oath by a medical gentleman, in behalf of the
  accoucheur, that he had contracted the disease in the course
 of his practice, about two years previous to the preceding
 unfortunate event; that he had undergone a complete course
 of mercury, and used even a larger quantity than is usual,
 and that he conceived himself incapable of communicating
 the disease ; that previous to that gentleman's attending
 my patient, a window sash had fallen on his finger, which
 produced a sore; that this sore became a venereal one, and
 infected the ladies before he was aware of its real nature.
The child of the first lady was weaned on the 15th; after
 wards spoon fed, and continued healthy.         The other child
was transferred about the 19th to a sound healthy nurse.
In a month a rash appeared on the head of the child, which
in a little time spread over the body, and remained ano
malous for a month, but afterwards became distinctly sy
philitic, and which yielded to the influence of mercury.
Since the occurrence of the above, I was called to attend a
lady, who after exposure to cold complained of acute pain
of ihe right side, shooting to the scapula, causing difficult
and impeded respiration ; cough and thirst urgent, want of
appetite, tongue foul and blackish, pulse quick. She never
was confined by sickness, or stood in need of medicine.
Married four months.        These febrile pulmonary symptoms
yielded in a week. After three weeks, I was again requested
                                                                to

  Geological Oiservations in Yorkshire, Derlyshire,             &c.   93
to see this lady. She now complained of sore throat with
difficult deglutition.       On inspection, there appeared slight
inflammation of the tonsils extending to the palate, which
continued stationary about a fortnight, without any other
symptom of disease; when, during the use of the warm
bath and gentle diaphoretics, venereal blotches on the fore
head and nodes on the shin bones arose.                  It appeared on
investigation, that the lady had contracted the disease from
her husband, who had had the disorder previous to his
marriage, and who had been apparently though not radi
cally cured.       Relating this case to an eminent surgeon,
he mentioned that a patient of his, a lady, who had con
tracted the venereal disease in her accouchement from the
above-mentioned accoucheur, had no other symptom but
what first showed itself in the throat.

Sir, When           the paper which you have done me the ho
nour    to copy from the Philosophical Transactions,                into
your    last   Number,     p. 2fi,  was    sent  to Sir Joseph   Banks,
but two or three sheets of my Derbyshire Report had been
printed : since which period, by the many comparisons of
my travelling and other notes and mineral maps, during
the printing of that volume, from the letters and com
munications of my friends, and two journeys which J made
into Yorkshire since the Report was published, some hew
lights have been thrown on the north-eastern part of the
great Derlyshire Denudation, the particulars of which I
am anxious to submit without delay to your geological
readers, in the hope, that some of them will be able and
disposed freely to communicate new facts, and verifications
or corrections of those which I have already, or am now
about to mention, in order, that the remaining difficulties,
                                                                    with .

  94            Mr. Farey's       Geological Olservations
 with regard to the stratification of this important part of
 England, may be cleared up.
     When I said (p. 27 and 28 of your last Number) that an
 uninterrupted series of basset-edges of strata, dipping to
 the SE, and ranging in continuity from SVV to NE in
 certain undulating lines conformable to the surface, " from
 one sea to the     other,"     had been traced        by   Mr. Smith,     and
 shown on his manuscript maps, I spoke from an imperfect
 recollection of some parts of his maps, and had forgot
 some difficulties which he once mentioned having expe
 rienced, in tracing the strata across the flat country around
 York : at which time also, he was in the habits of men
 tioning the oalite or ova-formed limestone of the Bath series
 and of Portland island in Dorsetshire, as belonging to the
 same stratum; and as the late Rev. Mr. Michel also con
 sidered them, as I have mentioned, p. 103, of your 36th
 volume, and vol. i. p. 113, of my Derbyshire Report, but
 which now appears to be incorrect j and that the oalite of
 St. Alban's-Head and Portland-Isle on the south coast, is
 the same with that of Calne in Wilts, Aylesbury in Bucks;
 and New-Malton, Helmsley, Kirby-Moorside, Pickeriug,
 and Filey head SE of Scarborough, in Yorkshire, and is
 situate within 100 yards (perhaps, and composed princi
 pally of chalk -marl) of the bottom of the chalk, greatly
 above ihe Bath-freestone*: and it seems, that besides the
 disappearance of the upper of these important Oalites (the
 Aylesbury Limestone/ under Alluvial Clay, from Stewkley
 in Bucks, through all Bedfordshire, (see that article in the
 Edinburgh Encyclopaedia,) and Cambridgeshire also, per
 haps, till its first exit from the Island near Hunstanton-
 cliff in Norfolk, it makes no appearance, or where the lower
 Chalk again enters the Island nearWainfleet in Lincolnshire,
 or for some distance after the bottom edge of the Chalk
 emerges from the Fens near Walton, as wc proceed north
 westward ; yet, in the hills near Dalby, Langton, &c. I saw
 thickness enough of strata basseting, to account for this
 Limestone Rock, that I had not time to search for minutely,
 or to inquire what had been proved underground, in sink
 ing wells or otherwise, when I was in that county in 1807,
    Do more than these two parts of the British scries of strata
                                                                  produce ova-
furmal limtstmiu t a question I ask of your correspondents, from having seen
 a very flat Echinus tilled with oalite (like those cf the Bath strata) said to
 be brought from I.inton Swindcn in Threshfieid, ten miles N. of Skipton in
 Yorkshire ? The large botryoidal Pisolithus at Boiling-hill one mile S. of
 the mouth of the Wear in Durham, and in other situations, do not appear to
 compose regular strata, I believe, as the small pisolites do.
    Mr. Michel's " very fine white sand," vol. xxxvi. p. 104, seems to be that
 dug at the foot of the red marl range, on Markham-Moor, by the {rear
 North Road.

nor can      I hear any thing more of the appearance of this
Oalite, near to Market-Raisin E, Caiston W, Brigg E,
crossing the Humber NW of Barton,                           near Market-
Weighton W, and near Pocklington, where I suppose to
be its range, and on which points I solicit the assistance of
your readers and correspondents.
     The first or outer-raised tract shown in the map and
mentioned p. 30, of your last Number, I now suppose to
have a north-eastern corner extended to near Leavening,
between Acklam and Burythorpe, near to the edge of the
Chalk ! ; the eastern boundary fault, after passing W o
Bawtry and Thorne, as there mentioned, probably prpceed-
ing near Suaith, W of Howden, E of Aughion, VV of
Pocklingtou, W of Garraby-street Inn on the York and
Bridlington Road (being here very near to the Chalk), near
Acklam ; and after turning nearly at right angles near
Leavening, the same probahly proceeds near Crambe S,
Sheriff-Hutton S, Stillington S, Easingwold, Thirsk                      SW,
to near the Swale River about Ainderby-Steeple,                       where   I
suppose it to turn again at rather more than a right angle,
pass      NW    of Northallerton,         NW         of Stokesley, near
Ormsby, Wilton, and Kirkleatham, and enter the German
Ocean near or on the SE of Redcar, near the mouth of the
Tees : instead of this fault turning westward up the course
 of the Wharf River, as I conjectured a year ago (p. 80),
before having seen the Country, as will be further noticed
presently.
      By this prodigious eastern fault, it has I expect happened,
that the magnesian or Yellow Lime Rock (with perhaps
 Coal-measures above it in some places, Report i. 132) oc
 cupies the surface under the Gravel, Peat, &c. on its west
 side (p. 31) from near Nottingham to somewhere near
 Pocklington* ; but on its eastern or outer side, are Red Marl
                                                                        strat3,

London Clay series to advance beyond Kendall, the Chalk
beyond Wintringham on each side, the Chalk-marl almost

Marsk, and where the great eastern fault that has hecn men

sight, all the strata (that have been mentioned p. 96 and 97
above), between these and the Red Marl with Gypsum beds,
of which there are said to be large quantities near to the
Tees, N of Lazenby in Kirkleatham : whether these Red
Marl strata occupy all the north-west side of the great
fault that I have supposed and mentioned, turn its W
corner and proceed on the W side of Thirsk, where I have
been .told that Gypsum is dug, as before hinted, T am un
able to say, any more than whether, the magnesian Lime
stone, that is described in Mr. John Bailey's excellent Report
on Durham County, as overlying the great Newcastle
Coal-series from near Sunderland to near Piersbridge on
the Tees, is an immediate under-measure to the Red Marl,
that ! have been speaking of ? and whether it be the same
with the Nottingham, Derby and Yorkshire magnesian or
Yellow-lime Rock f and whether these actually connect, by
way of Knaresborough, Ripon, Bedale, E of Richmond, &c.
as I have been told by some is the case ? are questions on.
which I am exceedingly desirous of accurate information ;
 and would take the present opportunity of mentioning, that
 the lower or calcareous part of the Newcastle series, as de
 scribed by Mr. Bailey, and by Mr. Westgarth Forster (see
 his " Section of the Strata") seem, in the blending of Grit
 stone, Shale, Coal-seams, !kc. with the Limestones pro
ducing Mineral Veins, to differ so essentially from the
 lower, or indeed any part, of the Derbyshire series, as to be
 with the utmost difficulty referred to the same part of the
 general -series, as hinted in the note, p. 80, of your last
 number.
     Whether, in case of the identity of the magnesian Lima
 Rocks and their under Coal-measures in Derby and Dur
 ham being established, the great fault that enters the island
 near Hartley in Northumberland (see the Map affixed to the
 " Picture of Newcastle,") by turning more southward, after
  re-entering that County N. of Ebchester, may range across
 Durham and the North Riding of Yorkshire, to connect
  perhaps with the great zigzag fault of my Derbyshire Re
  port and p. 32 of your last number, (on which I have more
  to say herein), and thereby entirely cut off and disconnect
  the upper and lower parts of what Mr. Forster has joined
  together as one series, perhaps about the 244th fathom of
  his Section, being the place where Mr. W.Miller's engraved

Section begins (and proceeds downwards further even than
Mr. Forster's),  and by this means, make the Coal and the
Lead districts of Northumberland, Durham, and York
shire to have no immediate or known relation to each other
in the scries, I am unable to say at present : but certainly
this is one of several suppositions that ought to be fully
tried, by an actual survey, before admitting the identity of
such very different series of strata as compose the Lead
districts of Derbyshire, and the Counties above mentioned.
   But I return lo the measures in Yorkshire, E of the great
eastern Fault, that basset from under the Oalite Limestone,
and occupy a space more or less wide on the SW and N
sides of that limestone tract, from near VVestow on the
SSW of Malton, by Spitlal-bridge, Sheriff-Hutton, Cox-
wold, Thirsk, Northallerton, Stokesley, Gisborough, Marsk,
Danby, Lylh, YV hitby, Goadland, Cloughton, Scarborough,
&c. &c. and have to mention that I find these, after a care
ful examination of the Country about Lyth (on which I in
tend to say more at a future opportunity) to be Coal-mea
sures, and consider them not less remarkable as occurring
in a much higher pari of the firitish series, than had hi

of Coals, and that a thin one, rarely amounting to 9 inches
thick, and never exceeding 18 inches, as I believe, after a
pretty extensive inquiry : though there is often a partial
layer of wood-coal a good deal below it.
    The account of Mr. Edward Martin's South-Wales Mi
neral-basin has, I observe, been by a mistake in the note in
the Philosophical Transactions, and p. 28 of your last num
ber, referred to the volume for 1808 instead of 1806.
    From all that I had read or heard, respecting the northern
termination of the valuable Coal-field of the West Riding
of Yorkshire, some distance N of Bradford, Leeds, &c. and
hearing how much wider this field was W and NE (from
Halifax to Fryston-IIall near Ferrybridge) at no great di
stance before its termination,    than it is anywhere S of this
in Derbyshire : I rather too hastily (as it now appears) con
cluded, that the zigzag fault (Derby Report i. p. 168, and
p. 32 of your last number) was diminishing northward in
Yorkshire, or the rise becoming less on its W side, and
that it would soon terminate, so as to admit a complete and
more extensive series of Coal-measures basseting, in regular
 succession, about the parallels of Leeds and Wakefield than
I had seen, as hinted p. 176 of my Report: and that in
 consequence there must have been a fault, unconnected
 with this zigzag fault, that ranged E and W about the
 course of the Wharf River, &c (p. 30 of your last num
ber), against which the several Grit-stone Rocks and Coal-
 shales abutted, nearly at right angles : on examining th«
 country about Wakefield and Leeds and NE of it last August,
 I find however these facts to be very materially different,
 and that the zigzag fault continues northward of Dinning-
 ton (where it is shown in the Map in your last number) to
 increase and act a still more important part in the structure
 of the country, than it has done south of this; its route
 probably being, near to Hooton-Roberts, Clayton, Feather-
 stone, Castleford, Church-Garforth, Barwick in Elmet,
 Thorner, Bardsea VV, East-Keswick W, Sicklinghall, &c. ;
 and perhaps, if the Yellow Lime continues much further
 northward? it may continue to follow its western edge un
 til almost arrived at the Tees, and then diverge from it west
 ward to let out the Newcastle Coal-field, as has been already
 hinted, page 99.

surprised, on visiting Woodhouse and Headingly NW of
Leeds, in company with my very valuable Friend (acquired
entirely through      acorrespondence on these subjects in your
Magazine) Mr. Smithson,             inAugust last, to observe there
these three strata with all thei/ usual characteristics and
some others, ranging about ENE and dipping southward,
making direct for the edge of the Yellow Lime, and against
w hich and the zigzag fault,        I  satisfied myself    by numerous
inquiries,  that  they actually   abut   near Thorner, the 4th Rock
being there elevated, on the SW of the Town, to the level of
the Yellow Lime on its         E side    !
                                         ; and that all the numerous
tipper  strata to  these, had   made     like
                                         a      but less extensive turn
 eastward, and had disappeared orbasseted northward, instead
of abutting in that direction against fault, as supposed.

Rounday      S  ofShadwell, and Thorner.              The 3d Rock,       I
believe, abuts on the Yellow Lime and zigzag Fault between
Thorner and Bardsea, at still higher level
                               a                      !   and   it seems
probable, that this southern dip continues, until the 2d and
 1st Grit Rocks and 1st Coal-shale and the Limestone-shale
are brought round to abut on the zigzag fault, near to the
edge of the Yellow Lime        :  but still   it seems, that    abranch
from the ziezag fault must range westward, not far beyond
the Wharf River perhaps, and near Otley, Keighley, &c.
(as mentioned p. 30 of your last number), as otherwise,                  if
the dip continued, the Mineral Limestones and alternating
Toadstones of the Derbyshire series must basset, N of Otley
or W of Ripley, of which       J  never heard the probability        ; but
the Limestones and other strata there seem, as far as           I   have
beard, to answer nearly to the lower part of Mr. Westgarth

    In the preface to my Derbyshire Report p. xiv. T have
mentioned the Red Marl strata containing Gypsum beds,
that had been said to cover or lie on the top of the Yel
low Lime Rock at Fairburn N of Pontefract in Yorkshire,

been able to do) Wliat is the regular or proper covering
stratum to this Lime Rock P made it among the most in
teresting objects of my visit to Mr. Smithson, to go with
him and view tljese Gypsum quarries ; but before I men

give a more exact account of the Western edge of the lower
part of the Yellow Lime Rock (where it is seen covering
the Coal measures) to the north of the Anstons in York

 104           Mr.   Farey's Geological Observations
  conducted to the north of the Road, and of Fairburn old
  Limestone Ouarries, and in the midst of a common-field,
  the general surface of which is Limestone with many shal
  low quarries in it made by the Farmers ; we ascended a de
  tached hummock of perhaps four or five acres extent and
  40 or 50 feet high, in the SE side of which the Gypsum
  is dug, in a great number of thin regular beds in red marl,
 nowise materially different from all the Gypsum quarries
  that I had previously seen in this marl, except perhaps that
  the beds of Gypsum are more numerous and thinner than
  usual : standing on the top of this interesting hummock
  (which has been dug over for Gypsum) with Mr. S. I re
 marked to him, that here were certainly undisturbed strata
 upon the Limestone Rock that we had ascended from the
  Coal-measures, and that the green hills in the inclosures to
 the north, showed marks of the ancient diggings of Gyp
  sum or Marl in their sides, and doubtless were similarly
 constructed to that on which we stood : but observing, that
 the Limestone hill about five or six furlongs to the east of
 ns, on which the village of Fairburn stands and the great
 North Road passes north of         it,     was much higher than the
 Limestone field that surrounded us, or than this hummock,
I   remarked, that either     a   fault must range between us and
 that  hill,  and  had  raised   that     so materially (previous to the
 denudation     that  had  left these     singular hummocks), or, that
 there were two Limestone Rocks, on the upper of which
 Fairburn stood, and Newton on the lower, and that these
 Marl hummocks were the remains of                 a      stratum between
 these Rocks.        We    lost  no     time    in   reaching Fairburn to
 verify,if    possible,  one   or  other     of  these   suppositions, and
 soon found on inquiry, that several of the Wells in the village
 had been sunk through Limestone into similar Marl with
 Gypsum beds     :   a  more decisive proof however immediately
 offered itself, in  a  Tunnel that Mr. George Althas had about
two years beforedriven under the Village and Turnpike Road,
at 54 feet deep, for conducting           a     rail-way branch from the
Air Navigation, into the deep Limestone quarries N of the
Road, which Tunnel passed along this Marl and Gypsum
stratum  :    in examining of which           in   its place at bottom of
the quarry, was then and since able to detect several errors

the planes of Yellow Lime, in different places, and which,
from having seen or heard no instance of such basseting, or
having  a    regular place between the Limestone Rocks, and

cluded all such to be, and have described them as alluvia, and
have in consequence, omitted to observe or notice, a most
important feature of the Yellow Limestone Rock, or Rocks
rather, that of their having strata of Red Marl (sometimes
holding Gypsum and other substances), ochry clay, loamy
or founders' sand, &c. interposed between them, of very
variable appearance and thickness, but sometimes capable
of forming a feature in the Country, as we have seen to
the NVV of Fairburn in Yorkshire.             I will therefore here
mention     the  places   in order,  beginning S, near which I
suppose    that  the  upper  Yellow  Lime Rock ends, and these
anomalous     beds   basset, with  remarks,   as I go along, of the
probable    errors   in my Derbyshire Report, in considering
them as alluvia, &c.

 seeing the upper Yellow Lime Rock, anywhere south of
Mansfield in Nottinghamshire,         (and probably the Red Clay
on the Limestone at the south end of that town, of which
bricks are made, may belong to these anomalous Beds ? and

XVI.     Desultory Observations concerning certain vegetable
     Muscicapce.   By Professor Barton, of Philadelphia.
     Communicated by the Author.
A fkw     years ago, I accidentally discovered that the flowers
of  the Asclepias syriaca of Linnaeus*, like the flowers of
the Apocynum androscemifolium, are endowed with the
faculty of catching and retaining flies and various other
kinds of insects.    I have given some account of this dis
covery in the Transactions                   of    the American    Philosophical
Society f.
   In the course of the present year (1811) I have ascer
tained that the beautiful Asclepias curassavica is also a Mu-
scipula, or rather a Muscicapa.   My observations were made
on a small and by no means vigorous plant of this species,
which I had raised from seed.         These observations con
vince me that this Asclepias, in its native climate, or any
where else when adult and vigorous, must be a powerful
and even useful fly-catcher.     It often so completely retains
insects, even pretty large house-flies, that they are wholly
incapable of disengaging themselves, but perish upon the
flowers.    Others, hardly more fortunate, escape with the
loss of their proboscis, or some of their limbs.      Few, per
haps, escape entirely uninjured.  The mechanism by which
 Asclepias curassavica catches flies, is nearly the same as that
by which they are caught in Asclepias syriaca                           /S.
   As the genus Asclepias consists of considerable numbera
of species, and as all the species are so similarly constructed
that there      no good reason to doubt that they are all en
                     is
dued with the power of catching insects,            easy to per
                                                              it   is
ceive what an immense havoc these plants must make of
 animal life, especially    many parts of the United States,
                                     in
where some of the species of Asclepias arc so numerous
thit they cover hundreds of acres of ground, in close con
nexion, especially along the banks of our rivers, in the
sandy fields, &c.

 108                           Olservations concerning
I   have already        referred,     I have, I fear, fallen into an error
concerning         the Nerium           Oleander,    or common Rosebay.
My      words    are    these    :
                                    " It has  long   been     known that this
is a poisonous plant.                 But I do not know that any per
son than myself has observed that this fine vegetable proves
very destructive to the common house-flies.                       These insects
visit the Oleander, in order to drink the fluid secreted in
the tube of its flowers.               The liquor soon intoxicates them,
and very few of those which have gained admittance into
the blossom ever return from it. So great is the number
of flies destroyed in the course of one season by a single
 Oleander, that I have often thought it would be worth our
while to pay more attention, than we yet do, to the cul
tivation of this vegetable ; as, independently of its beauty,
it is so well calculated to lessen the numbers of a most
 common and troublesome insect."
     Subsequent and more cautious inquiries have convinced
me, that although the neclareous fluid of the Oleander may
prove deleterious to flies, yet that the greater number of
 the insects which are observed dead or dying, in the flowers
of this plant, have been entrapped by the irritability of the
genitalia; by a mechanism, at least, as truly irritable as
that by which insects are detained in the flowers of the dif
ferent species of Ascltpias, of Apocynum, and other similar
 plants.
     In the course of my inquiries and labours concerning
 the indigenous plants of the United States, I have had the
 additional satisfaction of remarking, that one of our Grasses
 is also a Muscicapa, or at least a catcher of small insects
 of various kinds. And, so far as I know, it is the only
 grass, hitherto discovered, that is entitled to the name of a
 Muscicapa.
     The grass to which I allude is the Leersia lenticularis
 of the late Mr. A. Michaux*.                     This plant is a native of
 the marshy grounds of the Illinois country, of Virginia,
 North Carolina, &c.                  I do not know that it has been
 found in Pennsylvania.                 The glume or corolla consists of
 two valves, a character which belongs to all the species of
  the genus Leersia.              In the Leersia which is the subject of
 my observations, the glume is of an orbicular form, inclin
 ing to lenticular, and is much larger than in any of the
 other American species that are known to me, or than it

edges     of   the valves     are very distinctly ciliated, or furnished
with a number of            fine teeth or delicate spinules.
     It
     is this ciliate structure that enables the plant to per
form the business of a Muscicapa.      When a small insect,
such as a spider or a minute fly, insinuates itself between
the valves (probably in pursuit of a honeyed fluid), the valves
close upon         it,

No doubt, the former as well as the latter of these grasses
is  entitled to the appellation of               Muscicapa.

 not yet observed insects between the valves of the Leersia
virginica.      I    may hereafter inquire more particularly into
the subject.
     In Georgia and in Florida there grows beautiful shrub             a
 to which the inhabitants have given the name of " Fly
 catcher."         This shrub           the Befaria paniculata of Mi
                                        is
 chaux*. The inhabitants collect branches of                        when   it,        it   is
 in flower, and hang them up in their rooms, and find the
 flowers of very great use to them in ridding them of flies                                :
 hence its name, which               have mentioned, and the only one,
                                 by I

point  remains   to be determined by better  observations.       I
have never yet had an opportunity of examining the Be/aria
in   a   living
           state.
     I
     might here   give a long list of vegetables, such as dif
ferent species of Rhododendron, Kalmitt, Robinia, Silene,
Lythrum, which by virtue of the viscosity upon different
parts of their flowers, &c. entangle and destroy small in
sects. But my business in this imperfect essay is not with
Muscicapce of this kind. Yet a more critical inquiry into
the use of this viscous matter, in the vegetable ceconomy,
by which millions of iusects are destroyed in our gardens,
green-houses, woods, &c. might deserve the attention of
physiologists.
   In regard to the Sarracenice, 'as I design to make their his
tory, botanical, physiological and medical, the subject of a
distinct memoir, I shall content myself at present by offer
ing a few detached facts and observations concerning these
plants.
   It is well known that all the species of this singular
genus (and I think at least seven species have been dis
covered in North America) are inhabitants of the water, or
of wet situations. All the species are furnished with tu
bular or hollow leaves (ascidia), which in the more adult
plants are seldom found without a considerable number of
insects dead or living in them.       I do not mean, however,
to insinuate that these insects owe their presence in the
Sarracenice to any thing like an irritable property residing
in anv part of the plants. Indeed, I have not discovered
any vestige of peculiar irritability in the constitution of the
Sarracenice.     But I think it sufficiently evident that nature
has taken some pains (if it be ever allowable to use such
language in speaking of the works and operations of Na
ture) to solicit insects into the ascidia of the species of this
genus.
  Thus, the flowers of the Sarracenia fiava (the yellow
Trumpet-leaf or Side-saddle-flower of the people of the
United States) have a most offensive, cadaverous or carrion
like odour.   This odour, to speak more properly, seems to
reside principally, if not entirely, in the broad peltated stigma
of the plant. I think it probable that it    is, in part at least,
this odour, which     is  so potent and diffusible that     it   is
sometimes perceived at     a    considerable distance from the
plant, in   warm
             a      and  rather  confined atmosphere; that
                                                             it
                                                             is
partly this  odour,   which   serves to solicit various kinds of
insects about the plant, many of which before they can
                                                            reach

reach      the stigma are necessarily entrapped in the ascidia.
But I     know not what may be the final intention of Nature
in giving the peculiar odour which I have mentioned to
the stigma of Sarracenia fiava and some other species of
the genus.          Those philosophers* who imagine that there
are some plants which cannot be impregnated without the
aid of insects, may perhaps fancy that they have discovered
Nature's ulterior object in the present instance.                      Indeed,
I   confess myself at a loss to conceive how, in some of
the species of Sarracenia, the pollen or fecundating in
fluence of the stamens can reach the upper surface of the
stigma.         See in my Elements of Botany, and in other
works, the figure of Sarracenia purpurea.  And I presume,
that it is certainly upon the upper surface of the stigma of
these plants that the pollen, or at least its fovilla, must be
applied, in order to enlarge and render fertile the embrya
seeds.        In the Sarracenice, the akl of insects in giving fer
tility to the germen or ovarium may possibly be necessary.
I   think it cannot be much less necessary (if at all less ne
cessary) in Sarracenia purpurea, than it is said by Mr.Will-
denow, Dr. J. E. Smith, and other respectable botanists, to
be in Aristolochia Clematitis.  See Willdenow's Principles
of Botany and of Vegetable Physiology, English translation,
 pages3l6  318. Edinburgh, 1805 \. But although I believe
in the doctrine of the sexes of plants as a general doctrine,
I   am compelled by many facts and considerations to doubt
 whether the impregnation of any vegetable is necessarily
 dependent         upon insectile aid J.         On this curious subject
 I shall offer something more specific in my "Memoirs on
the Origin and Progress of our Knowledge concerning the
Sexes of Vegetables."
      But there is still a much more considerable and obvious

    f See also Dr. Smith's Introduction to Botany, &c. page 337, Ice. Loudon
 1807.    This botanist not only reposes confidence in Willdenow's thtory of
the insectile impregnation of Aristolochia Cltmatilu, but he thinks it pro
 bable that " for want of some insect adapted to the same purpose in its own
 country, the American Aristolochia Sijihu, though it flowers plentifully, never
 forms fruit
               " in the British
                                gardens. However it may be in drislotuchia Cle-
 matitis, I am persuaded that insects are not necessary agents in the impreg
 nation of the germ of Aristolochia Siplw, or " Dutchman's- Pipe," as it is called
 in Pennsylvania.      I am well acquainted with this plant, nnd cannot perceive
 from the structure and disposition of its genitalia any obstacle to the appli
 cation of the pollen to the female organ.     Certainly, there is much less diffi
 culty in conceiving how impregnation is effected in this Aristolochia, than in
 hundreds of other plants, concerning the impregnation of which no diffi
 culties have ever occurred in the minds of botanists.

 cause of the collections of insects which are so frequently
 observed in the ascidia of the Sarracenice.     These ascidia,
 in some if not in all the species of the genus, appear to
 possess a kind of glandular function, like the true nectaries
 of a great many plants. A honeyed fluid is secreted or de
 posited on the inner surface of the hollow leaves near their
faux or opening; and it is this fluid which allures great
 numbers of the insects, which they are found to contain,
 into the ascidia.
     Iwas entirely unacquainted with this curious ceconomy

speaking, the honeyed fluid may often be very distinctly
 seen; though sometimes, especially in the warmer weather,
it   is only to be discovered               by
                                       the taste.
    Many    insects,  as  well   as some   other animals, are found
in the ascidia of the Sarracenice, Nepenthes, &c. which do
not appear to have been solicited thither either                the ca by
daverous odour of the flowers, or                  by
                                            the honeyed fluid about
the opening of the tubular structure.             In the Sarracenice
we find species and sometimes large species of gryllus, or
grasshoppers, of gyrinus, &c. And Rumphius, speaking
of Nepenthes distillatoria, informs us that                    "
                                                         various little

except     certain small squilla or shrimp, with protuberant

back, sometimes met with, which lives there."                  Smith's
Introduction, &c. pages 197, 198.              Dr. Smith has "no
doubt, that this shrimp feeds on the other insects and
worms, and that the same purposes are answered in this
instance as       the Sarracenice."

          is                     remarkable instinct directs some

species   of  insects  to visit  the ascidia of different species of

Sarracenia, principally, if not entirely, for the purpose of
depositing their eggs or larva; in them.              We often see some
of the larger species of Musca and Tabaiius silting upon
the edges of the openings of the ascidia of Sarracenia fiava
and Sarracenia purpurea.               We soon rind that they do not
come here, as do the majority of insects, for the purpose
of sipping the honeyed fluid from the ascidial glands. The
mother-insect, carefully poising herself upon the brim of
the ascidium, emits from her uterus into the tube one or
more larva?, which immediately betake themselves to the
lower part, where meeting with abundance of good food^
they rapidly increase in size and in strength.
    I must give to Dr. Smith the credit of having preceded
 me in making, or at least in recording, an observation nearly
allied to the one which I have just detailed.                " An insect of
the Spkexor Ichneumon kind," as far as he could learn from
the description communicated to him, " in the Botanic Gar
den at Liverpool," " was seen by one of the gardeners to
drag several large flies to the Sarracenia' adunca, and, with
 some difficulty Forcing them under the lid orcoverof its leaf,
 to deposit them in the tubular part, which was half filled
 w ith water.      All the leaves, on being examined, were found
 crammed with dead or drowning flies." " The Sarracenia
purpurea," adds Dr. Smith, " is usually observed to be
stored with putrefying insects, whose scent is perceptible
as we pass the plant in a garden."                  This I have not ob
 served : and perhaps the odour spoken of may be that
exhaled from the flowers, or genitalia, of the plant. " Pro
bably (the learned English botanist goes on to observe) the
air evolved bv these dead flies mayTbe beneficial to vegeta
tion, and, as far as the plant is concerned, its curious con
struction may be designed to entrap them, while the wa
ter* is provided to tempt as well as to retain them. The
Sphex or Ichneumon, an insect of prey, stores them up un
questionably for the food of itself or its progeny, probably
depositing its eggs in their carcases, as others of the same
tribe lay their ejws in various caterpillars, which they some
times bury afterwards in the ground.                      Thus a double
purpose is answered; nor is it the least curious circum
stance of the whole, that an European insect should find
out an American plant in a hot-house, in order to fulfil
that purpose."
   * It is evident, from what hns
                                   already been said, that it is not the water
in, but the houcy about and upon, the ascidia. which tempts the greater
number of insects to visit these tubes, in the different species of Sarracciia,
Neither is it the water that retains them.

1 14                 Observations concerning
   I feel much obliged to Dr. Smith for leading me, by the
preceding observations, to pay a more critical attention than
I might otherwise have done to the ceconomy or' the Sar-
racenice and other ascidial plants.    Hitherto, however, I
have not observed any species of Sphex, or of Ichneumon,
engaged in the singular business which he has mentioned.
And although I do not doubt that the gardener's statement
is in the main correct, yet I incline to think that the sup
posed Sphex, or Ichneumon, was an insect of some other fa
mily. Future observations will, I hope, enable me to de
termine this point entirely to my satisfaction.
   Although 1 have no doubt that plants may derive much
of their nutriment and strength from the elements of de
composed animal bodies, just as I suppose that innume
rable species of animals are nourished by inorganic matter ;
and although it is possible thai the air evolved bv the dead
insects in the ascidia of the Sarracenice and other similar
plants may contribute somewhat to the vegetation of these
plants, yet I cannot suppose that the final intention of
Nature in furnishing plants with ascidial leaves is to lay up
a store of nutritious aliment for the plant.
   So far as the species of Sarracenia are concerned in this
view of the subject, I hardly know any plants to which
such storehouses as we are speaking of would be less ne
cessary.    For they live in the midst or upon the margin of
marshes,    where  animal matters of various kinds are con
tinually putrefying, and where of course the plants are al
most constantly surrounded by an atmosphere of azotic and
hydrogen gases.
   Again, the wonderful Dioncea Muscipula, the extremities
of whose leaves entrap, and frequently retain for a consi
derable time, various small species of insects, resides only in
marshy grounds, not much unlike those just mentioned.
In this plant, it appears to me to be still more difficult to
give a plausible guess about the intention of Nature in
constructing these vegetable Muscicapce, than in regard to
the Sarracenice.
    If, however, we were acquainted with only the last-men
tioned vegetables, with Nepentlws and with Dionceu, as the
only plants, I say, endued with the power, however different
the means, of catching or entrapping insects, we might,
perhaps, with some degree of reason imagine that this fa
culty is, somehow or other, subservient to the business of
vegetable nutrition.    But never can this idea be extended,
with even the faintest shadow of a good theory, to those
truly irritable Muscicapce, Apocynum androscemifoaum,

                          certain vegetable Miiscicapce.                         115
    Asclepias syriaca, Asclepias curassavica, Nerium Oleander,
    and many others, whose flowers entrap insects or the parts
    of insects. For, in these plants, the whole quantity of ani
    mal matter applied to and retained by the plants, in their
    most vigorous state, is a mere atom in comparison of the
    volume of living vegetable matter to be nourished.                       More-
    ever, the animalmatler is applied only to the flowers, which
    no one imagines to be essentially concerned in nourishing
   the plant; to the temporary organs, and not to those
    which may be called permanent, the leaves or ascidia.
        In making these observations, I have not an eye to the
   theories or speculations of any particular author. . I must
   confess, however, that 1 once imagined that Dioncea Mus-
   cipula itself does receive a part of its nourishment from the
    insects which it entraps. And Mr. Roth, if I do not mis
   take, has endeavoured to show that the species of Droserce,
   so common in the bogs of Europe, &c. are, in some mea
    sure, indebted for their growth and nourishment to the in
   sects which they entangle and retain.                    I have not seen the
   arguments by           which     the   respectable      botanist    just men
   tioned supports his hypothesis.
        I must not take my leave of the Sarracmice without ob
   serving, that the ascidia of some (perhaps all) of the species
   of the genus furnish us with still another beautiful example
   of what the ingenious author of " The Studies of Nature"
   would call the " harmonies" of the vegetable and animal
   kingdoms. For, omitting, at present, all further speculations
   about the intention of Nature in giving to the species o'f
   this genus ascidia! leaves, and a capacity of entrapping
  great numbers of insects, it is a fact, that these leaves be
  come repositories of the food of various species of birds.
. It is not uncommon, in the native soils of some o£ the species
  of Sarracenia, to see great numbers of birds, especially some
  Muscicajxe, or Flycatchers, and other Passeres, assembling
   about these plants, and, by means of their bills, slitting the
  ascidia in order to get at their favourite food*.                     This well
                                                                      ascertained

1 16    Observations concerning certain vegetable Muscicapce.
ascertained fact will not be deemed incurious in a history
of the genus Sarracenia ; nor unimportant in a history of
the instincts and intelligence of the great class of birds.
We know much less of the structure and oeconomy of ihe-
different species of the genus Nepenthes, and of the only
species of the genus Aquarium that has yet been discovered,
than we do of the structure and oeconomy of the species of
Sarracenia.         But it is highly probable, that the ascidia of
both Nepenthes and Aquarium* will be found by future
botapisls and naturalists to serve the same purpose, with
respect to birds, as do the Sarracenia variolaris and other
species of the genus in America.

    After proceeding thus far, it             was originally my intention
to have offered       some speculations of mv own concerning
the final object of Nature in constructing Vegktabi.eMus-
cicap^e, and especially those which I have ventured to call
irritable Muscicapce.            But the present- essay has already
been extended to too great a length.                   My intended specu
lations may possibly form the subject of a future commu
nication.        In the meanwhile, these " Desultory Observa
tions" may perhaps contribute to the amusement of some
of my brother naturalists, both in Europe and in America.
If they shall produce this effect, my principal object in lay
ing them before the public, in their present crude and irre
gular state, will have been accomplished.

   * I do not know whether this singular plant (Aquarium sitiens of Lesche-
nault), belonging to the natural order of Sticculentce, has yet been publicly
figured or described by any botanist.        I have seen a drawing of the plant,
which is a native of Australasia, in the possession of Mr.Leschenauit, when
I had the pleasure of knowing this intelligent botanist, and of inspecting a
part of his rich collection of plants, he. in Philadelphia, in 1807.        The
Aquarium grows in a moist but firm soil. Its radical leaves are hollowed,
and are in shape somewhat like a water-pot.           Each pot is about an inch
long, and is capable of containing a good deal of water.

heavy pain in the head, but he complained of nothing else ;

informed from his wife that he had continued to get much

in the head, giddiness, trembling; lost his speech, and the
use of his right arm.     In this stare I found him ; the lirrht

             cliffe   on  Allan's Dividing Instrument.
                           To Mr. Tilloch.
  Sir,   I  beg leave to inform you, that Mr. Stancliffe wrote
  his first opinion of my improvement on the mathematical
  Dividing Engine, after he went home from seeing the
  wooden model at the Society's house, and before he saw
  the engine itself    As I was surprised to see such an opinion
  inserted in the Society's Transactions, after giving his ap
  probation in so strong terms when before the Gentlemen of
  the Committee of Mechanics appointed by the Society of
  Arts to view the engine at my house on the 15th of De
  cember 1610, I mentioned the circumstance to him, and
  told him of some observations in a certain obscure publica
  tion ; in consequence of which he has thought proper to fa
 vour me with the enclosed paper.
     Mr. Stancliffe has for many years been justly celebrated
  for his extraordinary nicety in dividing, as well as for
 his extensive knowledge of the most useful instruments
  in the mathematical line ; and any ideas that he commits
 to p*per on the subject of mechanism 1 consider to be
  worthy of notice ; and I hope you are of the same opinion.
 If so, I should be very happy to see it published in the next
  Number of the Philosophical Magazine.
                        I am, sir, with true respect,

                              [COPY.]
                           To Mr. Allan.
     Sir,  T have lately seen in the Retrospect (No. 30)
 of philosophical, mechanical, &c. discoveries, some very
 strange remarks in the observations on the improvement ou
 the Dividing Engine made by you, which I am clearly of
opinion must have had their foundation in prejudice or ex
treme ignorance, or perhaps both.         Here I shall not enter
into any detail or vindication of what I said respecting my
opinion     before the Gentlemen of the Society of Arts, of
the great perlection, I believed, and do still believe, that
may be produced from your plan of racking1 or cutting the
teeth of a circle for the purpose of dividing mathematical
instruments.        However,   by  way of   explanation,  I will
                                H 4                      slightly

120              On Mian's Dividing Instrument.
slightly touch on a few points as a corroboration of my
former opinion.
    When the wooden model of the wheel and ring was first
put into my hands at the Society's house, I immediately saw
the great utility of the ring. I am still in the same opinion,
that the principle, which is not attended with anv great de
gree of difficulty in formation, will be found to produce that
accuracy which I think is not likely soon to be excelled.
The great improvement which has teen made in lathes for
turning large work would render that part of the operation
quite easy, even if it was carried to six feet or more in dia
meter.     A partial expansion at the time of racking, seems
to me one of the greatest objections that can be made
to a large size, and the bad effects of that I believe might
be overcome.
    To that extraordinary remark in the Retrospect, saying,
"   We canv conceive cases in which the effect of the shifting
would be to diminish the size of one or more or the teeth
each time below that of the rest, instead of equalizing
them, and finally, to cut some of them away entirely,"
I   shall make no reply ; only, that it cannot take place
¦without an error of at, least one whole tooth, before the
shifting of the ring.    Any man that knows the principle of
a wheelbarrow will see the absurdity of this remark in a
moment.
    I hope it is mentioned in the Transactions of the Society
of Arts, that w hen under the operation of racking or form
ing the teeth, the ring must, after being reversed or moved
 ISO0 once or twice, which will produce correctly all the way
round opposite teeth, although unequal in themselves, be
 shifted onequarter or 90° ; and then proceed with the racking
 and reversing as before, which will in the end, I have no
 doubt, provided all the work and apparatus            concerned
 is good, produce the number of equal teeth required
 round a circle, for the purpose of dividing mathematical
 instruments probably not yet equalled. 1 have had some
 experience in these things, which I hope will allow me to
 speak with that confidence I do on this point.           The in
 strument   alluded to  in the Retrospect   is the first essay on
 the art of dividing by the rack and screw, brought forth by
 Dr. Hook in tbe year 1 674, was merely a quadrant for
  the purpose of astronomy, with teeth cut with a screw all
  the way on the outer edge; which was not into degrees
  and minutes, but their true value was to be found after
  wards : therefore it was tint intended as a machine to divide
                                                            others

                      On Allan's Dividing Instrument.               1SI
  others with.       The   plan was soon abandoned by the Doctor
.on account of       its inaccuracy.      As far as I was ever able to
  learn, I believe my old master, Hendly of York, was the
  first that ever made an engine to work all the way round by
  a screw, to divide with.          It was about 13 inches diameter,
  and cut into 360 teeth or degrees.           I have worked with it
  many     a dav,   both  in  the  dividing and  cutting down way.
      Mr. Smeaton saw it in the year I74I, and he has told me
  since tnat he believed it was made about two years before
  that time.       Now 72 or 73 years.
      Now I will on your plan, just in a few words, run over
  the whole of the operation of makiug the teeth.               All the
  apparatus being prepared           and  quite ready  for the  cutting
   part, I would first start on Ramsden's plan by the dots,
   one half or nearly of the whole depth of the teeth.             This
  done, the screw has now got a firm hold of the teeth, and
  plenty of room for correcting by the ring, before the finish,
   any inequality that can exist in the complete circle. Having
   arrived at this point, I consider the work in a forward state,
   and the difficulty all over. So much accomplished, I would
   proceed no further on Ramsden's plan, but would have re
   course to the correcting ring, proceed with the racking and
   shifting in the manner described above.          Towards the last I
   would shift the ring every time it was once worked Yound
   by the screw cutter.         By this moving the ring to half and
   to quarters alternately, all those_ errors will be perfectly
   corrected without much attention of the workman.
       The Retrospect says you have given no proof, but bold
   encomiums on the perfection of your instrument, and denies
   its self-evidence.       I really do not know any greater test
   that it can be put to than may be done by the ring, which
   is certainly a part of the machine.
       I am confident in my own mind, that with makine: some
   little change, the whole of this piece of business,          I mean
   cutting or racking the teeth truly, might be accomplished
    to the greatest degree of exactness, without steady pins or
'
   even lines (only a few pencil marks) by contact itself, which
   Mr. Smeaton says, and seems to have proved, in the Philo
    sophical Transactions of the year 1785, is fifteen times
   nearer the truth than coincidence.             Respecting your im
    provement in the dividing engine, by what I have said
    above,    you    will perceive that I still support my first
    opinion, that it is a great and important discovery ;
                                  and remain, sir, yours truly,

  122   On the alkaline Matter contained in dropsical Fluids
     P.S.  I must say this, that I think the Gentlemen of the
 Society of Arts, &c. are very unhandsomely treated by the
 critic to whom I have alluded, as if they exercised no judge
 ment on whom, or for what, they bestow their honourable
 and bountiful rewards.
 XIX. An       Answer to the Observations of Dr. Pearson (see
     our last Number) on certain Statements respecting the
    alkaline Matter contained in dropsical Fluids, and in
    tlie Serum of the Blood.              By Alex. Marcet, M.D.
     F.R.S. one of the Physicians to Guy's Hospital,
                             To  Mr.     Tilloch.
 Sir, Althovgh I            feel disinclined to engage in any public
 philosophical controversy, especially when the object is to
 vindicate statements, the truih of which any common ob
 server may easily ascertain by experiment ; yet, as there are
 some points in the above communication                  which do Aot
 place the question in its proper light, and might mislead
 those who have no opportunity of referring to the original
 documents, I have thought it necessary to offer in return
 a few observations.         The state of the question is simply
 this : all chemists have for a long time agreed that the
 blood, and probably all the animal fluids, contain, together
 with various neutral salts, a certain portion of alkali not
 combined with any acid. This alkali has generally been
considered as being soda, although a few chemists had also
noticed traces of potash in some of these fluids.             Dr. Pear
son, on the contrary, in examining various kinds of animal
substances, and especially of expectorated              matter, was led
to conclude that the whole of the uncombined alkali con
 tained in the animal fluids, was potash ; and that they did
not contain uncombined* soda in any proportion what
ever.
    In analysing     the fluids of dropsy, I was naturally led to
inquire   into   this question, and the results obtained induced
me to conclude, that the only uncombined alkali present in
the blood, or other animal fluids, was soda ; and that the
indications of potash, which by applying the test used by
Dr. Pearson I was able to detect in these fluids, were owing
to the presence of that alkali in a state of combination
with the muriatic acid.
    The experiments I adduced in evidence were of two
       * By the expression unctmlined, I mean not combined with acid.
                                                                  kinds ;

                 and in the Serum        of the Blood.               123
kinds ; some  of them showing that the uncombined alkali
was 9oda, and others that it was not potash.
    Portions of saline matter being procured from various
animal fluids by evaporation and incineration, and brought
by subsequent redissolution and evaporation to a crystalline
state, crystals of determinate forms were obtained, some
of which appeared to consist exclusively of subcarbonat of
soda, some of muriat of soda, and others of muriat of
potash ; but none could be detected which appeared             to
contain any carbonat of potash.
    Other similar portions of the saline matter being treated
with acetic acid, in order to bring anv uncombined alkali
present to the state of acetat ; and alcohol being added
with a view to separate these acetats, the residue of this
alcoholic solution appeared to consist almost solely* of
acetat of soda;      whilst, on the other hand, potash was
found in the residue left undissolved by the alcohol.
    In these various trials the presence of potash, in a state
of combination, was proved by the tests of oxymuriat of
platina and tartaric acid, both of which form precipitates
with potash, and not with soda.
    The uncombined alkali, on the contrary, was shown not
 to be potash by the last-mentioned tests failing to indicate
 the presence of '.hat alkali ; whilst, on the other hand, it
 was proved to be soda by the action of nitric acid, which,
 in combining with it. formed crystals of a rhomboidal
 instead of a prismatic figure.
     1 shall not enter into the particulars of these operations,
 because they are minutely related in the communication
 which has given rise to this discussion; but I shall now
 rapidly examine the principal objections which Dr. Pearson
 has made to the above conclusions.
     Dr. Pearson's first ground of complaint             is,
                                                    that instead
  of showing his conclusions to have been erroneous, that               is,
I   conceive, instead of following him step               by
                                                     step in his
 inquiry, I     have contented myself      with exhibiting my
  own experiments and conclusions.        But   beg to observe,
                                                   I
  that the object of my inquiry was not to repeat Dr. Pear
  son's experiments, but to examine dropsical fluids; and
  that, if  in the course of my analysis       met with results
                                                 I
  which militated aerainst his conclusions,        could not be
                                                      it
  reasonably expected, that in stating these results      should
                                                               I
  think it  incumbent upon me to wade through his laborious
   * A trace of potash was detected in  the alcoholic solution; but
                                                                it  must be
 remembered that alcohol, however rectified, will take up minute portiousof
 muriat of potash, or indeed of almost any other soluble salt.
                                                               researches

 1 24  On the alkaline Matter contained in dropsical Fluids
researches    on the various forms of sputum or expectorated
matter.     I might indeed have abstained altogether from re-
ferring to his labours; but 1 thought it due to him, as a
philosophical inquirer long known in the chemical world,
to point out such similarities or discordances of results as
occurred in our respective experiments ; thus referring the
matter to the decision1 of pin siologists, and showing that
there was no wish, on my side, to overlook the authority of
former inquirers.
    In endeavouring to analyse the various objections brought
forward by Dr. Pearson^ I am so often at a loss to under
stand his meaning, and, I must add, so much embarrassed
by the obscure and inaccurate manner in w hich he has stated
some of my own proceedings, that it would be a task equally
fruitless arid laborious to follow his steps closely.    1 must,
therefore, as much as possible, select those objections
w hich are of a specific nature, and may be answered by an
appeal to experimental evidence.       Such is, for instance,
the argument which he employs, no less than three times,
 (once in support of hi? own experiments, and twice with a
view to invalidate my inferences,) on the effects of alcohol
and acetic acid,  which argument is founded upon his belief
that acetat of soda is not soluble in alcohol, and that it is
vol a deliquescent salt ; two palpable errors, which half a
grain of this salt and a few drops of alcohol, with no other
apparatus than a watch-glass, would have enabled him to
rectify.
    But the objection which recurs most frequently, and
that upon which the greatest stress is laid, is the minute
ness of the quantities of saline matter subjected     to experi
ment.     It would appear that Dr. Pearson questions whether
a few grains of saline matter may be expected to yield re
 sults similar to those which would be obtained from larger
quantities;     whether, for instance, the same inferences
 might be drawn from rhomboidal crystals of a minute size,
 as from similar crystals of larger dimensions ;  or, whether
experiments tried upon an ounce or two of my dropsical
fluids', may be brought into competition with those which
he performed upon two or three pints of his ropy sputum ?
    Such a scepticism, I must own, I have myself never en
 tertained. I have always thought, on the contrary, that the
 chemical properties w hich belonged to a particle of matter
 were exactly similar to those which would be found to be
long to a whole mountain of the same substance; that a
 rhomb of only one hundredth part of an inch might be
 characterized by its form as distinctly as one a hundred
                                                           times

                 and in ike Serum        of   the Blood.                 125
times larger *. But I carry the point still further ; fori
go the length of believing, that many experiments of re
search may be wonderfully facilitated by analysing upon a
small scale  that a great deal of convenience, of cecoriomy,
and sometimes even of accuracy, may thus be gained ; and
that, in some instances, we even acquire new powers of in
quiry by operating upon small quantities |\
    Thus, were it not for the assistance of minute microscopic
observation, a great number of          important facts which
have enriched chemistry within the last twenty years, would
in all probability have remained       undiscovered ; and this
country might not have obtained that first rank in philoso
 phical chemistry, to which it has but lately been raised, and
 which it had long held in other departments of science.
    Is it necessary that f should specify particular instances?
 Can any philosopher, attentive to the progress of analytical
 chemistry, overlook so many discoveries in which neither
 furnace, nor for^e, nor subterraneous laboratories, have
 been concerned  in which a watch glass, a blow-pipe, and
 a few drops of chemical re-agents, have been all the in
 struments required? Were not, for instance, the analyses of
 the Iceland springs by Dr. Biack (the same eminent phi
 losopher to whom Dr. Pearson appeals as an authority
 against microscopic observations) performed upon quanti
 ties of saline matter of astonishing minuteness ?  Surely Dr.
 Pearson cannot have forgotten that it was by the accurate
 examination of only a few grains of matter, that the na
 ture of no less than five kinds of urinary calculi has been
 ascertained, and their discrimination rendered easy and cer
  tain  that the nature of diamond has been established  that
  no less than lour new metals have been discovered in the
  crude ore of platina  that the similarity between ail the
    * Thus. I have no hesitation in maintaining that, unless it be proved that
 nitrat of pota~h may crystallize in ihombs, my conclusion!)     respecting the
 particular point in qucston, would stand upon that evidence alone; or that
 unless it be shown th.it carbonat of potash may crystallize in cubes, my
 inference respecting (he ptesence of muriat of potash staj.ds uncontro-
 wertcd.
    With regard to my attempt at expressing centesimal pirts of grain',
 which      with some apparent reason, noticed as
           is,                                         instance cf singular pre
 tension to accuracy, 1   beg to observe, that1 have never actually attempted
 to weigh smaller quantities than decimal parts of grains; and whenever
 smaller fractions have been expressed, they have arisen from a conversion
 of those numbers to some general standard.
  f    1would also observe, whilst upon this subject, that there  i*
                                                                  a    degree of

   meteoric stones has been proved  that the identity of the
   chemical agencies of electricity, whether excited by the
   common machine) or by the Voltaic battery, has been
   demonstrated  that in a neighbouring country the forma
   tion of crystals has been explained upon systematic prin
   ciples  that amongst us a new and wonderfully accurate in-
   sirument of crystallography has been invented  and above
   all, that ihe metallic bases of alkalies, those extraordinary
  bodies which nature had hitherto concealed under an im
  penetrable disguise, have at last been brought to light ! Let
  it be remembered as one of the most glorious circumstances
  of that discovery, that it was by examining mere atoms of
  these substances that their properties were iirst ascertained ;
  and that when, in consequence of subsequent improvements
  in the mode of obtaining these bodies, they w ere procured
  in larger quantities, and their genera! properties were re
  examined, no error was discovered, and no important in
  formation was added to that which had originally been gained
  from microscopic quantities.
      It is far from my intention, however, to contend, that,
 on some occasions, new and important facts may not be
 brought to light bv means of processes conducted upon an
 extensive scale, which would not admit of being reduced
  to a small compass.         I only mean to assert, that such in
 stances are comparatively but rare ; and that no philippic
 against the examination of small objects - no appeal to old
 masters  no slight upon modern improvements, ought to
 deter chemical inquirers from adopting methods which
 some of our contemporaries have employed with so much
utility and success.
     Amongst other inaccuracies in the critique which has
 given rise !o these remarks, my paper on dropsical fluids
 has been represented as being the joint work of Dr. VVol-
 laston and myself; for which supposition there was no other
 authority than a note in the paper in question, in which I
acknowledged my obligations to Dr. Wollaston for the
information and assistance which 1 have on this and other
occasions, derived from his kindness.                 I need not say how
highly I     should    have  been  flattered    by  such  an association j
hut I think       it due  to him  to  state,    not  only that he had no
share in     the   general inquiry,    but   that   he  did not even see
the paper      in  question previous     to  its publication.
     I cannot retrain from noticing, amongst Dr. Pearson's
remarks, another kind of licence which appears to me
still less warrantable.        I allude to the practice of quoting
in italics, or placing       between     inverted commas, words or
                                                                  phrases

 phrases which have not been used, and to seize upon them
 as a subject of ridicule.           This is the case with some pro
 posed elegant changes, and with my supposed recommen
 dation to transfer chemistry to the " fire-side of the draw
 ing-room :" expressions which I have not used, and yet
 upon which Dr. Pearson has thought proper to be extremely
jocular.
     I have onlv further to add, that should Dr. Pearson again
 write upon the subject, I shall not easily be induced to re
 sume the controversy.            I am sorry, therefore, to see it inti
 mated at the conclusion            of his   paper that be proposes to
 continue his observations in your next Number j and as it
 appears that those intended remarks are meant as a return
 for the notice which 1 have taken of his papers, f regret the
 more that he should take so much trouble.                        For praise,
 when used as the vehicle of irony, is the worst kind of cen
 sure.     The discovery of truth ought to be the only object
 of philosophical      discussion.       There are, doubtless, many
 errors in my humble attempts at chemical analysis ; but
 unless Dr. Pearson points out those errors, or brings for
 ward new facts connected with my inquiries, I confess that
 I had much rather he would not again honour them with
 his notice.

 XX.     Description    of the Diacatoplron.            Communicated iy
                        Dr. Gibbes, of Bath.
  Various optical instruments have been applied to the
 purposes of drawing and copying, and have been carried to
 a great degree of perfection.               The Camera obscura, the
 Delineator, and Camera lucida, have severally been justly
 celel >raled for the facility of tracing outlines, and the rules
 of perspective have been correctly illustrated by these re
 presentations of natural objects on a plain surface.
     The great simplicity of the instrument now about to be
 described, may entitle it to rank among the most useful of
 the kind, as, to the advantage of its simple structure and
 applicability without straining lite eyes, it adds a degree of
  truth not to be exceeded.           Without the aid of additional
 reflecting surfaces, this instrument represents its objects as
 an ordinary mirror, at the same time that it allows suffi
 cient transmitted light to pass for the guidance of the hand
 behind it. Thus, by a very little management, both the
                                                                       hand

  128                    The Diacatoptron.
 hand directing the pencil, and the object to be traced, may
 be equally well defined and clear.      Another advantage pos
 sessed by this apparatus is, that very little light is lost, as is
 the case where many glasses intervene between the object
 and its representation. The application is alio immediately
 obvious to the most careless observer.
    Take a perfectly clear piece of glass, a font square, well po
 lished and quite even, and parallel throughout ; place this in
 a frame (PI. HI. fig. 1.) about one inch and a half wide, and
 one inch thick, ami instead of wood at the bottom of the
 frame place a brass wire or narrow and thin plate which
 will hold the three sides together, and prevent the glass
 from falling out, as it must rest on the wire or plate, which
 should be fastened tight to the feet of the frame.
    The feet must be exactly at right angles with the frame,
so that when the plate is placed upon an even table, it will
stand perpendicular.       In the upper part of the frame at bt
make a long groove, in which insert the brass sight an inch
broad (fig. 7.) having the small eve-hole c : this is to be
fastened at top hy the screw d, which may be screwed up
or loosened at pleasure.
    Divide the frame (fig. 5.) into two equal parts, beginning
at the upper part from the groove b, to the bottom of the
1'cet a, pr of the brass wire.     Divide again the lower part
from e into eight equal parts, and on each side of the
frame bore holes, taking great care to place them exactly at
the eight measured points.
    A board (fig. 6.) is called the table, of the breadth of the
frame, in which two brass pins are fastened of such size
that they may exactly pass into the holts to raise the table
to different heights corresponding with the holes in the
frame ; otherwise you cannot magnify or diminish objects
correctly according to the size you may wish to obtain.
On the opposite side of the table arc supports at each cor-
ndr, so placed that they may be conveniently pushed up or
down.     The supports pass through two holes in the table,
and in each are eight small boles of the same size as those
in the frame, so that by means of a bra^s wire under the
table it may be kept fast in a horizontal position.
    The blind (fig. 2.) is made of a piece of wood, bevelled, one
foot long, one inch and a half wide, and one inch in thick r
ness.    A brass or iron rod is bent in such a manner as
to form a square, and the wood serves as a support lo it.
This frame is then covered with writing paper, which should
be of moderate thickness.        When you make use of the
apparatus, place the object k upon a flat table on a level
                                                             with

                                 The Diacatoptrott.                           1 29
with   the window       ; on the right hand lay some               blank pam
 per, upon      which   a  person may      draw    ;  and  between    the two
 place   the     Diacatoptron     or   transparent reflecting plate of
 glass  in   its  frame  ;  place  the   blind k at right angles with
 the glass on the right hand, so that the drawing paper may
 lie in the broken shade, and a person looking through the
 glass from the left side will observe the object exactly de
 signed upon the paper.              If the figure is not sufficiently
 distinct, you may darken the blind by hanging a paper
 upon it ; if it should darken too much, you place it a little
 further from the glass.
     It is of much consequence that the proper degree of
 shade should be thrown upon the paper; for, if it is too
 dark, you will neither see distinctly Hie lines of the draw
 ing which ynu copy, nor the point of your pencil :                         if,
                                                                           on
 the contrary,      it     not sufficiently dark, you will work at
                            is
 random, and the representation will be faint.                   In copying
 after this manner you do not make use of any eye hole,
 because the eye         easily kept in the proper direction, as the
                          is
 drawing      remains    in  its appropriate situation            but in the
                                                                  ;
 following experiments, where the objects are diminished
 or magnified, whether               picture or prospects in perspec
                                      a

                                                                  is
 to look exactly and constantly at the same point of view.
    The diminishing of an object                    is
                                                  effected        by
                                                                  raising the
 height of the table. Since the object placed on the left side
 of the glass  is    always represented on the right side, although
 the surface of the table should not be of an uniform height,
it  will be found that,          if
                                you take        fixed point of view, the
                                                    a
 object will be diminished the nearer the reflected image
 approaches to this point, and will be magnified as the re
flected and transmitted image                  made to recede from the
                                                   is
 eye.    Or rather, the image will appear larger than the ob
ject when     it   is removed further from the fixed eye than the
 object itself, and vice vtrsd.
    This may be seen clearer                  by

 and objects in perspective.
     Make a board (fig. 8.) 2-J- feet long, and bore two
 holes six inches from one end of the board at the width of
 the Diacatoptron, so that the supports of the table may
 pass through and may be placed upright.        Fasten behind
 two perpendicular pieces of wood a ; and also at the upper
 part two props which may pass into the holes of the table,
into which the feet were before fixed, so that the table may
be secured both at the top and bottom, and all shaking
prevented.
   Bore holes in the board from c to a, that you may place
there the sight-piece e, which is cither made of brass or
 wood, about six inches high, and has at the top a round
brass plate one inch in diameter, in which is the eye hole.
    When you make a trial of          it,
                                     fix the paper fast on the
table according to fig. 9.      Place the Diacatoptron about
six or eight inches from       it,
                                 upon the board, and parallel
with the table     the blind, (fig. 10.) which

wood, pasteboard, or paper, then covers the space between
the Diacatoptron and the table, so that the opening       may g
be on the right hand    :the sight-piece        then so placed

in one of the holes that you may have the desired power of
diminishing, taking care that your head may not intervene
between the object and the glass, and you may easily draw
upon the perpendicular paper the objects diminished.        In
this way you may with ease draw plants, and in short alL
objects, even academy figures, &c, and under circum
stances in which the Camera obscura could not be con
veniently employed.

Thursday Feb. 6.       The  Society again met, when         short
                                                              a
paper  by Dr. Wollaston was read on the primitive form of
calcareous, bitter, and iron spar.     The composition of these
three kinds   of spar being essentially different, although their
primitive  form   has hitherto been admitted to he the same,
seemed to    militate  against the truth of the crystallogical
system.    Haiiy    himself having rather hastily allowed that
the angle  of  the  rhomboid   of calcareous spar, masjnesian
spar, and   iron  spar, being 101° 27'» formed an exception to>
the general principle that    a difference of constituent parts
produced difference of form, Dr.W. with his goniometer
            a
was induced to examine these spars with greater attention.

 The angle in all of them he found some degrees more than
 M. Haiiy ; and also that each had a distinct measure, which
 in whole numbers may be stated at 105°, 106°, and 107°.
 Hence he was led to the Very important conclusion, that a
 difference in Constituent principles does in every case produce
 a difference of primitive form ; that the exceptions to this
 general position arc entirely owing to errors in our crystal-
 lographical operations, and that the crystallogical theory it
 more true to nature than even its author had supposed.
     Feb. 13. A paper by Mr. John Davy, communicated by
 his brother Mr. Davy, was read.          MM. Gay-Lussac and
 Thenard and Mr. Murray have asserted that there is no ac
 tion between gaseous oxide of carbon and oxymuriatic ga9
 or chlorine, when they are exposed to sunshine. Mr. John
 Davy states in this paper a very different result  that the two
 gases combine and become condensed to half their volume,
 and form a peculiar new elastic fluid possessed of acid pro
 perties.   He gives an account of the nature and combina
 tions of this substance, which neutralizes four times its vo
 lume of ammonia, and forms with it a peculiar salt ; it
 is not disengaged from ammonia by acetous acid, nor by
 nulphureous acid, and it is decomposed by the metals into
 gaseous oxide of carbon and chlorine, so that its conititu-*
 tion is established both by analytical and synthetical ex
  periments.
     Feb. 20.    Another paper by Mr. John Davy was com
 municated to the Society by Mr. Davy.         It related to the
 combinations of certain metals with chlorine and oxygen,
 and contained some general views on the theory of definite
 proportions. The pure combinations of metals with chlorine
 resemble in many respects oxides ; they are non-conductors
 of electricity, many of them are very volatile, and they form
  muriates by decomposing water.        Mr. John Davy describes
 two combinations of copper and chlorine, one containing
 twice as much chlorine as the other.         Two of iron and
  chlorine, one containing half as much as the other.         Ami
  two of tin and chlorine, of w hich the second contains double
 as much chlorine as the first. Bismuth, antimony, arsenic,
  zinc, lead, he has been able to combine with chlorine in
  one proportion only.      Between the oxygen in oxides and
  the chlorine in these combinations, the rate is as 7 5 to
  33*6. Many of these combinations with chlorine combiue
  with oils : and Libavius's liquor, the compound of chlorine
"and tin, inflames in acting upon oil of turpentine.        As the
  oxides are soluble in acids, so likewise are these compounds
  in an acid that they cannot decompose.          Corrosive sub
  limate forms   a particular salt, by combining with muriatic

acid, and there are other analogous substances. Mr. John
Davy considered    the whole tenour of these experiments as
offering confirmations of the fact that oxymuriatic gas, or
chlorine, has not yet been decompounded, and that it is a
solvent and acidifying principle analogous to oxygen.

                     ROYAL    INSTITUTION.
    Mr. Davy's    Lectures on the Elements         of Chemical
                           Philosophy.
    Mr. Davy delivered his second lecture on Saturday, Feb.
the first.   He offered some general views concerning the
different modifications of matter, and the active powers en
gaged in the production of the phenomena of nature and
of art ; he then directed the attention of his audience to
heat, or calorific expansion.      He considered its important
and diversified agencies in the ceconomy of things; and after
an elaborate discussion concerning the mechanical and che
mical hypotheses relative to the nature of heat, he concluded
by defining the limits of our knowledge on the subject.
    The expansive energy, or power of repulsion producing
heat; and attraction, which is either gravitative, chemical,
or electrical, being one of the active powers belonging to
matter, which cannot be separated from it  matter itself
may be considered as inert, and all the harmonious arrange
ments in the heavens and the earth may be regarded as
flowing from one primary cause, which, as it is intelligent,
says Mr. Davy, must be divine.
    The Professor entered into particular details relative to
the effects of heat, its importance, and the laws of its ope
rations. The law of expansion is connected with the equali
zation of the temperature of the globe, the production of
winds, and the preservation of animal and vegetable life.
He particularly pointed out its application to the ventilation
of mines, and the heating and ventilating of rooms. He
exhibited a model, illustrating the manner by which the
House of Lords is ventilated and warmed, after a new plan
proposed by himself.      All the air deteriorated by respiration
or combustion in the house, finds a ready exit by means
of three copper pipes carried to the roof, and ultimately
meeting in a single pipe ; the circulation of the air is assisted
by a furnace, and by means of ventilators bchxv there is a
constant supply of fresh air.      Such a plan Mr. Davy coii-
ceives might be adopted in large drawing-rooms,             or in
crowded assemblies, \vith excellent effect and at a trifling
expense.
                                                              The

                       Royal Institution.                  133
    The formation of elastic fluids arising from the decompo
sition of vegetable and animal matters, proceeds very slowly
under pressure: in illustrating this principle Mr. Davy re
ferred to the method lately adopted by M. Appert for pre
serving meat or vegetables, which consists of enclosing
them in close tin plate vessels, excluded from the contact
of air. Putrefaction cannot proceed unless aeriform fluids
escape.     Mr. Davy conceives that this method may be im
proved by using stronger vessels, and compressing into
them a quantity of fixed air, which by its pressure and
chemical properties would prevent decomposition.
    In illustrating the effects of combustion, Mr. Davy no
ticed some recent experiments made by Count Rumford,
who conceives that the light emitted is proportional to the
heat of ihe flame, and that it may be greatly increased by
bringing several parallel wicks near each other.       A model
of what the Count calls a polyflame light was exhibited.
It had four wicks, and the Count states that a lamp of this
kind, when properly constructed, will afford as much light
as 50 wax candles.
    Mr. Davy concluded his lecture by explaining the phse-
nometia of heat on the mechanical hypothesis of its being
a vibratory motion of the particles of bodies ; and accounted
for latent heat, when solids are converted into fluids, by
supposing that the motion is employed to make the par
ticles revolve round their axis. He offered this view, merely
for the purpose of comparison with the idea of a specific
fluid, the existence of which had often been too confidently
advanced by some philosophers.         On such a subject it was
proper to doubt.       The facts of science should he kept per
 fectly distinct from the hypothetical opinions advanced to
 explain them.
     "The truly philosophical inquirer into nature," says Mr.
 Davy, "    will not consider it as a disgrace that he is unable ¦
 to explain every thing.       He will feel that truth is more
 promoted by the minute and accurate examination of a few
 objects, than by any premature attempts to form grand and
 universal theories."
     Mr. Davy delivered his 3d Lecture on Saturday, Feb. 8,
 (it  was upon chemical attraction).      After stating that the/
 most important phamomena of chemical change depend
 upon the operation of chemical attraction, and on the
 agencies of heat, the Professor said  it    would be necessary
 to enter intoa    discussion of the laws of attraction, and to
 illustrate them  by   experiments.   This discussion, he said,
 might appear minute and tedious but
                                   ;        it  was essential, as.

I 'M                    Rnyal IuslUution.
mica! philosophy was to be erected ; and it should therefore
be constructed with care.      Mr. Davv mentioned that che
mical attraction was the power bv which different bodies
unite with each other and form new and different substances;
that some bodies possess no chemical attraction, and other*
exert it with different degrees of force; which he illustrated by
experiments. He said, the law of combination, of the union
by chemical attraction, applied to all the different ponde
rable forms of matter; fluids not only produce solid matter,
but sometimes likewise gaseous matter ; and gases are
condensed into fluids or solids : he instanced the combi
nation of aquafortis, or nitric acid, with alcohol; also ole-
fiant gas and chlorine ; likewise sulphureous acid gas with
ammonia; and proved, that as their forms and properties
were visibly changed, so likewise were their other sensible
qualities.   He next referred to his introductory lecture, in
which he mentioned that bodies which attract each other
unite in definite proportions.    This law, said the Professor,
is perhaps the most important of our science, and admits
of elucidation by a number of experiments. He showed
the combinations of barytes and sulphuric acid, chlorine
and hydrogen, hydrogen and oxvgen : thev always unite
in definite proportions.    Mr. Davy showed also some ex
periment qii the combination of muriatic acid gas with
ammonia. This experiment, he said, was mentioned lately
in a monthly publication, by Mr. Murray, to prove the
presence of water in muriatic acid gas; but the Professor
clearly proved, that the presence of water was owing to the
hygrometric qualities of the salt, which, when exposed to
the atmosphere for an instant-, absorbs moisture directly ;
and he showed an experiment, in w hich, when muriatic gas
and ammonia were combined out of the atmosphere and
heated, not an atom of water could be procured from them.
Nature acts by this fixed and immutable law ; and her ar
rangements, said he, however diversified, follou a certain
order; the circumstances of crystallization and definite
proportion form the alphabet by which her chemical lan
guage is to be deciphered; and it is not composed of nu
merous hieroglyphics, hut of a few simple characters.      Mr.
Davy said, that when two bodies combine in more than
one proportion, si    their proportions are definite, that the
gecond proportion   is ill
                       always     multiple or
                                  a            a divisor of the
first  ;hp instanced mercury, w hich combines with two
proportions of oxygen, the second oxide contains double
the quantity of oxygen of the first; also fluoric acid,
which combines with ammonia in two proportions, viz.
one    involume, and two     involume; so that the first con

    tains half as much alkali as the second : also Dr. VVollas-
   tou's experiment of equal weights of carbonate of potash,
   one fused, the other in its common state ; the one contain
   ing exactly half as much gas as the other.         Be said it was
   in consequence    of these circumstances,     that whenever  com
   pounds decompose each other by double affinity or double
   attraction, there is always merely a new arrangement of their
   elements, and none of the substances are found either in
   excess or deficiency : he instanced the salt called nitrate of
   barytes, which, when mixed with an equal weight of that
  called sulphate of potash,! the potash unites to the nitric
   acid, and the barytes to the sulphuric acid, and the results
  are neutral as before. It  is,  said Mr. Davy, in consequence
  of this simple law, that whenever one body precipitates
  another from its solution, he same quantity of one always
                                t
  precipitates the same quantity of the other          and hence the
                                                        ;
  different chemical elements may be expressed               by
                                                           numbers,
  and all their combinations be represented             by
                                                      the simple ad
  dition of those numbers.        Some of those principles, said
  he, may appear abstruse   ;    but     the proportions be consi
                                         if
  dered as uniform parts, there can be no difficulty in under
  standing the doctrine.      On this part of the science, said the
   Professor,it   is  necessary to gain distinct ideas      the doc
                                                             ;
  trines of chemical affinity become the instruments for com
  paring the results of our experiments, and their deviation
  from or coincidence with the law of proportion are the
  tests of their accuracy or imperfection.         These doctrines,
 said he, are capable of being made the guides both to the
  practical and philosophical chemist          they teach the artist
                                               ;
 or manufacturer what proportions of substances are neces
 sary for his combinations,      and enable him to pursue new
 principles with precision and certainty.
     Mr. Davy delivered his fourth Lecture on Saturday Feb.
 15th.     He considered and illustrated the principles of elec
 trical science, as developed bv the various combinations of
 human ingenuity, and exhibited               in
                                            the phaenomena taking
 place in the external world.
     When resin, glass, &c. are rubbed             by
                                                 woollen, they first
 attract, and after contact repel, light substances. Bodies in
 such a   state are said to be electrical. This property was first
 observed in amber, called electron                by
                                                 the Greeks, from
which the term electricity      isderived.
     In the Kith century, the researches of Gilbert awakened
the attention of philosophers.          He considered electricity
as exhibiting the attractive and repellent powers of matter.
The sagacity of Newton pointed out these powers as pecu
liar forces.                             ,.
                            I        4                            Otto

ISO                      Royal Institution.
     Otto de Guerickc, Boyle, Hawkesbee, 8cc. observed that
luminous appearances were exhibited by electrified bodies,
and for a series of years these novel exhibitions served rather
to amuse scientific men than to direct them to the funda
mental principles of electricity.
      The discovery of franklin, that lightning depends on
 the electrical state of the atmosphere, gave a new impulse
 to this department of knowledge ; and the novel facts ob
 served by Galvani led to the noble inventions of Volta.
" The discoveries to which they led," says Mr. Davy, have f
 produced a new order and arrangement of facts, and have
 to a certain extent connected together mechanical and che
 mical science, and exhibited new and unexpected proper
 ties of material bodies."
      The Professor said, that in treating of the subject he
 should offer views different from any that have been de
 veloped by elementary writers on electricity ; but no apology
 was necessary, the progressive nature of science is one of
 its noblest characters. As the facts of e^etricity have mul
 tiplied, the theory is more capable of being simplified ; a
 number of effects formerly supposed to be insulated may
 be attributed to the same cause.
      Mr. Davy described the different modes in which elec
 tricity is excited, bv the contact of bodies, by friction, by
 heat and changes of their form ; and this property seems
 to belong to all material substances.
      In the mineral kingdom there are several stones which
  exhibit electrical effects by being heated, as the tourmaline,
  boracite, &c.      Dry vegetable substances and most crys
  tallized bodies produce these phenomena by friction, and
  the metals by contact.       Thus zinc made to touch mercury
  becomes' positive, the mercury is negative.     The case is the
  same with other metals, as gold and mercury, copper and
  mercury,' &c. Even fluids and metals produce similar ef
  fects, as in the case of liver of sulphur and copper.
       The electrical effects produced by the contact of different
  metals are less obvious than those connected with luminous
  appearances ; but they may be perceived by the sensations,
    or by the «.fleets produced on ihe limbs of cold-blooded
   animals recently deprived of life, as in the celebrated ex
  periment of Galvani, who conceived that the effect was
   produced by a specific subtile fluid; but the genius of Voltaj
   said Mr. Davy, proved that it was electrical, and gave the
  demonstration of its principles in one of the noblest iuven-
   jions ever produced by human sagacity.
       " Very slight circumstances, " said the Professor, ** are
   sufficient to develop these important powers of matter, and

                         Royal Institution,.                        137
they must be continually in operation in external nature;
their grandeur and sublimity are exhibited in the thunder
storm ; and in their more tranquil agencies they minister
to the order of the terrestrial system, and perform slowly
and silently important functions in the oeconomy of things."
,     Electricity, by influence or induction, is different for
different substances; and the phenomena of electricity, by
  influence, exhibit the difference between conductors, im
 perfect conductors, and non-conductors.             It is also on the
 principle of induction, combined          in  some    cases with that
 of primary excitation, that the powers          of   the  instruments
for accumulating electricity depend,          as  in   the  J-eydenjar
  and Voltaic apparatus.
      Mr. Davy exhibited the powers of the Voltaic instru
 ment by some brilliant experiments; medals were fused
 upon the surface of water and oil of turpentine, and burnt
  in contact with them. He slated that the maximum of
 heat was at the positive electrical surface ; and he exhibited
  an experiment iu which, though the most brilliant light
  was at the negative surface, yet the ignition was infinitely
  greater at the positive.
      The Professor pointed out the analogy between the Vol
  taic battery and the organs of the torpedo and gymnotus.
  " These mean animals," said he, " in the bosom of the
  waters, are found armed with the power that produces
   lightning and thunder. The more the resources of art are
   extended!, the more analogies to them are found in nature,
   which offers j as it were, the archetypes of even our happiest
   and most extraordinary invention."
       In speaking of lightning, the Professor said, that rods
   intended to preserve buildings from its effects should be at
   least half an inch thick, and coated at top and bottom with
   platina, to prevent the effects of the weather. They should
   also terminate, if possible, in a moist stratum of earth.
       In considering the applications of electrical science to
   explain natural phenomena, Mr. Davy said, that the brilli
    ant and astonishing discoveries made known in this science
    in the -middle of last century, attracted the attention of
    speculative as well as of experimental philosophers; and at
    tempts were made to explain all the great and extraordinary
    phenomena of nature by electrical agencies.
                                                           " New prin
    ciples," said he, when first discovered, are always extend
                      c<
    ed too far ; the imagination, like the eye, is dazzled by no
    vel and brilliant lights, and time is required before objects
    are seen in their true relations or proper colours."
       The natural appearances which may with probability be
    attributed to, or supposed to be connected with, electrical
    >                                                            effects.

    138                   Royal Institution.
   effects, Mr. Davy considers, are water-spouts, some earth
   quakes, the luminous phaenomena in storms, and the au
   rora borealis or northern lights.      Lightning and the thun
   der-bolt, said he, were regarded by the ancients as the
   terrible instruments of the divine vengeance        of heaven.
   The moderns, in developing their causes, have not only
  disarmed them of their powers, but have removed much of
  the superstitious fears which they occasioned, and have
  shown their uses in the ceconomy of things.       In the system
  of nature the obvious effect is often the least important,
  and that which seems evil, when distinctly considered, is
  found only to exalt the good and render it more impressive.

     Mr. Davy's fifth lecture was delivered on Saturday, Fe
  bruary 22d.      He illustrated the laws of electricitv by the
  great  Voltaic   battery, consisting of two thousand double
  plates  of  copper and zinc, of four inches square. He show
  ed the ideniity of Voltaic and common electricity, and ex
  hibited the decomposing agencies of the battery in a series
 of beautiful and impressive experiments, many of which
 were of a novel kind.
     The identity of Voltaic and common electricity is de
 monstrated by the spark, the effects produced on the in
 struments employed for exhibiting electrical phaenomena,
 as electrometers, the electrical battery, and on the organs of
 sensation.      When bodies are similarly electrified by Vol
 taic as by common electricity, they repel each other; but
 when dissimilarly, they attract each other. The electrical
 battery was charged, and produced a spark by a single con
 tact from the Voltaic, instrument.      The more the powers of
 the Voltaic battery are investigated, the more correct the
 original views of Volu appear concerning the identity of
 Voltaic and common electricity.           Mr. Davy could not
 avoid reprobating the use of the terms Galvanic batteries
 and Galvanic electricity.      Galvaui was only the accidental
discoverer of an important fact. Volta ascertained           the
true cause of the phaenomena, and the merit of correct views
and of sagacity peculiarly belongs to him.         " Where the
names of men are to be connected with science," says Mr.
Davy,     "  truth should be rigorously attended to. Almost
the only reward offered in these times to scientific excel
lence, is fame ; and philosophical men should award it
with the same justice to the living as to the dead."
    Mr. Davy distinguished the chemical agencies of the
                                                         battery

battery into two kinds  into decompositions by ignition,
and polnr decompositions.             The former are exhibited when
compound gases,           fluids,   or  solids are submitted to the
agency     of  the fire  excited  by electricity.      The latter, when
alkaline, earthy, or metallic combinations in a fluid state,
or moistened with water, are acted on by the battery. Mr.
Davy illustrated these different decompositions by appro
priate experiments.          Sulphurated hydrogen andolefiant gai
were decomposed in glass globes by the contact of char
coal. These experiments were novel and impressive, es
pecially that on sulphurated hydrogen gas, the sulphur was
precipitated in the form of a dense white cloud.
     Mr. Davy decomposed soluble and insoluble compounds,
as nitre, sulphate of barytes, &c. and in all decompositions
lie found that alkalies, metals, metallic oxides, and hy
drogen, were uniformly attracted by the negative surface,
and repelled by the positive surface ; and that acids, oxy
gen, and chlorine were uniformly attracted by the positive
 and repelled by the negative surface.                It was in conse
quence     of  the discovery     of  this law  of  decomposition, that
 Mr. Davy decompounded the fixed alkalies, the earths, &c.
     Mr. Davy explained the transfer or passage of an acid
 through intervening alkali, or vice versa. In such cases the
 usual operation of chemical affinity appears to be suspended
 or destroyed by the agencies of Voltaic electricity.                  Mr.
Daw pointed out the application of the chemical polar
 agencies of electricity, to obtain alkali from the decompo
 sition of neutral salts.
     In illustrating the fusing powers of the battery, the Pro
 fessor stated, that the German philosophers were said to have
 convened charcoal into a substance analogous to diamond,
 by a powerful combination.             The only effect which he had
 been able to witness in trials of this kind, was, that the
 charcoal became harder at the points of contact.                   He ex
 hibited    an  experiment     in which    very  fine  points  of charcoal
 were electrized in chlorine gas, but there appeared to be no
 indications of fusion.
      Electrical decompositions and combinations,                 there is
 great    reason    to  believe,  are  constantly    taking   place  in the
 bosom of the earth and on its surface ; and many of those
  phenomena, says Mr. Davy, which are attributed by con
  tending theorists, either to the effects of water or fire, may
  possibly be owing to more refined agencies operating in the
 course of ages, and producing effects scarcely perceptible in
  the short period allotted to human observation.
     The surface of the globe must be influenced by the elec
  trical changes which occur in the atmosphere, and they
                                                                       pi ay

 may act an important part in the formation and renovation
 of soils.
     To some, says Mr. Davy, these circumstances may ap
 pear too minute to be dwelt upon
                                             but nothing which
 marks intelligence       in   the  ceconomy of Nature, he said,
 should be passed over without notice.         We recognise, with
 feelings   of pleasure,   the  combinations  of  ingenuity in hu
 man inventions ; and surely the grand arrangements of Na
 ture are worthy of our contemplation ; and if we can feel
 sentiments of respect and obligation to the contrivers of ar
 tificial machinery, limited in purpose, feeble in effect, we
 cannot refuse the higher tribute of gratitude and devotion
 to the Author of the mechanism ot the universe, where
 the scheme is designed by infinite wisdom and goodness,
 and executed by infinite power. ¦
     Mr. Davy stated, that the chemical attractions of bodies
 are nearly related to their electrical polarities; the chemical
agents which act most powerfully on each other, produce the
most striking electrical phaenomena. The powers of all Vol
taic combinations appear to be, in some measure, propor
tional to the chemical attractions of the acting bodies.
     Mr. Davy stated, that he had been misunderstood rela
tive to the ideas he formerly advanced concerning electrical
and chemical attractions.         He did not say that chemical at
tractions were produced by electrical attractions, or vice
versa.     He conceived that they may be different exhibitions
of the same powers of matter, in one case acting upon par
ticles, and in the other upon masses.        He wished, however,
not to attach much importance to this or any other hypo
thetical notion.      Hypothesis, he said, should always be in
duction from experiments, and should be regarded as dan
gerous and unprofitable when it does not lead to new ex
periments.

    Feb. 21st, 1812.    An extract of a letter from Mr.   J. R.
Jones of Holywell to the President was read, giving an
 account of a specimen, presented by him to the Society, of
 supposed native lead, found in a bed of gravel in the
 neighbourhood of Holywell.
    An extract of a letter communicated by the Hon. Henry
 Grey Bennet, member of the Geol. Society, was read, de
 scribing a submarine volcano which made its appearance
 on Feb. 1st, 1811, off the Island of St. Michael's in the
 Azores.
    The reading of a paper by W. Phillips, Esq. member of
 the Geol. Society, entitled      A description of the oxide of
 tin the production of Cornwall; of the primitive crystal
 and its modifications, including an attempt to ascertain
 with precision the admeasurements of its angles mechani
 cally, by means of the reflecting goniometer of Dr. Wol-
 laston : to which is added, a series of its crystalline forms
 and varieties,"  was commenced.
     The native oxide of tin appears to have been found in
 almost every district of Cornwall, and in the opinion of
 Mr. Phillips is by no means peculiar to the primitive rocks
  of that country.      Particular crystalline modifications of
  this substance characterize particular veins.
     Alluvial depositions of tin of considerable extent and
  depth have been found in several parts of Cornwall, which
                                                         appears

 occurs under these circumstances.            The peculiar variety
called wood tin has hitherto onlv been met with in these
beds, or stream-works as they are termed in the country;
and these have also furnished the only specimens of gold
hitherto found in Cornwall.
   Among the specimens of tin in the collection of Mr.
Phillips, it may be observed occurring in granite, in mica
slate, and in other varieties of schist, accompanied by
chlorite, tourmaline, calcareous spar, schiefer spar, topaz,
calcedony, quartz, fluor spar, and clorophane ; yellow cop
per ore, blende, arsenical pyrites, and wolfram.

   The objects of this Society      are, according to its Prospec
tus, " those of every man who      loves improvement :  to foster
genius, to eradicate unphilosophic prejudice, to increase
the knowledge of nature, and most, of man ; to destroy, as
much    as  possible,  that false definition of words which has
been  justly  reprobated by Locke and Bacon as the origin of
sophistry and misconception ; but, above all, to remove that
barrier erected by pedantry against universal knowledge,
which has introduced an esprit de corps into philosophy,
and rendered it the territory of a sect rather than the pro
vince of the world."
   The means which they adopt to effect these desirable pur-
posesWre, principally by the production of lectures in every
department of philosophy, excepting theology and poli
tics; and by a rigorous subsequent examination, in which
Truth is the solitary object of devotion, and the inductive
system of Bacon the portal to her shrine.           This principle
of responsibility imposed       on  the  lecturer we  believe to be
perfectly original ; and the good resulting from it must be

of original talent, it lops away       the puny excrescences    of
plagiarism, and the decayed branches of false and unwar
rantable hypothesis.
    The attention of the Society has, for this month, been
chiefly directed to a brief course of lectures on the Pyra
mids, by Mr. Clarkson, as a prelude to a regular attempt at
illustrating the hieroglyphical language.
    The first object of Mr. C. is to establish the point, that
the Pyramids in question were not sepulchres, but temples
dedicated to the mysteries of Solar Fire ; and we think he
has succeeded.       Indeed, he has brought together such a
mass of evidence from every possible source, from Arabian
manuscript, Coptic tradition, Hindoo analogy, Greek re
cord, various etymology, and logical deduction ; he has
condensed such an intense corradiation of proof, as we feel
assured will scarcely fail, on perusal, to produce a simul
taneous conviction.        It is impossible for us to follow him
through all the various channels of his research ; it is suf
ficient to say, that part of his lectures was occupied with
proving that the Pyramids were not sepulchres, and the re
mainder in arguing that the passages of those singular
buildings were devoted to the mysteries of Pire.          In pur
 suing the first of these divisions, he rests his conclusions on
the following facts:  That the form of the Pyramids was
sacred and mysterious ; and this he proved by the pyra
midal stones sacred to the Sun, to Hermes, to the Paphian
Venus, and, in modern times, to Bramha.
    He proceeds from this to trace the connection of this
form with the geometrical philosophy of the Egyptians,
which descended from them to the Platonists and Pythago
reans; and he imagines it scarcely probable, that a nation
imbued with such a veneration for this form as the Egyp
tians were, would have consecrated it to the purpose of shel
tering the body of a single monarch at an enormous ex
pense.     If this building were intended to neutralize the che
mical properties of Nature in this body, as Napoleon was
informed, he inquires, how it came that the builders left a
hole of a foot in diameter, which perforates the wall of the
second pyramid to the central room ? If this body was that
of Cheops, as it has been affirmed, how was it that Cheops,
who despised the theology of the Egyptians, should spend
a whole life in building a mausoleum which belied his own
atheistical notions, and confessed his fears to be under the
influence of the priests whom he despised? As to the Sar
cophagus, he remarks, that six circumstances mark that it
was never intended for a tomb. If it could neither be intro

duced by the common entrance passage, nor by the welJ,
how was the body to be deposited within it ? Would the
attendants convey it in their arms ? This was impossible, for
a single man can scarcely penetrate one department of the
passages  or would they drag it by cords ? This was ab
surd to suppose, when the Egyptian veneration for the dead
was called to mind :  and supposing this true, what was the
use of so many passages so curiously contrived ? Was it to
increase the magnificence of the burial ? This could not be ;
for the passages are in general only three feet and a half
high, and only one of them leads to the upper room. Was
it for the attendants, who, according to Maillet's theory,
were buried alive with the dead monarch ? This was ridicu
lous, for they were confined to a single room : and for
what purpose the two rooms, the five galleries, the platforms,
and the well ? And if the niche in the lower room were de
dicated to the mummy of the queen, how came it that the
unalterable laws of the Egyptian priests were violated at the
same time, and in the same building?          How came it that
the body in the sarcophagus was placed horizontally, but
the body in the queen's chamber perpendicularly ? The six
circumstances, from whence he infers his conclusion, are
therefore, 1st, that it was impracticable to bury the body
with any the least degree of decency in the sarcophagus ;
2d, that the form was not likely to be given to the human
body, being half the width of the length ; 3d, that it was
customary for the Egyptians to hollow the internal cavity
of their real sarcophagi in the human shape, and this is not
so formed ; 4th, that it was a custom of the Egyptians to
decorate them with hieroglyphics, and this is not so adorned ;
5th, that it was likewise a custom of the Egyptians, de
pending upon invariable laws, to place them upright against
a wall, and this is not so placed :  it may be said, that it has
been moved ; but it is fixed, and the attempt to dig for trea
sure beneath      it,of which the testimonials still remain,
proves   thatit retains its original position ; and 6th, that the
sarcophagus    consists of  two  exact cubes  ; and   this circum
stance, combined with its mystic situation, which           is  pre
cisely that of one of the foci of an eHipse, supposing an
ellipse inscribed on the rectangle of the floor, substantiates
clearly the fact, that its purposes were mysterious To what
purposes then, asked Mr. C. was          it applied ?   to those of
lustration, similar to the same vases in Hindostan? We
have Tanks of this description, adds Mr.      C,    in the British
Museum, and no one ever imagined that they were in
tended for sepulchres.     He then proceeds with        a just and
sensible argument, drawn frou> the pyramidal Temples of/
                                                            India.

                   London Philosophical Society.            145
 India. These temples, as he observes, bear the same exter
 nal character, have similar internal passages, and yet no one
 ever imagined that these temples were mausoleums.        Why
 then do we induce a different conclusion where the premises
 are the same ?      He pursues this argument by producing an
 extract from a Brahmin tradition, {the Maha Calpa,) which
 asserts that a Hindoo conqueror was the founder of the
 Pyramids, that the Sarcophagus was devoted to the myste
 ries of the Egyptian Isis, and that the well communicates
 with immense subterraneous regions, a circumstance sup
 ported by another extract from an Arabian manuscript.
 We agree, however, with Mr. C. that although it is ex
 tremely probable that there was a legitimate entrance to the
 pyramid of Cheops; yet that, if it rested on the mere Cop
 tic tradition recorded in the manuscript described, it would
 by no means be worthy of implicit credence. We give him
 credit for sacrificing speculation on this and on other occa
 sions to prudence ; and we think he has acted wisely in.
 abstaining from the question, when the Pyramid was built?
 though it is settled by the manuscript at 300 years before
 the Deluge.
    With regard to his etymological definition, though we
 entertain no greater respect for it than Mr. C. considered as
 affording illustration, we think that the Hebrew word Py-
ramido, the revelation of Perfection, or the Bull, is a
 much less strained analogy than Booremilh, the cave of
Death. It is curious, however, that the Coptic word Meed,
which corresponds with the Greek Malhos, the Jewish Mi-
do, signifies in Shanscrit a college of priests, and, when
combined with the foregoing part of the word, implies that
Fire was the object of their devotion.
    To proceed : If it be proved that the Pyramids were not
sepulchres, there appears to be no alternative but admitting
that they were Sabean temples.        But Mr. Clarkson is not
satisfied with this position, singly considered, and has
therefore entered into a variety ot evidence to prove that
the passages afforded the original model of initiatory ca
verns.     After detailing at some length the exoteric and
esoteric   rites of the ancient nations with a degree of erudi
tion which does him credit, he proceeds to adapt the de
scription of these rites to the peculiar form of the pyramidal
recesses.      We copy this adaptation, because we consider it
extremely ingenious ; and though we are ready to admit
that it bears a character of abstract speculation, we think,
as. he has established his main point, that the details de-

pending on that point may be allowed a little clothing from
a clasical imagination.
   " It is sufficient for me to observe, on the admission of
the foregoing premises,     that the room situated in the exact
centre of the Pyramid of Cheops, as the Sun is situated in
the centre of that starry system of which the Pyramid is a
symbol, must have been devoted to Osiris.         Next, that the
situation of the Sarcophagus, exactly placed on one of the
foci of an ellipse, and formed of two exact cubes, both of
which circumstances were symbols of the same meaning,
was dedicated to the birth of Horus, or Light, one of the
gemini who sprung from the egg of Chaos.                Now the
Gemini were like the Cherubim, the two visible apparitions
of the Triune Principle ; for, according to Pausanias, the
number of the Dioscuri originally corresponded with the
Cabiri. And here I cannot but remark, that, according to
the Pythagoreans, in two minds, that                    is,
                                                 Isis and Osiris,
was contained the great generating Fountain of souls,
and that Light and Life sprung from their mystical marriage.
Now the Demiurgic principles of nature were represented
 by cubic stones.    Hence the cubic temple of Mecca, hence
the cubic stone of Bubaste. The temple of Solomon was
indeed built upon     a  similar model       consisted of three
                                              ;    it
exact cubes, two of which were visible, but one invisible.
   " For myself -have no doubt, although

We learn from Synesius, that these Arks, according to the
priests, contained the Spheres        those Spheres which were
                                        ;
sometimes represented              by
                               semicircles, and sometimes             by
cubes; those Spheres, of which the Dioscuri, the Sephy
roth, the Cherubim,       (and even Proserpine, the object of
Eleusinian initiation,) were alike the symbols.          We are
told, moreover,      bySuidas and Eusebius, that Arks were
devoted to the mysteries of Fire, and that they were consi
 dered sacred, as well as the triangular form, to the great
triple Deity of Eleusinian as well as Egyptian initiation,
Bacchus, Proserpine, and Ceres.        But that nothing may be
wanting to identify these Arks with the triangular Pyramid,

the chamber      of Osiris-Bacchus, and the Sarcophagus it
self, Pausanias informs us that the Image of Bacchus was
found in a Chest which was said to be the gift of Vulcan 
that Vulcan of whom the Pyramid was a symbol  that
Chest of which theSarcophagus w as a model  that Bacchus
to whom the central room was certainly devoted.             Finally,
to complete the evidence, for it is impossible to turn with
out finding so many proofs as can scarcely be condensed
into two Lectures, we hear from Plutarch, that on the
third day after Osiris had been deposited in his Ark, during
which time he was supposed to have descended into Hades,
(the lower hemisphere of the astronomers,') they opened             it,
and brought forth/a Heifer to the people as the Deity restored
to life.    Now the famous manuscript of Denon represents
the exact point of time.         The Sarcophagus on which the
Heifer rises,      evidently the mystical tomb of Osiris, from
                   is
the prostrate figure on the side and the triune symbol above        ;
and it   certainly agrees with the figure of the pyramidal Ark.
I  shall add,      byway of corollary to this evidence, that the
Hebrew word Pyramido signifies           revelation of the Heifer,
                                              a

even while they knew as much of the principles of statuary
as the Greeks, they sacrificed the truth of proportion and of

 the outward wall, and the other to the foundations of the
 Pyramids, I should answer, with very little hesitation, that
 they were devoted to secret communication,             and most
 likely  to inform  the assembled   priests of the exact  moment
 when the initiate entered the north angle, or the well,
 consider this as a much more satisfactory and plain state
 ment than that of Savary, who contends that one of them
 was intended to convey food to the visionary personages
 he here confined ; for, according to his own hypothesis,
 it was scarcely possible to ascend the external wall ; and
 it is not very probable that a eet of priests, tenacious
 to a refinement of their secrets, should have suffered
 a basket of provisions to be dangling from a height of
 two hundred feet  a mere realization of Mother Bunch's
 Tales.     But it is the constant feature of a forced hypo
 thesis, that some little difficulty is perpetually starting
 which requires a correcting or a pruning hand. For myself,
 though I feel conscious that my powers of research are
 infinitely inferior to those who have preceded me, yet satis
 fied that I have yielded every thing to fact, and nothing to
 imagination, I am persuaded, that every candid and unpre
judiced mind will .submit to the weight of evidence I have
 adduced, and particularly to that harmony of feature which
 pervades and characterizes the system which I have endea
 voured to erect with comparatively feeble powers, but with
 unremitting patience of investigation.        Even the narrow
communication between the first and second gallery, which
has confounded and perplexed the opposite theorists, and
certainly put them to their last shifts of explanation, is to
me a matter of triumph and of aid. For I have only to
 rad the ordinary descriptions of travellers, and the cause
of it is apparent. We are compelled, they all concur, to
strip ourselves at this point, and to crawl upon our bellies
like serpents ;  and behold two accredited steps of ancient
initiation : for it is notorious that these actions, rendered
necessary by the skill of the architect, are symbolical rites,
representing at once the fall of man, and hts willingness to
return to his original simplicity and purity.      Indeed, if the
analogy were not so strong as it is, we arc not deficient in
evidence, drawn from the cave of Trophonius, St. Patrick,
&c. which were built upon a" similar model, that the narrow
ness of the passage was intended to impress a feeling of
terror on the mystic votary.      Proceeding, therefore, by the
same analogical clue, the concession seems as it were ex
acted from us, that the five platforms and five galleries
were the inferior gates of the great Sidereal Ladder which

                   London Philosophical     Society.          149
led   the initiate to the central Sanctorum of Osiris. The
 Coptic manuscript says, that there were images of the Stars
and the Sun and Moon within  hut the arrangement of the
 passage speaks for itself.        I have before proved that the
Sephyroth, with its own gates, was an Egyptian mystery.
It remains    to observe, that all the ancient temples of which
we have record, were built upon an astronomical principle.
 Of this, the temples of Mecca, of Solomon, of Elephanta,
are proofs.      Nay, there were pyramidal temples in Chaldea
and Mexico, which were erected on the very principle of the
 Sidereal Ladder and the Sephyroth. There is nothing, there
 fore, overstrained     in seeking; for it in the Pyramids of
 Egypt, expressly dedicated to the Universal System. It
 must be recollected, however, that the Sidereal Ladder was
 not alwavs uniformly represented.          It was not in the two
 instances before us; one consisted of concentric circles, the
 other of steps.     We know that the Jewish Sephyroth was
 sometimes represented by a tree.          We know too that the
 Tree of Knowledge was represented on the same astrono-
 cal principle by the Oriental nations, and by the 1'latonists
 themselves; and this is proved by Egyptian and Mithraic
 monuments.        For instance, they painted it by a Tree with
 one trunk, with three branches, and seven different kinds
 of fruit, typifying the Planets, and represented the Fruit of
 Life by the Sun, and of Death by the Moon. The Rab
 bins, indeed, express themselves in the same manner in
 mvsticizing on the branches of theSephyroth. If then we re
 fer this mvsticizing theory to the branches of the Pyramidal
caverns, we shall tind an exact and striking coincidence.
    "  As to the magnificent passage which leads to the Solar
 chamber, I should imagine, from the benches which accom
pany the course of the walls, and their distinct division
into something like the stalls of monastic temples, that it
was occupied by the assembled College of Priests, who pos
 sibly witnessed the efforts and triumphed in the success of
the blindfold initiate.      The descent of Ulysses and of Or
 pheus seem both      to  allude to thv latter circumstance; but
 the curiosity   of Orpheus removed the veil.
    " But however this may have been, there can be little
doubt, that most of the poetical descents into Hell origi
nated in the third passage. The description of it singularly
coincides with that of Virgil.        There are at the end of the
second gallery, three ways, the one leading to Elysium,
(the abode of the Sun, according to Bryant,) the other to
the abode of Proserpine (the Queen's chamber), and the
last to Tartarus, that is to the Catacombs, the only Infera of

the Egyptians.     It was here then that three priests were
stationed to prevent the intrusion of improper persons, who
in the Coptic language were called Caen, a word which the
Greeks translated Dogs, and thence the triple-headed Dog
Cerberus of the poets.       And here, if I may be allowed to
speculate on the description of Virgil, that beneath an over
shadowing rock, to the left, the city of Tartarus was placed
at the entrance of these ways, I should place the dungeon
of the Temple in the grotto beneath ; for there is little doubt
that the Tartarus of the poets originated in the penances
of the Priests, exemplified either in ihe persons of their re
fractory satellites, or on those of initiates who had violated
their oaths. Hence arose the stories of Sisyphus, Ixion, of
the Danaides, victims, as it would appear, condemned to
draw water, to raise stones, or to move the wheels of ma
chinery."
    Mr. Clarkson then proceeds with an interesting descrip
tion of Elysium, which he contends was the garden of the
Monastic College ; detailing rather at large the mystic dra
mas that were there represented, and ending with a' learned
and curious argument on the Origin and Effects of Drama
tic Representation.
    Upon the whole, we take our leave of Mr. C. with con
siderable feelings of respect.     We have derived at once
pleasure and information from his lectures, and we sympa
thize cordially with his future objects.
         WERNERIAN     NATURAL     HISTORY     SOCIETY.
    At the first winter meeting of this Society, an interesting
communication from Dr. Arthur Edmondstone was read,
concerning the Larus parasiticus, or Arctic Gull.         Owing
to the remote situation of the haunts of this gull, its history
 and .manners have hitherto been little known.           Dr. Ed 
mondstone has now illustrated them.        He has observed two
 kinds of arctic gulls in the Shetland islands ; the common
 sort, with the breast and belly of a mouse colour; and an-        -
 other sort with the breast and belly pure white.     Each kind
 keeps together;   and   the white is a larger  and heavier  bird,
 but less bold than the other. The Doctor is therefore in
 clined to consider these not merely as varieties, but as di
 stinct species.
    At the same meeting, Professor Jameson read to the So
 ciety a short description of several varieties of the precious
 stone named Zircon, which he had lately discovered im
 bedded in sienite, in Galloway.      He also informed the So
                                                            ciety,

ciety, that he had observed in the same rock in Galloway,
both the brown and the yellow subspecies of that very rare
ore, known to mineralogists by the name of Rutilite or
Sphene.
    At the meeting on the 30th of November last, Professor
Jameson read a paper on Granite.              He described three
principal formations of granite, and two of sienite. Two
of the granite formations belong to the primitive class; the
third to the transition : and of the sienites, one is primi
tive, and the other transition.        He mentioned particularly
the appearances that present themselves at the junctions and
alternations of the granite and sienite with gneiss and killas
(which last is probably a newer gneiss), and the relations
of these rocks to mica-slate, clay-slate, gray wacke, and
gray-wacke slate.        The descriptions were illustrated by
numerous sections and specimens from Gallowav, island
of Arran, and other parts of Scotland. The Professor af
terwards gave the natural history of a new genus of con-
camerated fossil shell.       In describing this shell, he em
ployed the usual zoological language; but in detailing the
other particulars, the method followed was that used in
giving the natural history of minerals.
    At the same meeting the Secretary read a communication
from the Kev. Mr. Fleming of Fh.sk, containing an account
of a bed of fossil shells which occurs- on the banks of the
Frith of Forth near Borrowstounness.             The bed is three
feet thick, nearly three miles in extent, and is situated about
 thirty-three feet above the present level of spring tides.
The kinds of shells which compose this extensive bed are
still found in a recent state in the Frith.
    At the same meeting, also, Mr. Leach gave a description
of a new British species of Echinus, which he<iad observed
in plentv at Bantry Bay in Ireland, and which he proposed
to call E. ti/lwpliagiis, from the circumstance of its forming
a sma'.l hollow tor itself in the substance      of the submarine
rocks.
    At the mectincon the 14th of December, Professor Jame
son read a short general account of the geognosy of the
stewarlrv of Kirkcudbright.        It would appear from the Pro
fessor's description,    that  the  greater portion of this part of
Scotland is composed of gray-wacke, gray-wacke slate, and
transition sla:e, with subordinate beds of transition por
phyry, transition greenstone, and flinty-slate.          But three
tracts, the first of which contains the mountain of CrifHej
the second, Cairnsnniir of Dee, 8cc. ; and the third, Loch
Doune, are composed of granite, sienite, sienitic porphyry
                                 K4                           and,

  and killas.   The sienite and granite in some places are co
 vered by the killas ; in other places the granite and sienite
 rest upon the killas ; and Professor Jameson also observed
 the killas alternating with beds of granite and sienite, and
 veins shooting from the granite into the adjacent killas.
 The granitous rocks, besides felspar, quartz, mica, and
 hornblende, also contain imbedded rutilite, titanitic iron-
 ore, and molybdeua j and, in rolled masses of a reddish-
 coloured sienite, crystals and grains of zircon were observed.
 Professor Jameson also stated several of the characters of the
 killas, described the magnetic pyrites it contains, noticed
 its affinity with certain rocks of the transition class, and
 exhibited specimens to illustrate this affinity. .
     At the same meeting there was read a series of ther-
 mometrical observations on the temperature of the Gulf
stream, by Dr. Manson, of New Galloway: and a descrip
 tion of a new craniometer, proposed      by Mr. VV. E. Leach,
 illustrated by a sketch.
         XXII.   Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
                           VACCINATION.
On this      subject we have lately seen an address by Edward
Rigby, Esq. senior surgeon of the Norfolk and Norwich
hospital, to the Corporation of Guardians of the Poor of
the city, which presents some facts that cannot be too.
generally known.         This gentleman, while variolous ino
culation was the only method known for lessening the
ravages of the small-pox,          was ever ready, not only to
inoculate the poor gratuitously, but omitted no opportu
nity, either by writing or by conversation, to promote its
general adoption j but Providence having placed in our
hands means of security against that loathsome disease
equally efficacious and much Jess exceptionable, namely
vaccination, Mr. Rigby has been one of its most strenu
ous advocates, and has exerted himself to root out the
small-pox entirely, from Norwich and its neighbourhood.
   , After stating some of the measures that he had recom
mended, but which it would appear had not been suffi
 ciently attended to,  he states, that
                                            " the small-pox did
disappear in the autumn of 1806: it had seized on all the
victims within its reach, and, like a fire, ceased lo burn
only for want of additional fuel ; nor did it again visit the
city till August 1807, when it was introduced in the fol
lowing way : 
     " On the Monday of      the Assize-week in that year, Mr.

Robinson, one of your surgeons, called upon me in'the
morning, to say he had been to visit a poor woman at the
Waggon and Horses, in St. Giles's- street, who bad just
been Drought thither from the London waggon, and that
she was in the eruptive stage of the sm^H-pox, and he was
very anxious that I should advise him how she could be dis-     .
posed of.     I told him, I feared I had now no power either
as a magistrate or as a guardian to direct in such a case, as
a late resolution of the court had rescinded the orders,
under which, heretofore, patients under such circumstances
had been sent to the Infirmary ; but I wished him to apply
to Mr. Simpson, the clerk of the court of guardians, to
Mr. Lubbock, the mayor's justice clerk, and to the chief
magistrate himself; all which Mr. Robinson took the trouble
of doing, but to no purpose  there was no place to which
she could be sent, and she was under the necessity of going
through this infectious disease at a public-house, in a pub
lic street, and at a public time when there was a more than
usual number of strangers in the city.      The consequences
were obvious  a person in the public-house caught the
disease, from whom it was communicated to another in
the neighbourhood, and thence it gradually spread to the
several parts of the city, and continued its ravages among
the poor to the end of the year 1809; during which time,
no less a number of deaths from this dreadful disease than
two hundred and three were recorded in the weekly
bills of mortality.    The greatest fatality was in 1808, in
some weeks ten, thirteen, and even fifteen died ; and from
June 1808 to June 1809 the number of deaths was 1 7 1 .
   I am satisfied that these accounts are correct; and I feel
no small gratification in reflecting, that a record so impor
tant to humanity would not have existed, had I not, when
mayor, directed the keeper of the bills of mortality to no
tice every death from the small-pox.        In a statistical as
well as moral view, these facts are highly interesting.       I
think it likely, as there are few adults in populous places
who have not had the small-pox, that this long list of
deaths consisted almost entirely of children ; and if the
common average of deaths from small -pox, as derived from
tables kept for a series of years in London, Paris, Vienna,
and other large cities in Europe, be correct, and which is
one in six, it is evident, that within this period more than
twelve hundred individuals must have had the disease ; and
the probability of these being children is increased, by this
number so strikingly corresponding with the number of
births in three years in that class of society liable to the
                                                       disease.

disease,      reckoning from the time when the small-pox dis
appeared at the end of 1806, to the end of 1809, when it
again ceased.          The annual births in Norwich for the last
four years are about nine hundred ; somewhat less than
half of this number, or four hundred, probably belong to
the lowest or unvaccinating class; which in three years will
produce by births ahout the number of individuals who had
the disease at this period, and which, as I before observed,
must have been somewhat more than twelve hundred *.
     "  The moral reflections which necessarily arise from this
melancholy detail need not now be insisted upon.                            I will
however just observe, that had this patient been fortunately
sent to the Infirmary at the time Mr. Robinson called upon,
me, and which was, I believe, before the disease had reached
that stage which renders it infectious, she would not have
been in a situation to have communicated it ; and the city,
in that instance at least, would have been spared the dread
ful visitation to which so many human lives were sacri
ficed ; and had the former wise regulations of this court
remained in force, it is sufficiently clear that she would
have been sent         thither,"

       Admitting this conjecture to be well founded, as more than two years,
 have elapsed since the small-pox was in Norwich, it follows, that at this time
 there are more than eight hundred children liable to catch the disease,
 should it again find its way into the city.   If also it be true, that this disease
 is fatal to a sixth of the individuals infected, it is equally clear, that unless
 some efficient means are adopted to secure the lower classes from the infec
 tion, an average annual loss to our population of more than sixty persons

                             To   Mr. Tilloch.
  Sir,  Ibeg to ask for information of some of your cor»
respondents, respecting the cause of an optical phaenome'*
non, for an explanation of which I have in vain looked in
 books.
    Surveying lately through a compound microscope at a
friend's, one of the sliders, I was struck by the figures
which I knew to be impressed upon it appearing to my
sight to be in relief; and was still more surprised to find,
 that to my friend, who at' my request looked through the
microscope, they retained their actual impressed appearance.
I then put one of the oU! penny pieces under the glass, and
 the letters indented round the margin appeared in relief,
while the head seemed as obviously excavated ; yet to my
friend's eye, as well as to that of a lady present, the na
tural appearances only presented themselves.        I am not
 aware of any peculiarity in my visual organs, except that
pf being in a slight degree short-sighted, which does not
 seem sufficient to account for the difference.
             I am, sir, your most obedient servant,
                                                       S. P.
             NEW PROCESS FOR REFINING SUGAR.
   A valuable and simple process has lately been discovered
by Edward Howard, Esq. F. R.S. for refining sugar, which
promises to be of great advantage.        The following is an
outline of   the process, but    a more   detailed  account of it
may    be expected  to be  published by   that   gentleman him
self :  " Take brown sugar, sift it through a coarse sieve,
then put it lightly into any conical vessel having holes at
the bottom (like a coffee machine). Then mix some brown
sugar with white syrup, that is, syrup of refined sugar, to
the consistency of baiter or thick cream, and pour it gently
on the top of the sugar in the vessel till the surface is co
vered.    The syrup will soon begin to percolate, and leave
the surface in a state which will allow more svrup to be
poured upon       it,
                   which     to be done carefully.
                                 is                    The treacle

will be found to come out at the bottom, having left the
whole mass perfectly white.        The first droppings are to be
kept apart, as the last will serve to begin another operation.
The sugar    is now     inpure state, except as to its contain
                             a
                                                               by by
ing insoluble matter, which mav of course be separated
solution in water.  The clarification       to be performed
                                                 is
the best pipe- clay and fuller's-earth,     and the addition of
                                                           neutral

  neutral alum, if lime be previously contained therein ; the
  whole to be agitated together ; and, if expedition be re
  quired, it should be heated to the boiling point : the faecu-
  lencies will then subside. The brown syrup may also be
  much improved by means of tannin and the above earths.
  To make the sugar into snow-white powder, it is only ne
  cessary to evaporate the clarified solution to dryness on a
  water-bath. To make loaves, the common methods may bo
  resorted to, or the syrup drawn off by exhaustion, or small
  grains may be made according to M. Du Trone's process,
  with much water, and these grains may be cemented by hot
  concentrated syrup."

  sophy of Physiology and of Physics; comprehending an
  examination of the modern systems of philosophy.

 what sailors call scud floated rapidly along in the west wind :

 XXIII.    Description of a Cavern near Chudleigh in Devon
    shire. By Mr. J. Jones, of Pembroke College, Cam
    bridge.   Communicated by the Author.
  -The Devonshire marbles have been lately much in request
 for ornamental purposes; and since it has been found im
 possible to obtain the more costly marbles of Italy, the at
tention of our artists has been directed toward the produce
of our own soil. The strata of limestone or marble traverse
 the country in various directions, adding considerably to
the beauty of the scenery ; for at some places they sink be
neath the surface of the earth, and at others rise with ma
jestic grandeur to a nearly perpendicular height of two or
three hundred feet, presenting from their summits views
not to be exceeded for extent or picturesque effect by any
 in the kingdom ; and what adds considerably to their ap
 pearance is, that their tops are not barren, but ornamented
with mountain plants and a lively verdure, and their sides
 are rendered shaggy by the shrubs and trees which grow
in abundance from their crevices. These hills are particu
larly interesting to the traveller, and may not prove unin-
structive to the geologist; for caverns of considerable mag
nitude have been discovered within their bowels, in which
a profusion of stalactitical and stalagmitical depositions
 abounds.    The most celebrated of these caverns are Kent's
 Hole in the vicinity of Torquay, and the I'iscies'-hole in
 Chudleigh rock near the town of Chudleigh : the first I have
never seen, but have frequently visited the latter.
    The Pixies' or Piskies' Hole, as it is commonly called, be
ing the supposed habitation of a diminutive race of fairies,
is situated in part of the rock which faces the woods of
Ugbrook Park, the seat of Lord Clifford : the ascent is rath
er difficult, being narrow and winding; but after having
ascended for a short time, the entrance presents itself al
most concealed by trees and shrubs: the entrance is 10i
feet in breadth, and 9 feet in height, and the same dimen
sions are nearly preserved for 67£ feet after you enter the
cavern : it then suddenly diminishes into a narrow hole not
exceeding 3 feet in height and 7 feet in breadth: before
you enter this narrow passage you, are necessitated to de
scend on your hands and knees, and light your candles, for
without light it is impossible to explore the interior of the
cavern: this narrow passage is the greatest difficulty to be
encountered; but it is not of any considerable length, not
exceeding 57 feet : at its extremity you suddenly emerge

  162                Description   of a Cavern   near
    into a large and magnificent cavity, formed within the
    bowels ol the rock, of considerable magnitude, and not
    cheered by a single ray of light from above: huge piece*
    of rock which must have fallen from the top impede your
    progress, and considerable caution must be observed in
    passing over these fragments.          The length of this cavity .is
    39 feet; its greatest height about 50 feet, and breadth 12
    feet; it terminates in a narrow cleft, too small to admit a
   middle-sized man : the silence of this cave is never dis
   turbed, except by the bats which are observed to be sus
   pended from the top ; and the              sound produced by the
   labourers from without,           blasting the rock, reverberates
   through the hollows like thunder.              A great number of
   stalactites depend from the top, assuming various forms;
' but
         they are not remarkable either for whiteness, or beauty
   of appearance.        The rock consisting entirely of limestone,
   of course all the depositions are calcareous : one deposit de
   mands particular attention, as it is considered the guardian
   idol of the cavern : it is situated on the left hand as you en
   ter, a few feet from the bottom, and presents the appearance
   of a human head : it is commonly called the Pope's head.
   The reason of this appellation it wpuld be perhaps now
   difficult to discover : owing to the continual droppings from
  above,     its surface is soft, and all visitors are desired by
   the guide to stick a pin into the head, to serve as a defence
  against the machinations of the fairies.            From this prin
  cipal cavity another branches off of greater regularity and
  of a more vaulted appearance : this second passage is g feet
  in breadth, II feet in height, and 72 feet in length; it           is,
  called the Pixies' parlour, and the bottom      is  sufficiently level
  to admit of dancing.        Here fires are lighted, and parties re
  gale themselves  :     the effectis   awful and striking, the flames
  playing    about   the  cavern,  the  sound of the music, and the
  resounding      echos    of  the    voices.    Banditti might have
  chosen this as a      proper place   to have  held their revels.   At
  the extremity of litis cavity the light        is    seen streaming
  through the rock from above, and on looking up you per
  ceive a   narrow opening of considerable height       ;   at the top
 of which huge masses of rock seem suspended over your
 head, and strike the mind of the spectators with terror
 lest they should suddenly be crushed to pieces.              This was
 certainly    the first opening  by    which  the cavern  was  entered,
 and the narrow pas-age was afterwards effected             bythe hand
 of man its regularity forbids the idea of its natural origin.
        :
      Besides the above-mentioned          chambers, several narrow
 entrances are discovered, which may perhaps lead to the

  discovery of other cavilies equal to those already explored.
  But the foot of man has never yet passed into those con
  cealed caves ; and the traditions of the vulgar respecting
  them are of the most fearful kind : unfathomable depths of
  water,' with all accompanying horrors, are predominant*.
  That water may sometimes be collected in those cavities,
  may not be improbable ; yet I have thrown down several
  stones, and water was never heard, and the stones soon
  reached   their termination.    One tradition is worthy of
  being remembered : a dog was once thrown into one of
  those pits, and some weeks after it emerged at Botier rock
  near Heniock, a village about four miles from Chudleigh ;
  and the most remarkable part of the tale is, that all its hair
  was rubbed off : this is a degree of consistency not often to
  be observed in popular tradition.
     Having finished the description of the cavern, I shall
 now hazard a few remarks respecting the use to which it
 was applied by the Aborigines        of Damnonium. Caves
 were certainly the first habitations of the wandering tribes,
 and perhaps first suggested the idea of constructing more
 convenient places of abode. Some savages arc now found ig
 norant of the means of constructing any settled habitation,
 and who retire to the crevices of the rocks as a defence against
 the inclemency of the weather t- The Eastern nations
  seem to have been more particularly attached to subter
 ranean abodes.      The deeds of Jesus Christ are sa'nl bv the
 inhabitants of Palestine to have been performed in caves %.
 Xenophon particularly describes the caves of the Arme
 nians § ; and the temples of the Hindoos are frequently
 placed in excavations at first formed by nature, and after
 wards improved by art : such is the singular cave in the
 Isle of Elephante, and the caves of Carli and Kenneri        By       ||.
 the Orientals, caves were used as places of abode, as retreats
 in case of defeat from the enemy, and as temples for the
 celebration of religious rites.  The first colonists of Dam
nonium proceeded from the East.           This hypothesis was
 first stated   bySir George Yonge, and supported           Pol-     by
whele in his excellent historical Views of Devonshire.      Ma
jor Welford has more recently conjectured, that the sacred
isles of the Hindoos were situated in the Western Ocean.

We cannot for       a  moment suppose that people capable of
undertaking long and tedious voyages were ignorant of the
means of constructing houses ; yet the caves might attract
their attention either in a military or religious point of view.
The Pixies' Hole was undoubtedly known to the earlier in
habitants of Damnonium. Art has been used in forming the
narrow passage ; but it presents no appearance of having
been diminished in size. The first entrance to the cavern
was effected through the cavity I have before described, as
descending from the side of the rock. When the interior was
gained, a more commodious outlet was desirable; the nar
row passage was then formed, of small extent, by which
means all hostile attacks were prevented. It is impossible
to account for the sudden diminution of the first entrance,
and the regularity of the second passage, by any other con
jecture.
    However convenient the Pixies' Hole might have been
as a place of retreat during the time of hostile invasion, it
never seems to have been used for a religious purpose. Yet
its awful shades and lengthened caverns, the venerable
rocks and wood by which it is surrounded, would have ad
mirably accorded with the superstition of the Druids : but
after the most laborious search I have not yet been able to
discover any Druidical antiquities in the immediate vicinity
of Chudleigh, notwithstanding the numerous tumuli still
 to be observed on the hills of Halldown, distant but a few
miles, afford convincing proof of a once numerous popu
lation ; although the absence of Druidical remains tends to
remove all conjectures respecting the religious use of the
cavern.     I am unwilling to suppose that it passed un
noticed by the Druids. The singular stalactitical deposit
called the Pope's Head may, without any inconsistency, be
named the Deity of the cavern ; and the superstitious usages
of former ages have not yet entirely vanished, as respect is
paid to its singular and striking form.               I have but one
more remark to offer, and that respecting the origin of
 Gothic architecture. Jt has been confidently asserted, that
groves of trees first suggested the Gothic arch, nave, and
transept of our ancient cathedrals*.            But it seems more
probable that the vaulted roof and stalactitic pillars ob
served in caverns first gave the idea. Religious rites were at
first performed in caves; and when removed to groves and
buildings, the priests and people endeavoured to retain the
form of these ancient natural temples, from whence arose
¦the solemn and massive grandeur of Gothic architecture.

 XXIV.            On the different Qualities of Wines, and the Me
        thods     of preserving and ameliorating them. By M. Du-
        portal, M.D. *.
In    my preceding Dissertation                   f
                                     on Fermentation,    I took
particular care  to describe that species of it which furnishes,
as its product, an intoxicating liquor, and is especially em
ployed in procuring this liquor from the grape.       This con
stitutes wine, «o agreeable a beverage to mankind in ge
neral, and in which the constituent principles are the most
intimately combined.       In all times, therefore, this useful
and pleasing liquor has occupied the attention as well of
the chemists as of the makers of wine.          Among the for
mer, M. Chaptal appears to me to have thrown the most
light upon the subject of wine. Whoever attentively reads
what this learned chemist has written upon the causes
which influence the quality of wine, the means made use
of to preserve and ameliorate                    it,

   4. Their more or less favourable exposure to the sun.
   5. The seasons being more or less propitious.
   6. The culture being more or less attended to.
   There can be no doubt, but that all these causes produce
considerable influence upon the nature of the grape, which
in its turn influences the product of the vinous fermenta
tion. But the manner in which this operation is conducted,
contributes also to impart to the wine certain qualities which
render it more or less esteemed.      Of this I treated in the
former   memoir,   and proceed, now  to the method of preserv
ing the wine,   after it has been poured into the cask.
2.     Of the   Methods employed for preserving and ameliorating
                               Wines.
    The juice of the grape being converted into a vinous li
quor by fermentation in the vat is put into casks, where it
undergoes a new elaboration, which renders the liquor tur
bid, and reproduces in it a slight tumultuous motion, which
is called the insensible or secondary fermentation.       This
intestine motion is to be encouraged or moderated, accord
ing as the wine drawn from the vat contains an excess of
sugar or of ferment.      In the first case, if we do not w ish
to have a sweet wine, it will be requisite to permit the in
sensible fermentation to go on, in order to convert the sugar
into alcohol, whereby the wine \vill become stronger; in
the second case, on the contrary, the insensible fermenta
tion should be speedily stopped, lest the wine should be
converted     into vinegar. This is to be effected either by
removing the sediment and scum, and clarifying the liquor,
so as to extract all the ferment it contains, or by adding to
the liquor some sugar, for the fermentation to act upon,
which will give a degree of strength to the wine which it
would not have possessed without this management. While
the secondary fermentation is going on in the cask, there is
disengaged a great quantity of carbonic acid gas, and there
runs over from the bunghole a considerable quantity of
scum, which renders it necessary to add more wine; and
this operation must be repeated until the fermentation has
entirely ceased.     The cask is then generally bunged up
with care, and no further thought taken of the wine untjl
it is fit for use. The liquor, when left at rest, verv soon
throws down all that is not completely dissolved in        and it,
even     a portion of the tartar, whence results     sediment,
                                                      a

                                                          is
separated from the wine       for this sediment acts upon

behind the lees,        matter consisting
                              a                    general of ferment,

altered       the fermentation of the must, some ferment un
               by
altered by the operation, mucilage, tartar, and colouring
matter. The lees, however, are not always the same from
every kind of wine; the quantity of tartar varies, as also
that of the colouring matter, according as the wine                  more            is
or less spirituous       in different wines there
                              ;                             more or less
                                                                      is
of the ferment, and this has undergone more alteration in
some wines than in others.             Thus       sweet Spanish wine
                                                       a
does not contain any unchanged ferment, because the sugar
in   it   more than sufficient to decompose the w hole of this
          is
substance;         adding more ferment to this wine, you will
                         by
 diminish its sweetness, and increase the alcohol.                On the
 contrary,       meagre wine of Burgundy will afford
                    a                                                great           a
 quantity of unaltered ferment, because the deficiency cf
 sugar did not permit the whole of                  to be decomposed.
                                                            it
 By the addition of sugar to this wine, the fermentation
 would be renewed, and more alcohol produced. The rack
 ing of wines         necessary operation for the proper keeping
                         is   a
 of them. In general, this operation should be renewed
whenever there             considerable sediment at the bottom of
                              is   a
 the cask.      Some wines, however, may be kept upon their
 lees, such as those, of St. Thierry in Champagne;                   these
 will continue to improve,            kept upon their lees for four
                                             if
 years, provided thev are contained             casks of
                                                       in     very large   a
 size.     Ifw   consider the different nature of different wines,
                    e
 and of their lees, we shall easily perceive that racking                                       is
 not equally necessary for all of them.              If, for instance,                          it
is   a very weak wine,         cannot be racked off too soon, for
                                       it

 able to prevent the acetic fermentation taking place, from
 the action of the ferment              the lees.in  But               if
                                                                      very      it   is   a
 generous wine, early racking             not necessary, because the

will grow better, when its       tartness is owing to a too slow
and incomplete fermentation, in which the sugar has not
been entirely converted into alcohol.        M. Chaptal, in the
following passage, clearly establishes the truth of this as
 sertion.   "We must only, says he, draw off those wines
 which have been well made : if a wine is very tart, or very
 sweet, we must let it undergo a second fermentation upon
 its lees, and not draw it off until the middle of May ; it
 may even stand until the end of June, if it continues tart.
 It sometimes becomes necessary to return wine upon its
 lees, and to mix thein well together, that a new fermenta
 tion may be excited, which will ameliorate the wine."
 There are certain rules to be observed in the racking of
 wines; it should never be done in frosty seasons, nor when
 a moist wind blows; a dry cool wind is preferable; it is
 most advantageously done, just previous to the periods of
 the shooting of the vine, its coming into blossom, and the
 turn of the grape ; for it is at these periods the wine fer
 ments most.       In every wine country, experience has de
 monstrated    the  proper time for this operation.
     Brimstoning of Wines.  Whatever care is taken in the
 racking of wines, they will again ferment, unless they un
 dergo the operation of brimstoning; that is to sav, if they
 are not impregnated with sulphurous gas, by means of
 burning sulphur matches in the casks, either when com
 pletely empty, or containing a few pails full of wine only,
 to which more wine is added every time the burning is
 renewed.     At Marseilles in Languedoc, they use for the
 brimstoning     wines, must, which has been so strongly
 charged   with  sulphurous   gas, as never to have fermented ;
 two or three bottles of which, mixed with each cask of
wine will also preserve t'oat from fermentation.      The brim-
 stoning by burning matches has one disadvantage, that of
 depriving the must of the flavour of the fruit, and commu
 nicating to it an unpleasant taste.      On this account, other
 anti-fermentescible substances are sometimes employed.
Thus, M. Ferperc recommends sulphuric acid; M. Astier
 employs the red oxide of mercury; and M. Parmentier has
 proposed the oxide of manganese, which is less hazardous.
    What is the chemical action produced upon the must
and upo»i the wine, by the operation of brimstoning ? This
action lends evidently to preserve these fluids from fermen
tation, and as this cantTot take place without the presence
of a ferment, we have reason to conclude, that this agent
is changed in its nature, and rendered insoluble, perhaps
because it abstracts from the oxides and acids employed, a
                                                         portion.

              On the different Qualities   of Wines.         169
portion of their oxygen.       We must however acknowledge,
that the supposed abstraction of this principle is not essen
tially necessary, since this fermentation may be prevented
by adding some boiling hot wine to the liquor, as is prac
ticed at Paris, which shows that the ferment undergoes        an
alteration by the action of caloric.     Nevertheless, it is cer
tain, that this substance undergoes a change in its nature
by the brimstoning, and is rendered in part insoluble, for
the wine becomes turbid by this operation : it also sensibly
loses its colour, but this is temporary, for it regains its
former colour in a few days.       M. Chaptal thinks it advan
tageous to the keeping wines, to preserve them from the
atmospheric air, whose contact is necessary to induce the
acid degeneration.
     Fining of Wines.  The two former operations are not
always sufficient to impart to the wine that fine limpidity
which is so agreeable to the organs of taste and smell, and
¦which so much enhances its value.        There still remain in
these liquors certain heterogeneous      substances which dis
 turb the transparency of them, and which do not fall down
 by simple rest.    In this case, we must have recourse to a
 third operation called fining, which is generally performed
 by fish glue, previously softened into a viscid fluid bv ma
 ceration in a little of the wine.      By this the substances
 which rendered the wine turbid are carried to the bottom^
 for we find the wine becomes more limpid, and a sediment
 is formed, which renders a fresh racking necessary, some
 time after this substance has been poured into the wiue,
 and well mixed with it.       The same effect is produced in
 the turbid wine by means of ox-blood and the white of
 eggs. These latter, therefore, may be used to clarify wines,
 especially the last ; which does not so easily undergo a
 peptic change, and is therefore preferable in hot climates,
 and in the summer season.        M. Chaptal affirms that gum
 arabic may be substituted for these gelatinous and albu
 minous substances.       He even adds, that wine rendered
 turbid by the lees, may by cleared by a multitude of sub
  stances, such as coarse salt, flints calcined and bruised,
 starch, rice, milk, &c. ; likewise by beech chips, first barked,
 then boiled in water, and dried in the sun, or in an oven.
  He attributes the effect of the beech chips upon turbid wines
 to a slight fermentation which they induce in the liquor;
 we may also refer the action of starch, rice, and milk, to
  the same circumstancs ; whilst the action of the greatest
 part of other substances is purely mechanical.         But how

   1 70         On the different Qualities   of Wines.
  is the action   of the fish glue, the ox- blood, and the white
  of    egg to be  explained ? So little attention has hitherto
  been paid to what takes place in this case, that I know of
  no theory formed upon the subject.        It appears to me very
  easy to invent a very plausible one, by attending to the facts
  I  am about to state.
      1. Fish glue is a gelatinous matter; the white of egg
  and the ox-blood are of an albuminous nature.
      2. Both of these animal compounds are very soluble in
  water, and not at all soluble in alcohol.
      3. Alcohol exists already formed in wine, since it is easy
   to separate it by congelation.
      These being inconstestible facts, what must happen when
   these gelatinous fluids are poured into the wine ? The al
  cohol of the wine, by its great affinity to water, will attract
  this fluid, holding the animal matter in solution, conse
   quently this matter, thus deprived of its solvent, must give
   way to the molecular attraction, which tends to bring its
   particles together, whence results a kind of net-work swim
   ming in the liquor; this net-work, contracting more closely,
   entangles in itself the foreign substances in the wine, and
   carries them down to the bottom of the cask, leaving the
   mass of liquor clear, pure, and transparent.
      The last method of preserving and ameliorating wines
   consists in the art of mixing them together, so as to render
   them less alterable, and to impart to them the most agree
   able flavour.   This art, although perfectly well known to
   the manager of a cellar, is not yet known by the chemist,
   and will never be known by him, unless the wine merchant
   will inform him what mixtures succeed the best. The ex
   perience of this latter would, however, be rendered more
   advantageous if assisted by the reasonings of the former.
   A wine mixed with some other wine, can acquire more
   strength, more colour, more aroma, or more flavour, only
   by its principles undergoing some reaction, more or less
   sensible ; and who, except the chemist, can best dispose
   the circumstances most favourable to this re-action ? If,
   for example, it is required to correct a very acid wine ; the
   chemist finding in this wine a great deal of tartar, will pro
   pose the addition of sugar, because this substance, by in
   creasing the proportion of alcohol, will precipitate the tar
    tar, and by this means he will avoid having recourse to the
    sweet and syrupy for that purpose, which are not to be
.   found in all countries, and whose price is always every
    where sq very high,

             3.   Of the Vessels  proper to keep Wines.
    After wines have undergone the operations I have above
described, it becomes an important consideration in what
vessels and in what places they are kept.              According to
M. Chaptal, a cellar should be dug several feet below the sur
face of the earth ; the openings into which should be towards
the north ; it should be at a considerable distance from
any street, highway, work-shop, sewer, privy, &c. and it
should be covered with an arched roof.             The ancients pre
served their wine in earthen vessels, varnished, such as the
amphora and the cadus. The porosity of these vessels has
occasioned their being laid aside, and for them have been
substituted those made of the wood of oak or mulberry-
tree, or, sometimes, glass vessels. The last have the advan
tage of not containing any principle soluble in the wine,
and of preserving the Tiquor completely from the contact
of air and moisture, when carefully stopped; but their brit-
tlcness and diminutive size limits the use of them to a very
small extent, and it becomes necessary to have recourse to
vessels made of dry and well seasoned wood ; for if the
wood is green, it imparts an extractive matter to the wine,
 which injures its flavour, and acts upon it in a similar
 manner to the lees.
    M. Chaptal justly observes, that very large and well
 closed vessels are the best for keeping wine, since it is
 found that wine is always better the larger the cask ; the
 reason of which, no doubt, is that the constituent princi
 ples are more intimately mixed, and do not so easily escape
 into the atmosphere.         This last circumstance is well known
 to wine merchants, who find, that twenty muids of wine,
 contained in one large vessel, do not lose more by volatiliz
 ation in a given time, than two muids do when distributed
 into four casks.
       4.  Of   the Deterioration   or Degeneration    of Wines.
     The   greatest care bestowed upon wines will not always
 prevent their suffering some alteration; they will generally
 undergo some change if the principles which compose them
  are not in suitable proportions. M. Chaptal has shown this
 in his investigation of the deterioration to which wines are
 subject ; a deterioration which, for the most part, he ascribes
 fo an excess of ferment in them.          I shall say a word or two
  of  this kind   alteration.
     Of the Rnpiness of Wines.  This degeneration only takes
  place in very weak wines, and those which have been badly

 and the wine then presents a kind of oily appearance.
No particular management is requisite to cure this; it is
generally sufficient to leave the wine to itself during a sea
 son or two, when for the most part, the wine recovers.
Exposure in a warm place, or the addition of some sugary
substance, will hasten the cure ; the same thing will hap
pen if the ropy wine is mixed with some good wine newiy
made.
   The fermentescible principle appears to be the source of
this degeneration; from its not having been completely
decomposed during the fermentation, a great deal of it is
dissolved in the vinous liquor, after the entire decomposi
tion of the sugar. And as this principle may be afterwards
separated from the liquor by a variety of causes, M. Chaptal
imagines, that it is this separation which gives that oily
appearance to the wine I have been describing.
   Of the spontaneous Acescency of Wines.  This takes
place most frequently in very weak wines, especially at three
particular periods of the year, when these liquors are in the
greatest state of fermentation, viz. when the vine is bud
ding, at the time of its blossoming, and at the time of
vintage.    It    is,
                  therefore, to the presence of the ferment
this deterioration      owing, especially when its action
                        is                                     is
assisted by air and heat.      have already said, that this ac
                               I
tion sometimes proceeds so far as to induce the acetous fer
mentation.     The prevention of this fermentation demands
the most particular attention, and therefore, all the causes
which give rise to      are to be carefully avoided.
                        it                              Unfor
tunately our efforts are not always successful, and we can
only arrest the fermentation, or neutralize the acid. For
the former purpose, M. Chaptal recommends evaporated
must, honey, or liquorice, to be dissolved in the tart wine.
These not only correct the sour taste by replacing       itwith
sweetness, but also reproduce the spirituous fermentation
 by supplying the saccharine principle for the remaining fer
ment to act upon.       The wine merchants possess       multi
                                                         a
tude of receipts for neutralizing the acid in wines;
                                                       they are
chiefly composed of salifiable bases, such as potass, lime,
and even litharge.    These methods, however, but imper
fectly  answer  the  purpose, and some of them are attended
with no little danger.
                   3.   Of a fusty   Taste in Wines.
       This arises from two causes; the first    is,
                                               when the wine
       kept in     cask made of decayed or worm-eaten wood

the other, when the lees of wine have remained in the cask,
although they are emptied out at the time of tunning.
Willermoz proposes to correct or destroy this taste by
means of lime, carbonic acid gas, and oxy-muriatic gas.
Others advise the wine to be fined and racked off with care,
and then to be infused two or three days upon toasted grains
of wheat. In Burgundy, they pour the fusty wine upon
the lees of well-tasted wine, and afterwards fine it.
                     4.   Of Bitterness in Wines.
    Some wines, especially those of Burgundy, acquire by
age a taste of bitterness.         This is owing to the total preci
pitation of the ferment, and the complete decomposition of
the sugar, which set at liberty the acerb or astringent prin
 ciple contained in these liquors.          M. Chaptal recommends
 these wines to be re-poured upon the lees, and that there
 should be added to them a solution of sugar, or what is still
 belter, a pint of musted wine to every cask.
     In addition to these alterations already pointed out, wines
 are susceptible of several others, such as a mouldy taste,
 loss of colour, rancidity, &c. I cannot now enter upon
 these, I will only mention that the rancid taste in wines is
 owing to the precipitation of the tartar and the formation
 of a small quantity of acetic ether, at the expense of the
 alcohol and acetic acid contained in the wine, as has been
 shown by M. Vauquelin.
  XXV. An Apparatus for preventing            the Accumulation of Air
     in Conduit Pipes,      &c.  &c.    By  Joseph   Steevens, Esq.
                              To Mr. Tillock.
  Sir,   It    having been objected by many, that the mode
  proposed for supplying the Sea-water Baths and Infirmary
  (intended to he established in the vicinity of London), by
  means of iron pipes from Southend, would be ineffectual,
  on account of the quantity of air that would accumulate at
  certain elevated points, over which the pipes will pass.             I
  beg   to  lay before   these  persons   and  the public, through  the
  medium of your publication, the following simple appa
  ratus, which I intend to attach to the pipes for this purpose.

 inches long, projecting from the upper part of it; into this
  tube is screwed the globular vessel gg about ten inches dia
 meter, and into this globe is screwed the tube t, about one
 inch external diameter, having a conical opening through it
 a quarter of an inch on the inside, and half an inch on the
 outside end of it.     In the globe gg is the globular float F,
 about seven, eight or nine inches diameter, as circumstances
 may require.      This globe carries two spindles or rods, the
 one projecting downwards about half an inch diameter car
 rying the valve o, and the other projecting upwards about
 ¦2 inch   carrying the valve i; this passes through a guide
 nn, as does the Tower rod through the guide mm; the part
 of the lower rod that passes through the guide is flat, to
 prevent it from turning round in the operation of screwing
 the float F to it.     The tube t is provided with a valve v,
 and weight w, nearly equal to the weight of the valve.
    Things being thus disposed, let us suppose water to flow
into the pipe AB until it rises to pp, then one half of the
 diameter Q q, will be occupied by air qr, and therefore
 only one half of the water which the pipe is capable of
 conveying would be allowed to pass : but as there is no
 water in the globe gg, the float F will rest on the guide
 mm and the valve i be opened through which the air will
 escape until F is floated by the rising of the water in gg,
 when the valve i will be shut, and none of the water suf
 fered to escape; this operation will be repeated as often as
a quantity of air sufficient to fill gg, is collected.
    The valve v is attached in order to prevent any air from
entering the pipe, by the tendency of the water to retire in
case a partial interruption in the supply should take place ;
or in the event of a pipe bursting at a point below that to
which this apparatus is affixed.
    In the tube c are two flanches, k and e ; the flanch h is
intended to prevent the valve o, and its rod from falling
into the pipe, and would in many instances (though not in
the present) supersede the necessity of the valve v ; the
upper flanch e is to receive the valve o, and prevent the
escape of water, should it be necessary to remove the globe
gg, or the tube t, for the purpose of repair, &c.
    It is easy to see, that by unscrewing the tube t, the float
F would rise and close the valve o, the same effect would
be produced by unscrewing the globe, or by detaching its
upper part, and the pressure of the water would effectually
pievent its opening; as, on several points of the pipes to
be used for the above purpose, the pressure will be equal to
six or eight atmospheres.

XXVI.      Memoir upon the Mordants employed in the Art of
    Dyeing. By MM. Thenabd and Roard.                      Read at
    the Physical and Matliemalical Class of t lie Piench In
    stitute.
The      name of Mordant is given, in the art of dyeing, to
those    substances which serve to produce a more intimate
combination of colouring matters with the different stuffs,
and to augment the brightness and beauty of them.               This
property belongs to a great number of saline and metallic
substances : but those which possess it in the highest de
gree, and which, for this reason, are exclusively made use
of by dyers, are alum, acetate of alumina, tartar, and the
 solutions of tin.
     An examination and analysis of the effects produced by
 these mordants upon vegetable and animal substances, will
 form the subject of the memoir we have honour to submit
 to the Class.     We shall divide it into four chapters, where
 in we shall successively treat of the action of alum, of ace
 tate of alumina, of alum and tartar, and of the solutions of
 tin, upon silk, wool, cotton, and thread, according to the
  methods most generally made use of in the art of dyeing.
                       CHAP. I. Of Alum.
     The manner of applying the alum varies according to
  the nature   of the stuffs, and according to the colours we
  wish to obtain.      Silks are permitted to macerate for several
  days in a solution of alum, sufficiently diluted for the salt
  not to crystallize.     Wool is boiled for two hours in wa
  ter, containing a fourth part of its weight of alum.        Cotton
  and thread are soaked for at least twenty-four hours in
  warm concentrated solutions or alum, to which frequently
  some potass is added.       It has hitherto been thought that
  in this operation the alum is decomposed, and that the alu
  mina combines with the stuff, causing it thereby the more
  easily to take the colour when plunged into the dyeing
  bath ; but the experiments we have made induce us to adopt
  a different opinion.
             Art.   1.  Analysis of the  aluming   of Silk.
      Ninety-five grammes of silk, well      cleaned and perfectly
   purified, were infused in a glass vessel durintr six days, at
   the common temperature of the atmosphere, with four
   quarts of distilled water, containing 100 grammes of pure
   alum, which had been previously dissolved in it.             After
                                                             standing

1   76                   Memoir upon         the   Mordants
standing this time, the^iik was taken out of the liquid,
drained completely over the bath, and washed several times
with distilled water, to separate that part of the mordant
which had not combined with it. The alum bath and the
washings were then evaported with the greatest care, and
they afforded very transparent crystals of alum.            These
first products indicated pretty clearly the nature of the
combination which had been formed with the silk during
the steeping, and that the alum had not been decomposed.
The alumed silk was then boiled in a mattras with six
quarts of distilled water, the boiling liquor was poured off
from     it,
           and in this manner         was treated twelve times.
                                             it
The 72 quarts proceeding from these operations being
evaporated, we obtained well formed crystals of alum, the
quantity of which, added to that obtained from the bath,
amounted to within two decigrammes of the 95 grammes
originally employed, forming        loss of  a     part only.   If
after each of the twelve washings we attempt to dye the
silk, the colour      less deep, in proportion to the number
                         is
of washings, so that after the twelfth the silk         not at all  is
coloured.     If the silk, after having thus been washed,                     is
again impregnated with alum,          re-acquires the same pro
                                             it
perty of retaining the colour which       had before the washing
                                                   it
commenced.        Hence results     very  natural
                                             a     explanation of
the reason why alumed silks take         deeper  colour
                                                   a     when the
dyeing      commenced at

one case, the action of the boiling water upon the mordant
is  so speedy, that there    not time for the colouring matter
                                   is
to fix upon      and render the combination insoluble, whilst,
                   it,
in the other case, no such effect takes place.

                               the Impregnation             of   Wool with Alum.
    After having thus ascertained the phenomena which
take place in the aluming silk,       was necessary to continue
                                              it
the trials upon wool, and to employ for these experiments
only perfectly pure materials, completely deprived of the

                                        is
derable quantity.     To separate the whole of this, we boiled
the wool several successive     times in     mattras with weak
                                                        a
muriatic acid, but         order to take up the last portions of
                              in
this acid we were obliged to make use of such large quan
               ;
tities of distilled water, that we were on the point of aban
doning such tedious experiments, requiring so much time
and patience, as well as the greatest care.      The separation
of all the muriatic acid from the first two hectogrammes of
                                                                            wool

               employed  in the Art of Dyeing.             17 7
wool which we purified, required' 200 quarts of distilled
water, at 100 degrees or' heat (212 F.) divided into 20 suc
cessive operations, each occupying from seven to eight
hours.    When calcined and properly tried, it afforded nei
ther lime nor muriatic acid.
    One hundred grammes of this wool were alumed with
the same care which had been taken with the silk.       It was
afterwards washed twenty times, employing six quarts of
distilled water, heated to an hundred degrees, for each
washing.     Immediately after the aluming, this wool took
a very deep colour, whilst, after the last washing, it would
not take anv more colour in the dyeing bath, than some
of the same wool which had never been alumed. These
experiments convinced us that the substance which had
been fixed in the wool by aluming, and had caused it to
receive so deep a colour in the first dyeing, had now been
carried off by the water. The alum bath, when evapo
rated, afforded us, in the state of crystals, two-thirds of
the quantity of alum we had originally employed ; very
nearly the whole of the remaining third part was obtained
from the residue of the bath, in an uncrystallized state, and
from the washings of the wool.       This experiment was re
peated several times, and always with the same result ; but
as this did not appear to us so decisive as the experiment
upon silk, on account of the difficulty of separating the
 animal matter from the last portions of the alum bath, we
alumed some wool in the cold, as we had done with the
 silk, being persuaded that in this case the bath would not
 sensibly dissolve this substance.
     We alumed in the cold, some clean wool with all the
 precaution observed with the silk, and we obtained from        <
 the bath and the washings the alum employed in the ope
 ration, with a loss only of 7 ^ part ; we were therefore
 assured, that in the aluming of all animal substances, the
 alum combines entirely with them, without undergoing any
 decomposition, and that it forms with them combinations
 more or less soluble, which have a great affinity for the co
 louring  matters.
     Art. 3.  Analysis  of the Impregnation  of Cotton and
                       Thread with Alum.
     Having freed some cotton, by the methods already men
  tioned, from all foreign matters, we macerated it for two
  days in a lukewarm solution of a given quantity of alum.
  After this operation the stuff took the dye remarkably
 well ; but being treated with boiling distilled water, it lost

the property of taking the colour in the dye-bath.          The
alum -bath and washings, when evaporated, afforded us all
the alum we had employed.        We separated this alum from
the vegetable matter which it had dissolved in its different
crystallizations.   To do this did not require such a num
ber of washings as were employed for the wool or the silk,
because the combination of alum with vegetable substances
is so weak, that soaking the alumed cotton in boiling wa
ter for a few minutes is sufficient to carry off the greatest
part of the mordant.     Cotton, therefore, ought to be dyed
at a low temperature, since it is only after the colouring
matter has rendered the combination insoluble, that it can
support a great heat without being attacked.            Thread
treated in the same manner as cotton, afforded us the same
results.
  Art.   4.  Analysis of llie Impregnation of common Wool.
    The analyses we have already related, most decidedly
demonstrate that in the aluming of all animal and vegetable
substances, the alum combines with them without under
going any decomposition ; but we thought it was neces
sary to repeat the same experiments upon these substances
in the state in which they are commonly met with in com
merce, as we had done in their purified state. Wool, when
impregnated with alum alone, always renders the bath tur
bid, which, upon cooling, throws down an abundant white
precipitate, as has been observed by several chemists.
Several analyses of this sediment, after being well washed,
have constantly afforded us some sulphate of lime, satu
rated sulphate of alumina, and sometimes a little alumina.
The bath contained a remarkable quantity of alum, of aci
dulated sulphate of potass, combined with a small propor
tion of animal matter.       Upon the wool we found alum,
and a very minute proportion of the precipitate.          These
experiments upon the sediment, formed in the alum bath,
do not differ from those made by M. Bcrtholletj but this
learned chemist not having examined the moi her- waters,
nor the alumed wool, has not given, as he himself says, a
 clear and precise explanation of the effects produced by
alum and tartar in the operation of dyeing.         These pre
cipitates, obtained by treating common wool with alum,
never take place with purified wool ; and as these only dif
fer from each other by the former containing some car
bonate of lime, it was natural in this case to attribute to this
substance the decomposition of a part of the alum.
    We satisfied ourselves of this, by mixing in glass vessels
                                                      solutions

                 employed  in the Art of Dyeing.           1 79
solutions of alum in boiling water with different propor
tions of pure carbonate of lime.        We always found the
alum was decomposed by the carbonate of lime, and that,
if a sufficient quantity was added, there remained no part
of the aluminous salt in solution.        The mother-waters ,
contained very acid sulphate of potass, and the sediment
was formed of sulphate of lime and acidulate sulphate of
alumina and potass ; whence it follows, that the property
possessed by common wool of forming a precipitate in the
alum bath, and rendering the fluid very acid, is in reality
owing to the carbonate of lime it contains.       The same re
sult was obtained by aluming common wpol five or six
                                        '
 successive times in the same bath. But in order to arrive
 at a general solution of this question, it was necessary to
 ascertain the nature of the precipitates formed in the so
 lution of alum, by different alkaline and earthy substances.
 We took, therefore, alums with base of potass, and with
 base of ammonia, which vve treated with ammonia and
 carbonate of potass, so as to leave in the solution but a
 slight excess of alum.        The mother-waters evaporated,
 contained very acid sulphates of ammonia, of potass and
 ammonia, and of potass, according to the nature of the
  alum and of the precipitate employed.        The sediment,
  which was acid sulphate of alumina and potass, or am
  monia, treated with sulphuric acid, afforded alum and aci
  dulated sulphate of alumina; boiled afterwards a great num
  ber of times with distilled water, it was converted into
  alum, sulphate of potass, and pure alumina.        There was
  always a greater quantity of acidulated sulphate of potass
  than of alum, even in the last washings.
     Solutions of alum, treated at a boiling heat with pure
  alumina, were converted into a very acid sulphate of potass,
  and into acidulated sulphate of alumina and potass.     These
  resuhs do not at all correspond with those obtained by
  M. Vauquelin in his experiments upon the alums of com
  merce, for we have never been able to obtain the saturated
  sulphate of alumina and potass, spoken of by that cele-
 "brated chemist.
      Thus all the alkaline and earthy substances mixed in
   suitable proportions with solutions of alum, converted that
   salt into acidulated sulphate of potass, or ammonia, and
   into insoluble acid sulphate of alumina and potass or am
   monia, for which reason we have named it the acidulated
   sulphate instead of the Saturated sulphate, the name it has

                         Acetate of Alumina.
    Wool, silk, cotton, and thread, in the different states in
 which these substances are employed for dyeing, were treated
 with acetate of alumina, which combined entirely with
 them.      But   as in exposing them to the air, or to a tem
 perature    a  little elevated,   the   mordant always loses a
 small quantity of acid, it follows that the combination
 formed upon the stuff is an acetate with excess of base ;
 thus, by treating it with boiling water, it is converted into
 acidulated acetate of alumina, which is dissolved, and into
 alumina which cannot be carried off by the water.

 Art. 1.  Of the      Action of acidulated Tarlrite of Potass  on
                                  Wool.
    Purified wool was treated as in the former experiments
with    very pure cream of tartar, free from tartrite of lime,
and formed directly by the tartaric acid and potass.         This
wool was washed a great number of times, until the last
washing did not contain any of the principles which had
been combined with it.           The bath afforded by evaporation
-J of the cream of tartar employed, or rather neutral tartrite
of potass. The washings were very acid, and we obtained
from them a small quantity of cream of tartar, and a very
acid composition formed of tartarous acid and wool. These
facts may be thought sufficiently to explain the phenomena
which take place in impregnating wool with alum and
tartar, since we already know from the experiments of
M. Berthollet, that these two salts are not decomposed ;
and as we have shown that the wool combines completely
with the alum, and that it acts upon the cream of tartar by
separating the tartarous acid with which it unites in the
most intimate manner.          But in order to have these facts
                                                       rigorously

                    employed   in the  Art of Dyeing.               181
 rigorously demonstrated, we repeated this experiment, al
  though a very tedious one, in the method already pointed
 out in the preceding chapters.
   Art.     2.    Of the  Action of Alum and Tartar      upon Wool.
     Before treating the wool with alum and cream of tartar,
 we made some trials of the reciprocal action of these two
 salts.     We ascertained that water, at the temperature of
  12° or 14°, (55 F.) holds in solution only l-g- part of its
 weight of cream of tartar, that boiling water dissolves
 of   its weight, and that a mixture of equal parts of alum
 and cream of tartar, dissolves in           f  the quantity of water
 required      to  dissolve  the  salts  separately at the same tem
 perature.        These results do not differ from those already
 obtained by M. Berthollet, who has shown that alum has
 the property of increasing the solubility of creain of tartar.
     If wool is al timed in the ordinary proportions, which
 are ± of the weight of the stuff" of alum, and              of cream
 of tartar, all the substances being perfectly pure, we ob
 tain from the bath when evaporated, alum, cream of tartar,
 and a residue difficultly cry>taHizable,           composed of tar-
 trite of potass and an animal matter; the washings of the
wool will give alum, a small quantity, scarcely appretiable,
 of cream of tartar, and a very acid combination, formed of
a large quantity of tartarous acid, alum, and animal matter.
    These experiments remove all uncertainty concerning
many practical facts, which at present are only noticed by
the dyer in a vague way, and point out to him the precise
method of applying the mordants according to the nature
of the colour he wishes to obtain. Indeed, since by mak
ing use of alum and tartar, the wool is impregnated with
alum and a large quantity of tartarous acid, these two salts
should never be employed together, except when the co
lour is susceptible of being heightened                 and rendered
brighter by acids, as is the case with cochineal, madder,
and kermes.          On the contrary, alum should never be em
ployed for wools intended to be dyed with woad or Brasil
wood, the colour of which is easily altered or destroyed by
acids.      Among all the vegetable and animal substances, we
have made choice of wool only for trial with alum and alum
and tartar, because it is only with this substance these mor
dants are made use of in dyeing.

  182              Memoir   upon the  Mordants
  fectual to find a substitute for alum, we have, nevertheless,
  made trial of a great number of substances         with wool,
  less, however, for the purpose of discovering the best mor
  dants,' than for determining the action of several substances,
 very soluble, and at the same time endowed with great
  powers. We boiled wool for two hours in water, in which
  were put small quantities of sulphuric,      nitric, muriatic,
  and tartaric acids.   In each instance, the wool, especially
 when combined with sulphuric acid, struck with cochineal
 and madder deeper colours than when impregnated with
 alum and tartar. No doubt, therefore, can be entertained
 of their superiority in similar cases ; but of all the mor
  dants we tried, there is not one which gives such bright
 colours as what are obtained by means of the acid tartrite
 of alumina (notwithstanding the opinion of M. Hausmann
 to the contrary).     This salt would, in a great number of
 cases, be preferable to tartar and alum, if its price was not
 so much higher than theirs.       Whilst we were occupied in
 inquiring with the greatest care into every thing relative to
 the nature and mode of combination of mordants with
 various stuffs, we did not forget to examine the several
 methods which have been adopted in all the workshops for
 a long time past, in order to ascertain if the proportions of
 alum and tartar, the most generally employed, were those
 the most suitable for the purpose, if the time employed for
 the alum bath was sufficient to impregnate the wool suffi
 ciently, and if the exposure to the cool air afterwards, for
 several days, which is so generally thought necessary, is at
tended with the expected advantages.
     Equal parts of the mordants, that is, half the weight of
the stuff, produced no better effect than one-fourth; but
between this quantity and one-twentieth part, the colours
of cochineal, kermes, and madder, were weaker in pro
portion to the diminution of the quantity of the salts ;
 whilst, on the contrary, the effects were reversed with
woad and Brazil wood, so that in these last substances, the
colour was deeper the more the salts were diminished.        No
 difference could be observed in the colour whether the wools
had been in the alum bath for two, four, or six hours ; it
is, therefore, useless to continue stuffs in the bath longer
than two Hours. Our experiments did not discover that
there was any difference in the colour, whether the dyeing
took place immediately after the aluming, or was protracted
for some time, except only that wool impregnated with
alum alone, produced a deeper colour with woad, after
having been exposed some time to a cool air, which we
                                                      attributed

                Art. 1 . Of the Scarlet        Colour.
   Scarlet is that hright and shining colour which is pro
duced in wool by treating ii with tartar, cochineal, and a
highly oxidized solution of tin. Before the discovery of
this method, for which we are entirely indebted to Dreb-
bel, those colours were called scarlet which are produced
in woollen stuffs by kermes or cochineal, when alum and
tartar are employed as mordants.         These processes for ob
taining this colour have long been known in the dyeing
houses, yet no theoretic investigations have been made into
the phaenomena which take place when a solution of tin is
used with cream of tartar and cochineal.           Dr. Bancroft at
tempted to explain what passes in the formation of this co
lour ; but as his opinion does not appear to be founded on
any experiments, we considered the question as not at all
determined by his labours.       We propose, therefore, in this
fourth chapter, to determine the chemical nature of the
combination formed upon wool by cochineal, tartar, and a
solution of tin, and to make known the result of our in
quiries upon the colour of scarlet.
Art.    2.  Examination    of tlie  Precipitate formed ly the
   Solution   of Tin, and the acidulated      Tartrite of Potass.
   All the substances employed by us in our experiments
were perfectly pure, and we constantly made use of glass
vessels and distilled water.    Eighty grammes of acidulated
tartrite of potass dissolved in three kilogrammes, and five
hectogrammes* of distilled water, were macerated for two
hours, at 100 degrees (212 F.) of heat, with one hundred
and twenty-five grains of a solution of tin.        The precipitate
which we obtained was washed several times, and distilled
in a small curved retort, the beak of which being plunged
into lime water, there was disengaged a sensible quantity
of carbonic acid. Proper re-agents indicated in other por
tions of it the presence of a great deal of tin and muriatic
acid.    Thus the cream of tartar and solution of tin are de
composed, and produce a precipitate, consisting of tar-
tarous acid, and a great quantity of muriatic acid and
tin. The mother-water contains tartrite of potass, aci
dulated tartrite, very acid muriate of tin, and a considerable
                         About  seven pints.

184              Memoir    upon the Mordants
portion of precipitate, heid in solution by excess of muriatie
acid.
   Very pure white wool, treated with the ordinary propor
tions of solution of tin and cream of tartar employed in
dyeing scarlet, was washed ;i great number of times in boil
ing water, which carried oft' all the substances combiued
with it. These washings, collected and evaporated, afforded
us the same principles we had before obtained from the
precipitate formed by the solution of tin and cream of tar
tar ; we also examined, in the same way, the action of co
chineal, and found no difference in the results. From
these facts we are to a certainty convinced, that the fine
scarlet colour is produced by the wool being combined with
colouring mailer, tanarous acid, muriatic acid, and peroxide
of tin. But we are mistaken, if we think the bath has no
influence on the colour; for wool combined with the mor
dants we. shall presently mention, and dyed with cochineal,
never take the scarlet hue unless some acid be added, which
causes the colour to pass from yellowish to red, and at
length to a hright colour.     This la?t experiment, and some
others we shall relate towards the close of this memoir,
proved to us that the wool is not coloured yellow by the
combination it forms with the nitric acid in excess in the
solution of tin, for this wool comes out perfectly white
from all the boilings it undergoes with the tin, when no
colouring matter is employed.
  Art.   3.  Of Tartritcs  of Tin, and   some other Metallic
                            Solutions.
   The proofs we have already given of the formation of
scarlet, appear to us so decisive, that we should not have
thought of increasing the number, had not the importance
of the question induced us to extend further our labours on
this subject.
   We tried upon wool, in the usual proportions for dyeing
scarlet, all the sulphates and muriates of aniimonv, bis
muth, zinc, and arsenic.      Some of these solutions afforded
very agreeable colours, but very different from that we were
seeking to obtain.      We were more fortunate in our at
tempts with the tartriie of tin obtained from tartrate of
potass and soda, and a highly oxidized muriate of tin.
This salt dissolved in muriatic acid, and used in the opera
tion of dyeing, afforded us a scarlet colour as beautiful and
bright as those obtained by cream of tartar and a solution
of tin. The tartrite of tin, also, dissolved in an excess of
jts own acid, produced very good effects} however, as this
                                                       method

                    employed    in the   Art of Dyeing.                             18*
method would be more costly than the ordinary processes,
it is best to employ the solution of this salt in muriatic
acid.   But before recommending this mordant to be used
in the dye houses, we intend to make trial of it in the large
way, so as to determine precisely the expense of          and                 it,
what advantages will be obtained    its           by
                                        employment.

                                a     the   latter  half  an hour;     this
division   is    necessary    to produce         gooda   colour,    which
would be weaker and more yellow                all the substances were
                                                if
rfiixed in the first operation, and applied to the wool for
two hours.         This circumstance          owing to the very acid
                                                is

mordant, and of the colouring matter.                  We obtain the
contrary effect when the mordants only are employed in the
first operation, and the cochineal reserved for the second.
    Pieces of very beautiful scarlet cloth, macerated in                            di
stilled water, at boiling heat, gave out to the water
                      a                                               por     a
tion of their colour, and when the operation was finished,
appeared only of       a  light flesh colour.       The washings col
lected and evaporated were very acid, and contained, be
 sides the colouring substance and animal matter, tartarous
acid, muriatic acid, and oxide of tin.               Scarlet, therefore,,
as we have already shown,             is combination
                                           a                       in

sure soluble, which in parting with             small quantity of acid
                                                     a

                                         repeated washings at ele
vated temperatures, and with            large bulk of fluid, be ren-»
 dcred completely colourless.
     It  results from the experiments related in this memoir                          :
     1st. That in aluming all vegetable and animal substances,
it   is  not the alumina which combines with them, but the
 entire alum    ;   and that when these matters are not purified,
 the lime which they contain, occasions               decomposition of
                                                          a
a   part of this mordant.
     2. - That all the alkaline and earthy bases, mixed with                          a
 solution of alum, decompose                it,
                                             and convert       into acid
                                                                    it
 sulphate of potass, and into an insoluble salt, less acid than
 alum, which may,          byrepeated washings, be converted into
 pure alumina, sulphate of potass, and alum.
     3. That the acetate of alumina combines also                  its enin
                                                                        tire

tire state with silk, wool, cotton, and thread ; that this
compound retains its acid but feebly, and loses a portion of
it by simple exposure to the air ; and that it is then changed
into acid acetate of alumina, which is carried off by water,
and into alumina which remains upon the stuffs.
     4. That alum and tartar are not decomposed, but that
the solubility of the latter is increased by the mixture ; and
that in impregnating wools either with tartar, or alum and
tartar, the tartar alone is decomposed, that the tartarous
acid and alum combine with the stuff, and tartrite of
potass remains in the bath.
     5. That the most powerful acids have the property, when
combined with wool, of fixing the colouring matters, a
property possessed in a high degree by the acid tartrite of
alumina.
     6. That alum and tartar cannot be employed indifferently
for all colours, and that their proportions must depend
upon the nature of the colouring matter; that the time of
aluming should not be more than two hours, and that the
exposure of the stuffs in a moist place, after the mordants
arc applied, is of no utility in augmenting the intensity of
 their colour.
     7. That highly oxidized tartrite of tin, dissolved in mu
 riatic acid, may supply the place of cream of tartar and the
solution of tin in dyeing scarlet.
     8. Lastly, that these experiments furnish some useful
 hints for combining mordants with the stuffs to be dyed,
and for improving several of the processes of dyeing.
    To complete these researches relative to the action of
mordants, it would without doubt be necessary to deter
mine, in the most accurate manner, the changes produced
in these combinations by the colouring matters, when ap
plied to the different stuffs ; but these experiments, which
 we have already commenced, will form the subject of a se
 cond Memoir, to be hereafter presented to the Class.

provement ; without, however, presuming to say, how far
it may be expedient to adopt the proposed alterations ; be
ing sensible that what may appear very feasible in theory,
or may even answer in small assays, may not be practicable
in large works.
    " The first alteration which I would propose to the con
sideration of the lead-smelters, is to substitute an horizon
tal chimney of two or three hundred vards in length, in
the place of the perpendicular one now in use.      In the pre
ceding Essay,    which   was first published in 1778,  mention
is made of the probability of saving a large quantity of sub
limed lead, by making the smoke which rises from the ore
 pass through an horizontal chimney, with various windings
 to condense the vapour. I have since conversed with some
 of the principal lead-smelters in Derbyshire, and find that
 I   had overrated the quantity of this sublimed lead ; the
 weight of the scoria, from a ton of ore, amounting to more
 than I had supposed. They were all of them, however, of
 opinion, that the plan I had proposed for saving the sub
 limate was a very rational one. But so difficult is it to
 wean artists from their ancient ways of operating, that I
 question very much whether any of them would ever have
 adopted the plan they approved, if an horizontal chimney,
 which was built a little time ago in Middieton Dale, for a
 quite different purpose, had not given them a full proof of
 the practicability of saving the sublimate of lead, which is
 lost in the ordinary method of smelting.        This chimney
 was built on the side of a hill, to prevent some adjoining
 pastures from being injured by the smoke of the furnace.
 It not only answers that end, but it is found also to collect
 considerable quantities of lead, which is sublimed during
 the smelting of the ore. This sublimed lead is of a whitish
  cast, and is sold to the painters at ten or twelve pounds a
  ton ; it might perhaps be converted into red lead with still
 more profit.
     "A   second circumstance to be attended to in the smelt
  ing of lead ore, is the saving the sulphur contained in it.
  The pure lead ore of Derbyshire contains about an eighth
  and a ninth part of its weight of sulphur ; but as the ore
  which is smelted is never pure, being mixed with particles
  of spar, caivk, limestone, Lrasil, and other substances,
  which the miners call deads, we shall be high enough in
  our supposition, if we say that the ordinary ore contains a
  tenth of its weight of sulphur; it may not, probably, con
  tain so much, but even a twelfth part, could it be collected
  at a small expense, would be an object of great importance

to the smelter.  In the common method of smelting lead
ore there is no appearance of the sulphur it contains ; it i»
consumed by the flame of the furnace, as soon as it is se
parated from the ore.    An attentive observer may, indeed,
by looking  into the furnace, distinguish a diversity in the
colour      the flame at different periods of the process.
           of
During  the  first three or four hours after the ore is put into
the furnace, the flame has a blueish tint ; proceeding, no
doubt, from the sulphur, which, in being sublimed from
the ore, is inflamed ; after all the sulphur is separated from
the ore, the flame has a whitish cast; and then, and not
before, the fire may be raised for finishing the operation;
for if the fire be made strong before the sulphur be dis
persed, the quantity of lead is less,          probably for two
reasons ; the sulphur unites itself in part to the lead which
is formed, and by this union becomes inseparable from it;
for the sulphur cannot without much difficulty be separated
from an artificial mixture of lead and sulphur, when the
two ingredients have been fused together..        2. The sulphur
whilst it continues united to the lead in the natural ore,
renders the ore volatile, so that in a strong heat a great
portion of it is driven off.       Hence, very sulphureous ores
should be roasted for a long time with a gentle heat ; and in
this proper management       of the fire principally consists the
superiority of one smelter above another.
    " An old lead smelter informed me that he bad often re
duced a ton of ore to 16 hundred weight, by roasting                 it;
but that he did not obtain more metal from       it   by   subse
                                                           a
quent   fusien,  than   if
                         he had  fluxed  it without  any previous
roasting.     This may be true of some sorts of ore, but         it   is
not true of very sulphureous ores.       Indeed the fire may be
so regulated in     cupola furnace, as to make
                    a                            it    answer the
purpose of      roasting and
                a              a  smelting-furnace at the same
time.     / have seen much lead lost     bysmelting

                                                                of
phureous ore in eight hours    ;  which might have been saved,
if the fire had at first been kept so gentle, as to have allowed
twelve hours for finishing the operation.
   " Sulphur cannot be separated from lead ore in close
vessels   ;and the lead ore melts with so small    a    degree of
heat, that there may be more difficulty in procuring the                   \
sulphur from the" ores of lead, than from those of copper or
iron  :  however,   I am far from thinking the matter im
practicable, though     1have not yet hit upon the method of
doing     it
           ; and the following reflections may, perhaps, tend
to supersede the necessity of collecting the sulphur in sub-
stance.

    " When it is said that the sulphur is consumed by the
flame of the furnace as soon as it is separated from the ore,
the reader will please to recollect that sulphur consists of
two parts,  of an inflammable part, by which it is rendered
combustible,  of an acid part, which is set at liberty, in
the form of vapour, during the burning of the sulphur.
Now this acid, though it may be driven out of the furnace
in the form of vapour, yet is incapable of being thereby
decomposed ; it still continues to be an acid : and, could
the vapour be condensed, might answer all the same pur
poses as the acid of vitriol ; since all the acid of vitriol,
now used in commerce, is actually procured from the
burning of sulphur.        That the fact, with respect to the acid
not being decomposed, is as I have stated           it,
                                                     may be readily
proved.      The smoke which issues out of the chimney for
some hours after each fresh charge of ore, has           suffocating
                                                            a
 smell, perfectly resembling the smell of burning brimstone                  ;
 and    if  wet cloth, or
            a                wet hand, be held in
                              a                           for

 short space of time, and afterwards applied to the tongue,
a  strong acid will be sensibly perceived.         Various methods
 may   be  invented   for condensing   this  acid vapour, and, pro
 bably,   more   commodious     than  the   following one, which,
 however,      will just take the liberty of mentioning, as,
                I                                                        if  it
 should not succeed, the trial will be attended with very lit
 tle expense.
    " Supposing then an horizontal chimney to be built, let
 the end furthest from the fire be turned up by               tube of
                                                                 a

 so as to be capable of being inserted into one another; let
 these vessels be placed on the flue of the chimney, the neck
 of the first being inserted into the tube through which we
 have supposed the sulphureous acid to issue, and the neck
 of the last being left open, for fear of injuring the draught
 of the furnace. Let each of these globular vessels contain
a   small quantity of water; then         it   isconceived that the
 heat of the flue will raise the water into        vapour, and that
                                                    a

damper.      Since the       first publication of the preceding Essay,
1 have seen an     horizontal chimney at the copper works near
 Liverpool, where every thing I had said concerning the pro
 bability of saving sulphur by roasting lead ore, is verified
 with respect to copper ore ; and 1 believe a patent has been
 granted to some individual for this mode of collecting sul
 phur.     Sulphur might be obtained with equal facility from
 the pyrites which is found amongst coal, and this applica
 tion of the pyrites might, probably, be more lucrative than
the present one  making green vitriol.
    " A third circumstance, which requires the utmost care
of the lead-smelter, is the leaving as little lead as possible
 in the slag. Near every smelting-house there are thousands
 of tons of slag, which, when properly assayed, are found to
yield from one-eighth to one- tenth of their weight of lead,
 though no person has yet discovered a method of extracting
 so much from them when smelted in large quantities ; and
indeed the smelters are so little able to obtain all the lead
contained in them, that in many places they never attempt
 to extract any part of it : in some places where they do at
tempt    it,
           I   have known the proprietor of the slag allow the
smelters 20s. for every pig of lead they procured of the
value of 38i. besides furnishing them with fuel               and yet        :

added       to  a mixture of lead and sulphur, it will absorb the
sulphur, leaving          the lead in its metallic form : might it not
be useful to flux sulphureous lead ores in conjunction with,
the scales or other refuse pieces of iron, or even with some
sorts of iron ore ? The smelter's great care should be to
extract as much lead as possible at the first operation of
smelting the ore, and to leave the slag as poor as possible ;
but if he should still find either the slag of the cupola fur
nace, or that of the hearth furnace, containing much lead,
(as that even of the hearth furnace certainly does,) he may,
perhaps, find it worth his while to reduce the slag into a
powder by a stamping mill, or by laying it in highways to be
ground by the carts, and then he may separate the stony part
of the slag from the metallic, by washing the whole in water,
inasmuch as the metallic part is far heavier than the other.
     "   I estimated the weights of several pieces of slag, and
 found them to differ very much from each other ; this dif
 ference is principally to be attributed to the different quan
 tities of lead left in them.

Uxbridge, in pursuance of the Acts of the 10th and 11th
of William III., having been discontinued in the year 1805,
in consequence of an agreement with Hugh Henshall and
Co. the Proprietors of the Trent and Mersey Canal, which
runs by its side (see Sect. 3, of Chap. XVI.*); and the Na
vigation on the Derwent River, from Wilden-Ferry up to
Derby, having been discontinued since 1794, when the
Derby Canals were finished. From this five miles of Na
vigation on the Trent River, the Loughborough Naviga
tion, by the side of the Soar, branches to the south, and
the Etfcwash Canal on the north, nearly opposite to each
other.
   The Derwent is the principal River of Derbyshire, col
lecting the whole of its waters from the surface of this
County, except from about 5000 Acres in Yorkshire, near
its source on the east side, and from 12,000 Acres in Not
tinghamshire, at one of the heads of the Amber branch to
this River.
   The smaller Rivers or branches to the Derwent on its
east side, are the Bootle and the Amber, and on its west
side the Morledge,    Eccleslurn, Bradford and Lathkil,
 Wye, Noe, and Ashop, besides smaller Brooks and Rivulets,
which are reckoned with the Derwent itself, and the whole
space which these occupy, including the 17,000 Acres
above mentioned, is 288,500 Acres of surface, draining to
and venting its waters into the Trent at Wilden-Ferry,
above mentioned.
   The course of the Derwent from Wilden-Ferry up to the
great Derbyshire Faultf E of Allestry (see p. 146), is very
widely excavated in the Red Marl Strata, and partially filled
again with sandy Quartz Gravel, mixed with thin and light
Bolders of Limestone, particularly in the upper part of this
distance : the present channel of the River closely ap
proaches the steep bank of Red Marl at Burrowash Mills,
and again for some distance from the north end of Derby
Town to Darley-Abbey. For about a mile, between the

page 129, see also page 243 ; the main trunk of the Der-
went being here deeper excavated in the series of Strata,
than in any other part of its course. Near the north end
of the High Tor, the 2nd Lime Rock again crosses the Ri-
ver to the west, and the 1st Toadstone also, and the River
runs in or upon the 1st Lime Rock, until about half a mile
above Matlock Bridge, when the same gets again upon the
great Limestone Shale (as below Cromford Bridge and be
low Milford Bridge), and continues for many miles to run
in deep excavations in this Shale, and the Shale Grit-stone
which it sometimes contains (except touching a denudated
patch of 1st Lime in Wensley, opposite Darley Church,
see p. 243), and having massive Cliffs, often, of the 1st Grit
in the heights above the River, until near its source upon
this 1st Grit Rock, at the place called the Trough on the
 Grand Ridge, at the Bounds of Yorkshire, as mentioned
page 4.
    I shall now proceed to mention briefly, the principal
Strata traversed by each of the smaller Rivers branching
from the main trunk of the Derwent above described, in
order as above, viz.
    The Bootle Rivulet or Brook, joins the Derwent S of
Little-Eaton, its course thence up to Coxbench being near
to the great zigzag Fault, upon the upper part of the Coal
Series; at Coxbench it crosses the 3rd Grit Rock, then the
3rd Coal-shale, the 4th Grit, and so on ascending the Series,
to its source, near Ripley Town ; and its branch from
Smalley also, ascends the Series towards its course.
    The Amber River empties itself into the Derwent at Toad-
moor Bridge, upon the Limestone Shale, and continues
therein and in Shale Grit-stone, until E of Bull-bridge
Aqueduct; it then crosses the 1st Grit (with a rapid E dip),
and then the 1st Coal shale, 2nd Grit, 2nd Coal-shale, Sec.
to Pentrich-lane,       where it has got upon the 5th Grit or
higher, when turning northward, its course follows nearly
the edges of the same Strata to Ford, NW of Higham,
where it turns NW and crosses the 4lh Grit, the 3rd Coal-
shale, 3rd Grit, 8tc. until near Mill-town its Excavation
    The late ingenious Mr. John Whitehurst, erred in asserting, in both
editions of his" Inquiry concerning the Earth," that the Derwent here runs
on loose and broken stud, between the 2nd and the 1st Toadstone (see also,
the Translation of Werner's "New Theory of Veins," Supplement, p.S34);

               and the Strata,          &c. in Derbyshire.                  1 97
crosses the 1st Grit, and enters the highly curious rlenudatcd
Dale of Ashover, descending the Series on to the Limestone
Shale, 1st Lime, and 1 st Toadstone, which is excavated for
near a mile (see p. 17 1 and 242), and then its course ascends
to the 1st Lime, the Limestone Shale, the 1st Grit, near
Bowers Mill, and takes its rise on the 1st Coal-shale, near
to Moor- Hall in Ashover.      The other main branch of this
River, from Toad-hole Furnace eastward, continues to
ascend the series of Coal-measures, till crossing the zigzag
Fault W of Sutton in Ashfield in Nottinghamshire, it has
its source from the edge of the yellow Lime.
   The Morledge Rivulet or Brook, falls into the Derwent
in Derby Town, 011 Red Marl and Gravel, its various rami
fications being excavated in Red Marl, except its several
extreme northern branches, which cross the great Derby
shire Fault, between Allestry Town and Matisel-park, and
are excavated in the great Limestone Shale, or in the Quartz
Gravel with which it is there locally covered.
   The Eccleslurn River falls into the Derwent at Duffitld
on the great Limestone Shale, and in which it is excavated,
through all its ramifications, except that, at its sources near
Wirksworth, these Excavations extend into the 1st, and the
3rd, and 4th Limestones ; and that on the south of Turn-
ditch, a local patch of the Shale Limestone is cut and laid
bare by a branch of these Excavations, see p. 230.
   The Bradford and Lathkil pour their united streams into
the Wye, west of Great Rowsley, near its junction with the
Derwent, on Limestone Shale: through which they are
soon excavated, so as to lay bare the 1st Lime Rock below
Alport (see page 68), where the Lathkil and the Bradford
meet, on a bed of Tufa, as observed page 458 ; from hence
the course of the Bradford proceeds westward in the 1st
Lime Rock, which it cuts through on the SW of Yolgrave,
and lays bare the 1 st Toadstone for a short space (see page
243), when it crosses the great Bakewell Fault* (see p. 291,
Note), and again ascends the Lime and skirts the Shale,
which it ascends near Gratton, taking its rise upon this
stratum near Elton. The Lathkil Excavation pursues the
 1st Lime to the south side of Over-Haddon, where it de
scends the Series on the 1st Toadstone, cuts through        and       it,
lavs bare  a patch of 2nd Lime, as mentioned, page 243                       ;     .

(page 68) up to Monyash, where it approaches the basset
of the 1st Toadstone ; but turning to the NW, it keeps in
the 1st Lime till near the branching of the Taddington and
Flagg Roads, where it crosses the 1st Toadstone basset, and
proceeds in the 2nd Lime, till opposite the Wells in Flagg
Village, where it crosses the basset of the 2nd Toadstone,

ifito the Derwent at Great Rowsley, upon the Limestone
Shale., as mentioned above, and on the south side of Had-

Note), which brings up the 1st Lime, in which the Vale is
excavated for a short distance, and then agaiu in the Shale up
to Bakewell Town, where the Lime, rising rapidly NW, is
cut again, and at the Cotton-Mill the excavation enters the
 1st Toadstone (page 242), and continues in it, until cross
ing again the great Bakewell Fault, the Shale and Shale
Limestone are then excavated, up to Ashford and beyond,
when the 1st Lime is again cut through, the 1st Toadstone,
 2nd Lime, and an Excavation made in the 2nd Toadstone,
at the west front of Fin Copt Hill (see page 33), which in
this respect, and its number of Strata, resembles Matlock
High-Tor, represented in Plate V.* facing page 120. From
hence through Monsal Dale (page fia), The 2nd Toadstone
is in the bottom and west side of the Dale, and below the
molith of Cressbrook Dale the Excavation enters on the 3rd
Limestone, and continues the same through Miller's Dale
(pages 69 and 243), where the 3rd Lime is cut through for
a I of a mile, and shows the 3rd Toadstone in the bottom
of the Dale. In Wye Wood in Wormhill, near Chee Tor,
the River crosses the basset of the 3rd Toadstone, and from
thence all the way to Mill Dale, near Buxton (page 69),
the Excavation is in the 4th Lime Rock : in Mill Dale the
3rd Toadstone is again crossed with a N dip, and the Exca
vation for about      \  of a mile is again in the 3rd Lime, to,
the great Limestone Fault f, near Mill-Dale Bridge at Buxton
Town's end (page 287) ; from whence turning W, the Ex
cavation proceeds in Shale on the north side of the Baths,
and so continues to its sources near the Grand Ridge by the
Manchester, Macclesfield, and Leek Roads.

   The Ashop River falls into the Derwcnt at Cock-Bridge,
south of Darwent- Chapel, on the Limestone Shale, and all
its different branches are excavated therein, except some of
their extreme ends, which penetrate the 1st Grit, on the
heights.
   Thus it appears, that the Derwent River, which collects
its water from very deep Excavations in the lowest known
Stratum in all this District, the 4th Lime Rock, both by its
Wye branch and its Noe branch from Castleton Peaks Hole
(see page 289), conveys the same on to the highest known
Stratum of the County, the Red Marl ; and a similar re
mark will apply to the Dove River, of which I shall next
treat.
   The Dove River empties itself into the Trent at Newton-
Solney Ford, on Red Marl covered by sandy Quartz Gravel,
about a mile above which it passes under the Trent and
Mersey Canal', through twelve low Aqueduct Arches, from
whence for many miles its course is very widely excavated
in the Red Marl Strata, and sandy Quartz Gravel mixed
with thin rounded Limestones, is lodged as a floor in the
bottom of this Valley, in so regular a manner, as to form
flat Meadows (occasionally flooded) from \ to 2 miles wide,
the adjacent heights being composed of* Red Marl in hori

(see p. 146) crosses this River, and suddenly terminates the
Red Marl, bringing the Limestone Shale ppposite to it on
the north side, and in which, and the Shale Limestone be

of the great Limestone Fault (see page 283) at_the entrance
of Dove Dale, near Thorpe.        For   aconsiderable distance
 above and below Hanging-Bridge,        a vast mass of sandy
 Quartz  Gravel   Rock

                                            in
 Dove seems excavated    ;  about  | m. above Mappleton, the
 Quartz Gravel in the Vale ends, and above this, the small
 quantity of Alluvia which    islodged in the bottoms of the
 Vales, consist of thin Limestones, and other native alluvial
 matters. From the great Fault last mentioned, the highly
 curious Dove Dale commences (see page 66), having the
 two surprising Hills of 4th Limestone, Bunster on the W
 and Thorpe-Cloud on the E, at the entrance of the Dale,

 exceptions, for near 5 m., the Dove running, in great part
 of this distance, upon lower Strata in this immense 4th
 Lime Rock, and in the general Series, than are perhaps any
 where else visible in the British Islands.        For about m.,                \
 after crossing the great Limestone Fault again, near Wolf-
 scote Hall (see p. 286), the Excavation is partly in Shale
 on the W, and p.irtly in 4th Lime on the E, when again
 crossing the Fault, the Excavation passes again through the
 4th Limestone for about         m. forming Beresford Dale (see
                                       -J-
 page  64), and   finally crossing   the Fault at the nonh end of
 this Dale, its further course for several miles       in the Lime
                                                                is
 stone Shale, often skirting close to the great Fault and 4th
 Lime Rock, till crossing the Buxton and Leek Road (about
   jb. N of what       usually called Dove-head, at the bounds

 of Derbyshire),      soon after enters the 1st Grit Rock, which
it  cuts through between the great and middle Axe-edge
Hills (see p. 17) the Dove taking its rise in the Bog upon

in Shale on the N and 1st Grit on the S ; it leaves this Fault
and cuts through the 1st Grit to Gradbatch, where it enters
the 1st Coal-shale, the 2nd Grit and the 2nd Coal-shale;
when a Fault near Birchen-Clough, again brings up the
Liniestone Shale, in which the Excavation proceeds a short
distance, and then cuts through the 1st Grit Rock to Paniers-
pool Bridge, at the corners of Cheshire, Staffordshire, and
Derbyshire; whence it proceeds N a little way in the 1st
Grit, and crosses a Fault at Gallywood-House, into the
2nd Coal-shale, which it pursues past Dane-head Collierv,
and then for a considerable distance through the 2nd Grit
 Rock to Thatch-marsh Colliery, and on to the 1st Coal-
 shale, where the Dane River originates, from the same Bog
 which gives rise to the Dove, page 479.
    The Goyte also is a western River, which uniting wrth
 the Ethrow at Water-meetings       in Ludworth, forms there
the celebrated Mersey, which runs to Stockport and Liver
 pool: the Water-meetings being in an Excavation in the
2nd Coal-shale, which the course of the Goyte pursues up
to Marple-.bridge,     and there enters the 2nd Grit Rock,
 which it cuts through, and exposes the 1st Coal-shale in
 the bottom of the Dale, for some distance above and below
Mellor-Mills : the Excavation then again enters and pursues
 the 2nd Grit, to the crossing of the New-Mills and Marple
 new Road, when the Rock is again quite cut throuch, and
 exposes the 1st Coal-shale for a short distance; then the
.find Grit is again crossed, and the 2nd Coal-shale, and the
 Goyte Excavation passes through the romantic New-Mills
Dale (see page 70) in the 3rd Grit Rock ; which Rock it
 juirsues almost to Bottom-Hall, and then is in the 2nd
 Coal-shale, till above Whaley-bridge : the 2nd Rock is then
 pursued to near Taxhall, where the Excavation is in or ad
joins a Hummock of the 2nd Coal-shale, for about a mile
 near Shallcross-Colliery   : near Ferneylee the    River again
 runs on the 2nd Grit, which continues to Goyte-moss,
 where the Goyte originates on the 2nd Coal- shale near
 Goyte-moss E Colliery.
    The Elhrow River, which discharges into the Mersey at
 Water-meetings in Ludworth, as before observed, is there
 excavated in the 2nd Coal-shale, which it pursues to Wood-
 seals in Charlesworth,    and then its course is cut through
 Cliffs  of the  3rd Rock  for near a mile, yet it enters again
 on the 2nd Coal-shale, and pursues it to Wolley-Bridge on
 the Glossop and Mottram Road ; then the 2nd Grit Rock
 is crossed, and the 1st Coal-shale, at Water-side Mills, the

  Excavation entering the 1st Grit Rock, which is soon cut
  through, and it pursues a large patch of the Limestone Shale
  laid bare in the Valley, on which the River runs till within
  about    of a mile of the bounds of Yorkshire, when the Ex
           -J-
 cavation again encounters the 1st Grit Rock, and cuts
 through it, soon after passing the corners of Derby, York,
  and Chester Counties, when         it     enters the 1st Coal-shale,
 on which the Ethrow rises SW of Lady-cross Hill in the
  Penistone Road.
     The Shelf Rivulet or Brook falls into the Ethrow on the-
 N side of the Roman Station called Melandra Castle, in an
 Excavation in the 2nd Coal-shale, partly filled with foreign
 Alluvia. On the      S  of Dinting, the 2nd Grit Rock       is   crossed,
 and the 1st Coal -shale; at Bridge-end the Excavation of
 the 1st Grit Rock commences, and           it   is  cut through at the
 E end of Glossop Town and Mills, the remaining deep
 Excavation being in the Limestone Shale, and the source
 of the Shelf in the Bogs on the same, N of Doctor-Gate
                 is
Bridle Road.
     The Sheaf River falls into the Don in the Town of Shef
 field in Yorkshire, upon the gth Grit Rock, the Ponds Col
 liery being excavated underneath             it
                                               :     between this and
 Heely-milT, where the Sheaf touches upon Derbyshire, the
Excavation has passed through the 8th Coal-shale, the 8th
 Grit Rock, the 7th Coal-shale, &c. and arrived on the 4th
 Coal-shale; in about to. more south,
                           $                          ithas cut through
the 4th Grit Rock, and from thence having entered Derby
shire near Oak-Mills, to near the north end of Totley
Town,      itruns upon the 3rd Coal-shale or great Crowstone-
shale  ;  at Totley   it cuts through the 3rd Grit Rock, crosses
the 2nd Coal-shale, and originates in the 2nd Grit Rock,
in Strawberry-Leys Farm on the high or East Moors.
     The Rother River falls into the Don about             §    to. above
Rotherham-Bridge          in Yorkshire, on the salmon-coloured
Grit Rock, in which        it   is  excavated,    to CatclitT, and then
through other parts of the Coal Series, which              I    have not
yet thoroughly determined, to the SW corner of Folkcn
Wood, where       it  crosses the 13th Grit Rock, and pursues
the 12th Coal-shale, having touched the County of Derby
above Woodhouse Mill, and entered             it   at the mouth of the
Gannow      Rivulet,  till  within
                                 i     to. of Killamarsh     Bridge, and
there crosses the 12th Grit Rock, then the 11th Coal-shale
and llth Rock, and the 10th Coal-shale and Rock, just
above the Bridge abovementioned           ;     the Excavation then
continues in    the  9th   Coal-shale    to  Renishaw     Bridge, where
the 10th Rock again         crosses  the  River,   and   soon   after the
                                                                     10th

            and the Strata,   &c. in Derlyshire.           203
10th Coal-shale and 1 Ith Rock do the same; and the Ex
cavation proceeds in the 1 1 th Coal-shale till near Staveley
Bridge, when the 12th Rock is crossed, the 12th Coal-shale
is then pursued for a short distance and the 12th Rock is
again crossed ; the Series is then descended, through the
 1 1th Coal-shale and Rock, the 10th and gth to the 8th Rock
on the NW of Brimmingten, laid bare by the Calow and
Bull-Close Denudation, see page 163; after which the
Series is ascended again in like manner by the channel of the
 River to the )Oth Rock, above Wildens-mill, and in this
 Rack the Excavation proceeds up the Trough between Ches
 terfield and Hady, to the Bridge on the London Road above
 Chesterfield,    having, opposite the Iron - Furnace,        cut
 through    the Rock  and exposed  the 9th Coal-shale for a short
 distance : from the Bridge last mentioned as far as Park-
 House Mill above North Winfield, the 10th Coal-shale is
 followed, the Rother taking its rise on this same Stratum
 at Littleworth near Stretton.
     The Hipper River falls into the Rother at the SE end of
 Chesterfield, on the l Oth Grit Rock, in which it continues
 to be excavated for -}?»., then the 9th Coal-shale for about
  the same space, then the gth Rock, the 8th Coal-shale, and
  so on, descending the Series to near Holy-moor-side, where
 the 4th Grit Rock is crossed, the Excavation then pursues
  the 3rd Coal-shale for $ m., and then cuts through the 3rd
  Grit, and lakes its rise on the 2nd Coal-shale on the W side
  of Harwood-Grange in Bceley.
      The Dolee River falls into the Rother near Hague, below
  Staveley, on the 1 1 th Coal-shale; its Excavation cuts
  through the 12th Rock below the Aqueduct Bridge of the
  Chesterfield Canal over this River, which stands on the 12th
  Coal-shale; at Netherthorp it cuts through the 13th Rock,
  and pursues Coal-measures which I am not thoroughly ac
  quainted with, to Sutton Water-Mill, from whence it fol
   lows nearly the course of the great zigzag Fault for some
   distance (see page 162), and then leaves it on its E side;
   on the SW of Heath Church the 13th Rock is again cross
   ed, and the 13th Coal-shale, and the 12th Rock is pursued,
   until it terminates abruptly at Stainsby Water-Mill, where
   the great zigzag Fault is again crossed ; and the Measures
   which basset from under the yellow Lime are pursued by
   the Excavation, the rise of this River being near Over-Moor
    on the Tibshelf-and Mansfield Road: about 1000 acres in
   Nottinghamshire     to the eastward of this main branch,
    draining intoit,   as shown in the Map of Ridges facing

204              Mr.   Farey's Account        of the Rivers
    The Idle is      a River of Nottinghamshire            and Yorkshire,
¦which     falls into the Trent at Stock with, having several
heads or principal branches, four of which rise in Derby
shire upon the yellow Lime, and continue upon the same,
until they quit the County, soon after which they each en
ter the Sherwood Gravel : one of these streams, which rises
on the E of Bolsover, passes through a curiously excavated
Valley in the Lime, called Markland-Gripes, on the NE of
Elmton, see page 68, and through another in a lifted part
of the yellow Lime, calltd Cresswell-Crags,* adjoining Not
tinghamshire.         At Walley old Furnace near Over-Lang-
with, a branch of the Palter is deeply excavated in the Lime ;
and so is the Medon, about the Cotton-Mills at Plesley old
Force : the Excavations for this last stream from Plesley up
to Hardwick Park and Teversall, and at Stoney-Houghton,
lay bare the blue beds of Lime in blue Clay, belonging to
the yellow Lime Strata, see page 157, and so dots the stream
first mentioned at Walls near Knitaker, &c. : and the
branches of the Leen near Cinder-Hill in Nottinghamshire,
seem to do the same thing, see p. 452.
    The Erewash River falls into the Trent at Barton-Ferry,
in a wide Excavation in Red Marl, partly filled with sandy
Quartz Gravel : about a mile below Sandiacre, hills of Red
Marl commence on each side, and continue, with the Gra
vel flat in the bottom of the Valley, to Stapleford-Mill,
where the great Derbyshire Fault (see page 146) crosses
this River, and its Excavation, which is then very wide,
proceeds in the upper part of the Coal Series greatly raised,
until somewhere about the Road from Ilkeston to Cossall,
where the zigzag Fault also crosses (see pages 162), and
the Excavation then continues in lower parts of the Coal
Series, not yet completely explored, until opposite the
mouth of Golden-Valley at the NE corner of Codnor-park,
where it enters the skirt of a curious local Denudation (see
page 164), which in about a Mile it leaves again, and con
tinues to ascend the series of strata until near Langton Hall
in Kirkby, Nottinghamshire ; where it again crosses the
zigzag Fault, and the Excavation ascends the Coal Strata
basseting from under the yellow Lime, which also it at
length intersects, south of Kirkby, crosses its blue beds
and Clay, and originates on the NE of Kirkby, near to the
edge of the Sherwood Forest Gravel.
    The Nutlrook Rivulet falls into the Erewash S of Trowel,
and has a wide Excavation in the upper part of the ^Coal
Series for £ m., when it intersects              and follows the line of

    The Mease River falls into the Trent north of Croxall,
 in a wide Excavation in Red Marl partially filled with sandy
 Quartz Gravel, which extends up the Vale of the Mease a
little above Croxall, from whence the Vale is excavated in
 Red Marl, with occasional patches of Quartz Gravel on                     it,
 sometimes in Derbyshire and sometimes in Leicestershire,

     The Sence    is River of Leicestershire, which falls into the
                       a
 Anchor N        ofAtherstone, and whose waters are conveyed
 thence   by  means of the Tame, into the Trent, which                      is
 here mentioned, on account of its draining the detached
 parish of Ravenstone belonging to Derbyshire, in which
 the Valleys are mostly excavated in Red Clay belonging to
 the Ashby-de-la-Zouch Coal-Field.

 the attempt may appear.
     The Rivers of Derbyshire are tolerably supplied with Fish,
 as will be further noticed        the beginning of Chap. XVI.:
                                      in
 they are not much infested               by
                                     Weeds, owing to the rapidity
 in the currents of most of them, yet none of them are per
 manently thick or discoloured.
  It   has been often remarked, that some of the Rivers of
  this District are warmer than usual, and rarely freeze, the
 Derwent in particular, owing as               said, to the many
                                                   it   is
  warm Springs which vent into them when however the     :

206             Mr.    Farey's Account       of the Riveri
that there is nothing like a general warmth perceivable in
the Strata any where, as those fond of deriving Toadstone
and every thing else from subterranean Fire have pretended
(see p. 275), it seems more natural to refer the circum
stance, as far as it is true, to the great depth and narrow
ness of the Valleys, preserving the temperature longer than
in more open situations.
   After long dry weather the Rivers and Brooks here, as
might be expected \Vith such rapid falls, suffer considerable
Droughts, and are quite dried up often, in places where at
other times the torrents are tremendous: a remarkable
drought is recorded in the year 166 1, in which it was said,
but not truly I think, thai, the Derwent was dried up at
Derby. See an account of the fluctuation of the Rain at
Chatsworth in the last 50 years, at page 99.
   It has been remarked, that considerable Floods usually
follow Rain with the wind blowing down the course of the
Rivers. The Dove seems particularly subject to sudden
Floods, which inundate its fine expanse of Meadows. Un
der this head it may be proper to mention, that in 1587 the
Derwent was greatly swelled by a Flood, which carred away
St. Mary's Bridge : in 1610, and again in 1673, the Mor-
ledge was so swelled by sudden Rains, as to do much
damage in Derby : Nov. 5, 1 698, the Derwent was greatly
flooded: also on the 21st of November, 1791*, wnen it
carried away Toad-moor Bridge above Belper; on the 11th
of February, 1795t> the same bridge, and those at Wat-
stanwell above it and Belper below           it,
                                         were washed down                ;
in the night of the 17th of August, 17991, the Derwent at
Matlock Town rose rapidly, to         most surprising height

  XXIX.     On   the Radiation    of Cold. By a Correspondent.
                             To   Mr. Tilloch.
 Sir, Having lately seen repeated at the Royal Institution,
 the experiment of the supposed radiation of cold ; and be
  ing dissatisfied with the explanations commonly offered of
  this phsenomenon, I am induced to trouble you with this
 communication, in order to learn whether an explanation
 which I have to offer, may appear to others more satisfactory
 than any of those usually given.
     The experiment is loo familiar to men of science to heed
 description ; I will just mention the explanation usually
 given, as I draw my conclusion from precisely the same
premises, without attempting any new experiments.
     Mr. Davy stated that heat constantly radiated from all
 bodies ; and as the temperature of the thermometer placed
 in the focus of the one mirror is maintained by such radia
 tion, if a piece of ice be placed in the focus of tjie other
 mirror, it displaces a portion of air which before assisted
by its radiation (for he said that air did radiate heat) in main
taining that temperature : the thermometer therefore falls,
but the ice being removed it again rises. Were this ex
planation the true one, it would follow, that when the ther
mometer is placed in the focus.of the one mirror, although
there be nothing but air in the opposite one, it ought to
rise ; otherwise it could not be depressed by the abstraction,
of that air, any more than by that of an equal quantity in
any other spot at an equal distance.
    But if it be true, that all bodies do constantly radiate
                                                                      heat,

                   On the Radiation  of Cold.              209
heat, they do so as well at one degree of temperature as at
another; and presuming that the heat so radiated must have
the same temperature (if I may he allowed such a mode of
expression) as the body from which it proceeds, it will fol
low, that the piece of ice will radiate heat which cannot
have a higher temperature than 32a at the utmost j and this
will of course instantly affect the thermometer, and even
the hand of a person placed in the focus of the opposite
mirror, as Mr. Davy stated that it did his : an effect incon
ceivable upon the idea that merely a small portion of warm
air had been removed.
   If a frlgorific mixture was put into two vessels, one of
which when filled with a heated substance radiated much
heat, and the other the contrary j and if the thermometer
was more depressed by the first being placed in the focus
than the second, it might be considered as a decisive proof
of the truth of this explanation, and the radiation of cold
as it is called would be fully established : and indeed as no
one now doubts that the only difference between heat and
cold is a difference of temperature, and as it is known that
one temperature is as readily communicated as the other,
there seems no reason to he surprised that a body at 329
should radiate as well as one at 212°.
   The important consequences that must follow from the
establishment of this idea, in explaining many of thephae-
nomena of nature, must appear -so obvious to every one
who has at all consi^red the subject, that I hope these
suggestions may be thought worthy of consideration, as
they may be readily either confirmed or refuted by those
who have the necessary apparatus and assistance at their
command, both of which are wanting to one who can con
sider himself in these matters merely as a looker-on.

   *** Having the present opportunity,      I shall, as others
have ventured to do, offer what    I conceive to be the true
explanation of the phenomenon above alluded to. The
facility with which radiation of temperature is effected, de
pends, in some degree, on the temperature of the body on
which the radiation falls.    If two bodies of equal tempera
ture be placed in the focus of the two reflecting surfaces, it
is evident that their radiant powers must be perfectly ba
lanced. But let one of them be of a higher temperature
than the other, then the body of lower temperature being
in a capacity to receive an increase, it seems obvious that,

  XXX. A        Sketch   of  the   Natural History of the Cheshire
      Rock-Salt District.        By Henry Holland, Esq. Ho
      norary Member of the Geological Society*.
  The     vast beds of fossil or rock-salt, which are found in
  different parts of the county of Chester, form undoubtedly
  the most important and peculiar feature in the mineralogy
  of this district. In offering to the notice of the Geological
  SQciety some remarks upon these mines, it may be proper
  to premise, that in a Survey of Cheshire, which I had the
  honour of drawing up for the Board of Agriculture, I en
  tered at considerable length uppn the subject of their na
  tural history, and upon the manufacture of white salt from
  the brine springs to which they give rise.                  It will be niv
1
  present object to consider more especially the mineralogical
  situation and characters of the Cheshire rock-salt ; and
  though the repetition of some statements must necessarily
  occur; this, in the case of a work only partially known,
  can, I conceive, be attended with little disadvantage.
       Character  of the Country surrounding          the   Salt Mines.
      In speaking of the general situation of the Cheshire salt
  mines, it will be proper to state some facts with respect to
  the nature of the surrounding country, that their mineralo
  gical relations may more clearly be understood, and an op
  portunity given to speculate upon the probable origin of
  these important strata.        The southern parts of Lancashire,
  the northern extremity of Shropshire, and the whole of the
  intervening county of Cheshire, form in conjunction one
  vast tract of plain country, interrupted by few elevations,
  and these inconsiderable in size and extent. The area of
  this plain may be regarded as extending nearly fifty miles
  from north to south, and as having an average breadth of
  twenty-five or thirty miles.          Its eastern boundary, as more
  immediately regards the county of Chester, is a hia;h range
  of sandstone hills, stretching from north to south along
  the borders of Derbyshire and Staffordshire ; connected on
           * From the Transactions  of the Geological Socii-ty, vol. i.
                                                                           the

thfc  north With the hills in the West Riding of York, and
on their eastern side passing into the limestone hills of
Derbyshire.      The sandstone, in a considerable part of this
range, is slaty in its structure, and would seem to belong
to the Independent Coal -formation of Werner, some pretty
extensive beds of coal being found and worked under it.
The southern boundary of the plain, which is the one ap
proaching most nearly to the rock-salt* is irregularly formed
by ridges of limestone arid calcareous sandstone, leaving
open some communications with the level country in the
middle of Shropshire.        To the west its limits are marked
by   the  sandstone   and  limestone  hills in the adjoining part
of Wales, and by the sandy aestuaries of the Mersey and
Dee.
    The only ridge of hills, properly speaking, within the
Cheshire plain, is one on the western side of the country*
extending with a few interruptions from Frodsham to Mal-
pas, and including in its progress from north to south, the
high grounds of Delamere Forest, the Hill of Beeston, and
the Peckforton Hills.       This range, which no where attains
 an elevation of more than four or five hundred feel, is com
posed entirely of sandstone.         A small quantity of copper
ore has been found in the Peckforton Hills, which form its
southern extremity.       Another ridge of land* possessing a
small and irregular elevation above the adjoining plain, may
 be traced from the hills on the eastern border of Cheshire*
 in a westerly or north-westerly direction to Halton and
Runcorn.       At this point, where it attains its greatest
 height, it is separated from the northern extremity of the
 former ridge, only by the intervention of the valley of the
Weaver, which valley is here about two miles in width.
Towards the eastern extremity of this range, we meet with
a singular sandstone hill, called Alderley Edge, in which
 have been found ores of lead, copper and cobalt, and masses
of sulphate of barytes*
    This distribution of the high grounds in the Cheshire
 plain is traced out in the annexed map, and it will be seen,
 by a reference to this, that they form three distinct divisions
 of its area: one to the west of the higher sandstone range j
 another to the east of this, and south of the lower range ;
 and a third lying north of the latter, and including the
 southern parts of Lancashire.        With the exception of a
 wry few instances only, the existence of the rock-salt ap
 pears to be exclusively confined to the southern or central
 plain.

il2             A  Sketdi of the Natural History bf
    The marl beds form the most peculiar feature in the al
 luvial strata of the Cheshire plain.      These occur in great
 abundance in everv part of the district ; being found not
 only under the common soil, but occasionally, as on the
 borders of Delamere Forest, interposed between layers of
 sandstone rock.        The Cheshire marls are also very fre-
            met with in large detached masses, twenty or thirty
  eet in thickness, in the working out of which, it is not
 Sjuently
 unusual to find large assemblages of fragments of the older
 rocks.     Portions of granite, often of large size, and show
 ing  on   their surface evident marks of attrition, are among
 the most common appearances in these collections : no
 granitic rocks are found within fifty or sixty miles of this
 district.
    The divisions which I have pointed out in the Cheshire
 plain are still further marked by the course of the streams
 in this tract of country.     The Dee is the great river of the
 western plain ; the Weaver and its subordinate streams re
 ceive all the waters of the southern division ; while the
Mersey and its tributaries do the same in the northern por
tion. From their local relation to the great beds of rock-
salt, the streams of the southern or central plain possess a
 peculiar importance.
    The Weaver rises in the. Peckforton Hills, near the
Shropshire border, runs for some milus towards the south
east, then making a sudden flexion to the north, continues
in this direction, by Nantwich and Winsford, to North
wich, about thirty miles further.        Here it takes a north
westerly course to Frodsham, where it expands into a sandy
aestuary, connected with the channel of the Mersey.           It
receives its principal accessions at Northwich, where it is
joined by the united streams of the Dane and Weelock
from the south-east, -and by a stream called Wilton-Brook
from the east.      At Anderton, ^ little below Northwich, the
valley, which has hitherto been comparatively wide and flat,
is suddenly contracted by the approach of two rangesof
high ground ; that on the western side of the river con
necting itself by a gradual rise with the heights of Delamere
Forest; the opposite one passing by a series of irregular
elevations into the range of high land, which separates the
southern from the northern plain.         At Frodsham the river
flows, as I before mentioned, between the termination of
this high ground and that of the ridge which crosses the
county from north to south, the hills thus opposed cor
responding perfectly in appearance and structure.           We
                                                           have

                the Cheshire  Rock-Sail District.             213
have    thus two distinct contractions in the valley of the
Weaver below Northwich; a circumstance in some degree
worthy of notice.
    Situation  of the Brine Springs, Rock-Salt Mines, &c.
    I have dwelt thus minutely upon local facts from their
connection with the situation of the rock-salt, which, with
few exceptions, has yet been ascertained to exist only in
the valleys of the Weaver and its tributary streams ; in some
places manifesting its presence by springs impregnated
with salt ; in other places being known by mines actually
carried down into the substance of the strata. A reference
to the map will show the several situations "where brine
springs occur, or where mines have been sunk, in the course
of these valleys. Between the source of the Weaver and
Nantwich, it will be seen that many brine springs make
their appearance ; and in the latter part of this course, it
would seem that brine might be obtained by sinking to
some depth in any place near the banks of the Weaver.
 Proceeding down the stream, salt-springs occur again at
Winsford, and in several situations between Wmsford and
 Northwich.       At Moulton, between these two places, a
 mine has been sunk into the body of rock-salt, and another
also   between   Winsford    and  Middlewich.      At Northwich
the brine springs are very abundant, and here also many
 mines have been sunk for the purpose of working out the
 fossil salt. The springs occur again in several places further
 down the river, but none have been met with below Sal-
 tersford, about two miles from Northwich.           At Whitley,
however, two miles north of the Weaver, and six miles
 from Northwich, a body of rock-salt is stated to have been
met with in boring for coal.
    On the course of the river Wheelock, brine springs have
 been found at Lawton, Roughwood, Wheelock, and aoain
 at Middlewich, where this stream unites itself with the
 Dane.      At Lawton a mine has been sunk into the rock-
 salt. In the valley of the Dane, no salt springs actually
 appear, but several circumstances indicate that brine has
 at some former period been discovered          there, and this as
 high up the stream as the neighbourhood of Congleton.
 No springs have been found in the valley of Witton Brrok,
 except at the part of it immediately adjoining the Weaver
 at  Northwich.
     The evidences of the   presence  of rock-salt occur, as I be
fore stated, in very few   places out  of these valleys, and even

 some of the excepted instances appear to have a local rela
tion   to the southern or central plain.    This is the case with
 the salt springs of Dirtwich, in the south-western angle of
 Cheshire^ with a spring of very weak brine lately found at
Adderley, in the northern extremity of Shropshire; and
 probably also with other saline springs which occur in the
 contiguous parts of Flint and Denbighshire.         At Dunham,
however, in the north of Cheshire, we find a weak spring,
which cannot strictly be considered as coHnected with the
formations of the southern plain.        At Barton and Adling-
ton, in the southern parts of Lancashire, brine springs
likewise appear ; and it is not improbable that other in»
stances of the same kind may occur in the northern portion
of the great plain. It appears possible, however, that these
weak springs may derive their saline contents, not from
distinct subjacent beds of the fossil salt, but merely from
beds of clay or argillaceous stone, strongly impregnated
with particles of the muriate of soda.

    Tt would be   foreign to the object of this    paper to enter
with minuteness into the natural history of      the salt springs,
or into the processes employed in the manufacture of white
salt. Those members of the Society, who may wish for
further information on these subjects, I beg leave to refer
to the Survey of Cheshire before noticed.        It may be suf
ficient here to state a few of the most general and impor
tant facts.
   The brines met with in this district are very generally
formed by the penetration of spring or rain waters to the
upper surface of the rock-salt, in passing over which they
acquire a degree of strength, modified by several circum
stances, which it would be needless to detail.        Their aver
age    strength, however,   appears  io  be  much    greater  than
that of the springs met with in Hungary, Germany, or
France       At Winsford, Northwich, Anderton, Lawton,
Roughwood, Wheelock, and Middlewich, where all the
principal salt works are situated, the brine springs contain
between 25 and 26 per cent, of the pure miniate of soda j
and in some of the springs at Anderton, the proportion
stands as high as 26 566 per cent, a very near approach to
the perfect saturation of the brine.       The earthy salts held
in solution together with the muriate of soda are principally
muriate of magnesia and sulphate of lime; the quantity of
these varying from       per cent, to 2 or to 2£ per cent, in dif

ferent springs.       The brine being pumped out of the pits,
is first conveyed into large reservoirs, and afterwards drawn
off as it is wanted, into evaporating pans, made of wrought
iron.    Here heat is applied in a degree determined by the
nature of the salt intended to be manufactured, and various
additions are made to the brine, with a view either to assist
the crystallization of the muriate of soda, or to promote
the separation of the earthy salts.          The latter exist in a very
small proportion in the manufactured salt, and cannot be
supposed in any degree to affect the uses to which it is ap
plied *.     The importance of the Cheshire salt manufacture
will be sufficiently obvious from the statement, that besides
the salt made for home consumption,                      which annually
amounts to more than 16,000 tons, the average of the
quantity sent to Liverpool for exportation has not been less
than 140,000 tuns.

                            To  Mr. Tilloch,
Sir,    A    great deal having lately been written and said
about the error in the Nautical Ephemeris for 1812, but
very little towards assisting the public in correcting this
trifling mistake, I flatter myself some of your readers will
not be displeased at having an easy and, expeditious mode
of correcting the Sun's Declination as given in the Ephe
meris ; this being the part most affected by having as
sumed an erroneous apparent obliquity of the ecliptic in
the calculation of that work.
   The following small table of corrections I do not claim
as my own ; 1 found it in the Connoissance des Terns for
 1812, where they also give the formula of its construction.
   The correction is for every third degree of declination,
and for one second of difference in the real and assumed
obliquity of the ecliptic.        All that is requisite to the appli
cation of the following table is to multiply the tabular
number by the difference between the real and assumed
 obliquity.
    The difference between the real obliquity and that as
sumed in the computation of the Ephemeris for 1812, is
supposed to be about 8" too little.
   * In reference to the chemical character of the different varieties of salt,
an eacellent paper by my friend Dr. Henry will be found in the Philosophi
cal Transactions for the year 1910, part i.

                            To    Mr. Tilloch.
Sir,    The     common watch, which is so extremely useful
in   the day, is   of very little use in the dark. To remove this
imperfection, a watch was invented which repeats the hour
and quarters at any time of the day or night.               Watches of
this construction are exceedingly convenient, but they are
too expensive for general use; and all other instruments
contrived to answer the same purpose, that have come
under my inspection, though less expensive are less con
venient.
    After many unsuccessful attempts to construct an in
strument to supnly the place of a repeating watch, at a
small expense, and that might be equally useful, I found that
a common watch with a very little alteration would answer
the purpose perfectly well.
    To make a common watch into a nocturnal one, I made
notches with a file in the rim of its inner case, against every
hour upon the dial, except 3, 6, 9, and 12. These tangible
marks are made no deeper than just to receive the nail of
the finger or thumb, as it is drawn over them.               The hour
of 12 is known by the pendant, and little pins are fixed into
the case at the hours of 3, 6, and 9, projecting outwards
                                                                  about

ibout ^- of             an inch,          to distinguish    those hours from the
rest.
   To ascertain the time in the dark by this watch, nothing
more is to be done, than to open the glass and feel with
the finger the situation of the hour hand, and count the
tangible marks, beginning at 3, 6, 9, or 12, to find the
hour ; and by the same means the minutes are found.
   By a watch of this construction, the time may be ascer
tained in the dark to a much greater degree of precision
than by a repeater, and without disturbing the repose of
any person that may be near it.

An Essay on Ike Probability Sensation in              of'                 Vegetables.
  By J. P. Tupper, F.L.S. and Member                                  of   the Royal
   College         ofSurgeons.               London     :   White   and   Co. Fleet-
   Street,        pp. 142.
We have      read this Essay with    degree of pleasure which
                                                       a
induces us to make the Philosophical Magazine one of the
organs of its publication.    The work embraces      variety of           a
subjects, on which the author has offered such observations,
as evidently show that he       capable of thinking for him
                                                 is
self.  The language      simple, yet elegant and perspicuous,
                                      is
free from technical obscurity on the one hand, and affected
embellishment on the other.
   Mr. Tupper begins his Essay with the following intro
ductory observations, to which he has prefixed        very ap             a
propriate quotation from Armstrong, as       motto            a

machine, cannot observe without admiration its wonderful

  plicate a form, every part of which is most exquisitely
 finished, anil the whole so well and skilfully arranged, as to
  constitute a being capable of giving existence to others
  similar to itself.
     " Although the vegetable physiologist may not have
 more to engage his attention, yet, he has not less to admire.
 How widely and wonderfully different rs the mature vegeta
 ble from the seed which gave it being !   How great the con
 trast between the diminutive acorn and the stately forest
 oak !    The seed is seemingly nothing more than a mere
 homogeneous substance; but, when placed within the in
 fluence and operation of particular causes, its latent vital
 principle is called forth into action, a variety of organs are
 unfolded, and by successive evolutions the plant arrives at
 that state which constitutes the perfection of its nature,
 when, like animals, it is also endued with the power of
 propagating its species."
     The Author then proceeds to consider " of the DistincT
 lions between Animals and Vegetables," and next takes
 " a general view of their analogies," on which subject he
 points out many interesting particulars.     After this, follow
some observations on " Vegetable Motion" and on " In
stinct and Volition," in the course of which Mr. T. has
 thrown out some very interesting and original ideas. -The
other subjects treated of are arranged in the following order:
" Of vegetable Instinct. Of the Sleep of Plants. Of Sleep
in general.  Of Sleep as related to the voluntary Power. 
Of the locomotive Power.  Of Sensation in general.  Of
vegetable Irritability.  Of the nervous System of Vegeta
bles.  Of vegetable Sensation.  Objections considered. 
Animals are exposed to Injuries.  Of the Limits prescribed
by Na'ure to the Destruction of Life.  Of vegetable Self-
preservation.  Organs of Defence in Vegetables.  Effluvia
of Plants a Protection from external Injuries.  Of the Pre
servation of animal and vegetable Life.  Of the Enjoyment
of Life.  Of the Limits between the animal and the vege
table Creation.  Conclusion."
     The Author has also enlarged on some of the abovemeh-
tioned subjects under the head of Additional Observations,
which are chiefly of a metaphysical nature, and display
much ingenuity of argument, although some of the opinions
advanced may be open to dispute.        On the subject of In
stinct he concludes by observing,      " From this view of
the subject we may form some idea how far instincts may
supply any deficiency of intellectual power, and even com
pensate for the total want of reason in the brute creation.
                                                             But

But where shall     we find any power, or quality, as a substi
tute for sensation ?      The idea of instinct is naturally asso
ciated with that of    life, and the idea of both, either jointly,
or separately,   with that of sensation; and as sensation does
exist in animals independently of those eminent attributes
with which it is combined in our natures as rational agents,
may we not reasonably infer that vegetables have likewise
their share of sensitive power, and consequently the means
of enjoying their own existence ?"
    Here the Author refers to some Additional Observations
on Sensation j but as our limits will not allow us to make
any further extracts from this interesting publication, we
must beg leave to refer our readers to the work itself, and
perhaps they will give to the Author a vote of thanks for
the rational amusement which they may have enjoyed by
the perusual.

                          ROYAL   SOCIETY.
 Feb. 27.      Sir  Joseph Banks, observing the motion of a
 snake (which had recently been sent to him) along- the
 floor of his library, discovered that it was assisted in ad
 vancing by its ribs, which served the purpose of feet, the
 points of them touching the ground, and bv those means
 facilitating its motion.     The fact was made known to Mr.
 Home, who availed himself of the occasion to observe more
 minutely ihe peculiar construction of the ribs of snakes,
 and the manner they are adapted for this hitherto unob
 served purpose of moving their bodies.         The result of his
 examination was read in a short paper to the Society,
 staling the curious discovery of the President, and the ac
 curacy of his observations.
     March 5. A very long paper by Mr. Brodie was read,
  containing a minute detail of the author's additional expe
  riments of the effects of various poisons on different ani
 mals.      In one or two cases Mr. B. succeeded in recovering
  the animals by artificial respiration ; but in the great ma
 jority of his experiments he failed. It appears that the
  slight inflammation which occurs in the stomach after tak
  ing poison into it is not sufficient to occasion death, but
  that it is the palsying power of the drugs on the nervous sy
 stem and on the blood, which destroys life.        Some poisons
  in this respect are much more destructive than others j but
                                                                the

the author did not in any of his numerous experiments
 try the antidotal powers of oxygen on the system.
    March 12. A paper by Dr. Herschel on the second co
met was read.     This astronomer has been equally occupied
with what he calls the second comet, as with that of 1811:
he considers the latter, which, although much nearer the
earth, is almost invisible by the naked eye, as much older
than the former ; that it has experienced as little alteration
in its perihelion passage as our earth ; that it is opaque,
destitute of any phosphoric lummation, and shines with a
borrowed light, contrary to that of last year.        This cir
cumstance "he inferred, as it is visible only through glasses of
low magnifying powers, being seen distinct with a mag
nifier of 150 or 160, but quite confused with one of 170
times, whereas the former was seen perfectly with a glass
magnifying 700 times. The diameter of its nucleus he es
timates at 2637 miles; its chevelure extends over upwards of
six millions of miles.     According to the author's theory of
comets, by the condensation of nebulae, he imagines the
present to be much more condensed and perfect than the
preceding one, and looks forward to its attaining all the
other characters of a habitable planet.
    March 19. A paper by Dr. Henry of Manchester, il
lustrative of a former paper by this chemist on oxymuriatic
gas, was read.     He decomposed by electricity muriatic acid
gas  into hydrogen and oxymuriatic gas, and produced wa
ter by electrizing muriatic acid gas mixed with oxygen. He
considered his experiments on the whole as favourable to
professor Davy's theory, but did not attempt to decide po
sitively on the subject.    He observed, however, that the
greater   number    of facts  seemed to favour Mr. Davy's
views.
    Two mathematical papers by Mr. Knight were communi
cated to the Society through the medium of Mr. Davy. They
were of a nature not to be read, but of considerable length,
accompanied with tables and diagrams illustrating the at
traction of planes.    The Society then adjourned over two
Thursdays, on account of the holidays, till the 9th of April.

    Mr. Davy's    Lectures on the Elements of Chemical
                          Philosophy.
   Mr. Davy's sixth lecture was delivered on Saturday, the
?9th of February.      It related to radiant or ethereal sub
                                                       stances,

stances, those forms of matter which are known only in
motion, and by their effects, and which cannot be weighed
or measured.     The well known agencies of radiant matter
are of three kinds  ist, those agencies which produce vi
sion  2d, those which occasion heat  and 3d, ihose which
occasion chemical changes.       If a beam from the sun, said
he, be passed through a prism, it is separated into rays
which produce different colours, such as red, orange, yel
low, green, blue, and violet ; and into rays which produce
heat, and rays which occasion particular chemical effects :
the invisible rays which produce heat, are more refrangible,
and those which occasion chemical changes, less refrangi
ble, than the coloured rays. Rays that produce heat and
light, and probably chemical effects, are disengaged in the
combustion of bodies; and rays that produce heat, seem lo
be constantly emitted by bodies at the surface of the earth,
but in quantities smaller as their temperatures are low. Mr.
Davy exhibited an experiment in which gunpowder was
 fired in the focus of a mirror placed at ten or twelve feet
from a small pan of charcoal;  and another experiment in
which there was an apparent radiation of cold from ice, but
which he explained by stating, that ice radiated less heat
than the air which it displaced.     Metallic vessels, he said,
as Mr. Leslie had shown, radiate less heat than porcelain
or glass vessels, and hence they are more fitted for preserv
 ing liquids or meats hot ; pipes for heating rooms, he said,
 should be polished, where they are intended to retain heat,
and covered with black paint or varnish where they are in
tended to give it off.    He referred to the analogy between
 the powers of radiant matter and electrified bodies : the most
 refrangible rays in the coloured spectrum are analogous in
 their powers to those of positive electricity ; the least refran
 gible rays to those of negative electricity.          Mr. Davy
seemed inclined to adopt, in preference to all other views
 respecting radiant matter, those of Newton. This creat
 man supposed them to be particles emitted from bodies
 having certain figures possessed of attractions and repul
 sions.   But, said Mr. Davy, we are still in the infancy of
 this branch of science, which promises in its extension to
 connect together mechanical and chemical philosophy, and
 to afford simple and sublime principles to this part of
 science.    The agencies exerted by radiant matter, said Mr.
 Davy, produce a number of important effects in Nature,
 and, by their relations to vision, give as it were a language
 to the external world :  without this effect, said he, we
 should be limited to our own globe; but by its means we
                                                                are

the universe, to pass from our transient and temporary ex
istence, to laws which' appear eternal in their operation
 to recognise one order in the immensity of space  and to
 indulge hopes, that in the future progression of our being,
 we shall behold fully that magnificent system, which we
 now see darkly and at a distance.
    Mr. Davy delivered his seventh lecture on Saturday the
 7th instant.     The ideas of the ancients concerning the ele
 ments of matter were founded upon superficial observation
of the great forms of Nature, and were rather poetical than
 philosophical. Water, air, earth and fire were supposed to be
 unalterable : principle, or matter, was considered as consti
 tuted by solid, indestructible atoms, as in the School of
Epicurus ; or by regular solids, as among the Pythagorean
philosophers.      The alchemists considered the rude results
 of their operations by fire, as the principles of things;
 salts, oils, phlegm, and sulphurs were the elements which
 they imagined.       All these ideas are discarded by modem
chemists, who do not pretend to define what bodies are
 really unchangeable, or the true elements in nature, and
 speak of compound and simple bodies merely in relation to
 their own knowledge.         The methods by which chemical
 truths are gained, are analytical or synthetical ; by analysis
bodies are resolved into simpler forms of matter ; by syn
thesis ihey are composed from their constituents; and the
test of the accuracy of the process is the correspondence in
 weight between the compound and its constituents.           By
the application of weight and measure to chemistry, says
Mr. Davyj its results are rendered certain and unchange
able, and independent of any alterations of theory and it
is placed, like astronomy, within the province of the science
of numbers and quantity. Mr. Davy divided the sub
stances not yet decompounded, into two great classes 
supporters of combustion and inflammable bodies.         In the
first class, he said, there were only two substances as yet
known  oxygen and chlorine.          He devoted the remainder
of the lecture to the demonstration of the property of the
former.     The ga3 forms one-fifth of the air of the atmo
sphere,   and  is the principal necessary for combustion and
respiration.     In its pure form it produces a number of bril
liant results, by acting upon inflammable bodies ; the me
tals burn in it brilliantly and absorb    it,andit   is consti
                                                          a
tuent part of most acids and alkalies.       Mr. Davy showed
a  beautiful experiment,in     which the same oxygen,         by
                                                          being
combined with sulphur, formed an acid, and       by  being abs

traded from the sulphur by potassium, which took place
with vivid combustion, formed an alkali.            Mr. Davy en
tered into some general views respecting the manner in
which the oxygen of the atmosphere, and that dissolved in
water, were renovated. Oxygen is absorbed, and carbonic
acid is produced, in the respirations of animals, in combus
 tion, and* in fermentation ; vegetables in the sunshine ab
sorb carbonic acid and evolve oxygen.            Mr. Davy com
bated the idea that this function of vegetable life was not
sufficient to supply oxvgen equivalent to that consumed.
There is no other mode known in which carbonic acid is
decomposed in the processes of nature ; and did not vege
                  it,
tables absorb     it   must be constantly accumulating; which
is  known not to be the case.       A great part of the solid sur
face of the globe        covered with plants, and light
                           is                               essen  is
tial to their healthy growth       and therefore great quantities
                                       ;
of oxygen are produced in countries where there               littleis
animal life.      Fishes, he stated, will live in confined por
tions of water containing aquatic plants, and the oxygen
they absorb      iscompensated for           by
                                         the plants, which de
compose the carbonic acid afforded in their respiration.

nature  proves to us that the meanest weed, the most

    carried into the waters, dissolved               by
                                                 rain, mists, and
dews  the sea        kept in agitation by waves and tides, and
                      is
its influence upon the air constantly exerted  the storm
and the whirlwind assist in this beneficent ministration                     ;
and the harmony displayed in such diversified combinations
offers  a  striking instance of the wisdom and perfection of
the arrangements connected with the preservation of life in
the system of the globe.
    The eighth lecture of Mr. Davy was delivered on Satur
day, March 14         ; was devoted to the consideration of the
                           it
nature, properties, combinations, and uses of chlorine, or
oxymuriatic gas. Some experiments were also made on
cnchlorine,  a    gas recently discovered bv the Professor.
    The illustrious Scheele discovered chlorine in 77-*, and   1
he considered     it as an undecompounded body.         Soon after
Lavoisier and Berthollet regarded        as  itcompound of mu
                                                     a
riatic acid gas and oxygen, and their views were embraced
 by   all the chemists in Europe; and during          period of 30
                                                          a
                                                                         years

  224                   "Royal Institution.
   ears no doctrines     in chemistry were considered as more!
   appily elucidated, or more clearly established.
     Mr. Davy, -after a rigid examination of the evidences on
 which the opinions of the French chemists were founded,
 was compelled, to reject them as false ; and the new theory
 he has advanced, relative to the nature of chlorine and mu
 riatic acid gas, has been generally embraced, though some
 chemists in France and Scotland still adhere to the old ex
 ploded doctrines.
    The Professor illustrated his views by simple statements
 of facts and experiments. Water is formed from the union
 of oxygen and hydrogen; When hydrogen and chlorine
 are detonated together, according to M. Berthollet, a com
 pound of muriatic acid and water should be the result; but
 when proper precautions are taken; muriatic acid gas only
 is formed.    Again, when any of the metals, as potassium,
 zinc, tin, &c. are heated in muriatic acid gas, hydrogen
 gas is evolved, and compounds are formed precisely similar
 to those obtained by heating these metals in chlorine.      By
 these simple experiments, and others of a similar kind, the
 great problem concerning the nature of muriatic acid gas is
 happily solved.
    Mr. Davy regards chlorine as an undecompounded princi
 ple analogous to oxygen ; like oxygen, it is highly negative,
 and becomes an acid by combining with inflammable mat
 ter. By no known methods can it be resolved into simpler
principles.
    Mr. Davy exhibited an experiment in which charcoal
was ignited in chlorine by Voltaic electricity, but it re
mained unchanged.          Oxygen can in no instance be ob
 tained from any of the combinations           of chlorine, but
through the medium of water, or compounds containing
oxygen ; and most of the erroneous views and reasonings
on the subject appear to depend on the presence and de
composition of water. Thus, when the compounds of
phosphorus and chlorine, and sulphur and chlorine, are
mixed with water, the acids of phosphorus and sulphur,
and the marine acid, are presently formed.
    Chlorine has a stronger attraction for certain substances
than oxygen.       This is exhibited in the case of copper, tin,
&c. which in combining with chlorine produce vivid com
bustion.     It is also shown in the facility with which chlo
rine disengages oxygen from the metals of the fixed alka
lies and earths.
    The fixed alkalies, and earthy salts, known by the name of
muriates, are in fact compounds of chlorine and metallic bases.

                     London Philosophical    Society.            225
      Mr. Davy developed some new views relative to the theory
   of hleaching. Berthollet, who first applied chlorine to this
   process, supposed that chlorine destroyed colours by losing
   its oxygen. Mr. Davy ascertained that the oxygen, which
   appears to be the true bleaching principle, is furnished by
   the decomposition of the water present. Chlorine dissolved
-  in water cannot he employed in bleaching without injuring
   the texture of the cloth, in consequence of the formation
   of muriatic acid in the process.       A compound of chlorine
   and lime is commonly employed in bleaching, but even this
   injures the fabric of the linen.     Mr. Davy has found that
   a compound of chlorine and magnesia bleaches             without
   affecting the vegetable fibres, and on his suggestion it has
   been used with success by some manufacturers in Ireland.
      Chlorine combines with oxygen, and forms enchlorine.
   Some beautiful experiments were exhibited, illustrating the
   properties of this gas.      When gently heated it was de
   composed     with  explosion, and its fine yellow colour entirely
   destroyed.      The metals, which readily burn in chlorine, are
   not affected in this gas ; but at the moment of its decom
   position by heat, they burn vividly.
      The combinations of chlorine and hydrogen, and chlorine
   and oxygen, harmonize with the doctrine of definite pro
  portions.
      These new views respecting chlorine prove the necessity
   of attending to minute experiments, and the danger of
   forming hasty generalizations.       The ideas adopted on this
  subject by     the  French   School  of  Chemistry are entirely
  gratuitous : every thing was taken for granted, nothing
  proved.      By using statical methods, the new truths are
   firmly established, and improvements in theory imme
  diately lead to improvements in the oeconomical applica
  tions of Science to the purposes of the Arts.

      This Society has been favoured with four excellent lec
   tures upon the Anatoray'of Oratorical Expression, by Mr.
  Wright, and which have engaged their meetings for the last
  month.       We shall endeavour to give a concise though cor
  rect outline    of them.
      The learned author commenced his papers by observing,
   that sensitive and intellectual endowments form the basis of
  oratorical excellence; and that good understanding and
  solid thought, happily blended, combine all that is useful
  in the character of either senator, pleader, or divine.

  sentiment by which the minds of Englishmen are so emi-
  nentlv characterized, Mr. W. alluded to the celebrated
  controversies of Lord Chatham and Sir William Pulteney,
  the disputations of Mr. Pitt and Mr. Fox, the metaphysi
  cal disquisitions of Mr. Windham, the splendid talents of
  the '* silver-tongued Murray," the transcendent abilities of
  the author of the " Sublime and Beautiful," the charac-
"
  teristic circumflexes of the inhabitants of Scotland and
  Ireland, all of which fully exemplify their quickness of
  thought and readiness of discernment.
       Having considered the rise of the liberal arts as de
  pendent upon the science of oratory, and demonstrating its
  excellence in Great Britain, he proceeded to treat of those
   particular circumstances calculated to call forth the genius
   of an orator. " It has been urged," says he, " that the
   genius of an orator cannot appear in all the fullness of its
   vigour, unless it be assisted by the concurrence of congenial
   and appropriate causes, by the fitness and plenitude of time,
   circumstance, and place.      Regard the tumults of Greece,
         I
   say hey,    and  contemplate the discords of Rome!        ft was
   this which stimulated the exertions of a Cicero : this which
   fired the. breast of a Demosthenes-  " Let us march against
   Philip!"      Jt was this which "call'd aloud on Tully's
   name and shook the crimson'd steel          that vociferated the
   cause of Freedom, Liberty, and Rome ! Contingences like
   these might have exhibited a Demosthenes or a Cicero ;
   but ** let me ask," says Mr. W. " these bold declaimers,
   whether similar chances operated on a Saul of Tarsus}" To
   pass over the advantage of an opportunity which the an
   cients did not possess, to leave for the present our sublimcr
   notions of astronomy as dictated by Sir Isaac Newton, the
   discoveries in chemistry by Priestlev, Lavoisier, Davy, and
   others, to disregard other modern discoveries, (all of which
    arc well calculated to improve the moral feeling, and to ex
    tend our general view of objects and things,) let us con
    test the science and ability of our constitutional assemblies,
    our houses of parliament, and courts of judicature.
        After copiously treating of the rise and fall of eloquence,
    in a manner which we should feel pleasure in following,
    did not the narrow limits of a journal prevent, the lecturer
    proceeded    to investigate genius and qualification.       "A
    habit of close thinking," says he,       " has ever been ac
    knowledged to be peculiar to the inhabitants of the British
    isles ; and their standard language appears to be appro
    priate lo their energy of mind."          " Quelle langite rai~
    sonn&e!"      Now, if we compare this evident disposition of
                                                                 the

the mind of Britons with the strength and judgement of
the Greeks and Latins, as philosophers, they cannot be
conceived inferior; and if we proceed further to consider
the premeditated     examples of the oratory of the latter,
rind the off-hand extemporaneous specimens of the former
in their senate and courts of law, as disputants and meta
physicians, let us see whether the modern Britons appear
far behind the Grecians or Romans ?
    To proceed : In those remote ages, to be enabled to dis
course for six, eighty or ten hours, or for a whole day, was
regarded as something worthy of trite highest admiration 1
An orator, then, (to use the language of one of Qjuincti-
lian's orators in his celebrated dialogue,) comprised a tedious
introduction, circumstantial narrative, division upon divi
sion, and subdivision upon subdivision.              All this was
certainly  wonderful,    for  it argues that  they  must have been
physically powerful     as   well  as mentally   strong; and also,
that the people must have been very fond of hearing long
specimens of premeditated oratory.           But this extreme en
thusiasm, as well as their excessive fondness for the drama,
when kings and princes descended from their sacred offices
to personify on the stage, evidently prove depravity of taste,
rather than accuracy of discernment.           On the other hand,
when we are given to understand that the tedious harangue
 of Demosthenes against his guardians served only to prove
his insufficiency, and likewise that the egotized specimens
 of Cicero in the former part of his practice did not assist
to establish his character, we give the ancients credit for
their judgement.  With us it is very different ; and what
Quinctilian insinuates concerning the orators of his day,
seems to apply in a most pointed manner in favour of our
 senatorial and legislative orators. " The auditory prescribes
 the limits of the orator's speech ; it will not wait calmly
until he pleases to return to the point; but it openly calls
 upon him, and testifies its impatience, whenever he seems
 disposed to wander from the question."
    After endeavouring to prove the progress towards perfec
 tion of this valuable attainment among the Britons, with a
 minuteness which does him great credit, he proceeded to
 recommend the application of logic and the whole circle of
 science, with the study of rhetoric in our schools of elo
 quence; without which, our orators will ever be as dry,
 sour, and morose, as the declining Romans, unassisted bylaw
  and philosophy,     were whining, mawkish,           and insipid.
 Mr. W. then decided in favour of the modern Britons as

228              London Philosophical ^Oclely.
disputants and metaphysicians, and of the Greeks and
Romans as excelling in the art of rhetoric.
   Having considered the efficacy of graceful and energetic
delivery, by which the ancients were enabled to carry the
art of oratory to unrivalled perfection, of which Gicero and
Demosthenes are striking examples, the learned lecturer
proceeded to state, that heing enabled by the exercise of
the understanding, the will and the memory, to appreciate
the whole circle of science, such a one would readily in
vent suitable arguments, and dispose them in their proper
order ; and while he remembered every bearing of the ques
tion, he could arrange, modify and round, variously every
period, and so deliver the whole with order, contrast and
nature.    The accomplished orator will avoid every extreme ;
and while he alternately moves the passions and convinces
the understanding, through the medium of the moral
sense, he will finally succeed in arresting the attention, in
spiring the mind, exciting the whole man, and impelling
him irresistibly to action.
   Further: To command attention, the orator must par
ticipate in the feelings of all around him ; in a word he
must flatter the senses of his auditory : that once accom
plished, contending or opposite opinions will be rendered
more susceptible to receive impressions of improvement ;
and however modified by affection or passion, or from
other causes, however the appearance of right and wrong
maybe altered to the intellectual faculty, the love of truth
is firmly implanted in the breast of every individual; and
consequently the mind of man, if judiciously assailed,
must be open to the entire conviction of reason.     The au
thor then spoke of elocution, and its utility in arresting
attention.    In consequence of the perverted plan of con
veying instruction in this branch of education, he con
ceived, many of the finest specimens of argumentative
writing, many of the subliniest arrangements of composi
tion, finely interwoven with sentiments of penetration and
feeling, to pass by unheeded from negligent enunciation
and delivery : after w hich he submitted an analysis of vocal
sounds, proving the human voice susceptible of five modifi
cations ; the two inflexions, the two circumflexes, and the
monotone; endeavouring also to prove, that when the mind
is tranquil, the compass of inflected and circumflccted
accentuation accords exactly with musical phenomena,
forming the substructure of " The Philosophy of Elocu
tion."
                                                        With

                 London Philosophical Society.                   229
   With this he concluded the first lecture, which had par
ticularly tor its object, to prove that in Britain there is tree
scope to exercise oratoric genius, and thatBritons are endowed
with every qualification requisite to form complete orators.
   Mr. Wright commenced his second lecture, by an in
quiry into the instinct voices or' animals, which he con
sidered as not analogous to language; proceeding from
thence to treat of sensation.       " All our sensations," says"
he,  "  are cither pleasing or painful ; and doubtless all the
passions, emotions, and sentiments, which can possibly
agitate the mind of man, are compristd in the two follow
ing, love and haired."
   Now if we observe the correspondent tones, which uni
formly accompany the expression of any particular modifi
cation or feeling of the human mind, we shall perceive
them to be commensurate to our general idea of concord or
discord.    When the felicity of miikl is diminished by the
presence   or  recollection of painful sensation, man is em
powered    to communicate     his feelings by characteristic signs
of dissonance ; and the diversified tones and pauses which
usually accompany the expression of an agitated mind,
naturally suggest the varied state of muscular exertion:
but when emotions are excited by the impression of objects
which calm and delight the imagination, in communicating
such feeling, the expression of sound, being regulated by
consonance of vibration, dwells upon the ear with pleasure
and satisfaction.
   Continuing these arguments in an elaborate manner, and
advancing well chosen examples to illustrate them, Mr.
W. made the following deduction : " that orators, speakers,
and readers, who do not display apposite expression of
earnestness and feeling in their several themes, discourses,
and specimens, must either not be. impressed with the
truth of what they are advancing, or be      ill favoured   by na
ture with the usual powers of organic association     ;   and that
they are liable not onlv to have their arguments confuted,
but. also to have their characters branded with insincerity,
vice, and falsehood."
   Having ablv delineated the character of an orator, and
having endeavoured to show, that when the organs of the
external senses were naturallv insusceptible to the various
impressions of objects, or when the clastic fibres of the
body were relaxed    by   partial or general debility in  the con
stitution, the mind could not easily be taught svmpathy
and social affection,  he advanced to another bearing of the
question, seeming to imply, that an individual may be ori-
                             P   3                          ginally

 ginally   endowed with     mental feeling,  vet from various
 causes which bring on lassitude in the muscular fibres, he
 may be incapacitated to summon up suitable powers of ex
 pression at will.
    There are few individuals who have not experienced dis
 appointment in some shape or other.       If therefore we re
 flect on the inaptitude of will or mind, which", by some
 sudden stroke of chance, has been apparently placed far
 beyond our reach, and if also we take into consideration
 the powerful stimulus which is necessary in such instances
 to give us just notions of the hope which remains of still
 accomplishing our desires, we shall then have some idea of
 the consequent Iaxitv in the muscular fibres.
    The next point which engaged attention was that most
 essential  part of the character of an orator,  modestv.
 " Without modesty," sav3 Tully, " there never was a good
 orator."    After citing Cicero's observations respecting
 himself, and adverting particularly to the Greek orators
upon this subject, Mr. W. asserted, that an orator should be
esteemed as perfectly true in his intentions towards his
audience, and that he should be known to have a warm
sense of general feeling and affection for his fellow-crea
tures ; proving an unimpeachable character to be a qualifi
 cation of all others the most essential for the preferment of
a public speaker ; and that truth, integrity, and earnestness,
are inseparably united with the art of persuasion.        This
lecture was concluded -by a view of the inconsistency of
man, and his consequent proneness to judge of the appear
ance of persons and things that he may suit his own tem
per and disposition.
    The third lecture commenced with some observations on
the philosophy of feeling, comprising affection, passion,
emotion, and sentiment ; previous to considering the out
ward attribuies;of expression.      On this head we select the
                       ,( In
following passage :          contemplating the philosophy of
feeling, I cannot but be astonished," says Mr. W., " that
writers on oratorical expression have not presented us with
more accurate definitions of the passions. Excepting <vne.
or two, all the volumes which have been handed down to
lis on the science, do not in this particular exemplify either
regularity, principle, or theory."
    " In the middle or the last century, the lecturer of ora
tory on the foundation of Erasmus Smith, esq. in Dublin,
seeined to enter fully into these ideas, when he endeavoured
to unravel perplexities which modern metaphysicians had
then thrown upon the performances of the ancients : And

  if I  am not," continues Mr. W., " insufficiently read in
  the present subject, Dr. Lawson was the first of the modem
  professors of rhetoric, who endeavoured to systematize the
  passions for the use of students in oratory.    But while this
 tribute of attention is offered to the memory of the lecturer
 of Trinity College, and to the exception of every other
 lecturer of the science, we are not to enter into the ideas
 implied in the apology of the doctor at the conclusion of
 the ninth lecture, expressly intimating, not oniy that rheto
 ricians had defined the passions imperfectly, but that mo
 ralists had fallen into similar        negligences;    that his
 ideas on the subject were completely new ; and, as such,
 the theory would be considered an innovation, and so be
  liable to censure. Now this was evidently to the exclusion
 of the disquisitions contained in the voluminous treatises of
 Dr. Hulcheson on the Passions ; the best perhaps extant:
 books which had been published only a few years before,
 and which caused controversy sufficient to produce illustra
 tions of the moral sense, and whic,h Dr. Lawson might
 possibly have perused ; books which prove to us, that there
 can be no exciting reason previous to affection, instinct, or
 the moral faculty ; and that the conscience is distinct from
 the sense of moral good and evil; and so that we may dis
cover, that what taste is to natural discernment, conscience
is to the moral sense, improved by knowledge and care."
     in pursuance of the inquiry, it may be curious perhaps
 to observe, that although         Walker and Sheridan have
descanted       with considerable feeling and energy on this
branch of the science, yet neither the one nor the other
has     satisfied    the  various inquiries   of philosophical
and interrogating        students.  In his essay on the Pas
sions, Mr. Walker has adopted the method of Mr. She
ridan,  calling the true signs of the passions, 1st tones,
2d looks and gestures.        And although the master of inflec
tion had most certainly the ability to analyse the former,
and to dwell with considerable advantage on the latter, he
consigns without definition, and leaves the student, who
feels himself deficient, to turn his studies to some other
department of learning, where nature may have been more
favourable to his wishes.       The other lecturer exerted every
energy within his power ; but unfortunately his judgement
was deficient, and his will in consequence was inadequately
directed.       Perhaps it is the circumstance of having sub
mitted imperfect ideas or definitions of the speaking voice,
which has rendered the works of Mr. T. Sheridan so totally
useless to students in elocution.       We must not feel sur
prised then, that the author of British Elocution proceeded
                                 P4                           no

no further in analysation than his lectures manifest, when
he admitted not the existence of inflexion, or that termina
tion to which all speaking sounds may be resolved. But in
dependently of inflexion, the ideas of Mr. Sheridan on tone
are insufficient.    When speaking of the Chinese language
te
    being chiefly made up of tones," and when proceeding
further in exemplification, observing that the same indivi
dual word has " sixty different meanings," according to the
different tones in which it is pronounced ; he appears to
jumble together qualities totally heterogeneal,  such as
 tune and tone, tune and accent, sound and articulation.
 Now tune refers to variety, harmony, and cadence; tone
to quality of sound, whether high or low, the natural or
 feigned voice. The lady sings chastely       (i.e. scientifically
 and  in tune), but she wants voice   (i.e. tone and compass.)
Accent implies stress variously delivered,        e. either in an
                                                 i.
 upward or downward slide of voice; or, after the term
 accent of the Greeks, we may distinguish        it    by
                                                       the names
of acute, grave, or circumflex. That gentleman has either
the Scotch or Irish accent in his pronunciation,           e. cir

cumflex. Articulation    is  sound modified    bythe various or
gans of speech.      The whole alphabet may be pronounced
or articulated in one note of music, or,    in other words, one
musical sound and vice versa, the whole compass of the
                ;
voice may be exemplified in one articulation          so that we
                                                       ;
 can perceive,    when Mr. Sheridan speaks of tone and the
tone of passion, he leaves the word just as he found            it,
                                                              and
very gravely informs the student, that tone           tone. In
                                                      is
 the analysation of speaking sounds Mr. Walker proceeded
further than the other gentleman, and we feci the more re
gret that he did not adapt his inflexions to the expression
of passion and the progress and completion of sense.
    Mr. W. then advanced      a  great number of arguments,
tending to prove,   in  the most direct manner, that Nature
has endowed man with an intuitive power of conveying
feelings of love or hatred,    by signs of consonance or dis
sonance which concluded the lecture.
           ;
    The fourth and last lecture consisted chieflv of illustra
 tions of the different passions, mostly selected from our im
mortal bard, and which were admirably delivered bv the
 ingenious lecturer, producing their proper effect       and also
                                                           :
 of   avindication of Aaron Hill's Treatise on Expression,
 as founded upon one general principle of reason and philo
 sophy.    We agree with Mr. W. in imagining, that great
advantage might possibly arise from     a well regulated theory
of the passions, should every admirer of the science apply
himself to that branch of eloquence with unremitted ob

serration and active industry : for, without an expressive
display of feeling, the orator is, at best, but lifeless mar
ble.     From the writings of the ancients, we must suppose
Iherq to have been complete masters of expression.           They
appear to have felt themselves impressed with just notions of
the assistance afforded to their specimens, by duly appreciat
ing and considering the passions as the secret springs of all
the actions of man.
     In conclusion, we think great praise is due to Mr. Wright
for his ingenious lectures, and from whose indefatigability
in this department of science many more highly instructive
lessons may be justly anticipated.
                    BUSSELL INSTITUTION.
                            Geology.
     On February 24th Mr. Robert Bakewell commenced a
course of lectures on the natural history of the earth, and
its mineral productions, designed to illustrate the Geology
 and Mineralogy of England.        In the first lecture, after ad.
verting to the present state of geological science, Mr. Bake-
well observed, that it might be considered in its infancy,
 compared with the progress which other sciences had made
 during the last 300 years; nor had it attracted much atten
tion from landed proprietors who were most interested in
 its advancement, their knowledge of the" rocks, strata, or
 minerals on their own estates being in few instances greater
 than that of their ancestors in the ruder periods of our hi
 story. All the substances now considered as simple, found
 in the mineral kingdom, do not exceed fifty : with nearly
 one half of these, Mr. Bakewell stated, we had only been
 made acquainted during the last twenty or thirty years ; a
 fact which was itself alone sufficient to mark the infancy of
 the science.
      The form, magnitude, and density of the earth, and its
 revolution on its axis, are the first objects of inquiry in the
 natural history of our planet, connected with its internal
  structure. The experiments and observations of Dr. Maske-
 lyne and Mr. Cavendish, relative to the density of the earth,
  Mr. Bakewell observed, differed considerably in their re
 sults.    From the recent corrections of professor Playfair,
 who had ascertained the specific gravity of the stones form
  ing the mountain Shehallion on which Dr. Maskelyne's
  observations had been made, it appeared that the density of
  the earth, or the quantity of matter it contained, is nearly
  five times that of an equal bulk of water.         From hence

t34                     Russell Institution.
Mr.    Bakewell said it might be inferred that the earth is
rearly   a solid ball, or, if it have extensive cavities, the solid
 parts are heavier than most metallic substances, and proba
 bly contain a very large portion of iron.         The opinion
 which has been lately advanced, that the different earths
 and alkalies exist in a metallic state in the interior of our
 planet, and inflame when water finds access to them, was,
 he conceived, ingenious, but unsupported by much proba
 bility.
    The division    of rocks into primary, intermediate or
 transition rocks, and secondary, though liable to some ob
jections, Mr. B. said he should follow in the present course,
 as such an arrangement enabled us to fix more distinctly
 the different parts of the subject in the memory.
    Each of these divisions he said would be described in the
 future lectures, and he traced on a geological map of En
gland, drawn for the purpose, the different parts of our
island which they occupy.          On the eastern side this divi
 sion is more distinctly marked ; but on the western side the
strata are much fractured and intermixed by some unknown
 cause, which had elevated them in some situations and de
 pressed them in others, and made ii difficult to trace their
 continuity or connexion.       According to this division, there
is a considerable part of the eastern side of our island in
which no coal is found, and a still larger division which he
traced where no metallic ores exist. Mr. Bakewell said
 that, so far as he knew, this was the first attempt to repre
 sent in a map the geological outlines of England.
    After explaining the different theories of the earth, by
diagrams and descriptions, Mr. Bakewell observed, that
they were only entitled to consideration so far as they ap
pealed to facts for their support, and every impartial ob
server of nature must have seen appearances which cannot
be explained satisfactorily by any of the systems hitherto
advanced. The great changes which the surface of our
planet has undergone in remote ages, are confirmed by
proofs equally intelligible and impressive, though we are
unacquainted with the means by which such changes have
 been effected.    Rocks composed of shells and remains of
marine animals form the summits of some of the highest
mountains of Craven in Yorkshire, in Derbyshire, and in
different parts of the world.      The height at which these are
found in Yorkshire is 2400 feet above the present level of
the sea, but on the Pyrenees they are found at the height of
 10,000 feet.    The impressions of marine animals in slate
locks present appearances still more curious and difficult to
                                                          explain.

                      Russell Institution.                235
explain.     Marine remains are also found imbedded in rocks
at the greatest depths which have been explored.       No re
mains of man have been found in solid fock, except in
mines, or what had been covered by recent depositions of
calcareous earth ; of which specimens were shown.         The
skeletons of quadrupeds found in mines and cavities of cal
careous rock, lie considered as recent, compared with the
marine remains of which such rocks were composed. The
entire skeleton of an elephant was found in a mine near
Wirksworth. Mr. Bakewell supposed that, in this instance,
a cave, once open to the day, had been closed by stalacti-
tical formations ; which is frequently the case. From these
fossil remains in the mineral kingdom, Mr. Bakewellsaid
it might be inferred, that the creation of man was posterior
to that of other animals, and took place long after those
mighty convulsions which elevated part of our present
lands and continents from the bottom of the ocean.
    Second Lecture.  Mr. Bakewell described the qualities of
the four earths, silex, clay, lime and magnesia, which,
with the oxide or rust of iron, compose all the great masses
of matter found on the surface of our globe. In some in
 stances they are combined with the sulphuric or carbonic
«cids. These few elements entering into combinations with
each other, constitute the great variety of stones found in
 the mineral kingdom ; and it was not difficult for a person
 entering on the study of mineralogy to ascertain the earths
 whose qualities were most predominant in each kind of rock.
The rocks called primary contain no organic remains, they
 are chiefly composed of siliceous earth (except primitive
 limestone), they are generally hard and crystalline.        Of
 these the most important is granite, being considered by
 many geologists as the foundation rock on which all the
 others are laid. Next to granite are usually found the differ
 ent slate rocks, known by the names of gneiss, and micaceous
 and argillaceous schist: of these specimens were exhibited,
 and their nature and localities described. Mr. Bakewell, in
 stating the different parts of England and Wales where
 the primary rocks appear, said, it had been erroneously as
 serted that there are no granite rocks in Cumberland and
 Westmoreland ; on the contrary, there are in both these
 counties, rocks of highly crystalline large-grained granite,
 of which he produced specimens. Most of the other rock3
 palled primary, generally exist in beds of different depths
 amongst the slate rocks, or cover them in vast masses, and
 which appear to have been of more recent formation.
    The arrangement of rocks in the primary mountains of
                                                         Great

236                    Russell Institution.
Great Britain, and different parts of Europe and America,
were explained by drawings and sections.           The highest
point at which granite is found in Europe is 15,000 fret ; in
South Amejica granite has not been observed higher than
 1 1,000 feet ; but in that country the granite and slate rock9
are covered with immense beds of porphyry and basalt,
which Mr. Bakewell said he was inclined to believe were
the products of subterranean fires.      The rocks that lie next
to the primary have been called transition rocks, from a
fanciful supposition that they were formed when the earth
was passing from an uninhabitable to a habitable state.
These principally consist of particular lime rocks, and a
rock called by the Germans grauwacke, which is a kind of
coarse slate intermixed with fragments of other rocks.
These lime rocks form entire mountains in Yorkshire, Der
byshire, and part of North Wales.          Mr. Farey, in his late
survey of Derbyshire, has described the undermost lime
stone of that county as the lowest rock in England; but
Mr. Bakewell observed, that the same limestone which
dips under the surface in the northern part of Derbyshire
rises up again in the north-west of Yorkshire, and is there
found to rest upon slate.     In Shropshire and Wales similar
limestone with similar metallic veins also rests upon slate,
and this slate in all probability rests upon granitic rocks,
though the granite is not sufficiently elevated to be seen,
except on the western verge of England and Wales.            The
primary and first order of secondary rocks are the reposi
tories of metallic ores.    In the lime rocks of this class the
most extensive caverns are found, some of which were de
scribed with sections, explaining their formation by subter
ranean currents,       Mr. Bakewell stated the influence of
elevated mountains on the temperature of the adjacent
countries, which, he observed, might in some degree be
measured by the period at which snow disappears from their
summits.      In some few instances, he said, snow had con
tinued the whole year on the summit of Crossfell in Cum
berland. The influence of mountain scenery even over the
untutored mind was in many nations almost indelible, and
created a strength of local attachment which was not known
to exist in the inhabitants of flat and more fertile districts.
The lecturer particularly recommended to the opulent in
habitants of large cities, an occasional residence among the
mountains ; where he observed they might contemplate the
grand features of creation, and revive their taste for the
sublime beauties of nature ; and from whence they could
pcarcely fail to return with invigorated health, and with a
                                                          certain.

  March       6.  Sir George Clerk, Bart. M.P. was elected an
ordinary     member      of the Society : and several presents of
books were announced.
     An additional notice by Arthur Aikin, Esq. See. Geo.
Soc. respecting a green waxy substance found in the alluvial
soil near Stockport, was read.
     The purport of this notice was to mention the discovery
of a similar substance at the foot of the hill of Menil
Montant near Paris, by M. Patrin.             It there occurs in al
luvial sand accompanied by fresh- water shells.
     A communication addressed to the Secretary by the
Hon. Henry Grey Bennet, M.P. respecting a whin dyke in
Northumberland,          was read.
     The dyke here described is best seen at Beadnel-Bay,
where it forms a kind of pier about 27 feet wide and 300
yards long.         It rises in a perpendicular position through
 several beds of stratified rocks, without occasioning any
 change in their dip or direction.         But the qualities of the
 different strata where they are in contact with the dyke,
 differ very notably from those exhibited by the same strata
 at a little distance from the dyke.        The limestone in par
 ticular of both the beds that are cut through, is harder,
 more granular and sparry in the vicinity of the dyke, and       is,
 further, incapable of being burnt into good lime.
      The reading of Mr. Phillips's paper on the native oxide
 of tin of Cornwall, was continued.
      Before entering into the crystal lographical history of this
 substance, Mr. P. makes some remarks on the kind of cry
  stals best adapted for goniometrical researches, and states
 his reasons for preferring the more minute crystals to the
  larger ones, and the reflecting goniometer of Dr. Wollas-
  ton to that in common use.           He then proceeds to state the
  means  by     which   he  succeeded in obtaining fractures exhi
  biting    the  structure  of the crystal from which
                                       ;                it   appears

the Society; and     several  presents   of books  and  minerals
were announced.
    The reading of Mr. Phillips's paper on the native oxide
of. tin of Cornwall, was concluded.
    After describing the primitive figure of this substance,
Mr. P. proceeds to an enumeration and description of those
modifications with their varieties which have been observed
by him, and specimens of which are at present in his ca
binet.
    After describing twelve modifications, the paper con
cludes with details of those compound crystals usually called
macles j of the still more compound ones which are formed
by the junction of two macles, and of the most complicated
of all, which are macles of macles.
    A description of Castle Hill near Newhavcn in Sussex,
by Hen. Warburton, Esq. Ord. Mem. Geo. Soc. was read.
    Castle Hill is a small circular elevation composed of
nearly horizontal beds, lying above the chalk in the fol
lowing order, beginning from the most recent :
    1. Sand and rounded flint pebbles.
    2. A congeries of oyster shells.
    3. A bed of broKen bivalve shells, chiefly of the genua
Venus.
    4. A  bed of blue clay inclosing a seam of martial      py
rites three or four inches   thick, composed entirely of   casts
of bivalve  and turbinated    shells.
    5. A  bed of indurated mar),      the lower part of which is
obscurely slaty, and contains between its laminae, leaves
apparently of some tree of the willow tribe converted into
coal.
    6. A seam of coal three or four inches thick.
    7. Marl of a sulphur yellow colour, including large cry
stals of gypsum.
    8. Sand,
    g. Chalk.
    A notice respecting an accidental sublimation of silex,
by Dr. M'Culloch, Ord. Mem. Geo. Soc. was read.
    A mixture of the oxides of tin and lead was put into an
earthen crucible, and covered by another inverted over it :
the mass was exposed to a high heat, and on opening the
crucibles the empty part of each of them was found lined
with capillary shining crystals; which by the usual me
thods of analysis proved to be pure silex.

    At the meeting of this Society on the 18th of Jaunary,
Professor Jameson read a paper on porphyry, in which he
described several species of transition-porphyry,     as occur
ring along with grey-wacke, &c. in different parts of Scot
land. He also gave a particular account of flcelz porphyry,
which likewise occurs in Scotland, and appears to belong
to the old red sandstone formation.       The Professor conjec
tured that this flcetz porphyry may be the mother- stone of
the porphyritic felspar lavas which are found in some coun
tries, and consequently that lavas may occur in rocks of an
older date than those of the newest floetz-trap series.  At
 the same meeting, Mr. E.W. Leach read a description of two
 species of shark found in the Scottish seas, illustrative of
 a proposed subdivision of the genus Squalus of Linnajus.
    At the meeting on the 1st of February, a communication
 from Lieutenant-colonel Imrie was read, containing an ac
 count of the district of country in Stirlingshire called the
 Catnpsie Hills, illustrated by some curious geological facts
 observed by the Colonel on {he coast of the Mediterranean.
 The Campsie Hills consist of trap-rocks of great thickness,
 under which sandstone occurs ; and below this lie beds of
 limestone, with slate-clay, clay-ironstone, and some seams of
 coal.   The trap is in some places distinctly columnar, and
 in many other places it shows a tendency to this form. He
 observed, that these circumstances might give occasion to
 some geologists to class the trap of the Campsie district
 with volcanic products ; of which, however, he saw no
 symptom.      He then pointed out, that nature produces
 these forms both in the moist and in the dry way, and
 gave examples of both.       In the moist way, he said that
 these forms are seen in greatest perfectio.. in warm climates,
 and drew his example in this mode from the coast of Africa,
 near the site of ancient Carthage ; where a small lake, with
 a deep clay bottom, had been drained by the accidental
 breaking down of a part of its barrier, and where the clav
  deposit had split into vertical columns eighteen feet high,
  and from a foot and a half to three feet in diameter.     The
  example in the dry way he took from the island of Fela-
  cuda, one of the most western of the Lipari islands.        In
  the lavas of that island which have taken the columnar
  form, he mentioned having seen obsidian and pumice,
  which had been in flow with the lava, and are seen com
  bined in what he termed one of its congealed streams.

Methods     for definite integrals, and their application       to pr&~
    labilities, and particularly to the investigation of the mean
    which must he fixed upon, among the results of observa
    tions. By Count Laplace.
    The theory of Probabilities is one of those to which M.
Laplace has directed his attention since his entrance upon
his career as an analytical philosopher, and to which at
different periods he has made many valuable additions. Be
sides several important memoirs, which he has published
in the volumes of the Academy of Sciences, or of the In
stitute, he has elucidated the subject also in his lectures at
the Normal school, in his Systeme du Monde, &c.
    Thus by "extending his information, and by the clear ac
count which he has given, he has enabled every person to
form an idea of the most profound part of the mathemati
cal sciences.
    The publication to which we now refer is particularly
adapted to geometricians who are sufficiently advanced in
that science to understand count Laplace's Analyse Sa-
vante.      It is a sufficient eulogium on that work to mention
that the Academy of Sciences announced its title, but left
its merits to be determined by those who peruse it ; and we
are under the necessity of following their example.                   Of
the two branches which distinguish this new work of count
Laplace, the first is merely- a short historical introduction,
from which no abbreviation can be made without rendering
it obscure and incomplete : in this part we find some novel
observations respecting the existence of different branches
of the modern analysis, especially the passages relating to
finite and infinite, and also to real and imaginary quan
tities.
    The second division of the work shows that all analytical
researches are easier unravelled than extracted.
    The author confesses that he has reserved various demon
strations on the subject for a work which it is his inten
tion to publish very soon, on Probabilities.              We cannot

do better than conclude by giving this information, which
assuredly will excite the curiosity or' all geometricians. If
amongst the applications which Count Laplace makes of'
his formulae, we perceive a point which concerns two ce
lebrated analytical philosophers, it certainly should find a
place in the present sketch.
    It is that passage in which Count Laplace mentions
small squares (pet its carreer).        He says that the method
proposed        l>y
               Messrs. Legend re and Gauss corrects the ele
ments in the most precise manner.          The learned who have
not met .with these works,                probable may wish to

have already gained so much honour             their labours.      hy
     M. Legendre, when he directed his attention to the pro
blem of the comet, in March 1805, first furnished astrono
mers with      certain rule to guide them in their number of
                a
approximative equations, much superior to those unknown,
quantities the value of which        was left them to ascertain.
                                                it
   The inevitable error of the observation on which the
equations are established, renders          impossible to explain
                                                              it
them all at once, and          taking the result of the system of
                                     in
the observations       does not give more explicit satisfaction;
                           it
all that can be gained is, that the errors are as trifling as
 possible  that they are equally distributed  and that none
of them exceed the probable errors of the observations. To
 approach nearest to the real value, M. Legendre proposes                            a
 principle     which the sum of the squares of the errors
                by
 must be    aminimum.
   This method, which he only mentions without giving the
analyses of       he has made the subject of an Appendix at
                  it,
 the end of his Memoir, and in which he gives some further
developments.              his opinion, that of all the principles
                           It   is
proposed on this subject, there are none more general, more
exact, or more easily to be applied. By this means, he con
tinues, there       established
                      is           amongst the errors      kind of          a
equilibrium which prevents the extremes, from being pre
valent.
  If   by  any singular event       were possible to obliterate all
                                           it
 the errors, he shows that       could only be done infallibly

                                     is
    If after having determined the unknown quantities we
carry the value of them into each of the equations, instead
of seeing them reduced to zero in general we shall find
                                                     ;                              a
value which will be for each of the observations, the errors
of the elements corrected, and            impossible to diminish

     M. Lesrendre next proves that the rule by which a mean
 may be obtained from the result of different observations,
 arises from a very simple principle of the smaller squares.
      This information is of much importance, as far as it au
 thorizes the astronomers to take the value of several hun
 dred observations lo form a final equation from them,
 which will present the means of thus uniting several groups
of particular equations, to form as manv final equations as
 may be judged proper, and applying the method of the
 small squares without engaging in endless calculations.
      This remark might of itself be considered as a sort of
 demonstration ; but afterwards, by a happy reconciliation,
 M. Legendre refers his formulas to those by which we find
 the centre of sravity of several equal masses placed around
 several given points.      He concludes that his principle in
 some measure makes known the centre, around which are
 ranged all the results furnished by experience in the neatest
 manner possible.
      To explain the method still further, after having applied
 it   to perfect the elements of his comet, he applies it to the
 last    measurement    of the meridian.    He had to determine
 the most probable flattening which resulted from the four
 arcs measured, and the correction of the 45th degree pretty
 nearly asctrtained by the members of the commission.
      These two unknown quantities must be found by keeping
 as close as possible to the five observed latitudes.
      He expresses the errors of five latitudes en fonct'ton of
 the two unknown quantities, and his method conducts
'him to a flattening (applalisscment) of -pj-g-, and to a 45th
 degree weaker than had been supposed by twelve toises and
  a half.    This flattening appeared to him to be too strong,
  and its degree too small ; but the errors of the latitudes
  scarcely exceed the errors which we may fairly' suppose to
  exist : he afterwards supposes the flattening as at      ; but
  then the errors of latitude found by his method go the
  length of 3, 4, and frequently nearly o" j which is scarcely
  credible.
       Such are the principles of M. Legendre: we take the,
  opportunity of mentioning him here, because his memoir
  having been printed in another shape, they have not named
  him in the volume of the Institute.

     Boscovich long since had it in contemplation to make
 the sum of the positive errors equal with the negative ones ;
 and all astronomers have had this object in view in the con
 struction of their tables.   He also maintained that the sum
 of errors without the distinction of signs was the least pos
 sible ; which is likewise the opinion of all astronomers:
 but to be mere certain, he gave, according to his custom, a
 graphical construction of the problem, to which a calcula
 tion may be applied when greater nicety is required.         It
 is to be observed, that he introduces the centre of gravity
 of all the extreme points of the alscisscp, which in his con
 struction represent the degrees measured : because it w&i
 also on account of the figure of the earth that he under
 took his researches.
     Count Laplace, in adopting the principal opinions of
 Boscovich, treated the same problem in a more analytical
 and more rigorous manner in the 2d vol. of his Mtcanique
 Celeste; and he was led to a flattening of -j-i-^, almost as
 great as that of M. Legendre: his 45th degree differed a
 little less from the arc adopted, and the errors of their lati
 tudes were nearly the same. Thus two methods, absolutely
 different, led to results almost identical.
     M. Gauss, in his Theory of the Motions of Celestial
 Bodies, published 1609, endeavours to determine the degree
 of probability of a system of elements for a planet from a
 considerable number of observations.        He soon meets with
 an insoluble equation, which forces him to take another
 course.     He inquires upon what function, taken tacitly as
  the base, the principle vulgarly adopted is supported, and
 what is the value of the mean result between several obser
 vations equally well made, which value is not rigorously
  exact, but only probably so? By this inverted course his
 demonstritfion is very analogous to that of M. Legendre.
     Setting out from an elegant theorem of Count Laplace,
 he arrives at a function which gives expressly the sum of
 the squares, which ought to he a minimum.            Hence he
 concludes, that the principle of the small squares has the
 same certainty with the common principle which allows the
 greatest probability to the arithmetical method.        But he
  remarks that this consequence cannot be correct but on the
 supposition that all the observations are entitled to the same
 confidence ; and in order to render the principle more
 general, he multiplies each of the squares by a co-efficient,
 which expresses the probability of the observation to which
 he refers ; and it is the sum thus modified which ought to
.be a minimum. He afterwards examines whether the eli-

mination of the unknown quantities be at all times possible,
 and by what n.ode of calculation it may be rendered practi
 cable, in certain cases in which it does not appear to be so.
 He adds, that this subject may give rise to several neat
 analytical inquiries, to enter upon which would carry him
 too far from his principal object : he postpones, therefore,
 to another occasion the methods of reducing numerical
 calculation to a more expeditious algarithm.     After the ex
 ample of M. Legendre, he entreats calculators not to seek,
in the determination of the known co-efficients, a pre
cision which can duly serve to lengthen the operations in a
useless manner.
       XXXV.      Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
              professor Leslie's discovery.
The     experiments of Professor Leslie, to produce ice by
evaporation in the air pump, have been varied and extended
in France by Messrs. Clement andDesormes: they have
proposed to apply the evaporation, in vacuo, on a large
scale, to the drying of gunpowder ; which, being done
without fire, will be attended with no danger. .
   The French chemists are engaged in endeavouring to ap
ply the evaporation in vacuo (before stated) to the drying and
preserving fruit and vegetables.    It may be easily conceived
of what advantage this process may be, particularly in the
army and navy, by preserving, unchanged, alimentary sub
stances, and also by diminishing their weight and bulk,
when they are to be sent to distant parts of the world.
    In consequence of this paragraph, we observe that Mr.
Leslie has addressed a letter to the Editor of the Caledonian
Mercury, and we can bear testimony to the truth of the
Professor's claims to the discovery ; for we personally wit
nessed the demonstration of his theory while in London
last year, when he freely explained the various important
uses to which the principle mi^ht be applied, particularly
by the introduction of the apparatus into hospitals in sultry
climates, and for its general utility in domestic purposes.
We understand that he has, since his return to Edinburgh,
improved his coolers, so as to produce ice in large quan
tities, by much inferior powers to those he first used.

XXXVl.           Description of an Improvement on La Borda's
                Reflecting Circlf. By Mr. J. Allan .
Sir,     I beg leave to inform you, that on Thursday last,                                      I
left     the Society's house, a mathematical instrument,
         at
adapted for the use of mariners, which I wish to submit to
the Society's attention.     It is a Reflecting Circle, com
monly   called La  Borda's  Circle, for the purpose of taking
altitudes and distances at sea ; and which I have greatly
improved lately, by fixing the shade glasses different to
what had heretofore been done, with some other improve
ments as a Reflecting Circle. The late Dr. Mackay, in a
publication of his called Mackay's Longitude, has a plate
of La Borda's original instrument, but the shade glasses are
so fixed, as to render the instrument useless, and which he
was convinced of on my pointing out to him the fault ;
he said he would alter his plate to my method, and that he
would state it as my improvement ; but his death soon af
terwards prevented it.    I am aware the Society do not con
fer their rewards without advantageous qualities to merit
their sanction.    I respectfully say, that 1 consider my in
strument to have merit, both in ceconomy, and in the great
improvement made on the plan of the Reflecting Circle

To C. Taylor,                M.D.    Sec.
   Sir,  Agreeably to the intimations of the Committee
on Thursday evening last, I beg leave to explain to the So
ciety, the properties of my improved Reflecting Circle ; and
which, with a Theodolite attached to         would be useful           it,
both to the mariner and surveyor.
   The Committee inquired what sort of centre or axis the
instrument had.       beg leave to state,
                               I            an improved one       it   is
of mine. The former way of centering this instrument
was only        single pin, which both indexes acted upon
                    by   a                                                                     ;
but the pin had so little bearing in the index, that     was                             it
not sufficient to keep the index-glass upright to the plane

of  the instrument in all its positions ; I have therefore con
trived to put what is caJled in our business, a male and fe
male centre or axis, upon a simple but accurate method.
    Permit ine to make a few observations on circular instru
ments in general. "J believe it will be universally allowed,
that it is easier to make a circle nearer to truth, with respect
to its horizontal plane, than it is to make a separate part of
a circle so.
    A sextant is only the sixth part of a circle, and is got flat
by means of a plane, as near as the maker can get          but             it,       is
not turned on its own axis as        circle
                                          a    thereforeis
                                                         ;  have           I
no doubt, but that the best sextant usually made,           very               is
short of the horizontal truth of sixth part of circle ;'and
                                              a                    a
if we were to suppose circle made of six of the usual sex
                                a
tants,     would be
          it             very untrue circle with respect to its
                         a
horizontal plane.
     Ithas, therefore, been    general desideratum, that
                                      a                      cir                 a
cular instrument of reflection should be introduced, of
simple construction, easy to adjust, and convenient for use.
I  have been induced to make several circular instruments
of reflection in vaYious ways, but none upon so simple                               a
construction, or so cheap, as the present, nor so well cal
culated to prove any untruth, as my improvement upon
Borda's    ;and    believe
                   I          will now be generally adopted for
                                 it
use.
   There have been great uumbers of Borda's circles made;
I myself assisted about twenty-five years ago to make many,
also since    have been in business for the last twelve years
               I
on my own account, but      never found any of them to give
                                    I
satisfaction till invented the present improvement.
                    I
   Captain M'Lennan,- who traded to South America, had
one of Borda's Circles made, similar to that described in
Dr. Mackay's Longitude, but could not use         till altered    it
by    me last   April.
     Theglasses in my instrument are moveable to any quar
ter that   aperson may wish to use      in and      taking the
                                                   it   ;          by
same angle with each quarter,       affords an opportunity of
                                              it
proving the correctness of the instrument, which circum
stance    Ihope justifies me in saying, that      the only init   is
strument of reflection that       know, so well calculated to
                                          I
prove itself.      beg pardon for being so tedious;
                   I                                    assure             I
you that can make the instrument better than can write

        Description       of an improved Reflecting Circle.        551
Description   of   the    Drawing of Mr. James           Allan's   Im
    provement      on the Reflecting Circle       of Borda.   PI. V.
  The Reflecting Circle, first invented by Tobias Mayer of
Gottingen, and afterwards improved hy the Chevalier La
Borda, of Paris, is an instrument, which in its principle
admits of such a degree of accuracy, as to be of the most
important service to navigators; but it has hitherto been
constructed in such a manner, that the inconveniences at
tending the use of it have prevented its general adoption
among seamen; any contrivances, therefore, tending to
diminish these inconveniences, were deserving of the So
ciety's notice.   The construction of Borda's circle as they
have hitherto been made, is minutely detailed in Dr. Rees's
New Cyclopaedia, article, Circle ; and the mode of using
it is there explained ; it will be therefore unnecessary to
describe   any thing more of the circle delineated in PI. V,
than is essential to the elucidation of the improvements
made by   Mr. Allan.
  The first of   these is in the mode of applying the dark
glasses,  which  are fixed on joints, so as to turn back out of
the way, in the same manner as in the sextant; in the old
instrument these glasses were fitted into sockets provided
with tenants on the indexes, and fastened by a milled head
screw, which took much time to change them ; the second
is the addition of double verniers to the index, carrying the
telescope and horizon glass ; these read upon opposite sides
of the circle, and if a difference is observed between these
readings by taking the mean of them, the error arising from
any ex-centricity the index may have, will be corrected; and
the third consists in fixing the index glass upon an axis, ac
curately fitted into the centre of the circle; by this means it
is assured that the index glass in turning round, shall always
be exactly perpendicular to the plane of the circle ; in the
old method, when the index-bar was merely fitted on a pin
fixed in the centre of the circle, it was impossible to make
the circle so perfectly flat, or keep the index so accurately
in contact with     it,
                      as     having an axis. To explain these
                              by
improvements more perfectly, the reader          referred to plate

 turned, to adjust it accurately; G is the index mirror
 screwed upon the index H, which has also a vernier, and a
 clamp and tangent screw ee, similar to the other; I is the
 handle by which the instrument is held when in use; it is
 fitted to a socket K, which is screwed to the centre of the
 circle, and is unscrewed from the circle when packed away;
 the handle is fitted to a springing socket, so as to turn round
 upon the socket K, that it may be turned to any side of the
 circle for the convenience of holding it ; it mav be fastened
 by a small milled nut, seen in the figure which binds the
 ends of the spring socket together ; L is a magnifying
 glass for the purpose of reading the divisions of the ver
 niers ; it is fitted upon a pin screwed into the indexes, and
 may be applied to either. The figure 2 in the corner of the
 plate is a section, showing the construction of the central
 part of the circle, where M is a section of the thickness of
the circle with a hole through the centre, and a recess turned
out in the lower side to receive a centre-piece N, which is
fixed in with three small screws; a hole is turned in the
 centre of this piece, and an axis O is fitted into it with the
utmost accuracy, this axis has a flanch on the upper end hy
which it is screwed to the index H, and upon this, the un
der glass G, fig. 1, is fastened, by other screws passing
through a piece projecting from the back of it ; the axis is
held in its place by a collet r, fitted on a square part of                        it,

    Lover's Leap, are noted Rocks in this Dale, which has
    some Slither in it, particularly opposite to Chee Tor in
    Wormhill, where are two very large Springs of Water.
    The Duke of Devonshire has, I have been informed, a
    design of extending the private Road for the accommo
    dation of Travellers, from Lover's Leap at the SE end of
    Mill Dale, through Wje Dale, Millers Dale, and Monsal
    Dale to Ashford, by which all the Hills between these
    places, and indeed all those between Buxton and Matlock
    nearly, would be avoided, besides laying open the fine
    Rock scenery on the Banks of the Wye River, ahich
    has hitherto been but little seen, owing to the great dif
    ficulty of access to it.
    I  have selected' the above,       as specimens of the narrow
and precipitous Valleys       of Derbyshire and its environs : the
neighbourhoods of Ballidon, Brassington- pastures, Brush-
field, Dowall, Flagg, Hartington, Pike Hall and others,
present similar Dales, some of considerable length, and
not less striking than many of the above, and which 1 have
visited, but don't happen to have learnt their particular
Names; otherwise they would have bem included, on ac
count of the facility which such Lists give, of recording a
number of highly curious and interesting phaenomena, of
which Travellers may in future avail themselves: it is to
such Valleys also, that Mineralogists and Geologists must
principally resort, to become acquainted with the different
Calcareous and Basaltic Rocks of this County, to draw
materials for the Natural History of each, and for settling

- *60       Mr.    Farey's Account      of the Slips in Strata, &c.
  the important and contested questions, respecting the origin,
  and mode in which Valleys were excavated and formed.
      It must not be inferred, that high and precipitous Rocks
  and Cliffs are peculiar to or confined, to the class of Valleys
  of which I have been speaking, since the sides of the wide
  Valleys, also, abound with Rocks and Cliffs, some of them
  highly picturesque and beautiful, but such Rocks seldom
  continue far, without the intervention of grassy or culti
  vated slopes, such as the sides of Valleys usually present,
  in districts where no durable or permanent Rocks exist in
  their strata: whereas, in the narrow Valleys above, such
  slopes, or interruptions to the continuity of the Cliffs on
  each of their sides, are rare, and in some instances do not
  occur at all, within the distances which I have named.
  The Grit-stone Rocks of this district, seem particularly dis
  posed to appear and disappear repeatedly on the surface at
  their edges, or in tracing their Bassets through the country;
  and except of the 1st or lowest Grit Rock, it is a rare thing
  to find a continued Grit-stone Cliff of any length : some
  of them, indeed, are so disposed to moulder and fall, on
  exposure       to the air, rain, frost, &c. that Cliffs of such
  Rocks are never seen ; but where Slips or slidings have
  happened, in comparatively modern times, of which there
  are numerous and striking examples in Derbyshire, parti
  cularly in the Shale and shale Grit districts ; and as it seems
  of the utmost importance in Geological researches, to di
  stinguish between Cliffs or Facades of equal antiquity with
  the Valleys themselves, probably, or such as have originated
  with, or been increased by, subsequent and sudden Slips*,
  or by the gradual and recent undermining of currents of
  the Brooks and Rivers, I shall here give a
                                                                             List
     * Since the above was written, I have read with some surprise, pages 61
  and 62   of the recent Translation of M. Werner's " New Theory," on the
  subject of Mineral Veins, wherein the phenomenon of Slips, as above, is
  described, and it is gravely maintained, that such, happening " in rainy sea
  sons," have opened the fissures for Mineral Veins (to be afterwards filled, I
  supposed); as though the conchoidal fracture of a Slip from an adjoining
  Hill, close pressed and ground by the moving load of softened Earth, had
  any relation to a rake Vein! This is not however solely relied on for the
  opening of Veins; but we are informed (p. 48), that while the beds of the
                    "                                                    "
  Mountains were at first wet, and possessed little solidity," the mass yielded
  to its weight," " sunk and cracked," " falling to the free side ;"now, notwith
  standing the parade of mathematical definitions and preparations, at pages
  88 and 89, 1 would venture to ask any one who knows Derbyshire, and the
  large rake Veins which cross the comparatively flat districts, that lay between
  Bradwell and Tideswell or Wardlow, between Sheldon and Monyash, be
  tween Winster and Bonsai, &c. which is the free side in any of these cases ?
  or what sort of an action of their own weight it must have been, which
  caused such immense lumps of Limestone to start a few feet asunder, in so
                                                                            many

     to prevent    prejudicial Effects to the Persons employed in
     pointing Needles. By Mr. Thomas Wood f.
 Sir,    I  herewith submit to the inspection of the Society
 instituted for the Encouragement of Arts, &c. a model of
 an inclosed grindstone, intended to prevent prejudicial ef
fects to the persons employed in pointing needles.
     This grindstone is inclosed in a case of wood or metal,
and hath a hood wherein a square of glass is inserted, de
 signed to admit light on the articles under operation.
     The particular advantages attending a grindstone suspend
ed in this manner, with a hood and a damp cloth, are, that
the stream or current of air, formed by the motion of the
stone on its axis, is confined by the case under the hood of
    * Which is the result of a careful scaleing of my large Map. - In the Ori
ginal Report, Mr. Thomas Brown stated the quantity at 720,640 acres; the
Parliamentary Returns of the Poor's Rates, as stated by Mr. Thomas Poole,
mulce Derbyshire contain 689,280 acres, which last, considering that many
of the Parish quantities must have been stated by estimation, agrees suffi
ciently near with mine above. About the year 1756, when Benjamin Martin
published his Natural History of England, this County was stated to contain
only 540,800 acres; but a Dictionary of Arts and Sciences, now publishing
in London, magnifies its dimensions to 1,600.000 acres ! Sec other particu
lars of the acres in this County, in Sections IV. and VI. of this Chapter.

Description of Ike Engraving of Mr. Thomas Wood's
   Improvement in the Grindstones for Pointing Needles.
   Plate VI. fig. 1.
   The grindstone A is inclosed in a box or case, formed of
two circles of wood, one marked B, and another on the
opposite side, which cannot be seen in this view ; a a are
two thin iron plates placed so near to the stone, as to be as
close to it as possible without touching it ; two other plates
I, support a pane of glass at c, which at the same time that
it prevents the dust from being thrown over ihe stone into
the air, admits light to that part of the stone where the
needles are applied ; the remaining space between the edges
of the two circular boards B, is filled up by a coarse cloth
                                      f
D, which encompasses about of the edge of the stone,
and is then hooked up to the iron plates a, by means of two
bent pieces of plate iron, to which the cloth is sewed, one
of which is seen at d ; and these are hooked upon other bent
pieces, which form part of the plate aa; the cloth is wetted
when put on, and will then catch the dust which is pro
duced by the grinding, and when it has accumulated much,
by unhooking the cloth it may be shook out, and the cloth
being wetted is hooked on again ; as the stone wears down
the piece of plate iron e, situated in a groove formed by
the edges of the plate a, is slided forwards to follow up the
reduced edge of the stone, and other plates are put into the
groove after e, when they are required ; the case B is sup
ported by a cross-bar of the frame in which the stone re
volves, and which may be made in this or in any other
form ; the stone is turned in the usual manner of grinding-
mills for needles, by a strap passing round a rigger, fixed on
the end of its spindle ; but this cannot be seen in this view,
it being hidden behind the stone.

XXXIX.          Description of a Contrivance for conveying Steam
 from     Boilers.      By Mr. George Webster, of Leeds*.
Sir,     It   is with pleasure that T communicate to you the
contents of this paper, hoping that this invention will be
beneficial to the public ; the leading feature of the contri
vance is simplicity, and that may possibly be a fair recom
mendation, at least such it seems to me.
     I have just finished a new erection, for my better accom
modation in the whitening and stoving of woollen cloths,
 and having been long" annoyed in this business with the
 steam from the hot water in the pans, I determined if pos
 sible to get quit of it ; besides I had ample proof in my old*
 building, how injurious the steam was to the timbers of
 the floors, &c.        Permit me to say, that I spent a decent
 sum of money to no purpose, and was giving up the idea,
 in despair of its accomplishment, when I hit upon this ex
 pedient, which answers my most sanguine desires.
     I presume that this easy method of carrying away steam
 has never yet been in practice, and if once known will be
 of very considerable utility. In the numerous instances in
 trades where steam is inconvenient, it offers a ready rid
 dance ; to the timber in buildings, and to the furniture in
 houses, private kitchens, &c. it affords a desired security;
 but in manv trades, as glue-makers, tallow-chandlers, &c.
 where the effluvia, united with or without water, is offensive
 and obnoxious, it must he doubly and trebly valuable ; and
 these cases are/more numerous thai) I can recite or am ac
 quainted with. The evaporating matter needs no longer to
 be the plague of the workmen, or the nuisance of the
 neighbourhood.
     Hoping that the plan, though simple, and that the ob
ject, though not of the first magnitude, will be deemed
 worthy of the approbation of the Society,

   not immediately necessary, tor in the bleach house belong-          >
   ing to Messrs. Benyon, Benyon, and Baze, flax-spinners,
   of this place, I advised the steam to enter the smoke flue,
   about six feet above the top of the pan, and with the same
   good effect.
      Several of my friends" here have adopted them in their
  kitchens, and wash and brew- houses.             The steam flues are
  variously curved, as the situations required them to reach
  the nearest or most convenient smoke chimney, and with
  the same uniformly good success.             I would, however, re
  commend, thai at the lower part of the aperture, where the
  steam enters a smoke flue, a stone may be made to project
  a little way into the chimney, in order to break the current
  of the ascending smoke, and thereby facilitate the entrance
  of  the steam.
      I would remark further, that in some cases a curved or
  angular form may possibly be found the most eligible for
  the steam chimney, in order to prevent a gust of wind, or
  any other casualty, from forcing soot down into the liquid
  in the pan.  I have not yet witnessed any immediate neces
 sity for it myself, and therefore merely suggest it as possi
  ble, but yet very easily remedied.
                              I am, sir,

from thence be carried up to the top of the building or
turned into any smoke chimney near at hand.
-    In order to keep the water in the pan as hot as possible

ney at D, and if both these dampers are shut, and the whole
top of the pan covered closely o\«cr at c, the boiling water

266        Mr. Farcy's      Statement     of Geological Facts
of   the pan ; and upon this circumstance depends the w hole
secret of getting quit of the steam.               If you remove these
hoards or partial coverings, the steam chimney loses all its
use.     The letter b shows the part of the lop of the pan
which should be left open to admit to the workmen a ready
communication with the hot waier, and through this open
part a current of cold air is constantly seen to press and
force the steam rapidly up the steam chimney.
    It is proper to add, that there must alwavs be an empty
space of two or three inches between the surface of the hot
water and the uuder part of the cover cc, so as to permit the
steam to pass to the bottom of the steam chimney.                    To
effect this purpose, and at the same time to allow the cop
per to be full of hot water, a rim or curb of wood F, about
three inches thick, should be fixed upon the top of the
copper, and upon this the covering boards cc placed; this
allows sufficient room for the steam to press forward to the
steam chimney at all times.
   The cover and wooden steam chimney are removeable,
and may serve for another copper if both are not wanted at
the same time.

Sir,    The    announcement which Dr. William Richardson
made in your 37th volume, page 368, of the Rev. John
Dubourdieu being employed on a Statistical Survey of the
County of Antrim in Ireland, to which he meant to con
tribute his assistance, as to the Geological Facts of that
most interesting County, has made me anxiously expect the
appearance of this volume : and in the perusal of which I

 have lately been gratified, through the kindness of G. B.-
 Greenough, Esq. the able President of the Geological So
 ciety of London, who at the same time lent me some notes
 made by, himself, when in the country S of Lough Neagh,
 in the last year, with the Rev. Dr. William Hamilton Drum-
 mond's poem " The Giant's Causeway" (having a copious
 Preface and Notes on the Mineralogy of Antrim) and the
 Rev. Richard Barton's Lectures on Natural Philosophy,
giving many particulars of the shores of Lough Neagh.                       I
lament that I have not seen the Rev. G. Vaughan Samp
 son's Statistical Survey of Londonderry or Derry County*,
 or the Surveys of Tyrone, Armagh or Down, or read any
connected account of their Strata; only the incidental cir
 cumstances, noted in the work;- and paper above mentioned,
 except the slight account of the Drumglass Coal Strata
given by Mr. Whitehurst in his " Inquiry concerning the
Earth," 2nd Edit. p. 246, and which are quite insufficient
to prove the identity or otherwise, of the Coal-measures near
the S W corner of Lough Neagh and those at the NE corner
of Antrim, and of Ireland? which to me appears a question
of considerable importance, and I have hopes, that by
stating some facts from the above sources, and conjectures
of my own founded thereon, as to this point, I may obtain
from Dr. Richardson or others of your Geological Readers^
the further facts necessary for confirming or correcting
what I am about to offer on this head ; as well as on an
other scarcely less important, viz. Whether the Coal-mea
sures at the NE corner of Antrim under- lie or over-lie the
great Basaltic Serie$\ which occupies the surface of great
part of that County? a point which I lament to find Mr.
W. rather obscure upon, .who after speaking of the Basaltic
Sea Cliffs, ranging from the west and finally terminating
upon a stratum of white Limestone at Ballycastle, says,
Inquiry, p. 259, " and where a new arrangement of strata
   * Wlio, I am told, intends to make a Sntim across Antrim and
                                                                       Derry,

    t  Dr. \V. H. Drummond dispatches this part of his description of the
NE extremity of Antrim, in the manner of too many Wernerians, by saying,'
p. xiv. " at Murloch the primitive strata are seen dipping to the N\V in an
angle of about 45°.    Freestone occurs here between the strata of Trap,"
anri adds, "The Basaltic formation which is here renewed, attains its highest
elevation at Fairhead, rising in proud magnificence <wer alternate strata of
freestone and Co. l. and thence gradually sloping down to the strand of
Ballycastle."   Dr. R. speaking of this same spot says, at Murlogh " the
precipice is composed of alternate strata of Freestone and Cnal, inserted be
tween mighty strata of columnar Basalt." Appendix 81 : and says nothing
ef the primitive strata of Dr. D.l

engraved Section, across the mouth of the Glenshesk or
Ballycastle Valley ; whence it might be inferred, that the
Coal-measures over-lie both the great Basalt and the white
Limestone, though doubtfully, on account of their dips
being shown as very different and the Sea preventing
their junction from being seen ; but which difference of
the dips when viewed in this direction, viz. looking S,
seems inconsistent with what Dr. R. says in your Magazine,
vol. xxxiii. p. 200; viz. that this Basaltic stratum (of Fair-
Head, which he seems throughout to consider as the great
Basalt of the other Cliffs on white Limestone), lies " with the
same angle of inclination in which it was disposed along our
whole (north) Coast, that         is,
                                   slight ascent to the north,"
                                     a
which he elsewhere states to be      to 10° of inclination,

                                  I                          Ihave
adopted   the suppositions  of  tbe Drumglass     and  Ballvcastle
or Tyrone and Antrim Coal-fields, containing detached
parts of the same Strata, which belong to the top of the
       Antrim Basalt, and that they once connected thereon
freat
  etween these two Coal fields       and shall reply to Dr. R.'s
                                        ;
question, Appen. p.    31,     by
                               saying, that here Coal-measures
do intervene between Basalt strata, according to the state
ment of Mr. Whitehurst,             260, of Dr. Hamilton (ag
                                        p.
                                                            quoled

             published respecting Antrim, Derry,             &c.     26*9
quoted bv Mr. D. p. 86"), and by himself, Appcn. p. 81, as
before observed ; or rather, they over-lie the great Basalt,
and under- He the Whinstone, as both of the authors, first
above quoted, call this small or upper Basalt, although
Mr. D. rather obscures this interpretation, in pase 86, by
savjng, that the Whinstone is
                                        " the same (kind of?) stone
as the Basalt of Fair-Head, and i3 imperfectly columnar:"
we are no where however told, what space to the south
ward this Whinstone occupies,                 before the Slate com
mences? and w hether other Coal-measures do not come
on upon this Whinstone ? (as I think very probable) ; or
how or in what form the Whinstone or its covering strata
adjoin to (whether by underlieing or overlieing) the Slate
S of them ? ; on all which points Dr. R. is rather sur
prisingly silent, and dots not any where, I believe, mention,
or allude to the Granite* found S of the Coal-field, on
Ballypatrick Mountain, mentioned by Mr. D. p. 84, and
on the Mountain above Cushenden (perhaps the same?)
accompanied by Gneiss (p. 92 and 93), where '« the enor
mous fractured mass of this substance, which hangs over
the Road on the left, and the disjointed fragments that lie
under it on the right, as the hill is descended, cannot fail
of striking the beholder with awe ;" at the bottom of page
93, Mr. D. is more particular in describing the places of
the Limestone, Granite, Gneiss, and red coarse Sandstone
 (or PuddingUone), to the Traveller.              Dr. R. in describing
the edge of the basalt on the Limestone, in this part, App,
p. 21 and 43, mentions only the Slate, and by directing
the devious steps of his Tourist (App. p. 95), up the
southern Road from Jiallycastle (instead of that SE) shows
him this Sckistw only : and in so doing (like Dr. Townsend,
as I suspect) loads the Cosniogonists with unnecessary dif
 ficulties, respecting the unconformableness of the Slate and
 Coal-measures, as already mentioned.
     I shall now take the liberty of suggesting (in hopes of
 early correction through your means, wherever I am wrong)
 what appears to me to be the structure of the north-eastern
 part of Ireland, from the Arts disclosed in the very interest
 ing accounts which 1 have been reading, and the know-
 Iedi;e I have of similar or analogous phenomena in very
 distant situations.
      first then, I suppose that the lowest known Stratum or
 assemblage      of strata in this district is a very thick Red
     * At Cushleak N of Newtownglens, Gneiss, mica Stale and Granite are
 found, and occupy the Coast, according to Dr. D. Preface xiii; and "dark-

Derbyshire Report, vol. i. p. 1-16, and in your present vo-
jume, p. 28.
    Dr. R. when describing the great Basalt stratum in your
33rd volume, pages 105, 113, and 204, and in Mr. D.'s
Appen. p. 62, SO, &c. .-peaks of " the little systems, by the
aggregate vof which our coast is formed; nature having
 changed her materials, or their disposition, or both, every
two or three miles :" " Nature in the formation of her ar
rangements has never acted upon an extensive scale in our
Basaltic area," &e. " Whenever there is a change of ma
 terials, by the introduction of a new system, the lines of
demarkatioti (are) always distinct and well defined ; yet, the
 different materials pass into each oilier without interrupting
 the solidity and continuity of the whole mass." " We
 (addressing Mr. Davy) studiously sought for the points
 where nature had made any change in her materials, or
 their arrangement, hoping that at the junctions of these
 little systems we should find," 8cc. : and which are the
 kind of passages, to which I alluded, vol. xxxiii. p. 257, as
 not perfectly understanding them two years ago, but which
 1 think that I now do, as applied by Dr. R. to the ano
 malies or occasional changes in the substance, or the struc
 ture, or the form, Sec. of what he still considers as the same
stratum of Basalt, notwithstanding such changes. In the
 mention which Dr. R. has since made of the matters below
 white Limestone (except speaking of schist in several
 places), App. pages 21, 22, 47, Sec. he savs, they compose
 "  a district in which the component fossils are much di
 versified,"     having
                         " more diversified materials and more
 diminutive and irregular arrangements," and again, he
  speaks of the valley between Cave-hill and Carmoney be
 ing excavated through the basaltic and calcareous strata,
  " and the more irregular materials upon which tliev rested,"
  &c. From all which ] conceive, that Dr. R. will find no
  great difficulty in understanding, and perhaps in admitting
  the statements in my Derbyshire Report, vol. i. p. 147 to
  156, 280, &c. as to the anomalous, accidental, or chance
  Beds and nodular and huge anomalous Concretions or
  rudely crystallized Masses in the Red Marl strata, in and
  near to that County, and elsewhere; whatever he may think
  of my present attempt, to refer the very various and dis
                               lower part of his series (to which
  similar substances in the

stratum of Red Marl, as mentioned above ; within which
thev are now actually imbedded, either isolated, or touching
or enveloping one another, or occupying its entire place in
local tracts : and I am extremely anxious, to enaaue so de
liberate   and careful an observer as Dr. Richar5-on,      in
comparing these suggestions with the fucts within bis
knowledge or reach, respecting all the norih-eastern Coun
ties in Ireland, as soon as niav be, through the medium of
your Magazine, or any other he may prefer:  but to pro
ceed   :
     This thickRed Marl stratum does not appear to have
formed a single plane, but to form a Trough on a larg«
scale, such as I have traced in several parts of England*,
the central or lowest line of which is to be sought for, by
the dips of the superficial strata towards         (where such      ilt
strata are regular), from near the north-western corner of
Antrim along ihe vale of the lower Bann River between
Antrim and Derry, across Lough Neagh and thence per
haps along the vale of the upper Bann, and line of the
Newry Canal between Down and Armagh Counties, or
some miles to the west of this perhaps, and into the Eastern
Sea, in Dundaik Bav, probably ; and 1 think it liktly for
reasons to he etaied hereafter,    that this trough declines or
detpeus towards the south   as  far as the south side of Lough

very crooked and fingered form of the ending* of the strata, without ad
mitting such to be the remains of strata of which the other pans arc denu
ded and gone, as then and since have maintained, and as Dr. R has since
                       1

county of Antrim, though the space                vastly smaller, my

beds of trrecnish blue or blue marl-like Earth, which appears

 p. 74 ; the gypsum having been called Talc by Mr. Barton
p.   106.
     A  putty-like substance found in the Red Clay, often la
 minated, fine and most unctious to the feel (Mr. D. p. 69),
 is perhaps a kind of Fullers' earth.
     Salt-Springs (indicative, no doubt, of Rock Salt beds in
 the Marl below) ; the strongest in Ireland is on NoahDal-
 way's Estate near Carrickfergus, Dr. D. says pref. vii.     At
 Ballyhill, and at Red Hall in Magee Isle, there are pure,
 but not strong salt springs, Mr. D. p. 142.
     Mineral Springs (purging nitrous) in marley Clay at
 Killroot, and near Carrickfergus, Mr. D. p. 139.
     Sandstone, variegated, and containing clay galls, is said
 to be lowest stratum seen, (dipping W) on the beach at
 Ringin point by Dr. D. pref p. vi. " Sandstones of dif
 ferent colours, different degrees of hardness, and differing
 in the size of the grains which enter into their composition,
 form the grand basis of this County. They appear at the
 southern" extremity of it near Spencer's Bridge, where it
 joins the County of Down. From thence they may be
  traced along the whole valley to Belfast and along the shore
  to Carrickfercus, a tract of not less than twenty-two miles,"
 Mr. D. p. 91 ; and at Whitehouse Point, Dr. R. vol. xxxv.
  p. 375.    "The depth, lo which the Sandstones go, is very
  great and quite uncertain ; this has been tried in many
  places near Lisburn, where after boring near 200 feet, the
  undertaking has been abandoned : and at the Freestone
 Quarry at Scraba in the County of Down 450 feet have been
  bored through without success," Mr. D. p. 92.        The sur
  face of this stratum makes a sandy soil W of the Lagan,
  from Maize Course to near Belfast, p. 23. " A fine section
  of this sandstone may be seen at Macedon Point, arranged
  in many-coloured stripes, and cut by vertical veins of an
  unctious argillaceous substance, resembling Fullers' Earth,"
  Dr. D. pref. vii. " On the western shores of Cushendall
  Bay, we meet with a red Sandstone, in beds five or six feet
  thick, dipping to the E (stralula, probably?) at a high an
  gle:" " a curious breccia or puddingstone consisting of
   rounded pebbles of quartz imbedded in a red sandstone
  cement: the cavemed Rock, on which Red Bay Castle

 4/4       Mr. Forty's  Statement   of Geological Facts
 stands, and the grotesque caves of Cushendun, are found in
 this material,'' Dr. D. pref. xiii. and p. 143 : this pudding-
 stone is noticed particularly by Mr. D. at page 92 and 94.
 I am inclined however to think it a coarse and very irre-
         gritstone, as to the size of the grains, of which I
 futur
   ave seen manv examples in Ked Marl districts.
    Magnttian Limes /one, this appears on the S shore of Bel
 fast Lough, at Hollywood in Downshire, and by Dr. D.
 pref. vi. is supposed 10 underlie the Sandstone : many miles
 N of this at T«»r Point there is "a dark-blue primary or
 transition Limestone with veins of chlorite and calcareous
spar," Dr. D. pref. xiv.
     Gneiss, Mica Slate, and Granite appear in Cushleak, the
 shore3 here being hold but not perpendicular, Dr. D. pref.
 xiii. ; and Grey-v ache and Schist, and Granite are said,
 probably, 10 underlie the magnesian Limestone of Holly
 wood, pref. vi.
    " Porphry in unconformable strata of a yellowish and
bluish external surface, containing veins of Jasper," occur
in Cushendall Bay, Dr. D. pref. xiii.         What Dr. R. and
Mr. D. have said of the Slate, Gneiss, and Granite, in-land,
at the NE corner of the County, have been noticed already
at page 2fii), and it remains I think only to mention, that
a vein ot Lead appears in a agee lrland, Dr. D. pret. xii. ;
that Manganese is found near Ballycastle, S (I suppose in
these straia?) Mi. D. p. 62, and Slieve Aura mountain
" has been long supposed to contain Mines," or veins
rather, Dr. D. App. p. 33.
    Such are the varied substances which the south-eastern,
east, and norih-easiern borders of Antrim furnish, from
what 1 consider as different parts of ihe same thick stra
tum, without being furnished with the means of tracing
any invariable law as to their disposition, or thinking that
such can be there traced (if such exists) any more than in
another stratum of similar properties which 1 have else
where examined, and which nothing but the succession of
well marked and different strata (the Lias, &c.) above it,
could hinder us from concluding to be the very same
stratum.
    Second  A great Limestone stratum, or rather an assem
blage of calcareous strata, * hose parallel planes are applied on
the Marl (or its anomalous beds), and except at the north
east and south east corners of Antrim county, but little of
the Marl remains uncovered thereby, while the surface

the same is a proper subject of further elucidation                    in your
Magazine, as a work pretty generally and increasingly read
by Geological inquirers.              Dr. W. H. Drummond, preface
p. viii. gives the following account of the strata above the
thin layer of bituminous schist, already mentioned page
272; this is overlaid, says he, " by a blue Limestone con
taining the Star-stone, or vertebrae Pentacnnites, Cornu
ammonis, and Anomia gryphus.                      To this succeeds a stra
tum of arenaceous Limestone, often of a green hue, known
in this district by the very appropriate name of Mulatto,
 from its mixed nature, and the difference of its colour from
the snow-white Limestone, by which it is covered.                          This
stratum abounds in quartz pebbles (or coarse grains of
 silex, rather ?) an J organic remains, particularly Belvmnites*,
 Pectevites Echini, Ijstracites,               Cardia, Anomia gryphus,
 and a substance resembling Gypsum, which some suppose
 to be the Pinna marina, so closely conglomerated and
 united by the arenaceous paste, that they seem in some
 places to compose almost the whole mass.
      "Above the mulatto lies a very thick stratum of white
  Limestone, one of the purest carbonates of Lime, also con
  taining Belemnites in abundance, Cardia more rarely, with
  Flints, ranging in horizontal lines, and often, where it is
  traversed by a dyke, exhibiting a granular structure like
  Marble. The horizontal lines of its stratification being cut
  by vertical fissures,         it has frequently the appearance of
  huge quadrangular          blocks,    artificially built on each other,"
  page ix.        And    he   continues,      " One of the most remark
  able appearances,         which     will  next    arrest the observer's at-
     * The Bclemnile and Echinus are often found in flint. The farmer, when
  found either in limestone or mulatto, is generally of a yellow, calcareous,
  sparry tenure on the outside, the centre being of the same substance as that
  in which it is imbedded.       From some specimens of the Renvois which I
  broke, it appears, that they are a solid mass of the same material as that in
  which they lie, and contain no central crystallization:    but the place of the
  shell in flint is marked by a very thin sparry incrustation.     In the mulatto
  the shell is very distinctly preserved ; it has become of a sparry texture; is
   much thicker than lhat of the urchin, now found in our Scasi has :io ap
   pearance of an opening havinp ever been at the top but of two small orifice*
   near each longitudinal extremity of the base, by which the matter was in
  jected. St. Pierre in his IVth Study of Nature observes, " that manv of
   the cornu ammonis and single-shelled fossils, which from their form have
   resisted the pressure   of the ground, have not ejected their animal matter,
   but exhibit it within them under the form of crystals, whereas the two-
   shelled are totally destitute of it." The observation will apply sometimes
   to the cornu ammonis, not to the Echinus, as far as my observation extends.
   To the above list, add the Mytilus crista galli, the Deiilalium,jirco, Tcllina,
   faflSerpula, found in Collin- Glen by Mr. Tcmpleton."

Limestone, and decomposed Basalt, which immediately
succeeds.       The Limestone is reddish, as if tinged by the
oxidaied iron of the basalt, the basalt friable as an earthy
mould, and the flints shivery, as if they had undergone the
action of intense heat.         The flints which lie in greatest
number on the limestone vary in colour from a light pink
to a rosy red, and contain cavities with a yellow impalpable
powder, or minute crystals.          They are often striped, as if
formed by successive depositions, and exhibit manifest
traces of Corals, Madrepores, and other marine exuvis,
which are supposed to 'have supplied the silicious matter,
or to have served a3 its focus of attraction."           " On the
beach near Glynn         the  Annvtia gryphus, and the vertebras
Pentacrines are. found in abundance, in Hue Limestone,"
          "

likewise at Church Bay in the Isle of Raihlin.             On the
mountain just mentioned, at the height of about 1 100 feet,
is a kind of calcareous Sandstone, containine a variety of
shells, among which some of our native ones ma\ be re

intermixed with the Mytilus instatus (figured in White's
Natural History of Selbourne), Ammonia serpulce, (Mr.

    Blue and white or dove-coloured Marble is found on the
lands of BalK murphy, two miles from Belfast; also in
Collin Glen, some of its white part being " as transparent
as statuary Marble."          A fine red Marble inclosing reddish
 Flints in Bamer's Glen near Trummery: a whin dyke
far advanced in decomposition to a yellowish or a reddish
ochreacous substance, cutting through this and other quar
ries to the SW, imparts these colours to the limestone near
it,  making     it  much harder, finer in the grain, and more
crystallized,     and   w hich when cut and polished, are nearly
equal    to    the  best   imported marbles, but they cannot be

    The shrinking and opening of fissures and caverns in the
Limestone, beneath these Basalts (in common with all thick
 calcareous strata which I ever saw), which the water-swal
 lows at Red Hall and near Kil waiter (p. 71) serve to illu
 strate, may well account for the sinking of the Basaltic
 surface into Funnel-shaped hollows*, at Broom-mount in
Soldier's Town and elsewhere, mentioned App. p. 112;
but where it was by no means necessary, to resort to the
improbable suppositions of             " the softening and carrying
away of some understratum, probably Limestone, by the
action of subterraneous running waters," to account for
these local, and in some districts very common depres
sions of the surface: and which seem to have nothing
in common with the decomposing cores and semi-
spherically-shaped cavities t left on the surface of Basalt,
   * Among the numerous facts collected, and further attainable, toward*
my proposed Mineral Hillary of Derbyshire (should an adequate interest
and encouragement arise and offer, to render it prudent on my part ever
to resume it), which covld not find a place in the published Report to the
Board of Agriculture, the several conical depressions in the 3rd Toadstone
(or Basalt) near Water-Swallows in Fairfield , owing to the shrinking of the
thick 4th Limestone beneath, remain to be mentioned, as instances similar to
those in Antrim. A depression or elliptical Sankum or Basin of small extent
and depth, on the 1st Grit Rock SW of Overton Hall, lately presented itself
to my notice, in surveying and levelling in the Fields in that part for Sir
Joseph Bank's large Mineral Maps and Sections which I have in hand, and
probably indicates a cavern or large shake-hole in the 1st l.ime Rock be
neath, into which this thick grit-stone Rock has become locally depressed.
Hell-Kettles S of Darlington in Durham are, doubtless, two sunk places of
the upper clayey stratum, into the shrunk magnesian l.ime Rock beneath.
Nor is it uncommon, owing to the unequal contraction of the lower cal
careous beds (where there is no superincumbent stratum) to find depressions
in calcareous soils, as may be seen on a grand scale about Stanstrad NE of
Brighton, in the upper Chalk ; in Norfolk near to Mr. Colhourn's former
residence: on a smaller scale on the Chalk Hills SW of Wendover, Bucks.:
and even in Gypseous tracks, according to the 1st Edit, of Jameson's " Geog»
nosy,'' p. 34 and 172.
   f The several Rock Basins, and some of the Stone Chairs on the 1st Grit
Rock, where exposed in blocks, in Derbyshire, seem owing wholly or in
great part, to decomposed or loosened I.ums or Nests of Mica plates, such
as are noticed iu my Report, vol.i. p. 4G6.

   Dr. W. H. Drummoml's description of these strata                     and
their imbedded contents, pref p. x. is as follows : " Over
topping: all (the Limestone strata) is the great stratification
of Trap, with its subordinate divisions of Greenstone, Por-
phry-slate, Trap-Tuffa, and Amygdaloid.          The solid Trap
and the Amygdaloid alternate, as may be distinctly seen at
the Knockagh, the former showing traces of incipient co-
lumnarity, the latter less rent into (by) fissures, often very
friable, and indented at its junction with the Trap; thickly
studded with Zeolite, and or a dark gray, brown, or reddish
colour.     It would require frequent minute examinations to
ascertain the order in which the different numerous strata
of this formation succeed eavh other. There is also a
stratum of an ochreous vermillion red .substance which may
be seen at the base of the precipice of the Cave Hill, but
In much greater beauty and extent at Murlogh and the
Giant's Causeway.         The Porphry -slate, which may be
easily distinguished by its slaty fracture, is ornamented with
small topaz-coloured crystals of Chrysolite or Olivin. Small
brilliant crystals like Sapphires, and opake crystals of Shorl,
 are found in some varieties of the Trap; that of Fair-head,
which is so coarse as to resemble Granite, contains Augite.
The vesicles of the amygdaloid are almond-shaped, tubu
 lar, quadrangular, and a series of them is often connected
 together. They are supposed to have been formed by air-
 bubbles during the deposition of the strata, and to have
 been afterwards filled or lined by percolation with           the
 matter by which they are now occupied.        This is, Steatites,
 calcareous Spar, Calcedony, Opal or Zeolite : the last is very
 prevalent: it is sometimes cubical, often stelliform, and
 in the beauty, delicacy, and the arrangement of its crystals,
 vies with the Thistles' down.     As the character of Basaltic
 or Whinstone Mountains, the flatz-trap formation of Wer
 ner, are too obvious to be mistaken, the description of one
 may serve for the whole.      On one side they generally pre
 sent a steep precipice, and on the other fall away with a
 gradual slope*. They are flat at the summit, whence they
 are denominated Tabular."
     A bed of prismatic IJasalt at Port rush and the Skerrie
  Islands, is full of Belemnites and of / ectenites, and above
 all, of Comua Ammonis, dispersed through the whole mass,

vol. xxxv. p. 370, Mr. D. p. 53, and App. p. 36 : Dr. R.
seems, however, only to mention the Ammonites : and
                                  "
Dr. D. says, pref. p. xv. At Portrush, the Chert, Pelro-
silex, or Silicious Basalt, abounding with impressions of
 the Cornua Ammonis (many of which are pyritous, and
emulate the splendour of gold) rises to puzzle the Geo
logist."
    Of the Whynn Dykes or Feins of Basalt which intersect
and branch off in northern and eastern directions from this
great Basaltic Area, I must at present say nothing, but refer
to Dr. R.'s valuable paper on this subject in your 35th
volume, p. 364.
    It will be necessary here, to say something more parti
cularly as to the limits of the Basaltic strata, and their po
sition, preparatory to assigning the Coal-series a place upon
them, both to show the grounds of my proceeding therein,
and to furnish what clues 1 am able to future observers,
who may, and I hope ere long will undertake, the decision
of the important questions stated in page 267. From So-
in Antrim, the N       end of the Basaltic Trough occupies the
cliffs of the Ocean ; from Ballycastle* to the heights above
Newtownglens, its NE irregular corner, crosses the moun
tains : from the last mentioned place round the coast of
the Ocean, the Lough, and the banks of the River Lagan, at
a somewhat greater distance than that of the Limestone
edge, the eastern Basaltic edge is to be traced, till it crosses
the Lagan near Moira                                          turns then
again suddenly to the E (as the Limestone also did, I ex
pect) and proceeds in Down County,

Eastward of Lisburn," Mr. D. p. 38, Note : this deep in
dent into the edge of Limestone and Basalt strata being
occasioned by the excavation of the Lagan valley, just as
they are indented on the west side in Derry by the Mayola
excavation (which Dr. R. has so well described, vol. xxxiii.
p. 202), except that here Red Marl is exposed by the exca
vation, and there Schistus which has occupied its place, in
"a little system." From Dr. Hamilton's Map, referred toby
Mr. D. in a note, p. 38, leaving the basaltic bounds against
Down County undefined, and from the obscurity of the
descriptions that I have read of the same, in Down and
Armagh and Tyrone : I am led to suppose, that consider
able accumulations of Alluvia are there lodged and conceal
   * The detached Basaltic Cliff of Fairhead NE of

on the spot, of tracing the eastern edge of the Basaltic
trough, from where Mr. D. leaves it E of Lisburn, in a S or
SW direction to the SE coast of Down, pr lhat of Louth :
to find again its western edge on that Coast, and trace it
thence in a NW or NN\V direction to Sheve-Gallon
Mountain VV of Desmartin in Derry, where Dr. R. satis
factorily describes its edge, vol. xxxiii. p. 202, and App. 23,
and thence NN\V to Solomon's Porch at the NW corner,
where I began*        It is true, Dr. R. (App. p. 22) mentions
a strip of Basalt about three miles broad, extending near
to the middle of Armagh County at Market-hill and Gos-
ford- Castle, in such terms, as might have led me to sup
pose, that white limestone appeared from under the sides
of this projecting horn of Basalt j had not Mr. D. p. 373,
informed us, that an official document of the Irish Parlia
ment states, that " from Blackwater town (down the Black-
water River) to Lough Neagh, and from thence again up
the River Bann, and along the Canal to Newry (an extent
of nearly 30 miles) there is no limestone iv hat ever ;" al
 though the line of navigation from Lough Neagh to Newry
must twice have crossed the great Limestone basset, had not
 its unbroken plane, in all this length, laid deep buried un
 der Basalt, with Gravel locally distributed on            as the it,
 " whynstoncs on the surface," Mr. D. p. 39, and the
"   field-stones," Dr. R. App. p. 22, give room to suppose                  ;
 but when Dr. R. returns northward (not southward, p. 23)
in   describing the western edge of his Basaltic area, and
says,  it " crosses Lough Neagh diagonally, catches the Derry
shore not far from Ballyronan           the Basalt
                                         ;             found in

 which shows either, the two last places or Magheralin, men

edges
        * of the strata, which edges without doubt rise south
wardly, for some miles from the north Coast, as stated
p. 376; owing, doubtless, to the E and W dip towards
the bottom of the trough, increasing, through that distance,
and producing tw isted or winding surfaces, rather than ma
thematical planes in the Limestone and other strata; for
the water of Lough Neagh in its deepest part, probably, I
think, rests on strata of Basalt, that are several hundred
feet elevated above the sea on the north of Coleraine.

XLI.     Experiments on the Strength of Men and HorstS in
             moving Machines.          By M. Schulze-J-.
Those        who have had occasion to construct machines in
tended     to be   moved by men or animals, are sufficiently
aware how important it is to be acquainted with the quan
tity of motion that can be attributed to either of them, in
order to estimate with accuracy the effect which it is pro
posed to obtain by the machine.                  It is well known that
the arrangement of the whole depends entirely on the iatio

Berlin for 1783, by T. S. Evans.
                                                                        Of

             Men and Horses in moving Machines.              283
of   the velocity of the motive force to the resistance.   This
 was the reason that long ago induced them to take the
 trouble of determining the strength as well as velocity ex
 erted by men and animals when they are made to move
machinery ; and the results they obtained, which have been
commonly made use of in computing the effect of machines,
are, that men exert from 27 to 30 lbs. with a velocity of
from 1| to 2 feet per second; and that a horse has about
seven times more strength than a man, with a velocity of
from 4 to 6 feet per second.
    These are the data which we have been obliged to us'e
whenever it became necessary to compute the effect of a
machine moved by men or horses.          It is evident that the
force must be diminished when the velocity is increased,
and vice versa: but we are not yet certain of the method of
finding the ratio of the diminution or augmentation of this
force to the velocity.     Euler has given us two different for
mulas to compute this ratio; but no one has hitherto at
tempted to verify by experiment, which of them is to be
preferred, although they differ very considerably from each
other.    If we put P for the absolute force which takes
place   when   we simply consider equilibrium, C the absolute
velocity   which  takes place when the man or animal moves
freely  and  without   being overcome by the resistance; p the
relative force, and c the corresponding velocity, we have
by the first of these formulse,
    Whereas the second gives us
    As I am obliged now more than ever to attend to a num
ber   of machines, and to compute their effect, it therefore
concerns me very much to know exactly in what manner
to estimate, compare, and fix the strength and velocity of
men and animals which are used for moving various ma
chines proper for different purposes.
    With this view I made with considerable care the ex
periments I am now about to detail ; which of course would
have been very expensive, had it not been for some facilities
which other persons may not possess.
   To make the experiments on human strength, I took
promiscuously 20 men of different sizes and constitutions,
whom I measured and weighed; the result of which is
given in the following Tftble :

    To find the strength that each of these men might exert
 to raise a weight vertically, 1 made the following experi
 ments :
    I took various weights increasing by 10 lbs. from 150lbs.
 up to 250 lbs.; all these weights were of lead having cir
 cular and equal bases.      To use them with success in the
 proposed experiments I had at the same time a kind of
 bench made, in ihe middle of which was a hole of the same
 size as the base of my weights : this hole was shut bv a cir
 cular cover when pressed against the bench ; at other times
 it was kept at about the distance of a foot and a half above
 the bench, by means of a spring and some iron bars. To
 prevent the weight with which this cover was loaded du
 ring the experiment from forcing down the cover, lower
 than the level of the surface of the bench, I had several
 grooves made in the four iron bars, which sustained the
 cover, and which at the same time served to hold up the
 cover at any height where it might arrive by the pressure
 of the springs as soon as the pressure of the weight ceased.
     After having laid the 150 lbs. weight on the cover, and
  the other weights in succession increasing by 10 lbs. up to
  £50 lbs. I made the following experiments with the men
  whose size and weight are given above, by making them
 lift up the weights as vertically as possible all at once, and
  by observing the height to which they were able to lift
  them.     The following Table gives the heights observed for
  the different weights marked at the head of the Table.

    This Tabic     proves to us .that the size of ihe men em
ployed to raise the weights vertically has considerable influ
ence on the height to which they brought the same weight.
We     find also by this that the height diminishes in a much
more considerable ratio than the weight increases : and we
may therefore conclude, that it is advantageous to employ
large men when it becomes necessaiy to draw vertically
from below upwards : and on the contrary , it is more ad
vantageous to employ men of a considerable weight, when
it is required to lift up loads by means of a pulley about
which a cord passes, that the workmen draw in a vertical
direction, from above downwards.                   To find the absolute
strength of these men in a horizontal direction I took the
following method.
    Having fixed over an open pit a brass pulley extremely
welt made, of 15 inches diameter, whose axis, made of well
polished steel to diminish the friction, was                   f  inch in dia
meter; 1 passed over thi» pulley a silk cord worked with
care to give it both the necessaiy strengih and flexibility.
One of the ends of this cord carried a hook to hang a
weight to it which hung vertically in the pit, whilst the
other end was held by one of the 20 men, who in the first
order of the following experiments made it pass ahovt his
shoulders-; instead of which, in the second, he simply held
it by his hands.
    I had taken the precaution to construct this in such a
manner thai the pulley might be raised or lowered at plea
sure, in order to keep the end of the cord held by the man
always in a horizontal direction, according as the man was
tall or short, and exerted his strength in any given          "       direction.
                                      T   3                                I had
                                     1

£58             Experiments        on the Strength   of
   I had made tlie necessary arrangements so as to be able
to load successively the basin of a balance which I had at
tached to the hook at the end of the coid which descended
into the pit, whilst the man who held the other end of this
cord employed all his strength without advancing or re
ceding a single inch.
    The following Table gives the weights placed in the basin
when the workmen were obliged to give up, having no
longer sufficient strength to sustain the pressure occasioned
by the weight. To proceed with certainty, I increased the
weight each time by five pounds,' beginning from 60, and
I  took the precaution to make this augmentation in equal
intervals of time, having always precisely a space of 10 se
conds between them.            The result of these observations re
peated several days in succession, is contained in the fol-

    These two Tables show that men have less power in
 drawing a cord before them than when they make it pass
 over their shoulders : it shows us also that the largest men
 have not always the greatest strength to hold, or to draw
 in a horizontal direction, by means of a cord. To obtain
 the absolute velocity of these 20 men, I proceeded as fol
lows :
    Having   measured       very exactly a distance of 12000 Rhin-
 land feet in   a  plain nearly level, I caused these 20 men to
                                                                   march

     It is necessary to mention with regard to these experi
 ments, that I took care to place at certain distances per
 sons in whom I could place confidence, in order to observe
 whether these men marched uniformly and sufficiently
 quick, without running.
     Having thus obtained, not only the absolute force, but
  the absolute velocity also, of several men, 1 took the fol
 lowing method to determine their relati\e force.
     I made use of a machine composed of two large cylin
  ders of very hard marble, which turned round a vertical
  cylinder of wood, and moved by a horse, which described
  in his march a circle of lu Rhinland feet.                This machine
 appeared     to me   the  most  proper   to  make   the    following ex
  periments,     which    serve  to   determine   the   relative   strength
  that the men had employed to move, this machine, and
  which I use hereafter, to determine which of Euler's two
  formulae ought to be preferred.
     To obtain this relative force, I took here the same pulley
 which served me in the preceding experiments, by applying
 a cord to the vertical cylinder of wood, and attaching to the
  other end of this cord which entered into an open pit a
  sufficient weight to give successively to the machine dif
 ferent velocities.
¦    Having applied in this manner a weight of 215 lbs., the
 machine acquired a motion, which after being reduced to
  an uuiform motion, taking into, account the acceleration of
  the weight, of the friction, and of the stiffness of the cord,
  gave^-41 feet velocity; and having applied in the same
  maunSr a weight of 220 lbs. the resulting uniform motion
 gave a velocity of 2"47 feet.            1 only   mention these two
  limits because they serve as a comparison with what un-
                                     T  4                         mediately

 tSS On     the Strength of Men and Horses in moving Machines,
  mediately follows : I began these experiments with a weight
  of 106 lbs. and increased it by 5 every time from that
  number up to 400 lbs.
     I made this machine move by the seven first of my
  workmen, placing them in such a way that their direction
  remained almost always perpendicular to the arm on which
  was attached the cord which passed over their shoulders in
  an almost horizontal direction.
     Thus situated, they made 28} turns with this machine in
  two hours, which gave for their relative velocity c = 2*45
  feet per second.      We have also the absolute force, or P,
  from these 7 men, by the above Table = 730 lbs. : and
  their absolute velocity or C = 5-30 feet.
     Therefore, by substituting these values in the first forr
  mula, we find the relative force p = 205 lbs. which agrees
'very well with what we have just found above.
     If instead of this first formula the second be taken, it
  gives p = 153 lbs. which is far too little.
     By this it is eyident, that the first of Eider's two for
  mulae is to be preferred in all respects.    I have also made
  a great number of combinations, and I almost always found
  the same effect.
     Dividing the 205 lbs. which we have just found by 7 the
  number of workmen, we get 29 lbs. for the relative force
  with 2*45 feet relative velocity for each man, which is
  rather more than the values commonly adopted in the com
  putation of machinery.       A number of other observations
  on different machines, which 1 intend to relate another
  time, have given me the same result; that is to say, we
  must value the mean human strength at 29 or 30 lbs. with
  a velocity of 2| feet per second.
     To obtain the ratio of the strength of a horse to that of
  a man, I had the same machine moved by a horse without
  altering any thing; and I found by ten different horses
  which I used successively, that a horse makes 603 turns
  jn   i  hours instead of 281 : therefore, by supposing the
  static motion of a horse 7 limes greater than that of a man,
  wc find that the former has 5'3 feet per second of velo-
  pity.
     By this it is evident, that the effect of a horse is 14 times
  greater than that of a ipan, or, which amounts to the same
  thing, 14 men must be used instead of l horse. Hence it
  appears, that it is much more advantageous            to employ
  horses than men in moving machines, if other reasons did
  pot require us to prefer men.
                                                            I have

                             On Animal Fluids.
    I  have also made a number of other interesting observa
tions on horses and oxen, which are likewise used in mov
ing machines : but as I am now waiting for observations
of this kind, which other persons are making according to
my plan, I shall reserve what          I  have to say respecting them
for a second memoir.
XLII. A       Rejoinder to a Paper published in the Philosophi
    cal Magazine, by Dr. Marckt, on the Animal Fluids.
    By George Pearson, M.D. F.R.S., &c.
                             To  Mr. Tilloch.
 Sir,    By    a severe   accident     I  have   been prevented    from
 writing    the paper   which I    proposed    in  my   Communication
 honourably        inserted in your Journal for January last.
 Meanwhile an answer to that Communication has been
 published by Dr. Marcet*.
     Before I redeem my pledge of offering some remarks on
 Dr. Marcet's Memoir, I feel myself called upqn by what
 I consider to be the true interests of science to reply to his
 intervening answer.            This gentleman cannot be more
 averse from polemical writing than I am, nor have more
 cogent motjves pf private advantage by being otherwise
 employed ; but unless I were to avail myself or the plea of
 a celebrated philosopher, who asserted that his regard for
 truth was so great that he would not part with it lest it
  should be ill treated by mankind, I have no option con
 sistently with public duty.             The feelings of either party
 must however regulate their future conduct.                  For myself,
 I can pnly promise that I shall not consider it as a point of
  honour, to contend for the last word.
      In the answer which has been addressed to me, Dr. Marcet
 has set forth evidence from his memoir, still under ex
  amination, to maintain that soda in an uncombined state,
  and not potash, exists in the animal fluids; as I trust I have
  legitimately proved according to facts hitherto discovered.
  As my honourable Opponent has still not contravened the
  most decisive parts of the evidence in support of my alle
  gations, I am spated the pains of again displaying it ; so
  that 1 have only to comment on the evidence he brings
  forward in justification.        In my remarks, perhaps, I cannot
  entirely avoid repetition of objections already produced.
      The first kind of proof that soda and not potash is present,
              * See the Fhiloiophical Magazine  for February last.
                                                                    again

  again asserted by my adversary, is from the figure of cry
  stals. 1 have to remark, in addition to my former obser
 vations, that their forms alone rarely or never, even when
  perceivable with the unassisted organ of vision, do singly
 denote unequivocal properties ; and when not perceivable
 without the medium of glasses, we know from past expe
 rience the figures are to be considered as still more equivo
 cal, I might say deceptive. If these crystalline forms are
 now admitted as justly distinguishing properties of certain
 substances, it is in consequence of repeated observation on
                                         "
 larger quantities by direct vision,  quae sint oculis sub-
jecta   fidelibus,"  but even then  not   without concomitant
 other well ascertained properties.
    Secondly  Great dependence seems to be placed on the
 acetate produced by combining acetic acid with the sa
 line matter afforded by incineration.      This was said to be
 acetate of soda, which dissolved in alcohol, while potash was
 found in the residue left undissolved by the alcohol.          I
have searched the pages of the memoir under examination
 again and again, fur the evidence in support of this allega
 tion ; but here, and on many other occasions, is a mere asser
tion, except a partial support from the serum of the blood,
as will be seen hereafter.      For, I. With regard to the sa
line matter of the fluid of the spina bifida I find these words :
" the alcoholic solution being decanted off and evaporated
to dryness, a residue supposed to consist of acetate of soda
was obtained."       Here no mention is made either of an ex
periment     to prove whether the acetate was that of soda or
of potash, but it was supposed to be acetate of soda. As
to the undissolved matter containing potash, there is not
that I can find even a word written. This too has been sup
posed.     2. With regard to the second fluid examined, that
of hydrocephalus internus, we are told " the analysis was
conducted in the same manner as in the former :" of
course the existence of soda in the alcohol and of potash
undissolved are not proved, but 1 presume here also sup
posed.     3. In the other animal fluids, viz. of ascites, of hy-
d othorax, and hydrops pericardii, as well as subsequently
of the hydrocele ; of the hydatids, of the thyroid gland, and
of a tumour of the chest, no such experiment as that of
compounding an acetate is mentioned.           4. In the experi
ments, however, on the saline matter of the serum of the
blood, an acetate was compounded which dissolved in alco
hol, the words of the author being, " the alcoholic residue
contrary to my expectations exhibited traces of potash, both
by means of tartaric acid and ox-ymuriate of platina."

                           On Animal Fluids.
  This,  as far as T can find, is the sole experiment with acetic
  acid and alcohol, related by- the author to determine the
  kind of alkali present, although the assertion is made of the
  animal fluids generally, i But although the assertion be not
  proved, it may be worth while to consider what, or whe
  ther any thing, is proved by these experiments ? They prove
  that potash was present, because there was a precipitate
  with tartaric acid, but nothing more  there is no proof
  that it was in the stale of muriate, as asserted.    It perhaps
  will be said that these experiments prove, that this    "  alco
  holic residue" contains also acetate of soda; " for the same
1
  residue treated with nitric acid was almost entirely re
  solved into rhomboidal crystals, amongst which I was un
  able to detect any distinct prisms."      Now, I have already
  expressed my want of confidence in the figure of minute
  crystals singly as evidence; especially, seen through glasses :
  and here, I presume, is a decisive instance of their fallacy ;
  for potash being proved to be present, as already said by
  Dr. Marcet, united to muriatic acid, it must have afforded
  cubes, if reliance can be placed on forms ; but no such cubes
  were seen.     A further objection occurs to my mind in this
  experiment.      I apprehend it is quite as likely to be true
  that alcohol will dissolve a small proportion of muriate of
  soda, as according to Dr. Marcet it does of muriate of
  potash. This being the case, the "alcoholic residue" ought
  to have afforded cubes of muriate of soda as well as of muriate
  of potash. The process under examination requires further
  animadversion :  on the remaining part of it " potash was
  easily discoverable in the residue insoluble in alcohol, which
  residue had now lost its deliquescent quality." That potash
  in a combined state was present I admit may be inferred,
  but I say confidently, there is no proof thai it was united
  to muriatic acid.     It is not incumbent on me, but on the
  Affirmer, to show with what it is combined.          I think it
  right to notice another unsatisfactory part of the process
  before me.     It is said a concentrated solution of the saline
  mass in question did not distinctly indicate potash by oxy-
  muriate of platina, but did by tartaric acid. Subsequently,
  however, we are told that the dissoluble as well as the in
  dissoluble residue of the acetous compound in alcohol
  readily denoted the presence of potash to the oxymuriate of
  platina as well as to tartaric acid. To my apprehension,
  I own this account only shows that the quantities were too
  minute for distinct observation of facts.        How all am
  biguity might have been removed, I have taken the liberty
  of proposing in commenting on this process in my former
                                                           Com

Communication to your Journal, p. 69, 1. 15. for January
last. On that occasion I expressed my doubt whether or
not the acetate of soda be dissoluble in alcohol, but I de
ferred to the authority of experiment.              Here my learned
friend exultingly construes these phrases of doubt, two
                                                   "
palpable errors, and seems to triumph  a hit, a hit, my
                                  
Lord, a very palpable hit." No : there is no error in this
case, Dr. Marcet ; according to the English meaning of
the terms used.        To make the utmost of these asserted
errors, I am also charged with no less than three times re
peating them ; as if the propriety of writing was absolutely
limited to the number of times an assertion should be de
livered.    At this time however, without the slightest un
easy sensation, I say that acetate of soda is a deliquescent
salt, and dissoluble in alcohol ; for I have performed the
necessary experiment; not indeed with " half a grain and a
watch-glass," hut with 50 grains. The truth                     is,
                                                              had not

a  friend most likely to be informed,           found he was igno
                                                      I
rant; as on just looking into two valuable books, Aikin's
Dictionary, and Thomson's Elementary Work, one said
the acetate of soda was        permanent, and the other
                                    a                             deli  a

was   a  permanent crystallized salt labelled             by

doubtful, although        own inclined to the contrary opinion
                            I           I
of that which       now
                   is        believe the truth.
                                I                    Dr. M. may call
this palpable error,
      a                        he pleases  he will hurt nobody
                                 if
but himself       by
                   the phrase.      The main proof         hereby not
                                                               is
affected  ; for the fact now ascertained against my doubtful
opinion   is only    collateral evidence on either side.
                       a
    Thirdly  Another source of evidence against me                that is
potash combined " was proved              the tests of oxymuriate of
                                                 by
platina and tartaric acid." The just inference has been
already proposed       but
                        ;     will barely remark that the experi
                                 I
ment does not prove that soda was or was not present.
    As to any other proofs, they have been already minutely
examined in my former Reply, or have been answered in
this; but entreat the indulgence of being allowed to make
              1
two or three further remarks.          1. On the fluid of the spina
bifi.Ja, of the thorax, and of the pericardium, the tartaric
acid was not employed at all.          Of these fluids the analysis
in general was very partial.          2. Of the alkaline matter of
the hydrocephalus fluid, the experiment must be unsatis
factory   by  the tests, on account of the impracticability of
                                                               entirely

                       On Animal Fluids.                      293
entirely separating the two alkalies from one another in
such minute quantities as were obtained ; and if the sepa
ration were not effected, as the two fixed alkalies are af
firmed to exist, the test by tartaric acid must have produced
soda-tartrate of potash, consequently the inference of the
adverse party cannot be just.
    Having as briefly as I deemed proper, commented on the
opposing evidence, and set forth in a different !i«ht my own,
I must pay due respect to the other parts of the ingenious
Answerer's paper. If it shall appear that the only difference
in the Tcsults of the inquiries by the two parties worth par
ticular notice is with respect to the alkaline matter, I sub
mit to the chemical public, whether or not Dr. M. could
with common discretion have published his memoir with
out a reference to his predecessor, as he observes he could
have done with propriety ; and especially as he owns he
was directed to the alkaline impregnation by my paper and
 conversations.     Dr. M. complains that he is at a loss to
 understand my meaning, and is much embarrassed by my
obscure and -inaccurate manner of writing.           I am grieved
 that mv learned friend should experience these difficulties ;
 but as I have not heard similar complaints from others, I
 may, perhaps, not indecorously venture to say that his
 claim to judgement of propriety and perspicuity in English
 is somewhat doubtful.
    The ingenious Opponent cannot agree with me that sub
 stances and properties of substances        are discoverable by
 operating upon large, which cannot be discovered with
 smaller quantities.    I really thought the proposition so ob
 viously true that illustration is needless.    Heaps of illustra
 tive examples in nature occur to my           mind   while T am
 writing, both in the department       of chemistry and physio
 logy.   If arsenous acid, muriate  of soda, or of sulphuric acid,
 be dissolved in the proportion of one part to 100 equal
 parts of water, they will be discoverable by well known re
  agents ; but if the proportion of water be increased more
  and more, the indication of their existence will become less
  and less distinct; and at last they will be no longer per
 ceivable, although it be known that they exist : or, if I take
  certain fractional designated parts of any given weight of
  these substances, they will elude manifestation by any
  means hitherto known.        On this principle of division and
  diffusion, the most deleterious poisons become innoxious
  by the minuteness of the quantity applied to the human
  constitution.    Hence atmospheric air containing fen mias
  mata, plague contagion, or variolous matter, 8cc. is ap

  plied with impunity to the human constitution.                     A ponnd
  of blood of a glandered horse transfused into a healthful
  horse cannot excite disease, but as much blood as can be
  transfused from two glandered horses into one horse can
  excite the disease of glanders.                Sugar, alkali *, &c. may
  exist in the     blood,    but  not   be    discoverable    by any known
  re-agent on      account    of  the    small     proportion of them ex
  isting   in  the  blood   at any given       time,  as 1 humbly reason,
  and not on account of an hypothetical new channel  a sort
  of north-west passage  from the stomach to the urinary
  bladder.       In the case of waters the proportion is so minute
  of various impregnating substances, that unless very large
  bulks be used they must escape detection.                  The great mas
  ters have accordingly employed such large bulks.                        Mar-
  graaf (Opuscules Chymiques,             t. ii.  p. 8.) did  not   evaporate
  100 drops of snow or rain water in a watch-glass capsule,
 like some modern microscopic chemists, but he operated
 upon 100 quart measures of snow-water, in which he was
 able to find only 60 grains of carbonate of lime, a few graini
 of muriate of soda, and traces of nitrous acid. I had the ad
 vantage of making my juvenile efforts to perform several
 chemical exercises            under that great master, Professor
 Black. Among other precepts treasured in the tablet of
 my memory for more than 30 years, was that of employing
 large bulks of mineral waters ; and of all other things in
 which there was a probability of minute proportions being
present. The reasons of Dr. Black for not practising ac
cording to this rule in the instance of the analysis men
tioned, I cannot pretend to assign j but it seems probable
that he was in possession of only a small quantity of the
material.         As to the magnitude of the masses of matter
required, it is impossible to specify them ; but it is obvious
that analysis must fail to develop certain substances, on
account of the minute proportion to other things with
which they are mixed not being susceptible of being made
evident to the senses ; and, in consequence, by a due larger
proportion they may be rendered sensible. Hence, per
haps, it is that we are ignorant of many of the properties
of light, calorific, electricity, of infectious and contagious
matters, &c.
     It i* argued against me, that ¦'' the chemical properties
    * In Dr. Rollo's work on Diabetes, I have related an experiment in which
potash was taken in such quantity that the urine became so impregnated
as. to afford a precipitate of snpertartrate on dropping into it tartaric acid ;
at the same time the blood did not indicate a trace of alkali; owing, as 1 con*
eluded, to the small proportion of alkali to the blood,
                                                                        which

which   belong to a particle of matter belong to the whole
mountain of the same substance."            True ; but I know no
thing of the properties of substances but by means of the
external senses (this indeed is an axiom); and unless the
particle be of a due magnitude, my organs of sense cannot
inform me in its properties. My honourable adversary
talks of the advantages of a small scale of operations in
the points of oeconomy and convenience.              Granted but
these are minor considerations indeed, to the acquaintance
with properties or acquirement of knowledge.             When Dr.
Marcet also speaks of the advantage in point of accuracy,
I protest against it for reasons above explained. It is
further represented that there is a degree of            " neatness
gained by reducing the scale of operations."          I own I have
difficulty to conceive a just sense in which this term may
be employed on this occasion.          Does it mean the avoiding
extraneous things occurring in operations ? If so, I cannot
separate it from accuracy ; and as it is seldom practicable
to operate without meeting with some extraneous matter,
or " dirt," it appears to me that many of those old che
mists who are reproached for mentioning " a little dirt" in
their results are more accurate than those modern chemists
who make up a " neat" tabular exhibition of the consti
tuents of substances in centesimal quantities which they
have never weighed, and even of which substances               there
is a palpable deficiency of proof.        If by neatness be meant
the instruments employed, it would be as injudicious               to
prefer neatness to knowledge, as euphony of style to per
spicuity.
    A proud list is displayed of discoveries achieved by
microscopic experiments, or on small masses of matter;
 but that was needless.       I never disallowed the utility of
 such experiments.       My plain answer is this  that for cer
tain purposes all the knowledge that is wanted is attainable
 and most easily by operations on the small scale  that such
is the nature of our present instruments, that it is only
practicable to work on small quantities of some kinds of
matter  that on almost all occasions it is advantageous to
commence an intended perfect investigation with experi
ments on small masses, in order to enable the mind to in
vent subsequent experiments and perform decisive opera
 tions on large quantities.       As to the successful practices
releired  to,  they only   manifest   that much may be accom
 plished  with  inferior  means ;  but  it is demonstrable that the
 same persons could have attained infinitely more by su

stances of adequate quantities.      In chemistry, T consider
illustration by examples to be superfluous.        Physic fur
nishes new illustrations analogous to the question under
discussion.    Sydenham without chemistry, with seemingly
little of anatomy and physiology, as well as of natural
history, has meritedly the credit of one of the greatest
Improvers:  if he could acquire so much without these
auxiliaries, it appears according to all reason that by means
of them much more would have been achieved. I might,
however, exemplify the advantages for which I am con
tending by the conduct of Dr. Marcet himself.         It appears
that he performed the analysis of two animal fluids, of the
component ingredients of which he has given an account,
to the one hundredth part of a grain, without finding potash
in any state. Subsequently, however, this alkali was de
tected in other animal fluids, the author's attention being
directed, as he is pleased to say, by my published paper, and
by my conversations.       Whether otherwise Dr. M. would
have found the potash, I must not determine.           Notwith
standing the sneering remark of his ounce or two of drop
sical fluids being in competition with my " two or three
pounds of " ropy sputum," I should be very unreasonable
if I were not, after this practical proof of the inadequacy of
Dr. M.'s method, to be well contented. If however, instead
of treading the primrose path of the new microscopic school,
he had condescended and submitted to the task of labour
ing in " the dismal, large, subterraneous laboratory       if,   T
say, he had been there employed, instead of in dalliance at
" the fireside his comfortable study," did not require
               of                            it
his talents to have done much more than nearly confirm
the results of my experiments on animal substances.           If
tooI    can see the future     in
                              the instant,  it will be only  by
experiments on very large quantities of the animal fluids
that discoveries can be effected of more of their impreg
nating ingredients  ;  on account of the very minute propor
tions in which they exist.
    Dr. Marcet thinks     itworth while to disclaim his me
moir as the joint work of Dr. Wollaston and himself.        I
cannot have the smallest objection indeed,
                                        :         by this gain

pelled^ me to consider this writing as  I have done.   I  must,
however, be allowed to cite single passage in justification.

Besides the advantages from Dr. Wollaston's writings and
conversations, Dr. Marcet owns " his kind personal assist
ance in this and other similar inquiries."
I     am accused of the unwarrantable license of " quoting

\h italics, and placing between inverted, commas, words
which have not been used by my adverse friend  such base
proceedings I am charged withal ! As for italics, I knew
no better than that all writers, for the sake of emphasis, do
employ them either for their own words or those of other
writers.     The word elegant so complained of is not in
tended as a quotation, it is my own word which Dr. Marcet
has mistaken.        As for inverted commas, the very few pas
sages they include, I think no 'one would apprehend are
his writing, except two or three instances.              Here I cannot
perceive any misquotation worth the slightest notice, being
of perhaps of a word or two only, except one passage.
There I confess the heinous offence, and express my con
trition sincerely, viz. for " fire-side of the drawing-room,"
in future read " the large dismal subterraneous laboratory
is now changed for the fire-side of a comfortable study."
     Again : my respectable adversary is offended with what
he is pleased to call irony.            I can do no more than declare,
whether I shall be again accused of irony or not, that I en
tertained more of respect than sufficient for subduing any
such humour.
     The last offence is jocularity not suitable for the ad
vancement of science.            If in such a vein I have written
offendingly, " T have shot mine arrow o'er the house and
 hurt a brother."       This mode of writing, however, has the
 high authority of a great poet and still greater philosopher :
   1               "            ridentem dlcerc verum
                                  "
                     Quid vetat ?   . .
     I wish I could be more frequently jocular^ as so many
 occurences in common life are experienced to make one
 sad.    Hence, I would rather live with Horace, than with
 the melancholy moralist Jaquez.                Some allowance, too,
 should be made for the differing natures of individual*,
 from the elements being so differently mixed :
            " Nature has made strange fellows in her time :
              Some there be of such vinegar aspect,
              That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile,
              Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable."
     The foregoing pages of rejoinder will, I trust, save me
 the   trouble of many intended remarks on Dr. Marcet's
 paper, independently of its relation to the questions at
 issue. A few comments only 1 now beg to be allowed to
deliver.
     J. The animal mailers in the fluids examined are stated
to be of two kinds, viz. coagulalle or albuminous matter,
     Vol. 39. No* 1 68. April 1812.                    U            and

 293                    On Animal Fluids.
and what the author calls muco- extractive.       I do not at all
 object to the experiments, but appeal to competent judge*
 whether it is not unjust to make this distinction.         The
 evidence of the coagulable matter is from the visible coagu
 lation by calorific and some re-agents; but if there be not
 a due proportion of it to the water in which it is dissolved,
 such evidence is not obtainable. This may be easily proved,
 and, as I apprehend, I have shown in my published papers,
 by a kind of synthetic experiment.        For example : serum
 of blood, or any other known coagulable fluid, may be so
diluted with water as to afford no distinct proof of its pre
sence by coagulation on applying calorific, although such
an effect may be reasonably inferred, on probable grounds,
from the disturbance of transparency or cloudiness.        And
as far as I have found by experiment, coagulable matter so
diffused, on being collected by evaporation to dryness, is
scarcely coagulable by calorific ; so that the whole of any
given quantity of animal coagulable fluid by such treatment
was rendered uncoagulable.        According to my trials, too,
there always remained, on coagulating serum and other
analogous fluids, a small proportion of animal matter dis
solved in the watery part, which differed in no respect from
the matter left on evaporating water, containing a certain
small or uncoagulable proportion of serum added to the
water, as above stated.      But these dilute solutions, which
appear uncoagulable,    denote  the presence of animal matter
to the test of tannin.     It was probably this property, and
the animal matter afforded by evaporation, which induced
some chemists to conclude that a different kind of animal
substance from coagulable, such as gelatinable, existed in
the serum of blood.        Hence T conclude, that the two
grains   of  what   Dr. Marcet   calls muco -extractive matter,
afforded by 500 grains of serum after separating 44 grains of
albumen or coagulable matter, is this matter rendered un
coagulable by dissolution. And hence too, I conclude, that
the animal matter in the other animal fluids which he ex
amined, was of one kind only, viz. coagulable matter, but
not demonstrable by its distinguishing property on account
of dissolution in a large proportion of water.
    2. Ammonia is not mentioned among the impregnating
ingredients. This is to me not surprising, for it is evidently
from my experiment in so small a quantity as to be undis-
coverable in the proportions employed.          If I could not
find by estimation above half a grain weight of it in seven or
eight thousand grains of animal matter, it was not likely to
be rendered evident in seven or eight hundred grains.

    3. Sulphate of potash. That a sulphate exists         I  per
ceived in my experiments, and have accordingly inserted it
among the saline matters in my published papers; but that
it is sulphate of potash I apprehend will not be allowed,
 to have been shown by    Dr. Marcet.
    4. Phosphate of lime, of iron, and of magnesia, are
enumerated     in the memoir before me. Of phosphate of
lime there is good evidence, as I have set forth, and coincide
in my results with those of the author, as well as that there
is probably phosphate of magnesia j also that there is iron :
but I was not able to infer that it was in the state of phos
phate, I only inserted it in my results as an oxide.          Al
though it is not essentially connected, it may be useful to
refer to a process which I offer as evidence against the com
mon opinion that the red and black colour of the blood is
owing to iron.     I have mentioned it in my lectures during
some past years.     The result is published in the Edinburgh
Medical and Surgical Journal, vol. vii. p. 124, for January
1811. I collected 1 10 grains of the red part of blood in a dried
state, by repeated ablutions from 10.000 grains or upwards
of twenty ounces of blood. By burning in a platina cru
cible it afforded, in weight, two grains and a half of a half-
fused brown tasteless substance.       By boiling in muriatic
acid a part was dissolved.      This solution was not stvptic
to the taste; it became blackish on adding tincture of gall
 nut, and on adding prussiate of'potash it afforded a deep
blue coloured precipitate, which did not yield on ignition
above half a grain of reddish brown powder.           Ts it then
            that twenty ounces of blood should derive its co-
  our from half a grain of oxide of iron ? I think proper to
firobable
speak of this result, at this lime, because it was published
anonymously, and because subsequently to its publication
I find it has been mentioned by other persons without ac
knowledgement; perhaps from not knowing this circum
stance.
    5. I found also indications of carlonale of lime and of
silica not enumerated by Dr. Marcet.        Future experiments
must however     furnish unequivocal  evidence.
    6. Muriate of potash inserted by the author instead of
potash united to animal matter, or to some other destructi
ble substance as I have inferred. On this question perhaps
more than necessary has been already said in the present
and former papers.
    7. Subcarbonale of soda asserted by the author has been
the subject of discussion at the same time as the last-men
tioned ingredient*. 1

    8. Muriate of soda.     Both parties agree in this being
the chief saline impregnation.
    It may be right to notice that I have employed the term
self-coagulalle   lymph instead of the usual one coagulalle
lymph; because the serum, another fluid of the blood, is
also coagulable ; not indeed of itself, but at a certain tem
perature, or on the admixture with certain substances. The
deposit spoken of by Dr. Marcet is not, I think, as he sup
poses, what I mean bv the term self-coagulable Ivmph.
    Although, if the cause of truth require      another com   it,
munication may be offered,        will be most agreeable to
                                      it
me, that   it be not found necessary. Considering the erro
neous inferences with which the writings of chemistry
abound     by men of the greatest celebrity,      shall on that I
 account find    source of consolation
                 a                        time show that am
                                                    if                     I
 the erring party.     hope too that this controversial discus
                          I
 sion may serve to promulgate knowledge,        inducing some  by
          to attend to the subject who might not otherwise
 Ecrsnns
   ave known the original papers.     If with these reflections
 my respectable adversary can be satisfied, the controversy
 will now be terminated        :

                         rs. E. P. aged 42, three months
gone with child, has had an umbilical hernia for 20 years,
as large as  full-sized teacup, but never found any incon
              a

                     it
the street,   boy ran against her, and struck her upon the
                a
tumour, which occasioned much pain. A neighbouring
surgeon and apothecary, who attended the family, was re
quested to see her.    She had sickness, vomiting, hiccough,
and constipation of the bowels      the pain, attended with
                                           ;                                      a
sensation of heat, was principally referred to the region of
the stomach. Aperients, opiates, and enemas were given:
the former were rejected         the stomach, and the latter

  pursued without benefit, and the symptoms increased till
  the morning of the 2d of July, when I was requested to
  see her.
     The operation was immediately recommended, and ac
  ceded to on her part. Indeed, I considered that too much
  delay had already taken place.
     The integuments over the hernia were very thin, and in
  close contact with the peritoneal sac, which was also very
  thin, and every where in contact with and adhering firmly
  to the omentum.         The omentum was partly torn through,
  and partly dissected from the peritoneal sac, and a consider
  able portion of it was removed before the convolution of
  intestine was brought into view.       The omentum was much
  inflamed, and in places approaching to a dark green colour.
  The convolution of intestine was very dark, nearly in a
  state of gangrene. The stricture was very deep and firm; but
  when dilated there was not any impediment to the return
  of the bowel: nearly the whole of the omentum contained
  in the sac was removed. The extent of the inflammation
  on the omentum and intestine, the latter appearing almost
  in a state of gangrene, induced me to observe to the gen
  tlemen who had rjeen attending the case,. that I was fearful
  that too much time had been lost, and that it was of the
  utmost importance to the safety of the patient, that the
  operation for hernia should be always performed early.
     July 3d. She had a natural stool, was free from fever,
  and continued to recover without any unfavourable sym
  ptoms. The wound was completely healed in a month, and
  she was as well as usual, and continued so till her labour
1
  came on at the usual time. The hernia then protruded and
  became      strangulated : she had sickness, hiccough, vo
  miting,    and   constipation.    She continued in this state for
  two-days,    when   she  was   safely delivered. The hernia was
  Still irreducible, and the vomiting and constipation con
  tinued till the next day, when the tumour lessened and the
  symptoms were relieved. At times she has had violent pains
  in the part, and the tumour has become tense and irreduci
  ble for a short period ; but these symptoms have generally
  subsided without any surgical assistance.        She could never
  be prevailed upon to wear a proper truss, though strongly
  recommended so to do.
     April 20, 18!2, 4 P. M. I was requested by her husband
  to visit her on account of her old complaint, of which she
  was now very ill. From his representation of the case I
  took my instruments, and Mr. Burn to assist at the opera
  tion should it be found necessary; in order that no time
                                  U 3                       should

should be lost.       We called upon the medical gentleman whot
had the care of the patient in this as well as in her former
illness, to learn the history of the case now, and to have
his assistance ; but he was from home, having left a mes
sage that      I  was to do what 1 pleased with her.                 On his
assistant referring       to his day-book,     it appeared     that  she was
taken ill with symptoms of strangulation on the 1 6th, and
visited by this gentleman on the 1 7th, when the symptoms
were very urgent, and the hernia irreducible.

    On the 18th the symptoms had not been at all relieved,

the former operation, was sent.

    A common glyster with one ounce of salts was now ad
ministered without any good effect.
    On the 19th all the bad symptoms were aggravated : an
other glyster of the same kind was administered, and some
castor oil which she had in the house was taken. She ap
peared at this time much worse; the castor nil was taken
in coffee in the evening, and remained on the stomach du
ring the night.
    On this morning          (4 A.M. 20th) the skin on the lips,
hands and feet, and on the hips and loins, was discoloured,
rather purple : another glyster was administered, and three
pills composed of jalapi 3i.                 Hydr. submurias grs. x.
were taken, and immediately rejected by the stomach.
Stercus matter was now vomited, and all the symptoms
indicated the greatest danger.             Yet it does not appear that
any means were taken to endeavour to obtain relief till
4 P. M. when I was first applied to, and visited her imme
diately*.                                                             '
    The pulse was low, weak, and irregular, at times the
beat scarcely perceptible ; cold clammy perspirations par

very dark colour : the skin on the face was nearly purple, and
on the lips almost black ; her strength was so much reduced
    The above
                 particulars were obtained from her husband, children, aod
herself, and also corroborated by the testimony of the axis tact to the gentle-
man who bad attended the case,
                                                                          that

that she was not able to turn herself or to raise herself in
bed without assistance.
    The tumour \va3 rather of a livid colour, not very tense,
but had that peculiar feel as if it was filled with faeces trom
a rupture of the intestine. There was but little pain in the
hernial tumour, or on the lower part of the abdomen ; but
above, and rather inclined to the left side, there was a small
part more tense and painful on pressure.
    After stating the extreme danger in which she was, both
to herself' and to her husband, I named the operation as
the only thing to be done, which could give any chance
for her life, and left it for them to decide; which they did
in the affirmative.
    The incision was made in the direction of the linea alba,
through the integuments, which were very thin and adhered
in every part to the peritoneal sac. There were about 3 oz.
of a straw-coloured fluid contained in the sac. The intes
tine was now exposed, being of a dark colour, almost
black. The peritoneal coat was abraded or ulcerated on one
part, to the extent of the size of a shilling : the stricture
was between three and four inches deep, requiring the
whole length of the bistoury : it was dilated a little both
above and below, in the direction of the iinea alba : there
was no adhesion or impediment to the return of the intes
tine, nor was any force required. When the stricture was
dilated, it appeared almost to withdraw itself into the ab
domen.
    The edges of the wound were laid together, and supported
by strips of adhesive plaster and a compress of lint; the,
whole confined by a common roller.
    The following medicine was Ordered, and two table
spoonfuls directed to be taken every second hour.

    On visiting her at nine p. in. four hours after the opera
 tion, the sickness and vomiting had entirely subsided. She      ,
 had taken three cups of tea, which she seemed to like. She
was still very cold, the clammy perspirations were not
 abated, and the skin was almost as much discoloured as       it
 was before the operation   :   but on the whole she felt her
 self relieved. The medicine was directed to be continued.
 She died at four o'clock in the morning, eleven hours after

with no small regret that I do relate' such cases, and that I
see no prospect of the number of these cases being dimi

cian can without delay have the advice of his colleagues,
the surgeon the immediate assistance of his professional
brethren, and the apothecary may have the advice and as
sistance of both physician and surgeon almost instantly ;
yet that wilful perverse desire of pursuing a routine of un
successful practice, of keeping the patient from proper as
sistance, for the purpose of making merchandise of his
maladies, by the sale of a few medicines, still prevails and
is equally disgraceful to the profession, as it is almost cer
tainly fatal to the patient.        In the instance before us, a va
luable parent was snatched from a numerous offspring,
surely hurried to an untimely grave by a want of that as
sistance which had been successful in a former case, ¦and
which would in all human probability have been again com
pletely successful, had it been applied in proper time.
    The operation for hernia is simple, and, when performed
with care, in proper time, is almost certainly successful.
    Few, if any, would be the fatal cases of this operation,
if it was performed sufficiently early*.'' The result of many
years practice, in which the number of operations on per
sons afflicted with this malady has been very considerable,
enables me to speak with well grounded confidence on the
success of thi3 operation.

XLIV.       Notice respecting the Geological Structure of the Vi
     cinity of Dublin ; with an Account of some rare Minerals
   found in Ireland. By William Fitton, M. D. Com
    municated by L. Horner, Esq. Secretary to the Geologi
    cal Society f.
The       following observations are      to be ascribed principally
to the late Rev.       Walter Stephens.      I communicate them to
the Geological         Society in their present imperfect form,
with    the   hope   that  they may attract the attention of minera
logists    to  the   country in the vicinity of Dublin; for they
are sufficient to show that very interesting information may
be expected from a correct examination            of  that district,     the
    Hey's Surgical Observations.

                                                                  situation

                   of the Vicinity of Dullin.                     305
situation of which renders it easy of access, and affords
many advantages to the observer.              I shall subjoin to a
brief statement respecting the geological structure of that
country, an account of some minerals of uot very common
occurence recently found in Ireland.
    The city of Dublin is placed in a flat country, at the di
stance of about three miles from the sea, and about five miles
to the north of a range of mountains forming the verge of an
elevated district which extends from thence for more than
thirty miles to the south. This district is bounded on the
inland or western side by a continuation of the plain of the
neighbourhood of Dublin ; and its breadth from the sea,
which forms its boundary to the east, is generally about
four-and- twenty English miles.
    The basis of all the plain to the north and west of the
mountains above mentioned, appears to be secondary (floetz)
limestone.
    The mountainous district itself is principally composed
of primitive rocks : it is traversed through its whole extent
by a broad tract of granite, which, taking its rise on the
shore at the south side of Dublin bay, crosses the county of
Wicklow in a south-western direction; being bounded by
incumbent rocks of great variety, the structure and relations
of which, as well as of the granitic mass, are in several
 places very distinctly exhibited.
    The relative extent of the space occupied by the granite,
 and by the rocks that occur between it and the calcareous
 country, and the general position of their boundaries, may
 be understood from the annexed sketch* ; in which it is to
 be remarked, that the places where the boundary is denoted
 by a clotted line remain still to be explored, the line having
 been there inserted only for the purpose of illustration.
    The granite has been observed in contact with other rocks
 at the following places in the counties of Dublin and
 Wicklow : viz. on its eastern boundary,  at Killiney ; at
 the southern extremity of the Scalp ; in the bed of the se
 cond streamlet which joins that oHhcPowerscaurtlVaterfull,
 above the fall ; from the neighbourhood of Luggelaw to the
 head of Loch Dan, and from thence to the upper part of
 Glmmacanass ; at Tviielagee ; at jighavanagh in the course
 of the military road about a mile to the east of the barrack ;
 and at the western branch of the Coolbawn stream on the
 north-west flank of the mountain Croghan Kinshe/af, The

                                                             boundary

  306              On the Geological Structure
 boundary of the granite on its northern and western confines
 is much less regular than on the east ; it probably com
 mences on the shore of Dublin bay between Booterstown and
 Blackrock, a mass of limestone having been observed there
 within a short distance of granite, but the rocks are con-
 cealed in the intervening space.      The granite comes nearly
 inio contact with limestone again, near the junction of the
 stream from Dundrum with the river Dodder a little above
 the village of Milltown ; and is visible near schistose beds
 in the course of the streamlet between Whitechurch and
 Ralhfarvham. It has been observed in contact with schist
 to the west of the Glen near the head of the Dodder,
nearly opposite to a little village called the Brakes of Glass-
vamucky, but from that place to the west and south, the
 line of boundary has been very little explored : it passes
however very near the granite quarries at Golden-hill, and
must run to the east of Poula Pliuca and the Glen of Holy-
 wood.     A junction occurs at Ballyroan on the south-west
 ern side of Kilranelagli-hill ; and granite has been observed
in that neighbourhood, to the ea3t of Kilranelagh at Knocka-
 derry, and to the south of it at Killalish, Kiltegan, Kilma-
 cart, and near the town of Carlow where the limestone
 appears,  at Brownshill.
    The slaty rocks incumbent on     the granite   in this country
 are very much diversified in their nature, and they have
 hitherto been very little examined.      On its eastern confines,
in the places above-mentioned, the prevailing rock is mi
 ca slate,  the beds of which in general lean towards the
granite,   their direction being nearly parallel to the line of
junction : rocks of the trap kind occur to the west in the
 neighbourhood of Ballinascomey, and at Kilranelagh; and
 columnar rocks of the same description have been observed
at Arklow-rock on the south-eastern extremity of the county
of Wicklow.
    The country around the village of Bray, which, like that
of Wicklow in general, is remarkable for the picturesque
beauty of its scenery, presents within a small space several
 very interesting geological appearances; and those observa
 ble at Killiney, first noticed I believe by Dr. Blake of Dub
 lin, will be found particularly deserving of examination :
the line of junction, which, as already mentioned, has been
 traced for several miles across the country, commencing on
the shore at the base of Killiney -lull, where schistose beds
 are to be seen to a considerable extent, reposing upon gra
nite.
    On the shore from thence to Dalltey, the granite is tra
                                                            versed

                            of the Vicinity of Dul lin,                      SOT
yersed  by numerous veins, many of which are. themselves
composed of granite ; and in several instances two such
veins, differing from each other and from the mass through
which they run, in fineness of grain, and in the proportion of
their ingredients, are seen to intersect, one not unfre-
quently deranging the continuity of the other's direction*.
The substance of which these veins consist is perfectly con
tinuous w ith that of the rock in which they occur, and the
surface of fracture passes through both without interrup
tion.
   The regularity of the line by which the granite is bounded
at Roches town- kill is highly deserving of attention.    "From
the top of ihe hill a very remarkable ledge of granite runs in
a straight line, for upwards of a quarter of a mile, extend
ing from a little below the summit on its south-eastern
side in a direction from N.N.E. to S.S.W.            This ledge,
which is elevated a few feet above the ground to the south
east of     it,
            appears to form the bo-indary of the granite. The
schist in this place seems to run up in          wedge-like form
                                                        a
between this ledge and another           little to the eastward,
                                               a
which      much less extensive than the former but corre
            is
sponds pretty nearly with           direction, its course being
                                         it
from S.W.         S.   by
                      to  N.E         by in
                                  N. and beyond this again
                                              ;
still further  to  the  east, another  wedge-like branch of the
schist runs up between this second ledge and the obelisk
hill."
   "   In   the annexed sketch        A   denotes the summit      of Roches-
town-hill; B, the first ledge of granite; C,                     the    second

  The whole of              the Greater Sugar-     Loaf mountain        is   com
posed of quartz         ;     and the adjoining   hill of Stile-bawn and
the rocks at the upper part               of the Dargle consist of the
same substance   which also
                        ;                  constitutes the mass of the

called " the Gold-mine" were situate on the north-east

    The     flat calcareous       country of the neighbourhood of
Dublin       is very widely extended in various directions : it
passes round the mountainous tract above mentioned at its
north-western angle, and reaches with little interruption,
in a southern direction, through the counties of Kildare and
Cat-low, to the foot of the hills of the Kilkenny -coal -district ;
and to the south-west, through the King's and
                                                                     Queen's
counties, to the foot of the Sliebh-blooni mountains.                       It
has also considerable extent towards the north and west.
     In the parts of this plain more immediately in the neigh
bourhood of the city, the prevailing rock is that variety of
limestone to which Mr. Kirwan has given the name of
 Calp, of which an excellent description and analysis have
been published by the Hon. Mr. Knox* :                       But in several
parts of the flat country, limestone of the ordinary kind
abounding in petrifactions is also to be met with.
     In the course of the river Dodder, between the village of
Milltoivn arid Classon's Bridge, the calp appears to alter
nate with beds. of granular magnesian-limestone in its cha
racters perfectly resembling some of the substances that oc
 cur in various parts of England, which are described as
affording a lime injurious to vegetation, in Mr. Teimant's
 very important paper
                                " on different sorts of lime used in
 agricidturef."        The      magnesian stone at Militown agrees
 with the calp and ordinary limestone of the adjoining
 country in containing petrifactions, although less com
 monly; and like them also it has frequently imbedded in it
 masses of siliceous matter, (the " Lydian stone," or a va
 riety of hornstone of Werner.)
     The beds of calp and limestone near Dublin, are in ge
 neral but little inclined to the horizon ; but they often ex
 hibit marks of dislocation ; and in some places are singu
 larly inflected, as is refnarkably the case with those observ
 able in the bank of the river Liffey, near the bridge at
 Lucan.

 calcareous      country   \  ;  the bcd3    of calp,   and of magnesian
 limestone, and the siliceous masses above mentioned, af

   the space occupied by limestone in several of the counties
   near Dublin.

   side of Dublin Bay, grey ore of manganese, and brown
   iron stone (Museum of Dublin College, Nos. 1067-S. 887.)
   have been obtained in considerable quantity: and a variety
   of the earthy-black cobalt-ore of Werner has been found
   by Mr. Stephens and Dr. Stokes at the south w est side of
   the hill, in the form of a coating of a rich blue colour, which
   incrusts the fissures of a rock of slate clay, nearly ap
   proaching       to whetslate       (Museum of Dublin College,
  No. 267) : Mr. Tennant has in this substance ascertained the
   presence of the oxides of cobalt and of manganese; and the
   discovery of it is important, as it indicates the probability
  of the existence of other more valuable ores of cobalt in
  that neighbourhood.

  have     hitherto been measured : the onlv published ob

      April   9th and   1 6th.   A    paper      was read on arsenic,  by
  Dr. Lambe of King's Road, Bedford Row, communicated
  by the late Dr. Garthshore.
<U+2713>     The principal object of Dr. L.'s labours on arsenic seems
  to have been to defend an hypothesis proposed hy him, a
  considerable time ago, in two successive publications,
  namely: " An Inquiry into the Origin of Constitutional
  Diseases," and "Reports on Cancer," in which the Doctor
  attempted to show the analogy between the action of putrid
  matter and arsenical poison.              The facts of most conse
  quence in the paper read as         above     to the Royal Society, are
  the    following  :
       1.  One part of charcoal was mixed with ten of white
  arsenic and twenty of nitre: after deflagration, no signs of
  carbonic acid could be detected, as would have happened had
  no arsenic been present.
      2. Small quantities of charcoal mixed with while oxide
  of arsenic had the same effect as upon many other me
   tallic oxides, producing carbonic acid nnd carbonic oxide.
      3. In the reduction of arsenic by. mixing white arsenic,
  half its w eight of subcarbonate of soda, and 1 th part of char
  coal, there appeared a peculiar gas in the early stage of the
  process. It could not be inflamed by a candle^ (mixed
                                                                   either

either with oxygen or common air,) but was inflammable
by electricity, and was thus conviriible into carbonic acid,
and a considerable portion of azote remained after the
inflammation.        The properties of this gas changed by being
kept   in a  phial  uncorked  : the  inflammable portion dimi
nished, and the residuum of azote increased.
    After this gas had come over, large portions of hydrogen
and carbureitcd        hydrogen were obtained.        They were
mixed with small portions of azote and oxygen to the end
of  the process.
    Besides these gases there was also carbonic acid in great
abundance.
    4. These experiments were performed in earthen retorts,
which might be suspected to permit some atmospheric air
to pass through their pores : and such appears on trial to
be the case.       For, on using glass retorts, the results were
considerably different.       The first products were carbonie
acid, and small quantities both of azote and oxygen, which
were left after the carbonic acid had been removed by lime-
water.     But towards the end of the process, instead of a
residuary portion of azote and oxygen, a peculiar gas waa
observed similar in many respects to that described.            It
could not be inflamed by a candle, when mixed with at
mospheric air, or with oxygen gas; but it inflamed by a
smart electric shock, and carbonic acid was produced.           A
more minute research detected also the production of nitric
acid from the detonation of this gas.            On this account
Dr. Lambe has given it the name of nitro- carbonic oxide.
    5. When this process was conducted in glass retorts,
not the smallest vestige of hydrogen or carbureited hy
drogen could be observed, which were so abundant when
the earthen retorts were used.         But still small quantities
 both of azote and oxvgen came over to the very end.
Water also appeared to be produced in every stage of the
process.

Capt. Heywood, communicated by Capt. Horsburgh, was

        Rev. T. W. Wpghte, M. A.            )
                      RUSSELL    INSTITUTION.
     In Mr. Bakewell's third lecture, he noticed the fractures
  and fissures in the earth's surface, which are filled wiih mi
  neral substances differing in quality from I he rocks or strata
  they intersect.    In travelling over an extensive ranee in a
  mountainous country, he observed 1hat the form and incli
  nation of the hills may present the same general resemblance
  for a considerable distance ; but we may sometimes perceive
  that in certain situations the s'aine kind of rock is thrown
 into a different position, and the strata are inclined in an
  opposite direction. When such a change of position occurs,
  then we may be aim 'St certain that a rent or fissure of the
  earth's surface has taken place, and that the continuity of the
  strata has been broken by some cau-e which has elevated
  one side and depressed the other.       These rents are called by
  miners dvkes or faults.     In the northern part of our island,
  they are Irequentlv filled with basalt or whinstone.        fn the
  coal districts of Yorkshire, ;ind in the midland counties,
  they are more frequently filled with clay.         In some situa
  tions, where these djkes occur in contact with coal, the coal

 appears charred on each side.         He stated instances of this
 in   the county   of Durham,    and  in  Shropshire.   Such phae-
 nomena appear to indicate that the basalt had been ejected
 into the fissure in a state of igneous fusion.
     The length to which dykes extend has in few instances
 been traced, owing to the upper part being hid by a cover
 ing of loose earth or soil. They vary in width, from 6 inches
 to 70 feet or more.        Their depth remains unascertained.
 Veins of granitic and other rocks occur also amongst pri
 mary mountains.
     Metallic veins resemble dvkes in their structure, but not in
 their contents, beinc filled with different metallic substances
 in a state of ore, and intermixed with various crystals
 and earths. Mr. Bakewell described the contents of many
 remarkable veins in England and other parts of the world,
 and the extent and depth to which they have been traced.
 He explained their inclination, position, and structure, by
 various drawings and specimens.          It appeared from his de
 scription,   that  the Eton  copper   mine   has been worked to a
           depth than   any other   mine   in  England, ore having
   een lately got at the depth of 236 fathoms, or 472 yards.
freater
Mr. Bakewell described the various states in which the same
metal is sometimes found in one mine, as native metal, or
as alloyed with other metals, or mineralized by oxygen, sul
phur, or acids.
    The lecturer proceeded to observe, that the question " In
 K what manner have metallic veins been filled with their
"    contents ?" has greatly divided the opinions of Geolo
gists.    Dr. Hutton supposed that mineral and metallic veins
have been formed by the breaking of the solid rocks from
the expansive force of subterranean fires, and their contents
ejected into them in a state of fusion from below.            Mr.
Werner supposes they are fissures produced by the shrink
ing or drying of the materials of which rocks are composed,
and afterwards filled from above by the metallic matter
in a slate of solution.       Both these theories, Mr. Bakewell
observed, were at variance with the appearances which mi
neral veins present.
    The favourable reception which Mr. Werner's system of
the formation of metallic veins has met with, was, he said,
a striking instance of the extent to which an attachment to
theory can be carried, and close the eyes of its votaries to the
plainest and most obvious facts.          Had metallic veins been
filled from above, by the metallic ores infused in a state of
solution, this solution must at one time have covered the
whole earth, and the ores deposited by it would have filled

                        Russell Instilut'ion.                    315
 all the valleys and cavities on the earth's surface, and would
 not have been confined to the narrow fissures or veins in
 which they are found. There are, however, he observed,
existing facts equally decisive against the theories of Dr.
 Hutton      and Mr. Werner respecting     the formation   of vein3.
 It  is almost universally found, that where a metallic vein
 passes through a mountain composed of beds or strata of
 different kinds of rock, the nature or quality of the ore
 varies in each kind of rock.      This is the case in Cornwall:
 where the same vein traverses grau-wacke or killas and
 granite, it is found to be more rich in the latter rock.         In
 Derbyshire,     the veins  of galena   which    pass through    the
 limestone rocks disappear in the basaltic amygdaloid by
 which the lime rocks are separated j or, if the vein passes
 through the amygdaloid, it very rarely contains any quantity
 of metallic ore. It is also found that different strata or
 layers in the same bed of lime rock are more productive
 in ore than others.       If metallic veins were filled by in
 fusion from above, or ejected from below, it is impossible
 that the nature of the rocks they traverse could alter the
 quality or quantity of their products.          This fact, though
 undeniable, has never, Mr. B. observed, been properly at
 tended to, and is alone decisive against the received opinions
 respecting the formation of metallic veins, and seems to
  prove that the rock itself has been in some manner opera
 tive in the production of their contents.
    Mr. B. observed, that the present si ate of chemical
 science did not admit us to form any decisive or satisfactory
 opinion on this subject, and he considered it much wiser
 to acknowledge our ignorance, than frame theories which
only serve to perpetuate error.        It is not at present fully
 ascertained, whether metals be simple substances, or com
 pounds : but this discovery, he said, must precede the
 formation of such a theory as will explain in a satisfactory
 manner many of the mysteries in the mineral kingdom.
    Some experiments which he showed, offered, he said,
 hints to future discoveries on this subject.        All the metals
are capable of existing in peculiar solutions, and some of
them (perhaps all) are also capable of becoming elastic in
visible gases when united with hydrogen, and can be made
to deposit the metallic contents in a solid form. In this man
ner they may have entered veins, and may have been sepa
rated from the substance of rocks, and decomposed by a
process analogous to that of the Voltaic electricity,            the
different sides of the vein acting like the opposite ends of
the    pile,

                       Geological Society.
    Mr. Bakewell observed, that much yet remained to be
done to improve the processes of metallurgy, and, what
was of more importance, to provide for the health and
safety of the persons who labour in mines and the reduc
tion of ore?. The immense annual sacrifice of lives in the
mines of Peru is a melancholy instance of the baneful ef
fects resulting from ignorance, tyranny, and avarice.        In
Mexico, according to late observation, the condition of the
miners is much improved.        Science, Mr: B. observed, had
eve'r been found the friend of man ; and when she' shall
dawn on those reg'ons, her beneficent effects will soon be
felt: she will teach him to supply subterranean works with
salutary currents of air, and extend his researches with safety
to far greater depths than have yet been explored.      Scien
tific pursuits are not, as some may imagine, unprofitable
speculations: thry have always a tendency to enlarge the
sphere of human power, to add to our comforts, and lessen
the evils of suffering huuninity.

presents of books and specimens was reported by the Se
cretary.
    A notice relative to the geology of the coast of Labra
dor, by the Rev. Mr. Sleinhauer, was read.
    The only accounts that have been hitherto published
concerning this part of the British dominions are the Me
moir of Mr. (afterwards Sir Roger) Curtis, inserted in the
Philosophical Transactions, and Mr. Cartwright's Journal.
    The Moravian Missionaries in 1 772 established in this
country their first settlpment, called Nain, in lat. 56 38';
and subsequently Okkak in lat. 56° 43' ; and Hopedale
in lat. 55° 3fi'. In the <ourse of the last year thev doubled
Cape Chudlei'ih in lat. 60° 20', and descended on the west
ern side of the same promontory as far as lat. 58° 36'.
    The leisure of the Missionaries, when opportunities oc
cur, is employed in collecting materials for a natural his
tory of the country ; they have kept tables of the thermo-
metrical and barometrical variations, have procured speci
mens of most of the mtive vegetable productions, and have
from time to time sent over specimens of such minerals as
attracted their notice.
    The general aspect of this dreary region is that of bare
and barren rock towering in craggy eminences, and of sandy
                                                       marshes,

marshes,     on    which are found a few pines and 'brush
wood and aquatic mosses.         In several parts of the country
the rocks are intersected by chasms, running generally in
a right line to a considerable distance, which when covered
witli snow form dangerous pitfal.s. The highest moun
tains extend along the eastern coast : the elevation of one
of them, called Mount Thoresby, has been ascertained by
actual measurement to equal 2*33 feet, and a few others
probably attain the height df 3O00 feet.
    From the islands near Cape Cliudleigh the Missionaries
have sent specimens of large-grained pale granite with gar
nets.     The island of Aumiitok in lat. 59D 207 Consists
entirely of a crumbling garnet rock, in which hornblende
sometimes occurs.         The mountains about Nachwak Jiay
furnish lapis ollaris.
     On the south of the high land or Kiglapyed in lat. 57°
the district commences          where the Labrador felspar is
found:     this  mineral occurs  not only in rolled stones on the
shore,   but    in spots in the  rocks in the neighbourhood of
Nain, and particularly in the rocks bordering a lagoon
about 60 miles inland, in which Nain North river termi
nates.     The same district also produces the hypers tene or
Labrador hornblende.
     At Hopcdale a limestone occurs from which have beeu
 procured specimens of reddish limestone, of calcareous spar,
 and of a variety of schiefer spar.
     The country to the west of Cape Chudleigh, as far as it
 has been explored, is called the Ungava; and abounds with
 red jasper, with haematites, and with iron pyrites.
     April 17 .  Two communications were announced, and
 the receipt of various books and specimens was reported
 by the Secretary.
     An account of the brine springs at Droitwich, by Leo
 nard Horner, Esq. Sec. Geol. Soc. was read.
     The town of Droitwich has been noted for the manu
 facture of salt during at least a thousand years ; but no de
  tailed account has hitherto been published of the natural
 and chemical history of the brine springs from which it is
                 The brine springs are in the centre of the town,
  Procured.
    eing situated in a narrow valley through which the small
  river Salwarp flows.     The prevailing rock about Droitwich
  is a fine-grained calcareo argillaceous        sandstone of a
  brownish red colour, with occasional spots and patches of
  a greenish I lue.     At Doder Hill in the immediate vicinity
  of the salt pits the rock appears to be a stratified sa: dstone
  of a greenish gray colour, and more indurated than the red
                                  X&                         rock.

rock. It also differs from this last in containing slender
veins of gypsum.
   No new brine pits have been sunk for the last thirty
years : the only particulars therefore concerning the strata
covering the salt, which Mr. Horner has been able to ob
tain, are derived from Dr. Nash's History of Worcestershire,
and from an inhabitant of Droitwich who was on the
spot when the last pit was sunk.           From these authorities it
appears that the depth of from 35 to 45 feet below the sur
face is occupied by beds of gravel, of red marly clay, and
of blue and white stone. To these succeeds a bed of gyp
sum about 105 feet in thickness,                immediately below
which    is  what  is  called the  River  of Salt ; which is a stra
tum    of  nearly saturated   brine  22  inches  in depth, lying on
a bed of rock salt, the thickness of which is unknown, no
 borings have been sunk in it to a greater depth than five of
six feet.    In constructing the pits, the method is to sink a
shaft about eight feet square into the gypsum, and then to
         this ted by a borer four inches in diameter : the
  orer is known to have passed through the gyp3um by its
Eierce
suddenly dropping 22 inches, the depth of the River of
Salt.    As soon as the borer is withdrawn, the brine sud
denly   rushes  up and overflows at the mouth of the pit.
   There are only four pits at present in use, and the an
nual quantity of salt which they afford is about 16,000
tons.
   The brine from all the pits is perfectly limpid, and when
in a large body has a pale greenish hue similar to that of
sea-water. To the taste it is intensely saline, but without
any degree of bitterness. The specific gravity differs in the
different pits, probably on account of the greater or less
accuracy with which the land springs are stopped out :
 that of perfectly saturated brine is equal to 1210-39 (wa
 ter being 1000); that of the five pits examined by Mr.
 Horner was found to vary from 1206- 11 to 1 1 74-7 1 ;
 and an evaporation afforded from 2289*75 grs. to 1922 97
grs. of entire salt, dried at 180° Fahr., in a pint.
    This salt, from a careful analysis, appears to be com
 posed   of
                      96*48 muriate    of soda.
                        1*63 sulphate   of lime.

 the strength of the different brines is nearly the same ; that
 the Cheshire brine contains rather a larger proportion of
 muriate of soda; that the Droitwich brine is free from car
 bonate of lime, oxide of iron, and muriate of lime, all of
 which are found in the Cheshire brine; and finally, that
 the latter is free from the sulphate ofsoda which is con

     At  the meeting of this Society on the 7th of March, the
 Secretary read an u Essay on Sponges, v>ith descriptions of
 all the species that havfe been discovered on the coast of
 Great Britain," by George Montagu, Esq. of Devonshire.
 From Mr. Montagu's researches as to the constitution of
 sponges, it appears that no polypi or vermes of any kind
 are to be discerned in their cells or pores : they are, how
 ever, decidedly of an animal nature ; but they possess vi
 tality without perceptible action or motion.            Mr. Monta
 gu   has  divided   the  genus Spongia     into  five  families, viz.
 branched, digitated, tubular, compact,               and orbicular.
 Only fourteen species were previously known to be British.
 Mr. Montagu iu this communication described no fewer
 than thirty-nine.       A considerable number of the species
 are quite new, or have now for the first time been distin
 guished and formed by that indefatigable naturalist.
    At the same meeting Dr. Yule read a memoir on the
 natural method in botany, in which he defended the ex
 istence of the series of natural affinity in plants against ob
jections of Professor Willdenow and Dr. Sm'th, founded
on the want of regularity in the series, &c.           He contended,
 that the illustrious author of the artificial system never in
 tended that it should supersede, but, on the contrary, that
it should lav the foundation of, the natural classes,*' quas
 plana genera nondum dc-tecta revelabunt ;" and that with
this view he uniformly inculcated the study of natural ge
 nera, in conformity with li 3 great maxim, " Omne genus
naturale."
               THE fclRWANIAN SOCIETY OF DUBLIN.
    A new Philosophical Society has been established in
Dublin, on a plan somewhat different from those already
existing in that city.       Its object is, to promote the cultiva-
                                           and other branches of
natural history ; and it means to concentrate its attention
to these pursuits exclusively.

    The members, desirous of paying the greatest and onl?
tribute of respect in their power to the venerable and illus
trious Mr. Kir wan, long distinguished in the first rank of
philosophers,    for a long continued course of labours
equally useful to the world and creditable to himself, have
resolved upon establishing themselves      under the name of
the Kihwanun Society.
    The Societv, except during the maimer vacation, holds
its stated meetings once every fortnight.
    Communications      on subjects connected with the above
sciences will be received and read to a meeting of the So
ciety : for this purpose, a meeting will be even summoned
at any time during the summer vacation.           The more ef
fectually to ensure the right of anteriority to any original
communication,      the day of its receipt will be registered in
a book kept tur that purpose.
    In order that immediate publicity mav be given to such
communications, with the author's permission, an abstract
is to be sent to the Editor of the Philosophical Magazine
for publication in his succeeding number. Further, the
communication itself, if deemed of sufficient merit, is to
be published at full length in the Transactions which the
Society intends to conduct.
    The Society will gratuitously circulate concise printed
directions, for the selection of such important or rare mi
nerals as may promote the progress of mineralogical know
ledge. These directions shall be particularly calculated for
drawing the attention of the less experienced, to such spe
cimens as indicate the vicinity of metallic veins or other
mineral treasures.
    Any person having in his possession minerals, with the
nature.of which he is unacquainted, may have them ex
amined, or, if of sufficient importance, even analysed, by
 transmitting them to the Secretary of the Society.
    A set of instruments for mineralogical observation or
research will be always kept in readiness by the Society,
for the use of those who have not such already in their pos
session, and who may be deemed likely to pursue such in
quiries with advantage.
    Such are the present objects of the Soeiely, and they
 will no doubt in time be extended so as to become more
 generally useful.    A fuller statement w ill, we understand,
be shortly published in a Prospectus.

 shall be given in our next.

          CURIOUS AND INTERESTING EXPERIMENT.
A.T      Edinburgh* Professor Leslie has just succeeded in
freezing quicksilver by his ffigorific process.     This remark
able experiment was performed in the shop of Mr. Adie,
optician, with an air-pump of a new and improved construc
tion, made by that skilful artist. A wide thermometer tube,
with a large bulb, was filled with mercury, and attached to a
rod passing through a collar of leathers, from the top of a
cylindrical receiver. This receiver, which was 7 inches wide,
covered a deep flat bason of nearly the same width, and con
taining sulphuric acid, in the midst of which was placed
 an egg-cup half full of water.        The inclosed air being re
duced by the working of the pump to the 50th part, the
bulb was repeatedly dipt in the water, and again exposed to
evaporation, till itbecatne incrusted with a coat of ice about
 the 20th of an inch thick.       The cup, with its w ater still un
 frozen, was thememoved, and the apparatus replaced, the
 coated bulb being pushed down to less than an inch from
 the surface of the sulphuric acid.        On exhausting Ihe re
 ceiver again, and continuing the operation, the icy crust at
 length started into divided fissures, owing probably to in
 being more contracted by the intense cold than the class
 which it invested ; and the mercury having gradually de
 scended in the thermometer tube till it reached ihe point of
  congelation, suddenly sunk almost into the bulb, the gaga
  Standing at the 20th of an inch, and the included air being
  thus rarefied about 600 times.      After a few minutes, the ap
  paratus being   removed,   and  the bulb broken, the quicksilver
  appeared a solid mass which bore the stroke of a hammer.
 The temperature of the apartment was then 54° of Fahren
  heit.
     In another experiment, with a small spirit of wine ther
  mometer, under the same circumstances and the same degree
  of rarefaction, the cold produced was found to be "0iJ below
  nothing, or more than 30° below the point usually assigned
  for the congelation of mercury.
     We understand that Mr. Leslie, from the commencement
  of these inquiries, confidently expected to be able -to freeze
   quicksilver by such a process.        In January last year, he
   maintained a cold within a degree of mercurial c^n<rel'"i'>n
   during the space of eight hours ; but his air pump not being
   then in perfect order, and some other parts of the apparatus
   being likewise defective, he was induced to defer the experi
   ment for some time.
                                                                    It

    It is evident that such prodigious powers of refrigeration,
 and which     will no doubt be further improved, open a wide
field for philosophical investigation.      Liquids which have
hitherto resisted congelation may yet be rendered solid,
and gases convened into liquids.
    Theatre of Anatomy.  Lectures on Anatomy, Physi
 ology, Pathology, and Surgery, by Mr. John Taunton,
F. A.S. Member of the Royal College of Surgeons of
London, Surgeon to the City and Finsbury Dispensaries,
 City of Loudon Truss Society, &c.
    In this Course of Lectures, it is proposed to take a com
 prehensive view of the structure and ceconomy of the
living body, and to consider the causes, symptoms, nature,
and treatment of surgical diseases, with the mode of per
 forming the different surgical operations ; forming a com
 plete course of anatomical and physiological instruction for
the medical or surgical student, the artist, the professional
or private gentleman.
    An ample Geld for professional edification will be af
forded by the opportunity which pupils may have of at
tending the clinical and other practice of both the City and
Finsbury Dispensaries.
    The Summer Course will commence on Saturday, May
the 23d, 1812, at eight o'clock in the evening precisely,
and be continued every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday,
at the same hour.

Meteorological Observations made at Clapton in Hackney,
              from March 21, to April 20, 1812.
    March 21.  S.E. Fair day, with cirrus scattered aloft,
tnd cumuli lower ; also cumulostratus formed. Much cloud
by night, with faint lunar corona.
    March 22.  S.E. Clouds in different stations ; fine pe-
troid cumulostratus in the afternoon, followed by slight
showers : much cloud at night with rising wind.
    March 23.  E.S.E. Overcast day; rain, with wind in
the evening, which continued through the night.
    March 24.  N.E. Snow and rain fell early j the rain kept
falling nearly all day.
    March 25.  N.E. Snow which fell during night soon
melted after sunrise j fair, with light cirrous and cirro-
cumulous clouds above flving cumuli; some showers of
snow fell during the day ; the night very clear and cold.
The thermometer fell to 28a of Fahrenheit.
    March 26.  Very clear morning, the wind N.E. ; above
it blew another current from the N., and still higher one
from the E. ; this was ascertained by a small balloon which
my brother launched at nine o'clock.       The day continued
cold with clouds, and the wind became stronger.
    March 27.  Cold easterly wind, and chiefly clouded sky,
nimbification in some places.
    March 28.  Warmer, clouded nearly all day, with
westerly wind and gentle showers at times.
    March 2p  Temperature increasing, vaiious modifica
tions in different heights ; sky chiefly clouded j some light
showers.
    March 30.  Very warm gale from S.W. ; various clouds
in different heights, with frequent nimbi, one in particular
about six o'clock in the evening poured such hard rain
that many ditches overflowed and flooded the gardens and
 fields.
    March 31.  Clouded sky, and cool easterly wind again :
 rain came on in the night, and the wind got to the south.
    April 1.  S.W. Overcast and hazy morning ; afterwards
the haze cleared and the sun came out at times; there
were however mas;y clouds in different heights, and a little
 rain at night.
     April 2.  S.W. Misty and overcast, followed by some
 small rain.
    April 3.  S.W. Mazy, clouded, and windy, followed by
 some rain ; clear evening, with various clouds.

     April 4.  N.E. Cloudy morning,        afterwards fair and
iralm, with various clouds.
     April b.  Wind very calin and variable ; cumulostratus
prevailed through the day; in the afternoon gentle nimbi ;
a sort of confluent cirrocumulus disposed in rows appeared,
 in the fair intervals, above the cumulostrati, which pro
duced rain by inosculation.       Birds singrand gnats and flies
appear.
      April 6.  Chiefly cloudy and hazy.
      April 7.  S. S.E.  E. Cloudy) followed by rain, but it
 held up again at night.
      April 8. E. Some rain early; when it cleared, several ill-
 defined modifications as usual.      Clear and very cold night.
      April 9.  E. Clear morning ; it afterwards became
  clouded with cumulostratus, and other defined clouds;
 none of the modifications have lately been well marked.
      April 10.  Clouds with fair intervals ; wind various.
      April 11.:  Cloudy day ; towards evening thick nimbi-
  form haze threatened rain, which however, did not come
  down ; wind gentle arid various.
      April 12.  E.  W. Cloudy morning, and fair afternoon,
  with light fleecy masses of cumulus apparently diminishing
  by evaporation, and nearly stationary ; lower down fibrous
  cirri passed along in a gentle gale from the west.      This is
  an inversion in the general order of clouds worth notice ;
  in the evening features of cirrostralus.
      April 13.  Cloudy morning, fair afternoon; clear and
  cold easterly wind ; cumulus and cumulostratus.
      April 14.  Cold easterly wind, rather lofty masses of
   cumulus through the day ; in the evening cirri passed over
   from the west, some of them opposite to the setting sun
   showed a fine red colqqr : cirrostratus also observed ; very
   clear cold night.
      April 15.  S.E. This morning a veil of cirrus taking
   on here and there the cirrocumulative form, while cumuli
   of various degrees of density and various figures rolled un
   der. The fall of the barometer and irregular strength of the
   wind indicated a change of weather ; but the day continued
   fair, and the night particularly clear.  The blueness of the
   sky, however, was not so great this afternoon as in the
   morning.
       April 16S.E. Early,    a confused veil of cirrus appeared
    spread aloft, while cumuli sailed under, and produced cu
    mulostratus, which obscured the sky. In the course of the
    day nimbi formed in different places, and a few drops of
                                                              raia

rain    fell  at    four o'clock.       The night     became     dark and
windy.
   April 17. N. Cold wind and much cumnlostratus.
    April IS.  N.E. Cold day ; sun om at times : cumu-
loslralus,     and     some      nimbi   which   poured   a  little  snow.
Flimsy confluent cirrocumulus             by night.

the one kept at Gordon Castle, ihe residence of the Duke
of Gordon, the other at Kitifauns Castle near Perth.
    I think, a more general publication of such results than
what has heretofore taken place, would be of infinite use to
meteorological science, by inducing gentlemen more par
ticularly to exert themselves to keep regular journals of the
pressure and temperature of the atmosphere ; thereby ob
taining, in the course of a series of years, a more perfect
average knowledge, by which to judge of the changes that
are to take place jn the weather.
    I beg to say, that I have tiis Grace the Duke of Gordon's
 sanction for sending his Table.

XLVII.    Biographical   Sketch   of the late Maxwrll Garth-
         shore, M.D. F.R.S.        & S.A.M.R.I.,      Wc.
Impartial     records of the principles and manners of di
stinguished   characters   have long been considered as the
writings   most   beneficial  to society.     They often unfold
those original traits, and even eccentricities, which contri
bute to modulate or give a bias to the characters of suc
ceeding sons of genius.        It has also been laid down as a
general proposition, that the literary portraits of such per
sons should rather be drawn by their friends than their
enemies, because good men are much better than even their
friends believe then to be, and bad men much worse than
even their enemies suppose them.          The position will appear
more defensible, if we insist on the portrait being sketched
from nature, as indispensable to the fidelity of the likeness,
and admit that all human judgement is biassed and partial.
Hence, in one case the credible portion of good will be re
lated, in another the incredible quantity of evil concealed,
and society be equally benefited by the details.         The cha
racter of the preeminently good, however, still suffers in
 public estimation ; the mass of mankind reluctantly admit
the existence of any thing better than themselves, and the
 general disposition to reduce every thing to our own stand
 ard acts as a counterpoise to the ascendency of mere moral
 goodness.    Without, therefore, either attempting or ex
 pecting to raise the popular criterion of human character,
 we shall only endeavour to relate facts, or state opinions^
 with that simplicity and respect for truth which become
 the subject.
    Dr. Garthshore was born near Kirkcudbright on Novem
 ber 9, 1731 (new style), and died in St. Martin's Lane,
 London, March 1, 1812.          His father was a clergyman of
 the church of Scotland; he published some detached ser
 mons, which, although perhaps inferior in literary merit to
 those preached in Scotland at the end of the 18th, are cer
 tainly much superior to any contemporary one delivered at
 the close of the 17th century.           That he xvas a man of
 learning, talents, and profound piety, cannot be doubted ;
 and the excellent moral principles which he early inculcated
 in his son were remembered by him with filial gratitude to
 his last moments.      The salutary effects indeed of an en
 lightened piety, in both father and mother, were happily
 displayed in the whole life of their son.           But these are
 topics foreign to the nature of this work, which aims at
 recording only what has reference to human science or art.

 The   same cause renders it necessary to omit all minute ac
 counts of genealogical or family alliances, and not that they
 are unimportant in themselves,              as most men owe much of
 the best part of their characters to their ancestors.                If any,
 indeed, despise such things, it must be that their names
 have never been known, and that they are still unworthy of '
 being known.          Against Scots family pride the shafts of
 licentious satire have often been directed ; but till reason
 finds a better auxiliary to human virtue, cool judgement
must acknowledge its expediency, and sanction its tempered
 existence.      While man continues to be influenced by ex
 ample,
           "  the virtuous son of a virtuous sire" shall always be
 the glory and the benefactor of his species.                Of this truth
 the deceased was perfectly sensible, but not vain-glorious :
 its mention, therefore, in this place is rather to illustrate the
nature and principle of human action than to indulge in any
 laudatory reflections on family dignity. The name of Garth-
 shore, it is believed, is now extinct, although it was once
 known and distinguished in the North. A few years ago
 the Secretary to the Society of Antiquaries (Mr. Brand)
 read a curious grant of an estate by an Earl of Buchan to a
 Mr. Garthshore of Garthshore, a parent of the subject of
 this memoir.        Some of the particulars are recorded among
 the transactions of learned societies in the Philosophical
Magazine.
   , The education of Dr. G.            was marked by that practical
 solidity    which    characterizes the Scottish schools.                 His
 knowledge      of  the   classic   and    modern      languages    was    ge
 neral and comprehensive ; and he could read, write, or even
 speak them with considerable ease and perspicuity.                        His
medical studies were directed                 by    the   once    celebrated
 Cullen ; but unlike the modern fry of M. D.'s, he did not
graduate before learning to reduce his theory to practice
with safety, before he haa acquired more real knowledge from
his own observation than falls to the lot of the majority of
London physicians.            His reputation for skill, assiduity and
humanity had extended over several of the northern coun
ties of England prior to 1764, when his inaugural disserta
tion* " De Papaveris Usu, tarn noxia quam salutari, in
Parturientibus ac Puerpens," procured him the Edinburgh
 academic honours of a doctor of physic.                  This dissertation
     Several German writers on
                                   opium have quoted this thesis with appro
bation, »nd it may be observed that it appeared long before the Brunonian
theory had any existence.    The salutary effects of laudanum in certain stages
of child-bed are now universally admitted. Professor J . C. Starke, of Jena ,
in 1781 noticed Or. G.'s opinions of the use of opium, as a respectable au
thority, in his medical dissertation on this subject.

              the lale Maxwell Garthshore,   M.D.          331
is dedicated with much gentlemanly good humour and un»
feigned respect to his early and unchangeable Wend the
late Sir George Baker, and does no discredit to the author's
head or heart.      All his friendships, indeed, being disin
terested, were permanent, and he had the happiness of dis
covering near the same period the talents^ and patronizing
the merit, of the late Dr. Pulteney, who at his instance
obtained an Edinburgh degree without having regularly
attended any college lectures.      It would, we fear, be a
vain effort to look for such exalted principles of friendship
among any three living physicians, as what distinguished
during their respective lives Sir George Baker, Dr. Pulteney,
and Dr. Garthshore. All of them were fortunate practitioners:
but Dr. Pulteney realized a lanre fortune in a country town ;
Dr. Garthshore distributed one to the poor of the metropolis:
the former devoted his leisure hours to botanical researches ;
the latter to patronize, science, and support scientific or
humane institutions.
   After Dr. G. was established as a practising physician in
London (about 1764) and a licentiate of the Royal College of
Physicians, he became a Fellow of the Royal Society and
of the Society of Antiquaries, the meetings of which he
regularly attended, and was not perhaps absent one night,
except the two meetings previous to his death, during the
last 40 years.    His insatiable desire of knowledge and his
intellectual energies continued to the last ; he read every
new publication of merit either on medicine, chemistry,
general science or divinity ; and he was familiar with all
the new discoveries in natural philosophy, anatomy, or the
practice of medicine.      Many of the modern novelties, in
deed, he could trace to their original authors; the curious
and obscure work of Wallace on the numbers of mankind,
which perhaps gave birth to the famous Essay on the prin
ciple of Population, he had examined when writing on
 " Numerous Births;" and the internal use of cantharides,
 which has been brought forward as an original discovery in
 the loth century, he well knew was ably discussed by Dr.
Greenfield, a physician of the 17th, and strongly recommend
ed by him in gleet, leucorrhoea, &c.     The revived doctrines
 respecting the functions of the liver, use of digitalis, sea
 bathing, &c. were equally known to him from their original
 sources. Hence, he was at all times able and willing to avail
 himself of every thing plausible that was offered as likely to
 mitigate
      ~
           the sum of human suffering, or improve the healing
 art.   Yet, notwithstanding his indefatigable and extensive
 j                              Y2                     reading,

  332                   Biographical  Sketch  of
  reading, his vast field of observation, his natural prompt
  ness and extraordinary accuracy, joined with habits of
  acute correct reasoning and judicious reflection, he pub
  lished but comparatively few works on professional sub
  jects. Hi9 experience and practice were very considerable,
  as the relief of the poor deeply engaged his feelings, and
  drew from him those interesting accounts of "Two cases of
 retroverted uterus," addressed to Dr. Hunter, and pub
 lished in the 5th volume of " Medical Observations and
 Inquiries," 1776; a " Case of difficult deglutition occa
 sioned by an ulcer in the oesophagus;" and of a " Species
 of erysipelas followed by gangrene which appeared in in
 fants at the British Lying-in Hospital."            The last two
 cases were described in the first and second volumes of
 ** Medical Communications,"
                                      published by Johnson in
 1784 and 1796. His " Observations on extra-uterine cases,
 and on ruptures of the tubes and uterus," which appeared
 in the Medical Journal, vol. viii. for 1787 ; and also a pa
 per read to the Royal Society, and published in its Trans
 actions for that year, on " Numerous Births," demonstrate
 his intimate acquaintance with both nature and art, his
Applicable knowledge of all that had occurred in his own
              or that of his friends or correspondents in Paris,
Sractice,
    lontpellier, Italy, Vienna, Germany, and St. Petersburgh.
But, unlike the modern case-coining physicians of literary
notoriety, his time was too much occupied in professional
practice, in conscientiously discharging the duties of a
m£decin expectant, to waste it in transcribing and polishing
his journals for the press: he was actuated by a different
spirit; the recovery of his patient engrossed his whole care
and attention, without any regard to literary fame; the
production of a flowery narrative, the rounding of a period
for some new publication, or multiplied editions of a trea
tise on a fashionable disease (for among the doctors fashion
is as paramount as with the milliners and mantua-makers)
in order to afford opportunities of repeatedly advertising his
name, were considerations very far beneath hitn.          In this
age    of speculation   and adventure  such  things,  however, are
too common ; but the interests of society require that they
should be stigmatized, and that the memory of those who
virtuously spurned them should be endeared.           The sons of
Britain sigh under the dire effects of modern charlatanism ;
and should the manufacture of physic doctors continue to
flourish as it has done of late, all the apprehensions of Mr.
Malthus and his votaries, respecting overgrown population,
                                  v i                        must

               the late Maxwell Garthshore,   M.D.         333
must vanish, and sink under the manslaying operations of
medical artifice.     The sword has cut off its thousands, the
doctors their tens of thousands.
    But the natural history of medical practice during the
last 50 years is too intimately allied with the venerable   life
of our octogenarian, and too honourable to his talents as
a philosopher     and his probity as a man, to be wholly over*
looked in this brief sketch.       Dr. Garthshore lived to see
the rise and fall of the spasmodic theory and of antispas
modics, that of the antiphlogistic regimen, phlebotomy,
diffusible stimuli, drastic purges, gases, digitalis, and even
stramonium ! The curative powers of all those sovereign
remedies, and many more, which owed their existence to
the sanguine imaginations of speculative enthusiasts, have
sprung up, flourished for an hour, and sunk to lasting obli
vion.     While popular attention, however, was occupied
 with these phantoms, the true indications of nature were
 entirely neglected, and all our knowledge of her ceconomy
 remained as stationary as if the chemist's laboratory or the
 apothecary's shop had been the real seat of every disease.
 Hence the great merit of Dr. G.'s practice, which was
 peculiar, original, and efficacious far beyond vulgar belief.
 Well knowing the impotency of drugs, and the imperfection
 of human knowledge, (which in medicine has not one fea
 ture that can aspire to the characttr of scientific,)        he
 studied nature, identified himself with his patient in family
 digressions or friendly inquiries, discovered his latent sym
 pathies and idiosyncrasies, ensured his perfect confidence
 by his suavity and tender attention, engaged his feelings,
 relieved   his mind, .and restored him rapidly to health,
 strength, and improved moral character!         In doing this,
 however, he was far from neglecting any other means
 which could possibly contribute to the relief of his patient ;
 hut he never considered them as alone sufficient, without
 his own personal care and gratifying attention.       The na
 tive benevolence of his heart, indeed, impelled him to use
 every possible resource for the relief of the suffering, and
 his long experience added to his means, and even to his
 zeal in applying those means.         That he was eminently
 successful will, we believe, be readily admitted by all disin
 terested persons capable of judging.     Considered as an ob
 stetrician, his talents and success peer above all competi
 tion ; and he formed a distinguished exception to the truth
 of the general observation, that all accoucheurs are super
 stitious.    Were we called upon to write an epitaph on
 his tomb; we should «ay, " Here lie the mortal remains of
                              Y3                         a most

334                Biographical  Sketch of
a most charitable and benevolent man, who combined the
scientific talents of the philosopher with the exalted purity
of the Christian, and cured more patients and killed fewer
than any other physician of his age and country." Being
a most conscientious man, he was a diffident practitioner,
and he always administered powerful drugs or known poi
sons to his patients with a caution and personal care which,
for the sake of humanity, we wish were more generally
adopted or universally imitated.
   With an active, vigorous, and independent mind, it was
not to be expected that he could entertain respect for those
corporate bodies which have no internal stimulus but self
ishness, no principle of science but puerile innovation,
and which are otherwise remarkable only for their rapid
transitions from a state of morbid somnolency to that of
the wildest enthusiasm or the most scandalous quackery.
During his life also he was decidedly hostile to those in
terested combinations of men ycleped " Medical Societies;"
all of which were anxious to insert his respectable name in
the lists of their members ; but they were often obliged to
make very humble apologies for the liberty, and never re
ceived from him anv sanction in their sordid projects of
extending individual practice. To his immortal honour it
must be recorded that he never founded nor patronized any
such bodies; and all those modem conspiracies against so
ciety which are organized by the more ambitious and arro
gant to enable them to prey on the more simple practi
tioners, by assisting them in paying the expense of adver
tising theimamt s under the mask of Medical Transactions,
he conscientiously and openly condemned.       Yet, whatever
could by any honourable means contribute to the advance
ment of science, or the improvement of the healing art, in
variably and promptly received his active support.          It
was not in his nature, indeed, to refuse assistance to any
measure honesily designed for public utility; but his per
ception was too quiclt, anil his judgement too correct, to
be deluded by any false pretences of visionary good.
   Asa liberal patron of science his memory will long be
cherished by its votaries : his attention to the Royal So
ciety, and his extensive support of the Royal Institution,
evinced his zeal in the general cause of knowledge ; while
his Mondav evening conversations, conducted on the most
laudable principles, contributed to diffuse useful truths,
scrutinize mtdical or scientific facts, bring philosophers
and men of taste into habits of mutual communication,
and destroy all those petty jealousies, narrow-minded pre

judices, and envious broodings, which too often disgrace
 the professional character. For these and many other good
 services to genuine philosophy every friend of science will
 heave a grateful sigh to his memorv, and at the same time
breathe a prayer for the protracted life of his right honour
 able and steady friend, the worthy President of the Royal
 Society.         Both kept open houses for the learned of all na
 tions, both devoted their lives and fortunes to the meliora
 tion of their species, and both have obtained the esteem
 of great and good men. The patronage of Sir Joseph,
 indeed, has been much more extensive and more glorious,
 but could not be more zealous, than that of Dr. G. ; and
 the latter, often regretted the inadequacy of his means,
 which prevented him from being more directly useful to
 the general progress of philosophy.                Even his age did not
 abate this propensity; but his zeal for science never led
  him to forget the sufferings of the indigent or unfortunate,
  and during the latter part of his life he distributed in pri
 vate charities, and subscribed to humane institutions, above
  a thousand a year, besides his gratuitous prescriptions and
  advice to the poor.- Nor was this the consequence of in
  stantaneous feeling, the mere impulse of the moment, but
  a fixed principle of action, the discharge of a Christian
  duty ; and it is now known that at an early period of his life,
  and when his fortune was very limited, he gave in one
  charitable donation to the full amount of a year's income 1
  To practise rather than to speak of beneficence was his
  uniform principle, and his generous heart and hand always
  gave to the utmost extent that his cooler judgement could
  approve.        His habits of life were the most exemplary and
  regular. At four o'clock every morning he commenced his
  studies in his library till a few days before his death : this
  was the time allotted to write his Diary, which he kept near
  60 years.        His temperance was scientific, his ceconomy the
  result of rational reflection * and extensive charities to the
   distressed ; and          perhaps no physician in London ever
   contributed so liberally, and with so much extreme delicacy,
   to the necessities of the widows, orphans, or indigent rela
   tions of his professional brethren. So numerous indeed
   was this class of pensioners, and so liberal was his assist9

                                  may be some persons ignorant enough to cen

   lity of discriminating what should be the conduct of a philosopher and a
   Christian from that of a common parvenu.        Such, indeed, is the progress
   of extravagant luxury, that some vulgar minds begin to think it a necessary
   duty !

 ance to them, that even     if the disappointment of dishonest
 expectations should absorb the noble emotions of gratitude,
 the painful feelings of their loss must draw forth involun
 tary tributes to his memory during the remainder of their
 lives.   Viewed as a philanthropist, as a man of talents,
 whose genuine simplicity and graceful ease made him
 equally the lriend of the poor and of the great, his charac
 ter rises the more it is investigated ; and if we examine his
 domestic piety, his clear and rational conviction of the
 great truths of Christianity, we shall perhaps long look
for a greater and a Letter man in any age or country.           To
 youth he was a most able and propitious friend: his meek
 ness rendered him lenient to their foibles, his sagacity an
 ticipated their wants, while his purity checked the recur
rence of evil propensities.      Had he possessed less virtue, he
 would have appeared a greater man ; had he been more
ambitious, vain, or reserved, his reputation might have been
higher, but his merits and talents less.        Like all conscien
tious men, he was extremely diffident j in many cases, even
with all his knowledge and experience, he hesitated where
a forward and thouchtless youth, or an impudent and ig
norant quack, decided with all the dogmatism of unprin
cipled impostors.      The horrid sentiment of * Kill or cure*
never once found a place in his mind, as he could find in
those cases no such satisfactory evidence of cures as of
deaths. He was, indeed, fully sensible of the degraded
state of medical practice in the metropolis, as well as the
imperfect knowledge of medicine, and he zealously assisted
Pr. Harrison in all his attempts in the sacred cause of me
dical reform.      Even the case of a man dying in an English
hospital by the bile of a snake, he justly considered as a
stigma which every honourable practitioner should labour
to remove, by qualifying himself to prevent the recurrence
of a similar catastrophe. In this he was consistent, as well
as in the whole tenor of his life.         His last moments also
were worthy of himself; and in the judicious distribution
of the very moderate fortune which he left, he did not rob
his relations and friends to gratify any posthumous vanity
by popular bequests.

wise authentic and correct, states, either in consequence of
a typographical error or wilful misrepresentation, that the
Doctor died worth 55,000/.          Every person who wishes to
know the     truth  may  learn,  by applying at the proper office,
that the whole amount of his property was only about

    explored, on the Water of Brora, in the Valley S of
    Clyne, near the SE Coast of Sutherland in Scotland, ex
    tracted from Capl. John Henderson's Agricultural
    Survey of the County of Sutherland, just published.
Coal has been bored for, and found on the banks of the
river Brora, on the Sutherland estate, and a shaft is now
sinking, to the depth of 250 feet, (a particular account of
the strata is annexed,) under the superintendance of Mr.
William Hughes, an eminent engineer from North Wales.
Salt will be made, as has formerly been done in that vicinity ;
ironstone may be found, (appearances of it being observed
in boring for coal,) and the shores abound with limestone.
    Mr. Telford has seen, and given his opinion as to the
best mode of searching for, and working the coal at Brora.
The work is carried on, (as above stated,) under the di
rection of Mr. William Hughes, who has had much ex
perience in such undertakings, and has been employed on
the Caledonian Canal since its commencement.

Though        springs impregnated with salt occur in several
parts      of   the Cheshire
                        plain,   may be remarked that the

 rock-salt itself has only been worked into, near the banks
 of the Weaver and its tributary streams.      was first dis     It
 covered at Marbury near North wich, about one hundred

                the Cheshire Rock -Salt  District.          339
and    forty years ago, in searching for coal. This bed of
rock was the only one worked for more than a century,
when, in the same neighbourhood, a second and inferior
stratum was met with, separated by a bed of indurated clay
from the one previously known. This lower stratum was
ascertained to possess at a certain depth, a great degree of
purity and freedom from earthy admixture; on which ac
count, and from the local advantages of Northwich for ex
portation, the fossil salt is now worked only in the vicinity
of this place.
    This local limitation of the mines precludes the possibi
lity of many comparative remarks which might be interest
ing to the geologist; and in giving a particular description
of the rock-salt formation, I must confine myself in great
measure to the facts which present themselves in the neigh
bourhood of Northwich, explaining first the circumstances
of general position, Sec. and then entering into the more
minute particulars of the mines which have been sunk into
 these important strata.
    The rock-salt of Northwich occurs, as I have just men
 tioned, in two great strata or beds, lying nearly horizontally,
 but on different levels, and separated, the superincumbent
 from the subjacent stratum, by several layers of indurated
 clay or argillaceous stone. These intervening beds possess
 in conjunction, a very uniform thickness of ten or_ eleven
 yards, and are irregularly penetrated by veins of the fossil
 salt. Though the evidence on the subject is not entirely
 of a positive nature, there seem strong grounds for believing
 that the beds of rock-salt at Northwich are perfectly distinct
 from any others in the salt district, forming what the Ger
 mans would call Uegende stocke, lying bodies or masses of
 the mineral.      It will readily be conceived that there is
 much difficulty in acquiring precise information with re
 spect to the extent and limitation of these great masses,
 and that there are many sources of error to which such an
 inquiry is liable. There are, however, a few leading facts
 upon which dependence may be placed, and which will be
 admitted to furnish fair grounds for deduction.
     It would appear that the great beds or rock-salt at North
  wich assume a general longitudinal direction from north
 east to south-west, the line which has been traced upon
 them in this direction being a mile and a half in length,
  and no direct evidence existing that they may not extend
 further in these points ; while their transverse extent, as
 measured by a line at right angles to the former, is much
 jnore limited, probably not exceeding in any place one thou

 340         A  Sketch  of the Natural History of
 sand  three hundred or one thousand four hundred yards:
 Several circumstances concur in giving probability to this
 statement. Let two parallel lines, drawn from NE to SWf
 with an intervening distance equal to about half their
 length, be employed to designate the supposed extent of
 the subjacent rock-salt.    In a mine which approaches very
 nearly to the eastern limit of the area thus formed, the
 upper bed of rock-salt was actually worked through in an
 horizontal direction on this side, and discovered to be going
 off with a very rapid declivity.    A similar fact has been
stated with respect to another pit further to the south on
 the same line of boundary ; but as the mine was destroyed
many years ago by the ingress of fresh water, this statement
is considerably more doubtful than the former.        It may be
 remarked too, that in sinking for brine a little beyond, or
 out of the area, on this side, the brine met with is of a very
 weak and inferior kind, and at a short distance altogether
 disappears. Appearances leading to the same conclusion
 of the sudden termination of the body of rock-salt occur
 on the opposite side of the area marking its extent.       In a
 mine at the northern extremity of the western line of
 boundary, a shaft situated nearer to this line is fifteen yards
 deeper than another shaft immediately contiguous,           ap
parently in consequence of the rapid sinking of the rock-
salt at this point.  In most of the pits on this side, the
upper bed of rock is met with at a depth of from thirty to
forty yards ; yet at Barnton, a mile further to the west, and
on the same or a lower level, none was met with in a sink
ing of one hundred and fifteen yards.
    Corresponding appearances have been observed in the
body of rock-salt which occurs at Moulton, between Wins-
ford and Northwich, where in two sinkings on the same
level, and at the distance of one hundred yards from each
other, the difference in the depth at which the rock was
found, was nearly twenty yards, a circumstance from which
the limitation or going off' of the bed at this particular
point may reasonably be inferred.        As nothing further,
however, is ascertained with respect to the extent and di
rection of this particular body of rock-salt, I merely men
tion the fact to corroborate the statement given of the limi
tation of the great beds at Northwich.
   Another important observation with respect to the North
wich rock-salt is, that there seems to be a progressive
thinning of the upper bed of salt from NW to SE, or in a
direction nearly at right angles to the longitudinal extent of
the stratum.     Though much uncertainty exists with re
                                                           spect

               the Cheshire Rock-Salt District.            341
spect to the rate and progression of this decrease, the ge
neral fact seems to be sufficiently confirmed by observations
taken from different mines.       In those which have been
¦unk near to the western or north-western side of the area
before described, the thickness of the upper bed has been
very generally twenty-eight, twenty-nine, or thirty yards.
Proceeding towards the east "or south-east, we find this
thickness decreasing to twenty-five yards, and in the mines
near the eastern boundary the bed of rock-salt comes down
to twenty, eighteen, and even seventeen yards in thickness.
It will be observed that this thinning takes place in a ge
neral direction from the nearest sea coast ; the thickest
part of the body of rock being situated furthest down the
Weaver, and just above the contraction which takes place
in the valley of the river at Anderton.
    Besides this general variation of surface in the superior,
stratum of rock-salt, it has been found that there is a con
siderable irregularity of level on its upper surface. In one
of the mines, in which a tunnel was carried one hundred
yards along this surface, many small risings and depressions
were met with ; and similar appearances have been observed
in the other mines near Northwich.
    The depth at which the upper bed of rock-<sa!t is found,
though varied by several of these circumstances, depends
 principally, of course, upon the surface of the ground above,
which at Northwich, from the confluence of streams there,
is somewhat irregular. In the greater number of the mines,
it is met with at a depth varying from thirty-five to forty
yards. The smallest depth at which it has been found is
 in a mine situated close to Witton Brook, about half a mile
 above the entrance of this stream into the Weaver.       Here
it appears at twenty-nine yards from the surface ; and a
 general estimate of level from this mine shows that the
 upper surface of the salt is at least twelve or thirteen yards
 below the low-water mark of the sea at Liverpool ; a fact
 perhaps not wholly unimportant as regards our ideas of the
 formation of this mineral.
    The thickness of the upper bed of salt at Northwich has
 been already stated to vary from twenty to thirty yards :
 that of the lower bed has never yet been ascertained in any
 one of the mines in this district.     The workings in this
 lower stratum are usually begun at the depth of from
 twenty to twenty-five yards, and are carried down for five
 or six yards, through what forms, as will afterwards be
 mentioned, the purest portion of the bed.        In one of the
  mines a shaft has been sunk to a level of fourteen yards

342           A    Sketch    of  the  Natural History of
still lower, without passing through the body of rock-salt.
We have thus an ascertained thickness of this bed, of about
forty yards, and no direct evidence that it may not extend
to a considerably greater depth.
    Though only two distinct beds of the fossil salt have been
met with at Northwich, it has been ascertained that the
same limitations do not exist throughout the whole of the
salt district.     At Lawton, near the source of the river
Wheelock, three distinct beds were found, separated by
strata of indurated clay ; one, at the depth of forty-two
yards, four feet in thickness ; a second, ten yards lower,
and twelve feet thick; and a third, fifteen yards still further
down, which was sunk into twenty-four yards, without
passing through its substance. Coal is found and worked
within two or three miles of this place*, and the only lime
stone known in the county of Chester is got from the hills
which here form the southern boundary of the plain.                      In
no   other  parts   of   the   salt district,  than   at Northwich     and
Lawton, has the upper bed of rock been worked through.
    The strata passed through in going down to the upper
bed of rock are nearly horizontal in position,                   and very
uniform in their structure, consisting in every instance of
beds of clay and marl ; and these, with the exception of a
few of the most superficial, appearing in similar progression
in each mine. The clays, or argillaceous stone, of which
these beds are composed, are indurated in different degrees,
tinged with various shades of red, blue, brown, See. and
usually contain a portion of sulphate of lime.                   They arc
known to the miners by the general name of metals; a
distinctive appellation being given to each from the shade of
colour which it assumes.            In the section of strata, given in
my Cheshire Report, these appearances are noted with some
degree of minuteness; and that they may more accurately
be known, I have sent a few specimens, illustrative parti
cularly of the induration of the clay strata, and of their
admixture with the sulphate of lime.                It will be observed
that, though these clays in general possess a considerable
degree of induration, there are some of them sufficiently
porous to admit the passage of water through their sub
stance. Where this structure of the clay occurs it goes by
the name of the sliaggy metal, and the fresh water which
makes its way through the pores has the expressive appella
tion of Roaring Meg. This term will not appear too strong,
when it is mentioned that in the mine from which the sec
tion of strata was taken, and where the shaggy metal was

water, ascertained to issue from its pores in One minute,
was not less than three hundred and sixty gallons ; a cir
cumstance greatly enhancing the difficulties of passing a
shaft down to the body of rock-salt.
    A portion of salt, sufficient strongly to affect the taste, is
found to exist in many of these beds of argillaceous stone :
and this saltness increases, as might be expeoted, as we ap
proach the body of the rock-salt.       In the strata or layers
immediately above the rock, which in all the mines are1
perfectly uniform in their appearance and structure, it is par
ticularly remarkable.     It may be observed, however, that
there are not in these strata any veins of rock-salt con
nected with the great mass below : on the contrary, the
line of division between the clay and rock-salt is drawn
with great distinctness in every instance, and presents none
of those inequalities which would arise from a mutual pe
netration of the strata.
     It may, I believe, be considered as a decided fact, that
 no marine exuviae or organic remains are found in the strata
 situated over the rock-salt.    I have indeed heard it asserted
 that there are a few instances in opposition to this state
 ment; but, upon minute inquiry, I do not find- that the
 accuracy of these alleged exceptions is in any degree to be
 depended upon.
     The general, I believe universal, occurrence of gypsum,
 in connexion with beds of fossil salt, is a fact worthy of
 observation.     This connexion appears in the salt mines of
 Hungary, Transylvania, and Poland, as well as in those of
 Cheshire, and it has led Werner to assign to the rock-salt
 and floetz gypsum a conjunct situation in his Geognostic
 System.     The gypsum, contained in the clays over the
 Cheshire rock-salt, occurs in varying proportions, and
 under different appearances in the several beds passed
 through.     It is found both in large masses and in small
 granular  concretions.    The compact, foliated, and fibrous
 varieties are all met with ; the last of these occurring in
 very considerable proportion.      According to Werner, the
 first or oldest floetz gypsum is that which has the most
 immediate relation to rock-salt.     I am not enabled to say
 whether the gypsum appearing above the Cheshire salt
 would be considered as belonging to this particular forma
 tion. The presence of the fibrous variety of the mineral
 would rather seem to place it with the second floetz gyp
 sum where this species is particularly abundant ; but no
 positive distinction can be derived from this circumstance.

 344            A Sketch of the  Natural History  of
I may    remark that gypsum has been met with in several
other parts of the Cheshire plain, in situations and with
appearances very similar to those in which it occurs above
the rock-salt.
          Interior Character of the Beds of Rock-Salt.
   Having stated the several facts which regard the extent,
thickness, and other general characters of the beds of rock-
salt at Northwich ; I shall now mention more particularly
the appearances exhibited in their internal structure, in re
lation to which some interesting observations occur.
   The fineness or purity of the rock is a circumstance very
important to the interests of the mining proprietor, and in
this point considerable varieties appear in different parts of
the strata.    The great body of the rock-salt, both in the
upper   and   lower stratum, is composed of crystals of mu
riate of soda, intimately mixed with certain proportions of
clay and oxide of iron, giving to the mass a red or reddish-
brown tinge; and, in addition to these constituent parts,
contains likewise certain earthy salts, the sulphate of lime,
and the muriates of lime and magnesia, but these in small
proportion.      In every part, however, of this compound
rock, we find separate crystalline concretions of muriate of
soda, variously disposed, sometimes occurring distinctly in
the cubical form ; in other places in masses of larger size,
and irregularly shaped.     The colour of these concretions,
which are of the foliated species of fossil salt, is usually a
grayish- or milk-white ; they are always translucent, and
often attain a considerable degree of transparency.          It
would appear that they contain the muriate of soda in its
purest form; the sulphate of lime in specimens of this
kind being scarcely distinguishable by the delicate tests
applied to its discovery.
   This finer rock-salt occurs not only in separate concre
tions, but also in veins intersecting the coarser mass, and
in the rims or borders of the polyhedral figures which will
afterwards be mentioned.        Its proportion varies both in
the two great beds of rock, and likewise in different parts
of the same bed ; and it is a regard to this circumstance
which determines the situation and extent of the workings
in the several mines. InJ.he upper bed this variety is less
considerable than in the lower : but here the substance of
the rock-salt is evidently purer three or four yards above
the lower surface than in other parts of the same stratum,
and continues so for about four feet.        In the lower bed,
the first twenty or twenty-five yards passed through contain
 \                                                      a pro

a proportion     of earth as large as in the upper stratum : at
 this depth, however, a greatly increased degree of purity
 appears, which is continued for .five or six yards further
 down, when the proportion of earthy admixture again be
 comes as large as before.
    It is invariably this purer portion of the lower bed which
 is at present worked in the Northwich mines, and the rock-
 salt obtained from             it,
                              being principally exported to the
 Baltic, obtains the name of Prussian Rock. The extent of
 the cavity formed        the workings varies in different mines
                           by                                       ;
 the average depth may probably be taken at about sixteen
 feet.   In some of the pits, where pillars six or eight yards
 square form the supports of the mine, the appearance of
 the cavity      singularly striking, and the brilliancy of the

 would almost appear to realize the magic palaces of the
 eastern poets.     Some of the pits are worked in aisles or
 streets, but the choice here         wholly arbitrary.
                                       is                  The me
 thods employed in working out the rock-salt offer nothing
worthy of notice.        The operation of blasting       applied to
                                                             is
 the separation of large masses from the body of the rock,
 and these are afterwards broken down                 by
                                                   the mechanical
 implements      in  common     use.     The  present   number of
mines       eleven or twelve, from which there are raised, on
            is
 an annual average, fifty or sixty thousand tons of rock-salt.
The greater part of this quantity         exported to Ireland and
                                            is

                                                      solution and
subsequent evaporation.
  It   is very doubtful whether in any instance the body of
rock-salt can be considered as stratified, or disposed in
distinct layers.      A perpendicular section does sometimes
indeed present irregular appearances df this kind, and more
especially in the purer part of the lower bed but the great

pearance observable on the surface of an horizontal sec

marked, and differing considerably in the forms which they
assume  ;   some appearing nearly circular, others perfectly
pentagonal, and others again having an irregular polyhe--

 figures  are  composed of extremely pure white salt, forming
 a division between the coarse red rock exterior to the figure,
and the equally coarse rock included within its area. These
bordering lines or rims vary from two to six inches in
width. The figures themselves differ greatly in size ; some
of them being less than a yard in diameter, others as much
as three or tour yards; and they very frequently are ob
served, one within another, gradually diminishing in size
to a centre.       Professor Playfair, in his Illustrations of the
Huttonian Theory, has stated, that the compression of these
figures is always mutual ; the flat side of one being turned
to the fiat side of another, and never an angle to an angle,
nor an angle to a side.       This remark, as far as my observa
tions have gone, is perfectly founded in fact.            From the
mode of working the mines, it is difficult to ascertain the
progressive appearance of these figures in a perpendicular
plane. It has been stated to me that their form is a pyra
midal one, the area enlarging by a determinate ratio of
increase as they are traced downwards ; but several circum
stances induce me to consider this statement as a very
doubtful one, and certainly founded upon insufficient evi
dence.
: One
          very important negative fact remains to be men
tioned with respect to the internal structure of the Cheshire-
rock-salt, viz. that no organic impressions or remains have
ever been met with in any of the beds of the mineral which
have been worked in this district.          This fact rests on evi
dence of a satisfactory kind, and I am not aware of more
than a single instance adduced in opposition to         it,and that
of very dubious nature. The same remark may be applied
    a
to the strata of argillaceous stone between the two beds of
rock-salt.     The veins of lock-salt intersecting these inter
mediate strata contain principally the fibrous variety of the
fossil.  It   may be remarked too of these strata, that at their
'unction    with    the upper and lower beds of rock-salt, the
] ines of  division   are nearly as distinct as that between    the
upper    bed  of  rock  and the superincumbent layers of argil
laceous stone.

salt.      The   best, or rather the only memoir on this subject
which I have had the opportunity of seeing, is one by
M. Hassenfraiz, contained in the eleventh volume of the
Annates de Chimie.              From this memoir it would appear
that the general situation of the rock-salt in Transylvania
and Poland is very similar to that which it occupies in
Cheshire; the beds of this mineral being disposed in small
plains, bounded by hills of inconsiderable height, forming
a kind of basin or hollow, from which there is usually only
a narrow egress for the waters.                   The situation of the
Austrian salt-mines near Salzburgh is however very dif
ferent.        The mineral here appears to be disposed in beds
of great thickness, which occur near the summit of lime
stone hills, at a great elevation above the adjoining country*.
This fact is a singular one; and, if wc admit the idea that
 rock-salt is formed from the waters of the sea, makes it
 necessary to suppose the occurrence on this spot of the
 most vast anil wonderful changes. M. Hassenfratz states
 it as a general fact, that in countries where salt-mines
 occur, fragments of primitive rocks appear in great abun
 dance over these beds.             It does not seem, however, that
 any deduction of importance can be connected with this
 fact.
     The disposition of the beds of salt in the continental
 mines seems to be very generally a horizontal one, and as
 in the English mines, they are separated by strata of clay of
 a varying thickness.            It would appear, however, with re
 spect      to  extent     of  dimensions,     that they are in general
 greatly     inferior   to  the  bodies   of  rock-salt    met with in our
 own island.          In Hungary and Poland these beds do not
  present a thickness of more than one or two feet, and are
  separated by layers of clay a few inches in thickness.
  Much, however, it is evident, must depend upon the num
 ber of the beds thus disposed, but this I do not find any
  where noticed.          The earthy saline contents of the foreign
  rock-salt very exactly resemble those of the Cheshire; the
  gypsum existing in much larger proportion than the other
  earthy sails, and appearing in considerable masses, both
  distinctly, and in mixture with lhe beds of clay.                   It is an
  important      fact,   however,     that   sea-shells   and   other  marine
     * l am informed by Mr. Greenough that the lapelsgraben, which is the
  highest gallery of the salt-mine at Hahtadt, is stated in Von Buch's Travel*
  through Germany and Italy to be tvyo thouuuid nine humlred and seventy-
  five feet above the sea, and that the salt mines at Hall in-the Tyrol are at a
  much more considerable elevation.

  348              A   Sketch  of the Natural Ftislory of
  exuviae    ire found in these beds of clay and gypsum ; a
  circumstance which, as I before stated, never occurs in the
   Cheshire mines.         It would seem that the portion of oxide
   6f iron combined with the clay in the substance of the
  English rock-salt does not exist in the mineral as found
   abroad, or at least in a proportion not so considerable.
      The comparative commercial value of the English and
   Polish mines is best ascertained by the fact that many thou
  sand tons of rock-salt are annually sent from Cheshire to
  the parts of the Prussian coast most nearly adjacent to the
  salt-mines; independently of the large supplies of the
  English manufactured white salt which are exported to the
  same country.
      Considerations on the Origin        of the Cheshire Rock~Salt.
      With     respect to the theory of the formation of rock-
  salt, as  applicable particularly to that of Cheshire, I shall
  not venture to say much, and that little will be of a general
  nature. Though it must be acknowledged that there are
  some difficulties connected with the supposition,                      little
  doubt can exist of the general fact, that the beds of this
  mineral have been formed by deposition from the waters of
  the sea. Such an opinion acquires much probability from
  the situation in which these beds usually occur ; occupying
  the valleys and lower parts of plains which are. so sur
  rounded by hills of secondary formation, as to leave only a
  narrow egress for the waters collected on their surface.
  This structure of the plain constituting the salt district of
  Cheshire, I have particularly described ; and, regarded in
  its general character, it leads strongly to the conclusion
  that the waters of the sea must, at some former period,
  have occupied the lower parts at least of the basin thus
  formed, which at that time had a level eighty or one hun
  dred yards lower than the one now appearing*.                        To ac
  count for the great depositions of salt in the lower parts of
. this basin, it is necessary to suppose that some barrier must
  fiave been afterwards interposed to prevent the free com
  munication of the waters of the sea with those thus col
  lected; and the general course of the streams, the position
  of the beds of rock-salt, and the contractions in the valley
  of the Weaver, which appear below Northwich at Anderton
  and Frodsham, point out with some distinctness the place
  where these obstructions may probably have occurred.
     * This general character of the Cheshire salt district was remarked to me
  by my friend Sir John Stanley, in reference to the formation of the rock-
  salt; on which subject he obliged me by some Very interesting observations,
  which are inserted in the Cheshire Report.
                                       '
                                                                            To

                the Cheshire Rock-  Salt District.          349
    To explain the appearance of the strata of indurated clay,
intermediate between the beds of salt, we must suppose that
the obstruction still continued, when the deposition of salt
from the waters first confined had nearly ceased ; and that
at this period the deposition of clay, which had hitherto
been going on in conjunction with that of the salt, pro*
ceeded in a great measure alone ; the salt w hich remained
in the water being merely sufficient to form small veins in
its substance. When these strata had been deposited to a
thickness of ten or eleven yards, it would appear that the
barrier preventing the access of the sea to the basin or plain
was again so far removed as to allow the entrance of a fresh
body of sea water ; from the gradual evaporation of which,
the formation of the upper bed of rock-salt took place ;
and there being then no further admission of sea water to
the plain, the superincumbent strata of clay and marl were
successively deposited in the order in which they at present
appear.
    This is a general sketch of the probable mode of forma
tion of the Cheshire rock-salt; but as it would seem very
doubtful whether any single accumulation of sea water
could contain the materials of depositions possessing so
great a thickness, the theory might perhaps be successfully
modified, by supposing the barrier before noticed to have
had such an elevation in the progressive stages of the de
position of the salt, as to allow the very frequent ingress
of sea water into the basin. Admitting this idea, we must
suppose that the formation of the strata of indurated clay
between the beds of rock-salt took place, either during some
intermission of these overflowings, or when there was a
great predominance of this earth in the water from which
the depositions were made.      It seems probable too that the
veins of salt intersecting these strata were formed rather by
 the penetration of water holding salt in solution, from the
upper bed of rock-salt, than by
                                      a direct deposition from
 the waters of the sea.    With respect to the sources of the
clay, cqmbined with the substance of the rock-salt, or
 found in intermediate and superincumbent beds, little doubt
can exist (hat it has been derived from the decomposition
of more ancient rocks, of the situation and precise charac
 ters of which no vestiges now remain.
    This general idea qf the formation of the Cheshire rock-
salt derives confirmation from the fact that, with the ex
 ception of the sulphate qf magnesia, the same earthy salts
occur together with the muriate of soda in these strata, as
are met with in the waters of the sea.       The circumstance
of the beds decreasing in thickness as they recede from the
                               Z  3                         sea.

350              A    Sketch   of the Natural History of
sea, may perhaps be admitted as another argument in be
half of the opinion.
   The principal objection to the theory undoubtedly        the                      is,
non-existence of marine exuviae either in the rock-salt or
in the adjacent strata of clay;    fact very difficult to con
                                              a
nect with the idea of     deposition from the waters of the
                                a
sea.     Other objections, though perhaps of less moment,
arise from the appearance of the earthy salts                  smaller          in
proportion in the rock-salt than               sea water; from the
                                                    in
apparently partial deposition of the beds, and from the
difficulty of explaining the formation of the figured ap
pearances which occur in the substance of the rock. These
circumstances, however, will                  by
                                          no means authorize us to
reject the general idea which has been given of the origin
of this mineral, strengthened as                    the situation and
                                                   it   is   by
appearances observed           the foreign salt mines, where the
                               in
proofs of marine deposition are still stronger than those
presented        the Cheshire district.
                 in
 I     confess    I see no sufficient reason for supposing the
action of subterraneous or internal heat in the formation of
the beds of fossil salt.        appears probable that deposition
                                 It                                         a
of muriate of soda from the confined waters of the sea
might have taken place without the intervention of this
agency, and there are no appearances either in the beds of
salt, or in the clays accompanying them, which render                                      it
necessary to have recourse to the supposition                question.      in
It must be acknowledged, however, that                     difficult to
                                                                  it       is
 give  a  satisfactory account of the consolidation of the beds
 of salt; nor do know any opinion on this subject, which
                      I
 can be considered altogether free from objection.            A more
 enlarged discussion of these theoretical points may be
 found in the Appendix to the Report of Cheshire, before
 alluded to.                                ¦ "

consider Drumglass, Dungannon or Tyrone Collieries, at
no great distance from the SW corner of Lough Neagh,
and near 300 feet I believe above its level, with a rapid NE
dip, to be in measures above the great Basaltic Rock, that
under-lies Lough Neagh : whether these Coat-measures
form a limited patch, or hummock on the western slope of
my grand Trough ? or, whether they are the exposed part of
more extensive carboniferous strata, covered in general by
alluvia or Bog ?     I submit to the decision of the able ob
 servers, which 1 am so glad to find, that our sister Island
can boast: I would however further remark, that 48 feet
      "
 of Clay and rubble stones," being found on the Drum-
glass Coal-measures, according to Mr. W. p. 246, these
 alluvial stones, according to Mr. G.'s notes, consisting of
rounded Limestone, Granite,           and other stones, seem to
favour the latter supposition, especially, as Coal-measures
 are intersected and shown by the Blackwater Valley, for half
 a mile above Benbervin Mill, near Clonfecle ; that Coals
 have been dug at Maydown         \ m. E of this, that near Newry
 on the Keady Road, a substance has been found " much
 resembling Coal in appearance," though " in a primitive
 Country," Granite being found at Newry, and there are
 appearances within half a mile of Banbridge in Down, that
 induced English and Scotch Colliers to try there for Coals,
  (Mr. G.'s Notes ;) all this I think tends to show, that the
 Coal-measures S of Lough Neagh are not of such small

354        Mr.   Farey's Statement         of Geological Fads
   The Ballycastle    Coal-measures may have appeared to
Mr. D.    to be elevated,  from his saying p. 75, that     the           "
Sandstone, which may be traced from the southern to the
northern extremities of the country, and which seems to
be the body, on which all the other strata rest, is here out
of its usual level, being as it were forced up from its na
tural place and hemmed in by Basalt, which it equals in
height :" which is founded it will be seen, on the supposed
identity of sand-stone (but which of them ?) in the Coal-
measures, with that in the Red Marl, page 273 herein, at
the SE extremity of the County. I think, on the contrary,
that a great fault or Gaw might be traced, from somewhere
near the mouth of the Ballycastle Valley*, eastward to the
coast, and that the corner of the trough and of the Island
beyond this, has sunk (or the other been raised, who shall
say which ?) very many hundred feet.
   Dr. Hamilton's account of these Coal-measures, taken
from the basset edges in the sea cliffs, for they have no deep
shafts, but use Galleries or Drifts only, as given by Mr. D.
p. 86, is as follows; viz.

   In the above account by Evans, it will be observed, that
Slate means Skale, Freestone means Grit-stone, in the lan-
        of the Derbyshire Colliers, and that the Notes in the
 ast column seem by some one else, whether Dr. H. or
f;uage
Mr. D. does not appear.
   Mr. Whitehurst gives no measures to the 14 strata which
he enumerates     (page 260) ; and the order and denomina
tions so materially differ from the above, that further and
more precise observations seem much wanting, in the lower
part of the series particularly.    Mr. W. if his scale has
any proportionality in      it,
                            shows the Limestone to be about
eight feet thick, and calls    "brown, containing no marine

Ironstone is found above the Coal here, Mr. D. p. 75 : the
dip is easy, to the south, p. 76 : some of the levels are 900
yards long ; a bed of Coal has been worked, by pumping,
below the level of the sea, p. 77: 100 men are daily em
ployed in these works, p. 78, and as might I think from
their number, be expected, are rather " lazy and indolent,"
p. 80.   Fine Potters' Clay is found near Fair-Head, Brick-
clay, excellent Firestone, Scytfie-stones of the best'quality,
and Glass Sand; and Quarries of excellent Freestone are
wrought in these measures, pages 84 and 85. Near Bally-

and unexplored part of these Coal-measures          to which
think may probably be referred, the " small eruption of

which this stone contains,     itwill not answer for making
limej    andI think   itvastly more probable, that these are
remains of the lower part of the Coal-measures, resting on
the Basalt, than parts of its understratum, elevated 1200 feet
or more; to say nothing of the dissimilarity of the sub

           The micaceous Limestone found at Toberbelly
near Ballycastle, which makes good Lime for mortar or for
manure, and is of the same quality with that used at Dal-
mully in Scotland," Mr. D. p. 68, probably belongs to these
measures.    The gray Limestone commencing at Lough-
gall in Armagh, Mr. D. p. 39, is probably that extending
to the neighbourhood of Armagh Town, already mentioned
page 281 herein, and belongs to the lower part of the Coal-
measures, on the great Basalt and not below it. The notes
of Mr. G. represent the Coal-field in Tyrone, as bounded
on the NW, by Limestone at Ruchan j that Benbervin
Castle stands on Limestone near the Blackwater River not
far from Clonfecle, and that three or four alternations of
Limestone, Freestone and Coal-shale appear, near that place ;
that at Desamartin in Derry, there are very large lime-
works in a bluish-gray          Rock (not white), and smaller
quarries of the same sort of stone at Cookstown in Tyrone.
     The Sandstone which occurs " between Broughshane
and Clough, near the centre of the County," Mr. D. p. 91,
probably is the remains of the lower part of the Coal-
measures below the Coal-seams ; and so may the same in
Rathlin or Raghery Island, Mr. D. n. 91, since I have not
heard of the actual existence of Coal seams there ?, a point
on which I wish information,           and of their position with
respect to the Basalt, if such appear.
   Fifth Alluvia or Water-moved and worn superficial mat
ters, in your 33d volume, page 199, Dr. R. speaking of a
 tract immediately to the southward of Kells and Connor
 says, " we here find a district near four miles in diameter,
 called the Sandy Braes : over this whole space the basaltic
 stratification has been carried off, and the operation has
 reached deep into a very singular substratum, a reddish
 Breccia, by some mineralogists called a Porphyry, the mass
 friable, but the component angular particles of extreme
 hardness. The Hills, of which this little district is full,
 are every one perfect segments of spheres, while the loftier
 basaltic hills that surround    it,   preserve their characteristic
 form,    to  wit,
                 a     gradual acclivity on one side, with a  steep
 abruption      on the  other." In Mr. D.'s App.     p.  33, Dr. R.
 says that this Breccia  is   an excellent material for Roads, and
 frequently     contains  Opal; at p. 49, nearly the same      isre
 peated;     to  me  notwithstanding,    the  evidence seems defec
 tive, of these knowls belonging to any regular stratum, but
 the probability much stronger, of what Mr. D. states, page
 34 viz. that they are Gravel, (or rather should say, rub
   ;                                         I
 ble knowls, the stones being angular, of extraneous alluvia),
                                                                and

358         Mr.    Farey's Statement         of Geological Facts
and he considers them as allied to the gravelly ridges, com-
mou in the south of the County, p. 34, particularly that
extending from Dunmurry to near Magheragall church,
p. 24.  T should inquire, does this singular breccia appear
in a ring, at the foot of the hills surrounding the denuda
tion ? as it ought to do, and pass under them on all sides ?
and what is the stratum under these knowls ? ; in short I
fear, that the Doctor's zeal has here led him a little too far,
in applying a favourite theory : while in enforcing the fact,
of a denudating agent having very generally acted from
above*, in his district -(vol. xxxiii. p. 204), he seems not
to have been aware of one of the most conclusive evidences
of its truth, that of faults or depressions of the strata not
occasioning a corresponding step or inequality in the surface!
and though much struck with the derangement of 30 or
40 feet in the face of the facade near Port Spagna, vol.
xxxiii. p. 106 and 197, vol. xxxv. p. 37 J, and others in the
Coal district, pages 372 to 374, it does not seem to have
occurred to the Doctor, to have traced any of the lines of
these faults from the edge of the cliff and along the surface
of the land, as in the Coal district would easily be done by
the information of the Colliers, as to where they have
    * Dr. Drummond, on the very incontestable evidence which Dr. R. hat
advanced to prove, not from a solitary spot hut from a Coast of GO miles in
length, and the greater part of the surface of the country which it bounds, that
a force acting from about has torn or carried off the greater part of the upper
strata (and into which evidence Dr. D. carefully declines entering), treats
the Reader of his Poem with the following remark: " What," says he " thi*
cause was, the Doctor leaves his readers to conjecture, and he is decided that
it was neither fire nor water.      Was the tail of Whiston's comet the besom
of destruction, with which our valleys were swept ?" All this, and much
more that precedes and follows, may serve to amuse, and to prove, how
much easier it is to give mineralogical names to substances, without hesitation
assign their order ef superposition, unsight, unseen, according to
                                                                             " The
Geognosy," and to write verses, than it is to make Geological observations,
and to reason thereon, in the able manner that Dr. Richardson has done.
    Though compelled thus again to flatter Dr. R., as he is pleased to term it,
in Mr. D.'s App. p. 51, 1 cannot acknowledge much fresh obligation, on ac
count of his inventing a denudating cause for me, of which I never spoke
or thought in my life! and there publishing     it, viz. *' that one of the dimiau-
 tire and newlv discovered Planets has, in some of its revolutions, come so
near to our Globr, as to have changed the direction of gravitation, and, in
i:s rapid progress close to our surface, to have carried off the materials we now
miss;" an opinion, so demonstrably contrary to the possible reciprocal action*
ot Planets on each other, or of Cornels on Planets, that     I     should be truly
ashamed of it, and introduce    it   here, only to disavow it; wishing now, as  I
have done in my Derbyshire Report, to employ myself with facts and visible
effects, and adjourn the discussion of causes, perhaps, until Dr. R. shall have
more extensively succeeded, in silencing the supporters of false theories,
against which he has so nobly commenced hostilities; now and thenlmay
perhaps find opportunity, to furnish him with little ammunition, from my
                                                  a
stores.
                                                                           easily

proved these beneath, (confirmation of which might be
easily obtained, from the principles laid down in my Der
byshire Report, i. 129, and your 33d vol. p. 263), and to
have shown, that none of these derangements materially
affect the form of the surface, but that what remains to
complete the pile on the sunk side of a fault,          is, as in the
case of the numerous hummocks, the proper and undis
turbed upper strata, that on the other side the line of fault,
are carried off and gone     !  ;   all this I  cannot doubt but he
might     have  shown,    from    my undeviating experience, and
that of all the many practical Colliers with whom             I  have
conversed but
            :    I    caution Dr. R. against suffering modern
slips of piles of strata, either into the Sea or the valleys,
from being unfairly urged as objections to this most asto
nishing and important Geological fact, with which             I   be
lieve no theory-maker before my time was acquainted, or
if   so, they seem culpably to have suppressed it.
    On subject connected herewith,
       a                                      I   cannot help again
noticing the seeming inconsistency of Dr. R. with resptct
to the alight Tablets of hard Strata,        if not " Stony ridges,"
to be seen and most assiduously attended to, in surveying
denudated districts, as hdve mentioned, vol. xxxiii. p. 262

and which he seems fully to admit,           in the mention of these

and the shapes of our hills, depend more than we are aware
of, on the materials composing them " App. p. 49 and          :
yet, the improper manner of expressing the 3d of Dr. R.'s
Geological facts (vol. xxxiii. p. 112) "and our surface             it
self are unconnected with, and unaffected          by    the arrange
ment of the strata below them," remains yet uncorrected,
and in Mr. D.'s App.       p.   40, Dr. R. even says, that an ob
 server " finds the arrangements of the component strata
have not the slightest influence on the form of our surface           :

  360        Mr.    Farey's Statement        of Geological Facts
  strata than the general mass, which I have mentioned aborey
  would well employ the attention of Dr. R. and other ob
  servers in Antrim, where I think, while inspecting Mr. D.'s
  Map, that I can perceive clearly their influence, in sepa
  rating the long and wide stripes of Bog, with which the
  western side of that County, from Lough Neagh north
  ward, is unfortunately encumbered : and that such stony
  ridges, might be traced northward to the top of the eliff,
  and into its face, to the facade which Dr. R. has so well
 described vol. xxxiii. p. 104.
     The readers of your 36th volume, p. 361 and 437, will
 have noticed, besides some important facts, as to the natural
 history of the extensive Bogs or Peat Mosses of Ireland,
 that our legislature had seriously entered on a scheme for
 effectually draining, in orderto aid the cultivation of the main
 of such Bogs : and I embrace the opportunity here of men
 tioning, that Dr. William Richardson, having long turned
 his attention to these Bogs, and to the making of accurate
 observations and discriminations, as to the causes and na
 ture of Bogs and Fens, and the different steps to be taken
 for the improvement of each, some time ago prepared a
 long and excellent Memoir on the subject, which is now
 printing (for the first time) in the numbers of the Agricultural
 Magazine* (published by V. Griffiths, No. 1, Paternoster
 Row), in which nearly the whole of the most expensive
 steps now pursuing under the Act of Parliament for the
 above purpose, are decidedly and as I think, justly con
demned, as useless and indeed hurtful some of them, if per
sisted in: it is a subject that has fallen somewhat under my
cognizance, ever since the quackeries of the late Mr. Elking-
ton first engrossed the public attention, and on which [have
enlarged rather, in the chapter on Draining in the remaining
part of my Derbyshire Report, now in the press.
                                                                    I should
     Dr. R. will excuse
                         my correcting an inaccuracy in vol. r. p. 67, of thin
work, in mentioning the Fens of Bcdfnrdthire, since there are none such.
The name" Bedford Level of the Fens," situate in Cambridgeshire, a great
many miles from Bedfordshire, and so called in compliment to an Earl of
Bedford who patronized their embank.neut and drainage, has probably
misled the Doctor, as it has before done others.
    Among the important facts with respect to the Irish Bogs which Dr. R.
gives us, is that of their not immediately resting upon Clay or Marl, as re»
presented vol. xxxii. p. 367, 371, and 44:is but that in every one of the nu
merous places which he had examined, " a tough, viscid, ponderous, and
whitish Earth, which when analysed (says he) by my scientific College
friends (in Dublin) gave eighty-three parts nf silex, sixteen of alumine, and
one of oxide ofiron." Agr. Mag. vol. x. p. 81 and 144, was found immediately
under the peat; and which confirms the observations of Mr. Wm. Smith
and myself duting near 20 years past, that though Fens and Marshes, and
                                                                         some

 tioning, that Mr. D. p. 21, represents a clayey Whynstone
  Gravel as prevalent on the plains and valleys.                That a con
 siderable tract of alluvial Sand is found at Shane's Castle
 and other parts of the shores of Lough Neagh, p. 24 and
  III:   and whence probably, the variegated Calcedony pebbles,
 p. 1 10, are derived : a clayey Gravel near theCrumliti River,
 two miles from its mouth, contained a mass of partly petri-
Jied wood weighing 700 lbs., the outside being stone and
 parts of the interior still wood, Mr. Barton, p. 51 and \00;
 at Tradubach Bay on Lough Neagh, a piece weighing
 200 lbs., wood outside and stone within, Mr. B. p. 99 ; at
 Ahaness l m. S of the river Glenavy, a piece 150 lbs.
 weight, now probably in the Museum of Trinity College,
 Dublin, Mr. B. p. 96, and Mr.'D. p. 109, Note. On the
 Six- mile River two miles from Lough Neagh, specimens
 are found, as much as a man can carry, the outsides of which
 are wood, Mr. D. p. 55, and in other places wood which
 has undergone no change, Mr. B. p. 59; specimens of
 petrified wood being found in Gravel, eight or ten miles di
 stant from Lough Neagh, Mr. B. p. 103 : see also Mr. D.'s
 account of the above, pages 105 to 111.                  Lapis syringoides
 are found in Dejry on the shore of the Lough, Mr. B. pages
 74 and 75, perhaps the petrified Coralites of Mr. D. p. 109.
  Hazel Nuts petrified, are thrown up occasionally, by the
 waves of the Lake or Lough, Mr. D. p. 109 and 110, but
 whose waters are denied the wonderful properties which
 ignorance and credulity had assigned them : Mr. B. shows,
 p. 130, that the petrified wood is not so generally Holly,
 as had been asserted.            At Ahaness a stratum of lituminated,
  Wood under blue and red Clay is found, Mr. B. p. 97 and
  130, and in other places bordering on the Lough, Mr. D.
 p. 90.

 of  the obstructions to the retreat of the Waters which occasioned them, yet
 real Bogs and Mosses such as those in Derbyshire (which 1 first examined
 near Buxton, in 1797) perhaps invariably, rest on Sand, Grit-stone, or sandy
 loam, as mentioned in my Derbyshire Report i. D07, S08 and 312 ; and in
 which respect, the present aquatic vegetables of our Bogs, seem to differ ma
 terially trom the immense subaqueous crops of alincl races nf plants, which
 occasioned our Coat-seams ; which, according to my extensive observation*
 and inquiries among the practically informed on this subject, invariably rest,
 immediately (however thin it may be), on infusible or Fire Clay in some of
 its various states of induration and perfection, as mentioned in my Report i.
 p. 179; and into which fact I hope that Dr.R. will minutely inquire, in the
 Collieries of Antrim and Tyrone, &c: as also, what is the exact direction of
 all the times or length-way vertical joints in the Coal-seams, in those various
 Collieries i Do they range ESE and WNW, as in and near Derbyshire (Re
 port i. I Si), or in any other invariable direction?

LI   I.   Description          of   an   improved Pump for raising the
     Water while           Shafts        or Pits are sinking.   By Mr.
     William Brunton,                    of Butterley Iron Works, Derby
     shire*.
Sir, I       beg leave, through               you, to lay before the Society
for      the Encouragement of             Arts, Manufactures      and   Com
merce, drawings of pump upon an improved construction,
                               a
for the purpose of raising water from pits, whilst they are
sinking. Before enter upon an explanation of my plan,
                           1                                                it
will be requisite to state those inconveniences arising from
the common mode, which are intended to be obviated.
   First, as     necessary for the pumps whilst sinking, to
                 it   is
be always working upon air, that the water may be kept
   * From Transactiini
                       of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Mamt-
factures, and Commerce, for 1811.       The silver medal of the Society was
 voted to Mr. Brunton for this communication.
                                                                         very

          the   Water while Shafts or Pits       are sinking.              363
very low in the pit, the engine of course frequently goes
too fast, and carries up by the violence of the current small
pieces of stone, coal, or other substances, and lodges them
above the bucket, which must considerably retard the
working of the pump, and wear the leather.
   Secondly.  When the engine is set to work, (after hav
ing been stopped whilst working upon air, and consequently
a quantity of air remaining in the suction-pipe,           with the
small stones, Sec. deposited on the valves of the bucket,) it
often happens that the compressure of the air by the descent
of the bucket is not sufficient to overcome the weight of
the bucket valves so loaded with rubbish, and the column
of water in the stand pipes, the pump is hereby prevented
from catching its water; the usual remedy for which                 to    is,
draw the bucket out of the working barrel, until           quantity
                                                               a
of water has escaped by its sides, and displaced the air.
Observe here, that this often happens from the unnecessary
magnitude of the space between the bucket and clack.
   Thirdly. The pumps are suspended in the pit                 by
                                                            capstan
 ropes, for the purpose of being readily lowered as the pit                     is
sunk the stretching of the ropes (especially when sinking
     ;
in soft strata) occasions much trouble,              by
                                                     suffering the
pumps    to  choke;   but  the  most   serious  evil          is,
                                                           that the
sinkers, in shifting the pumps from one place to another,
throw them very far-out of perpendicular, thereby causing
immense friction and wearing in all the parts           besides en
                                                          ;
dangering    the whole   apparatus,     by
                                         breaking    the bolts and
stays, and straining the joints.
   Fourthly.  As the pumps sink, the delivering pipe at the
top  is raised,    by
                    putting on short pipes, generally about                     a
yard at   atime, which occasions many stoppages and much
hinderance in the work.
   Having an engine pit to sink at Codnor Park Colliery,
Derbyshire, belonging to the Butterley Iron Company,              en  I
deavoured    to obviate the difficulties stated; and, first, for
the purpose of preventing the pumps working too much
upon air,     constructed
              I             a  working barrel, (which in this
case was nine inches diameter,) with       side pipe three inches
                                             a
diameter, connected therewith by an opening at the top and
bottom    ;also at the upper end of the side pipe            fixed
                                                                I               a
valve, so as to slide over and shut the communication with
the working barrel, the stem of the valve            by
                                                   which           reit   is
gulated, passing through      a stuffing box, and             by
                                                           letting              a
quantity of water return through the side pipe, to the bot
tom of the working barrel, (the men at the bottom regu-
                                A   a
                                    2                                 lating

  364     Description  of an improved Pump for raising
  lating the valve, so that the pump takes the water as it
  comes,) very little rubbish is then taken into the pump,
  and much wear and tear of buckets prevented.
     Secondly.  I also by this valve and side pipe, preclude
  the necessity of ever drawing the bucket to displace the air.
  The clack piece was made as small as possible, and the
  clack with its gearing very low, in order to have as little
  space as possible between the bucket and the clack.       The
  clack as represented in the drawing, possesses the advantages
  of being easily caught by the clack hook,' in case of being
  under water. The ring prevents it irom oversetting, and
  thereby fastening itself in the pumps, and the valves are
 very easily repaired by unscrewing the cross-bar, which
 admits of their being taken off and replaced.
     Thirdly.  I avoid the inconvenience of suspending the
 pumps by ropes, by forming the suction-pipe in two
 pieces, one inner and outer pipe ; the outer pipe is bored for
 about six inches in length, and the inner one turned cylin-
 drically to fit it ; they slide into each other, the whole
 length of a regular pipe, viz. nine feet ; and they are made
 tight by collars of leather, surrounded by a cup filled with
 water and clay. The pumps are supported at proper di
 stances, so as to suit the length of the pipes, by beams, and
 across those are other beams upon which the flanches of
 the pipes Test; these last are not fastened by any bolt, in or
 der that they may be readily removed ; the pumps by these
means remain stationary, and the suction-pipe lengthens as
 the pit is sunk, until it is drawn out to its full extent.
The whole column is then lowered to the next flanches,
and another pipe is added to the top; the lower end of the
suction pipe is formed somewhat like a crank, in order
that the sinkers, by turning it round upon the other pipe,
may move it from one place to another, and so prevent the
necessity of sinking immediately under it.
    Fourthly.  The pumps being stationary as above stated,
the pipe at the top will of course deliver the water at the
same level at all times, and instead of being obliged to
lengthen the column every yard sunk, it will only be ne
cessary every nine feet.
    By sinking the pit above mentioned iu the manner I
have slated, trie whole of the difficulties so generally com
plained ot were obviated, rhe safety of the workmen em
ployed greatly increased, and much time, labour, and ex
pense saved.      If the above should appear to the Society
deserving of their notice and patronage, or (he publishing

              the Water while Shafts or               Pits are sinking.          365

  and oblige

  Explanation of the Drawings of Mr. William Brunton'*
    improved Pump, for Mining, and Sinking Shafts. Plate
       VIII.     fig.   1,   2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
    Fig. 1,  is a section of a shaft or pit, with the pump fixed
 in it ; it is
             cast in lengths of nine feet each, screwed together
 by flanches, and supported by beams extending across the
 pit, (as shown in the plan, fig. 6\) short pieces are laid across
 these, with half circular holes in them ; these being put
 round the pump, just beneath a flanch, sustain the pump
   firmly, but may quickly be removed when it is required to
   lower the pumps in the pit ; and, as they are not fastened,
   they do not prevent the pumps being drawn upwards ; A,
s fig. 1, is the door which unscrews, to get at the lower valve
   or clack of the pump ; this is more clearly explained in the
   enlarged section, fig. 2, where A has the same designation.
  B, fig. 2, is the working barrel, with the bucket D, work
  ing in it ; E is the clack, also shown enlarged in figs. 3 and
  4 ; F is the suction pipe, and GG, the moveable length
  ening piece; this slides over and includes the other, as in
  fig. 2, when the pump is first fixed; but, as the pit is sunk,
  it slides down over the pine F, to reach the bottom, as in
  fig. 1 ; the outside of the inner pipe F, is turned true and
  smooth, and the inside of the outer pipe G, at the upper
  end, is bored out to        it; the junction
                                 fit                made perfect by
                                                              is
  leathers placed in the bottom of the cup,          a, which holds
                                                               a
  water and wet clay over them, to keep them wet and plia
  ble, and consequently air-tight; the lower extremity of,
  the suction pipe G, terminates in          nose, pierced with
                                                       a                           a
  number of small hole3, that           may not take up the dirt
                                               it                                  ;
  this nose      not placed in
                 is                line with.the pipe, but curved
                                         a
  to one side of         it,
                        so as to describe      circle when turned

    ger of being injured by the explosion, as is the                           case in the
    common pump ; in which this danger can only                                be avoided
    by moving the pump foot to one side of the pit,                            which ne
    cessarily throws the whole column of pumps                                 out of the
     perpendicular.
        The construction of the clack is explained by figs. 3 and
     4, the former being a section, and the latter a plan ; LL is
     a cast-iron ring, fitting into a conical seat in the bottom of
     the chamber of the pump, as shown in fig. 2 ; it has two
     stems 11 rising from              it,

    just beneath this,          bar m extends across from one stem to
                                 a
     another, and has two screws tapped through                these pressit
                                                                           ;
                second cross-bar n, which presses the leather of the

    down   a

it      fast, forming the hinge on which the double valves open,
    without the necessity of making any holes through the
    leather as in common            but the chief advantage is, that
                                       ;                                                    by

    importance          for,

                                 in
    fast   in the pit, that       the clack fails and cannot be quickly
                                     if
    repaired, the water rises above the clack-door, so as to pre
    vent any access to           it,
                                 and there    no remedy in the common

    most tedious and expensive operation.               In Mr. Brunton's
    pump,      the  clack   can  at any  time be drawn   out of the pump,
    by   first drawing out the bucket, and letting down an iron
    prong, fig. 5, which has hooks on the outsides of its two
    points ;     this when dropped down will fall into the ring M,
    and its prongs springing out, will catch the underside and
    hold  it    fast enough to draw           up. Another part of Mr.

Sir,      In
           the 166th number and U7th page of your valu
able Magazine, you did me the honour to insert some notes
of case of ap affection of the brain, the consequence of
    a
local injury to the head, that came under my care, in which                             I
particularly mentioned the symptoms, the treatment, and the
favourable state         which the patient James Thomas was at
                          in
 the time    Iwrote and sent         you.it       very short time after

that he had      a relapse quite as severe as the former              and as ;
the former was published,            thought
                                         I          right that the ratter

this reason    I  have laid     before you.

    James Thomas continued to get better and to recover
very rapidly, until the 22d of February, when, without any
apparent cause, he was taken so ill as to oblige him to re
tire to bed.      He sent to desire      would see him,

I  could not understand much of what he said he lay moan          :

little notice of any thing or any body.               If asked himI                      a
question,    he  would   answer   as  well  as  he  was   able      the only

    Now, as he got so much better in his former rllness, I
was induced to resume the same plan of treatment, which
was to endeavour to regulate the functions of the skin and
of the alimentary canal, and with that view I ordered him
to take the following powder immediately :
       R Hydrargyri Submuriatis gr. vi.
          Pulveris Antimonialis gr.          ij.Misce.
    Feb. 23. The powder has produced some evacuations
which are quite black, and smell very offensive.                  askedI
 him how he did; he shook his head and answered, Very
 bad. He still keeps perpetually moaning he         ;      very thirsty,

  black, and bowels are regular: but his eyes are for the first
  time inflamed, and the light feels troublesome, and when
  suddenly placed before his eyes produces pain. He can
  take a    little gruel, but as yet cannot sleep            he  ;  very  is

ously;    he slept several hours last night, and that sleep was
sound and       undisturbed, and he appears to be much re
freshed ; he is able to sit up in bed for an hour at a time,
and takes broth and small quantities of the whiter kinds of
meat, but he is very much reduced in bulk and in strength ;
his bowels keep regularly open, and the colour of ihe faeces
greatly improves.       I ordered him to go on with the mix
ture as before.
    March    7.   He continues gradually to get better; for the
last   three days he has sat up three hours at a time without
being much tired ; his appetite increases, and he is in every
other respect proportionally well.         The pain in his head
has almost left him ; his speech is still very indistinct, and
in speaking he very often forgets what he was going to say.
At times      he seems to lose    all recollection for a moment.
The mixture continued.
    March 20. His faeces         are now perfectly of a natural
colour, and he goes to stool once or twice every day.         His
 skin keeps moist ; hi3 appetite is very good ; he is still in
 a state of great debility ; he has left off taking his medicine ;
 talks better; pains in the head quite gone ; is able to walk
 out a short distance ; his memory is as good as usual, and
 he is mending hourly.
     May 12. I have just called and found him with his
 wife at dinner, and apparently eating very heartily ; he is
 got quite fat since last I saw him ; he tells me he can pur
 sue the office of constable as he was accustomed, and feels
 as well as ever he did in his life, except his articulation,
 which is the only thing from which he suffers.
     From the peculiar and well marked symptoms under
 which the patient has laboured in both attacks, I think
 little doubt can remain as to the cause which produced
 them ; namely, that it was pressure on some part of the
 brain ; but on what part that pressure was, or what caused
 the pressure, scarcely admits of a conjecture, for the pain has
 never been confined to any particular part; but, on the con
  trary, was generally diffused over the whole head.          The
  mode of treatment has been very simple, and the three chief
  points it had in view, were to regulate the evacuations of
  the alimentary canal, to set right the morbid secretion of
  bile, and to keep up a gentle action or perspiration on the
  skin. Now this treatment, as the relation of the case shows,
  has been attended with success ; for as soon as the skin be
  came in a natural state, and the excretions from the bowels
  regular and of a good colour, so soon did the symptoms be
  gin to be mitigated, and continued so to do till they disap
                                                           peared.

    pearcd.     Some may say, that in the present instance the
    deranged     state of the skin and of the bowels was the
    effect of the disease, and that the treatment adopted re
    moved the effect without first removing the cause: but
    this case (as well as many others) clearly proves to me the
    importance and great necessity of paying strict attention to
    the state  of the skin, and of the alimentary canal, in every

   LIV. A Method of correcting             the Variation     of the Mariner's
       Compass.        By Mr.      John Hodgson,               Charles Street,
       St. James's Square*.
   Sir,    I takb     the liberty of requesting you to submit to
   the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures
   and Commerce, a small theodolite, to which an addition
  has been made, calculated, it is hoped, to be of some utility,
      The frequent recurrence to the variation of the compass,
  which is necessary in the use of the theodolite, is always
  attended with trouble, and not unfrequently productive of
  error.                                                                         I
      It appears to me, that by a very simple expedient these
  inconveniences may in a great measure be removed. To
  the magnetic needle of the instrument, let one of hrass be
  affixed moveable upon the centre of the former; the brass
  needle may be termed the corrector.                 Nothing more is ne
  cessary    than to   place   the  magnetic      needle   and the corrector,
  at the angle of the variation, in such a manner that, the
  former being in the magnetic meridian, the latter shall be
 in the true meridian. The south end of the corrector will
  point to the true bearing of an object seen through the
 sights of the theodolite.
      I also beg to lay before the committee a ship's compass,
 in which will be found a different application of the same
 principle.      In this instrument, the needle is made move
 able under the compass card, so as to be placed by the
 officer of the watch, or any other proper person, under the
 variation line, as often as an azimuth or an amplitude shall
 have been taken.          The points of the compass will, by these

 voted to Mr. Hodgson for this communication.
                                                                        means

means,     be directed to their corresponding points in the
heavens, and the mariner will know that he is really sailing
upon the rhumb indicated by the cord.
    I am inclined to think that a seaman may sometimes be
liable to error, in the continual reference which it is neces
sary for him to make to the variation of the compass, from
a possibility of his allowing it on the wrong side, by sub
tracting where he should add, or by adding where he should
subtract it : even under a supposition that such a mistake
is not likely to occur, the use of this instrument as an
additional check, in a matter of so much importance as is
 the ascertaining of a ship's course, may not be entirely un
 worthy of attention.
    It is very probable, that from my imperfect information
 upon these subjects, I am now proposing what has before
 been suggested,    and been found either to be wholly im
 practicable, or of little or no utility when reduced to prac
 tice. This is indeed the more probable from the extreme
 simplicity of the expedient itself, which could scarcely have
 escaped the attention of the many enlightened seamen, and
 others, who have devoted their minds to subjects of this
 nature. This consideration, however, is not sufficient to
 induce me to lose a chance of suggesting any the most
 trifling hint which may be useful to a class of men to
 whom we are so much indebted.
     It may be objected against the application of this princi
 ple to a ship's compass, that as the variation in a long voy
 age is continually changing, the card in a short time after
 it has been adjusted will not point truly. This must be
 admitted; but it must also be recollected that it will agree
 with the last variation ascertained, and which is that on
 which the mariner must rely, until a fresh observation shall
 have been taken.
     It may also be objected, that through the' negligence of
  the persons employed to regulate this instrument, errors
  may arise, equal to those which it is intended to obviate ;
  but surely, whatever may tend to afford a correct knowledge
  of a ship's course, is of sufficient importance to render the
  adjustment of the. card an pffice hy no means unworthy of
  the captain himself; and it cannot be supposed that he,
  or indeed any other officer, can be liable to error in an ope
  ration merely manual.
      If we admit, however, that these objections are well
  founded, an instrument of this description might not be
  destitute of utility, placed in the captain's cabin, or some
  other convenient part of the ship, where it might continu-

 ally indicate her course, without the          necessity of a reference
 to the last observation ; and at the same time serve as a
 check upon the several courses entered from the steering-
 compass.
     Whatever obstacles may exist to the application of this
 contrivance to the ship's compass, I apprehend that there
 will be none to its utility, as applied to the instruments used
 in land surveying ; confined as that business is to tracts of
 country within which only a trifling annual variation takes
 place, and to which variation the corrector may be set
 whenever it becomes considerable.
    To the common boat- and pocket-compass the same prin
 ciple may be applied with equal utility ; to the latter espe
 cially, which may frequently, perhaps, be in the hands of
 persons unacquainted with either the bearing or amount of
 the variation of the magnetic needle.
    As the instruments submitted to the Committee are
 merely intended for illustration, I have not aimed at great
 nicety in their mechanism.               It is obvious that they are
 capable    of  considerable       improvement, and that both the
 theodolite     and   the  ship's compass may he so constructed
as to    be  capable      of  all requisite, accuracy in their adjust
ment, without loading them in such a manner as to obstruct
 the free motion of the needle.
    If a modification of these instruments, in itself so sim*
pie, shall be found \q he of the least utility, I shall feel
 highly gratified.

it can be easily turned round to make any angle with the

bearings of any object observed through the two sights e

the divided circle ; at least whilst the variation of the needle
continues the same; but as this alters by the instrument
being used in a different tract of country, the brass index a

   will not neglect, I hope, to treat themselves with examina-

LVf .  Notice respecting the Geological Structure of the Vi
  cinity of Dublin; with on Account of some rare Minerals
 found in Ireland. By William Fitton, M. D. Com
  municated by L. Horner, Esq. Secretary to the Geologi-
 .   tal      Society.,
                                  [Continued   from p. SHI.]
The      following substances, with the exception of the last
two, have been found within the district to which the pre
ceding observations relate.
   I . Vesuvian  (Idocrase, Haiiy.) This mineral was observed
by Mr. Stephens, in specimens found by me at Kilranelagh
in the county of Wicklow ; where it occurs in irregular cry
stalline masses, in a rock composed of common garnet of a
reddish brown colour, of quartz, for the most part greenish,
apparently from the admixture of a lamellar fossil of that
hue, and a small quantity of yellowish white felspar. The
dodecahedral      figure of the garnet was very distinct in se
veral of these specimens ; but the form of the Vesuvian was
not so well exhibited, some indistinct prisms only being
observable; and in general, the crystalline shoots of the
latter mineral had assumed a diverging or stelliform arrange
ment, an appearance which I have not observed in speci
mens of this substance from other places ; but their easy
fusibility, lustre, colour, and other characters, were suffi
ciently decisive of their nature.
    I could not discover the original situation of the com
pound above mentioned at Kilranelagh ; but the size, the
great weight, and angular, form of the blocks consisting of
it,  render     probable that they were not far removed from
                    it
their natural place: and the country in that neighbourhood
is  composed of primitive substances, among which Garnet
rock      described              hy
                         mineralogists, as constituting beds.
           is is
     It   remarkable,   that   compound much resembling that
                                         a
which       Ihave now described, occurs also       the county of
                                                               in
Donegal       from whence specimens in the cabinet of the
                   ;
Dublin Society, and that of Dublin College (No. 30), were
                                                        obtained.

                         bf the Vicinity of Dublin:                     3 77
  obtained.       The garnet and vesuvian in these specimens are
  scarcely to be distinguished from those of Kilranclagh ; and,
  as at that place, are accompanied hv quartz, often of a si
  milar greenish colour; with the addition however of blueish
  grey granular limestone, and of a fibrous substance, not
  improbably tremolite mixed with carbonate of lime.                       I
  have not seen any felspar in the specimens from Done-
  gal   *.
      2.   Grenatite  (Stauivtide, Haiiy).             This mineral was
  detected by Mr. Stephens in a micaceous compound of
  which I found a specimen at the Glenmalitr lead mines, in
  the county of Wicklow : and I have reason to suppose,
  that it is not very uncommon in the schistose rocks along
  the south-eastern confines of the granite in that county.
  The crystals from Gleumalur were small ; but their colour,
  form, and characteristic crossinir, were very distinct, and
  they were infusible before the blowpipe.
      3. Beryl  (a variety of Emerald, Haiiy).  This was
  found by Mr. Stephens and myself, imbedded in granite^
  near Loucrh Bray, in the county of Wicklow.                   (Museum
  of Dublin College, No. 39.) Mr. Weaver has discovered
  it in blocks of granite, near Cronebane in the same county j
  and 1 have obtained specimens, probably belonging to the
  same species, in the Dublin mountains, above Dundrunii
      4. Andulusite  (Feldspath-apyre, Haiiy). This mineral
  has been found by Mr. Stephens and myself, in very distinct
  specimens, on the north-east side of Do7<rc-mountain, in the
  county of Wicklow ; apparently imbedded in the mica-slate
  of which that mountain is composed, and accompanied by
  quartz, mica, and a remarkable substance hereafter to be
  mentioned.         It differs from the Andalusiie of Spain and of
  Scotland, chiefly in possessingan inferior degree of hardness;
  for although some specimens readily scratch glass, others
  yield easily to the knife: but the Count de Bournon has
  observed an equal variation in the hardness of specimens of
  this substance obtained by himself at Forezf ;-and I have
  found that of the Scottish stone to vary very considerably.
.     This mineral seems to have been first taken notice of,
  under the name of IVurfiicher- (cubic) Feldspath, bv Kar-
  stent; who took his description from specimens in the
  Leskean cabinet, now hi the possession of the Dublin So
  ciety (No. 907-b, 8cc.) : and by a comparison of these with
      This compound from Donegal lias been described          Mr.

  378              On the Geological Structure
  some of the specimens above mentioned from Douce, I have
  ascertained the identity of Karsteu's mineral with Anda
  lusite.   I have not found however, that his claim to the
  first detection of this species has been mentioned by subse
  quent writers ; although his opinion with respect to its
  affinity with felspar, accords with that which Hauy is dis
  posed from his latest observations to adopt : Tableau com-
 paratif, &c. p. 21 7-
      To the Andalusite   is also to be referred, a mineral which
 occurs in great abundance at Killiney in the county of
 Dublin, first observed there by Dr. Blake, and for some
 time considered as belonging to a species not described by
 mineralogists : the schist at the southern extremity of the
 Scalp, appears to contain the same substance, as well as
 that next to be described ; and it is found also near the
 head of Glenmacanass. It is most remarkable on the shore
 at Killiney, at the southern extremity of the cliff under the
 obelisk hill, where it abounds on the surface ot the mica-
 slate, and also imbedded in the rock.        In a recent fracture,
 it is imperfectly distinguishable from the mass of the stone j
 but as it resists decomposition better than the other sub
 stances of which the aggregate is composed, it appears very
distinctly on the surfaces which have been long exposed to
 the weather.
     The Andalusite when thus brought to view, appears ge
 nerally in the form of embossed groups, consisting of slen
 der prismatic crystalline shoots, of a dull greyish black
 colour, which are sometimes assembled in a stellated form,
 but more frequently without any determinate arrangement :
these are commonly rounded, at the edges from the effects
of decomposition, and in that case, several of their principal
 characters are scarcely to be distinguished ; but in the
pieces least affected by exposure, when attentively examined,
the crystalline form, colour, lustre, cleavage, and other
characters of this species, are sufficiently distinct.
     5. The andalusite of Douce-mountain          is accompanied,
as has been mentioned, by another mineral besides quartz
and mica ; the characters of which have much affinitv to
those of the indurated talc of Werner, and which is placed
under that denomination in the collection of Dublin Col
lege (Nos. 4Q5  6  7) : a specimen of the same kind,
stated to be lrom Glendalogh, in the county of Wicklow,
¦was found also in that collection (No. 404) ; and a similar
substance was observed by Mr. Stephens at the southern
extremity of the Scalp.
     The following are some of the characters exhibited by
                                                               the

                           of the Vicinity of Dublin.                                  379
 the specimens from Douce, to which I have access at pre
 sent ; these specimens however are not very distinct, and,
  I give this imperfect description, only w iih a view to point
 out this substance as deserving of further examination.
     Its colour is yellowish grey, approaching in various de
        grees to yellowish white : it is translucent in about
        the same degree as wax.
    TRe form under which it has principally occurred, is that
        of four-sided prisms, nearly square, the length of which
        is in some instances more than thrice their breadth,
        without any visible acumination. The surfaces of these
        prisms are uneven, and their angles       defined.ill
    The fracture, transversely to the axis of the prisms         ir-?             is
        regularly curved-foliated, and splintery exhibiting nur ;
        merous scalv distinct concretions sometimes radiating
        from the centre, the lustre of which        splendent and
                                                            is
        pearly. In the direction of the axis, the fracture seems
        to be uneven passing into splintery.
  It     isscratched       by
                          calcareous spar, and easily cut       the               by
        knife; with strong pressure
                           a               leaves    whitish trace
                                                     it         a
        on glass, which       sometimes scratches, apparently
                                it                                                      by
        the action of some harder particles dispersed through it.
    The specific gravity of some of the purest pieces that                             I
        could select was 2-888.
    Before the blowpipe this substance appears to swell                                 a
little, from the separation of its folia, on the first applica
 tion of the heat      ; becomes white, opake, and brittle, and
                           it
in   small fragments gives, with some difficulty,      solid while  a
enamel.
    In the specimens from Douce-mountain, the connection
of the mineral now described with andalusite,              very re      is
markable; several of the prisms, which on the outer part
consist of the falc-like matter, containing within         nucleus      .a
of andalusite, that in some instances fills nearly the whole
of the interior of the prism, but in others forms little more
than an axis, of an irregular figure and with rounded edges,
from which the folia of the investing matter appear to ra
diate. The nature of the connection between these sub
stances       isstill obscure    but the occurrence of talc in
                                     ;
genuine crystals of the figure above mentioned, has not
hitherto been stated on any good authority; and                 not      it       is
altogether improbable, that the prismatic form assumed by
the substance now under consideration, may really be that
of andalusite the latter mineral .having been wholly or
                   ;
partially removed, and the talc-like matter moulded in its
place.

    6. Hollowspar, Jameson  (Macle, Haiiy).           Very di
stinct specimens of this mineral have been found by Mr.
Davy at Aghavanagh in ihe county of Wicklow ; and I
have observed it at Baltinglass-hill, within a few miles of
that place.
    From some passages among the papers of Mr. Stephens,
it appears that he had found reason to suppose that .there
existed a connection between the species andalusite and
macle; although the specimens which he had seen, were
not such as to enable him to decide on the precise nature
of their relation to esch other. The appearances of several
specimens of the latter mineral, which 1 have lately had an
opportunity of examining, lend to confirm this opinion; and
even induce me to suspect that the crystalline part of that
curious substance, is in reality the same with andalusite.
 In one of these especially, a very fine specimen of made
from Britanny in the possession of Mr. L. Horner, that
part of the complex crystal, which is usually of a whitish or
yellowish hue, has in several places the reddish colour, as
well as the lamellar fracture, lustre, and other characters of
andalusite ; and like that substance also, is infusible before
the blowpipe, becoming white and nearly opake : and it is
further remarkable, that in this specimen, as in those al
ready mentioned from Douce-mountain, the crystalline
 matter is in some places invested with a coating of a talc
 like substance: which is the case likewise, although less
 distinctly, with several of the specimens of andalusite that
 I have seen, from other countries.
    The following substances have been found at places not
 included within the district, to which the preceding part
 of this paper relates : but they may perhaps be subjoined
 without impropriety, as they have hitherto been rare, and
 are in other respects deserving of notice.
     7. Pilchstone.   This mineral has been found in a vein
 traversing granite, in the vicinity of Newry, in the county
  of Down ; where it presents the following characters, for
  part of the description of which, I am indebted to Mr.
  Jameson of Edinburgh : 
     Its colour is intermediate between mountain and leek
        green.
     It is massive.
     Fracture small and not very perfect concl>oidal :
     Internal lustre vitreous, and shining.
     It exhibits lamellar distinct concretions : the plates being
                                                            from

                         of the Vicinity of Dublin.                381
        from about one-fourth to one-tenth of an inch in
        thickness, and further divisible into pieces of a rhom-.
        boidal form, of various angles.
     The surface of the concretions is smooth, and strongly"
        glistening.
    The mineral, in fragments, is slightly translucent on the
        edccs :
     It scratches class, but is easily scratched by quartz :
     It is easily broken :
    Specific gravity 2-29.
     Before the blowpipe without addition it yields a greyish-
white frothy enamel.
     It is in some places porphyritic ; containing imbedded
minute crystals of felspar and of quartz.
     A letter from a veiy intelligent observer, who has ex
amined this substance in its native place, states the fol*.
lowing particulars respecting its position and geological
relations; viz. "The vein is first observable in the Town-
land of Newrv, at the bottom of a bank of granite, about
half a mile from the northern end of the town, on the
right of the road leading to Downpatrick : it crosses the
road, and runs due westward, ending on the side of the
great road from Newry to Belfast.                Its length, so far as
hitherto observed, is half a mile."
     " The rock, which is covered with mould to the depth
of about a foot, consists of grey granite : the vein is about
two feet and a half, or two and a quarter in width ; at the
places of contact both the granite and pitchstone aro dis
integrated, the latter being almost as soft as clay, but be
coming gradually harder as it approaches the centre of the
vein. The structure of the vein is foliated, the folia being
perpendicular to the horizon, and also to the walls ; and
besides these, there are seams that run longitudinally,            pa
rallel to the horizon, and nearly perpendicular to the folia."
    Although the substance above described presents some
peculiarity, in being divisible into rhomboidal fragments,
it approaches       in ibis respect to the pitchstone of Arran
"in lamelhr concretions ;" a variety considered by Mr.
Jameson as having hitherto occurred onlv in that island'*,
and which holds, as it were, a middle place, between the
mineral f rom Newry and that possessing the more common
characters. The occurrence of pitchstone in geological
(,'ircunistances      like those above mentioned, has hitherto
been very rare; but Mr. Jameson has described a vein of

    8.  IVavellite.     This remarkable mineral has recently
been     found in the county of Cork, at Sprtnghill, near
Tracton-abbey, about ten miles south-eastward from the
city.     The Rev. Mr. Hincks, of the Cork Institution, who
has been so kind as to send me some specimens of it from
that place, informs me that it was found very near the sur
face, in digging the foundation of a cottage, in the neigh
bourhood of a hill composed of flinty-slate ; and that he
lias seen it adhering to a fragment of rock of that descrip
tion : but it has occurred principally detached in the soil,
in the form of spherical nodules irregularly grouped toge
ther, and of various sizes, the largest being about three-
fourths of an inch in diameter. These nodules are coated
externally with a yellowish-brown earthy crust, and within
are of a crystalline structure ; resembling in their appear
ance and properties the original IVavellite from Devonshire,
 described by Mr. Davy, from which indeed, some of the
 specimens from the county of Cork can scarcely be distin
 guished.
    The most distinct and purest specimens of this mineral
 from the last mentioned place, that 1 have seen, exhibit
 the following characters, viz. 
    The globules are formed of crystalline spiculae radiating
       from a common centre ; but the surfaces of these are
       seldom perfectly plane, and their figure when separated
       is not distinctly to be discerned. The exterior of the
       nodules, is composed of the terminations of the cry
       stalline shoots, which are dihedral and obtuse-angled ;
       the curvature of tht ir surfaces, however, did not admit
       of their being accurately measured.
    The spicule are nearly transparent and without colour,
       or of a very light shade of yellowish green. The lustre
       of their surface is strongly splendent, and glassvyin-
       ciining to that of siik :
    The cross fracture of the spiculae seems to be flat cou-
        choidal, with a splendent lustre.
    This substance scratches glass ; but it is so easily broken
        down as to render difficult the trial of its hardness.
    The nodules arc very easily divided in the direction of
        the rays : the spiculae are extremely brittle.
    The specific gravity of a portion, which was very pure,
       and about twenty grains in weight, was 2'34.

  Before the blow-pipe the spicules of this substance are
separated from each other, becoming white, opake, and fri
able, without any mark of fusion.       The flame by passing
over it acquires a slight tinge of green.

sell was read, describing the peculiar appearance of three

             7-                                        Mr.                             by
Brown of the Linnean Society, from Dr. Allman, on the
figures of the tubes and pores of plants, was read.    Dr.
Allman having been led to investigate the cells and tubes
of plants during    course of botanical lectures, observed
                              a
that they might all be reduced to some regular geometrical
figure.  He then proceeded to demonstrate mathematically
that the various tubes of plants necessarily assume octahe
dral, dodecahedral, or other geometric figures, either sim
ple or combined.    In the conclusion of this paper, which
does not admit of analysis, Dr. A. acknowledged the merit
of the labours of Mirbcl and Decandolleon this branch of
                                                                                     vegetable

   May 14.      A letter from the indefatigable Mr. T. A.
Knight to the President was read, describing his experi
ments on the tendrils of plants, and investigating the cause
of their apparently rational inclination to adjoining ob
jects for support.   Mr. Knight tried a number of creeping
plants in a green-house, and aUo the tendrils of vines; he
exposed them in various positions with respect to the sun
or light, and found that they all invariably receded from the
stronger light, and attached themselves to those objects in
the shade, or, if no other object presented itself, to ihedark
side of their parent stems.    Hence he was induced to con
clude that the action of light on the tendriis contracted the
vessels on the sides exposed to         it,
                                    and occasioned not only
the spiral convolutions, but also that tendency to fix on
obscured or shaded objects.    On this principle he accounted
for all the curious instinct-like motions of young tendrils
in   amanner purely mechanical, and positively denied them
any sensitive or elective motion whatever. .

logy of an organ, it is necessary to consider its anatomy :
the lecture, therefore, commenced by a very accurate and
perspicuous description of the anatomy of the Eye, and
its adjacent parts.       As he proceeded to demonstrate the
various parts of this most beautiful organ, he noticed the
appearance and peculiarities of them in different animals,
snowing their adaptation to the elements in which they
exist.
     Having explained the anatomy, Mr. P. proceeded to elu
cidate the action of the eye by physical experiments, and,
after examining the nature of light and colours, applied it
 to the subject of vision.          Here he enlarged on the power
of the eye, by which it adjusts itself to the distinct per
 ception of objects; and having-noticed the opinions of
 Kepler, Le Cat, Des Cartes, Young, Pemberton, and some
 others, from the lately discovered muscle, by Mr. Campion,
 in an eagle, which is attached to the sclerotica, capable of
 producing the change in the focal distance, inferred that
 something analogous might exist in the, human species,
 ¦which would perform the three changes suggested by Mr.
 Ramsden and Mr. Home, viz. a motion of the crystalline
 Jens  an elongation of the axis of vision  and an increase
 of curvature in the cornea.
     From this subject the learned author proceeded to con
 sider the theory of Hartley, on the manner in which the
 rays of light in falling upon the bottom of the eye excite
 vibrations in the tunica retina, which he seemed much dis
  posed to coincide with ;  the myoptic and presbyopic
  states of the eye, with their remedies ;  and the manner in
 which the optic image is reverted.              After examining the
 different suggestions on this latter important subject, he
  determined the theory of Mr. A. Walker, of Edinburgh,
  to be the most rational and deserving of attention.                    We
  shall close this article by submitting a few extracts from
  Mr. W.'s work, selected by the lecturer*.
     Mr. W. supposes " the eye to be acted on by light pre
  cisely as some kinds of the reflecting telescope, which, after
  receiving the image inverted upon its interior lens, reflects
  and reverses it upon its exterior lens, and permits it to be
  seen in its natural situation.       In the same way, the interior
  part  of  the retina, having    received    the image inverted, re
  flects, reverses, and presents it in its natural position upon
  its anterior part."
      " The anatomical fact, that, at the posterior part of the

                                                                      retina,

  retina, its arachnoid, pulpy or most sensible lamina is co
 vered on the side which is toward the vitreous humour by
  a more consistent, vascular, and less sensible portion, while
  the anterior part is exquisitely delicate and fine, tends to
  confirm this theory.       It receives also additional confirma
  tion from the circumstance, that the transpaient retina thus
  laid over the black pigmentum, and more especially over
  the tapitum, exclusively occupying this part in some of the
  inferior animals, must form the most perfect reflector."
      "Thus doubtless it is that that portion receives no im
  pression from the image, and that the anterior extremity
  of the nerve, which is in all cases the most sensible, is-
  alone impressed by a natural and correct picture of the ex
  ternal object, and transmits it to the sensorium."
     " The physiological (act also, that the anterior part of
 the retina cannot oe impressed even by a single direct ray
 from without,  and that, unless it receive the image re
 flected, reverted,       and in its natural position from the
 posterior part,    as  I  have described, it must be apparently
useless.     is almost   a  decided confirmation      of the theory
 I have suggi stcd."
     "A   confirmation of this theory, however, still more de
 cisive than these, yet remains.          It appears thai posterior
 ly   the  retina   is entirely  insensible  where the optic nerve
 enters, as at that part we have no sense or vision.''
     " Consistently with the theory just delivered," Mr. W..
concludes, " that we have from this circumstance a de
cided proof that the posterior part of the retina is utterly,
insensible, since, at the entrance of the nerve where it
exists in the greatest quantity, it can be demonstrated to-
be so; and, that vision is wanting at this spot precisely,
because, where the nerve enter3, there is no choroides to*
reflect the rays to the sensible interior portion."
     Thus he conceives the optic image is reverted.           It af
forded us much pleasure to hear it intimated, that comr
parative vision will form the subject of another paper, as
probably an attentive examination of this organ in the more
simple (if we may be allowed the term) animals may throw
some light on so interesting and important a branch of
Physiology.
    May.  Mr. Clarkson has this month delivered two-
Lectures on Physiognomy.            His object in giving them was
to define accurately the expressions of Physiognomical Cha
racter, and to prove that they formed, if accurately studied,
a species of universal character ; thus paving the way for

                   London Philosophical    Society.
the future progress he intends to pursue, in analysing the
Hieroglyphical       and investigating the Philosophical    Lan
guage.
      He began bv remarking the rapid conquest which the
theory had made over incredulity since the time of Lava-
ter; and mated it as a proof of its general soundness, that
it should not only be tacitly assented to by the learned, but
be received      as an axiom (which had really been the
                                                            case)
into ordinary journals and newspapers.
      Mr. Clarkson conceived that Lavater had not reduced
 physiognomy to a science by induction and logical analysis,
and this was the great desideratum for which he had under
 taken the subject. The basis on which he founded his su
 perstructure was, that we judge of every thing in the world,
 of animals, vegetables, and minerals, by superficial appear
 ances. This superficial judgement is therefore as correct,
  with regard toman, as any other part of matter of which
 he forms a portion.        But it does not involve the conse
  quence, that human nature may read as in a volume, from
  the index of the face, the past or future history of an in
  dividual subject.     Undoubtedly, Mr. C. observed, an un
  erring physiognomical judgement must be an attainment of
  long and laborious initiation ; for, if every individual of all
  those numerous multitudes who have by turns possessed the
 globe differed in external characteristics, the shades of dif
  ference must be minute in the extreme for infinite variety
  to be written on so small a tablet as the human face :  still,
  if the infinite variety of characters in the Chinese or Hie
   roglyphical languages could be faithfully distinguished,
   those of the face are equallv capable of distinction;  they
   are more so, because the roots of these characters, viz. the
   Passions, are known to all men :  the modifications of
   these roots, therefore, are all that remain to be understood.
       Mr. C. then entered into a distinction between Pathogno-
   my and Physiognomy.         The first he defined to be passion
   in action, the latter in quiescence. The former was ac
   knowledged by all, the latter denied by few ; but 'if it could
   he proved that certain lineaments were the provinces of cer
   tain emotions and passions, an immoveable fulcrum was
   obtained on which to rest' the physiognomical lever,  be
   cause nothing remained hut to prove that the admitted ac
   tion left traces proportionable to the power exertedi After
    having demonstrated the former point from paintings and
    from plates of the passions, he proceeded to prove the lat-
 , ter by syllogism as well as by experience. For if the nerves
                                                              and

  390             London Philosophical     Society.
  and muscles, which are the media of internal action, be ma
  terial, they must be subject to all the effects of material ac
  tion, to tenuosity, to rigidity, to expansion, to contraction;
  and the traces left upon them will be more or less strong
  in proportion as the action is more or less vehement, more
  or less reiterated.     He next exhibited instances from paint
  ing,  in  which  the  milder passions and qualities might remain
  stamped upon      a  face in  quiescence, such as benevolence,
  love, courage, and sorrow ; and observed, that if this
  point was granted with regard to all the passions, more was
  granted, generally speaking, than what physiognomy de
  mands ; because it was not to be supposed, that a man who
  was struck with sudden panics repeatedly would by any re-
             retain the haggard gaping look of Fear, or that a
  !>etition
   >eing   who  expressed his pride or hi3 contempt with the
  most demoniacal exjension of muscle, would retain that
  expression in all its disfiguring dimensions in a state of qui
  escence.     Physiognomy did not require such a concession :
  she merely demanded          assent to this simple proposition,
  That if positive lineaments in a state of rest approach the
  form which they assume in action, the more or less wiH
  the individual who possessed them be characteristically
  stamped with a propensity to such feelings and to such
  sensations.
     Mr. C. then proceeded to mark out the provinces of the
  triple existence of man upon his face, agreeing with Lava-
  ter in assigning the forehead to intellect; the cheeks, the
  nose, and the lips, to moral or sentimental; and the chin and
  throat to animal existence ; but differing with him in consi
  dering the harmony of this triple existence, that is, its co
  equal diffusion over every portion of the frame as the corner
  stone of Physiognomy.          For what is gained, he asked,
  when the fact is admitted, that the finger of oue man will
  not harmonize with the hand of another, or the nose of
  one individual will not congenialize with his neighbour's
, features?     The old objection of the Antiphysiognomist
  will immediately recur : 1 I grant the individuality of all
  human forms, but I doubt the connexion of internal orga
  nization with that individuality.' The argument, there
  fore, merely goes to prove, that there is as great a diffe
  rence between the mental as between the personal charac
  ters of mankind, and not that the mental is influenced of
  necessity by the personal.       Indeed, if it were necessary to
  prove this harmony, the argument of Lavaterwas superero
  gatory ; because any one who frequents a theatre, or a
                                                      masquerade,

                London Philosophical    Society.             39 1
masquerade, is aware that the substitution of an eyebrow,
or a False nose, will baffle personal recognition as strongly
as if the face was disfigured by a mask.
   To prove the proposition that the three existences of man
had their distinct provinces of the face, Mr. C. observed,
that wiih regard to intellect, the mere fact that the fore
head was 1he superficial boundary of the brain, that is, the
visible boundary, (for with the invisible, as far as regarded
physiognomical     practice, there was no necessity to inter
fere,) substantiated the deduction if the preceding pre
mises were true, which regards it as the tablet and mirror of
intellect.   Experience was the best argument, that sensi
tive or moral existence acted on that portion of the face
which occupies from the brows to the mouth ; and no one
could doubt the fact who had ever seen the eyes lighted up
by love or dimmed by sorrow ; that had ever heheld the
cheeks irradiated by joy, flushed by hope, dimpled by be
nevolence, or excavated by envy, jealousy, or ambition.
Animal life, the lowest species of existence, next drew the
attention of the learned Lecturer, and this, by demonstra
tion as well as by experience, would be found to reside in
the lower part of the human face occupying from the mouth
to the throat.    That this was a fact, he said, independently
of other evidence, Anatomy, at once the nurse and sister
of Physiognomy, loudly and strongly attests ;  she attests,
that those portions of the frame in which animal strength
resides, arc concatenated with the muscles that move the
arm and chin ;  she demonstrates, and Pathognomy co
gently pourtrays the demonstration, that in vast exertions
of animal power the under jaw is firmly knitted to the up
per : that in all cases of bodily debility, or menial apathy,
the under jaw drops and depends ;  she points to the well-
known influence of old age, in still further augmenting the
visibility of this depending characteristic ; and she appeals
 to Death itself, whether the total laxity of the under jaw
 be not its most positive and most undeniable symptom.
    After making some remarks on the impracticability of
 the theory of Gall as applied to living beings, inasmuch as
 the organs by that Professor are diffused over the whole
 surface of the scujl, the Lecturer proceeded to define the
gradated differences between intellect and inanity, observ
 ing that, if his foregoing premises were true, the diffe
 rence between the ratiocinative faculties of brutes and men
 should be marked in the boldest delineation on the foreheads
of the different species. The difference, in short, con
sisted in this, that man has a forehead       slightly inclining
                                                            from

 from the perpendicular, and the brute either possesses no
 forehead at all, a most decisive mark of inanity, or presents
 it to view in a line nearly horizonial or parallel with the
 earth.   Hence, then, a deficiency of forehead is analogous
 to a deficiency of intellect ; and from this proposition re
 sults another of still greater importance, that the nearer
 the forehead of brutes approaches the line described by that
 of man, the greater must be their characteristics of sagaci
 ty, of memory, of sensibility ; and this is instanced in the
elephant, the dog, and the monkey.            The approximation
or deviation, therefore, affords a scale perfectly unembar
 rassed for the physiognomist.  The main result of the
 whole argument was this : that a receding forehead, that is,
when compared with the usual perpendicularity of human:
foreheads, implies a defective gradation of intellect ; and,
 when the line so receding passes a certain point, involves
a necessary incapacity in the individual.
    It must not be supposed, however, continued the Lec
turer, that a rectilinear forehead affords the only real stand
ard of perfection.     Where there are internal organs origi
nally active, there must be prominences and curves. The
greater the curve, the greater will be the power ; and the
more distinct and clear the external delineation, the more
singleness of internal energy in the metaphysical faculties
of the brain. Hence, then, a concavity of forehead betrays
agreater want of intellect than a perpendicularity, and the
latter than a convexity, that         is,
                                      under certain modifications
and restrictions.     He was aware ihat the Greek statues of
the gods exhibited   a  forehead distinguished               by
                                                         perpendi a
cularity of outline continued throughout the whole extent
of the nose but even this fact, though apparently hostile,
              :
was in reality coincident with this theory         for the Greeks
                                                       ;
aimed at conferring      a calm intellectual self-absorption on
their deities, as well as    aprivation from debasing passions.
Instead, therefore, of prominences, which are the stamps of
effort, they selected right lines, and they produced          that    by
selection the anticipated effect.
   Mr. C. concluded his first Lecture             by
                                               exhibiting    scale    a
of the gradation of intellect, from the horizontal line of
forehead peculiar to the lowest brutes, to the perpendicular
line of the Greek ideal      :   by
                                 this    appeared, that the Eu
                                            it
ropean forehead retrogressed from the ideal ten degrees, the
Asiatic  (a  fact pregnant with moral conclusions) about fif
teen, the Negro twenty, the Peruvian twenty-five, the Ou-
rang-outang thirty-five.       He alluded to the argument of
Negro -nonprogression, drawn chiefly from the foreheads of
                                                                           that

that race ; and after mentioning his desire of appropriating
a single lecture to the defence of i heir progressive powers,
observed, that the 'exhibition of the physiognomical scale,
he then produced, decided against the opposite theorists in
a striking degree,  for the Peruvian was now below the Ne
gro in the physiognomical indication of mental powers; and
it was a notorious fact, that the Peruvians were rapidly ad
vancing up the great ladder of civilization, from the lowest
degree of the scale in which savage existence mingles with
that of brutes at the period of Pizarro's invasion*.                       The
line of the forehead, therefore, did not prevent improve
ment, but accompany degradation.
     In his second Lecture Mr. C. proceeded, from an analy
sis of intellect in the abstract, to an analysis of intellect in
the detail ; observing, that if the intellect have various di
stinct metaphysical powers, such as memory, perception,
imagination, and judgement, the organs of the brain, which
are the media of their action, must correspond with them,
not only in their distinct existence, but in their distinct
position : otherwise, the connexion between brain and
 intellect would not be positive, but partial.                He then pro
 ceeded to a learned           metaphysical analysis of Perception,
 stating it to be a faculty peculiar to childhood j and con
 cluding, that it was necessary to express some proof of its
 existence on the forehead of the child.                After stating the
 Striking difference between the projecting curve of the
 child's forehead and the retiring line of the adult, he ob
 served, that the convex of the former was repressed by a
 horizontal sinus or indenture, as the faculties developed
 themselves, and that the consequence of this indenture
 was the formation of an arch above the brows, which in
 creases as the low er arch recedes. From hence he concluded,
 that the upper or retiring portion of the forehead was the
 province of perception, and the lower or advancing portion
 the territory of the reflecting energies maturing or con
  firmed.      He next remarked, as collateral testimony, the
 projecting rotundity of forehead evident in the faces of
 idiots, which Lavater has already observed.                    This proved
  them the creatures of mere sensation ; and immaturity of
  intellect always accompanied the external sign.  He then
  adverted to a more pleasing collateral testimony.                     It had
  been allowed, he said, by most philosophers, that women
  were superior to men in the perceptive faculties, though
     * We believe that the
                             practice of the Peruvians with their infants, of
  placing the head between boards, firmly confined, to mould them agree,
  ably to their ideas of btauty, materially influences the line of direction.

inferior in the reflective ; that they acquired frequently by
a glance of thought, what men acquired by elaborate and
slow research.      After detailing the benefit which might re
sult from the refinement of this instinctive felicity of rea
soning, he inquired, whether it could be traced in the ex
ternal lineaments?       Nothing could be more satisfactory
than the answer, for the female forehead uniformly differs
from that of man ; and the difference consists in this, that
in the forehead of man there is a strong indenture indica
tive of application : in woman there is none.          The former
is rectilinear, the latter curvilinear,  but curvilinear with
out being projecting. In the former there are protuberances
and broken lines : in the latter the beautiful unbroken arch,
not only of the profile but of the eyebrows, demonstrates
 the superiority of the perceptive faculty, chastened more or
less as it advances or recedes.
     Imagination, the next division of the intellect, the learned
Lecturer stated, was a modification of perception and me
mory.       It must, therefore, be sought for in the upper arch
 of the forehead.  Gall had placed wit in the two angles of
 that upper part, and wit was the effect of imagination.          It
 had been before observed, that a retreating line was pecu
 liar to ardency of thought;- a straight line to judgement ; 
 a projecting line to immaturity of idea. When, therefore, the
 curve peculiar to perception was felicitously mingled with the
 slightly retiring line peculiar to production of ideas, there
 ¦was the character of Imagination,       and such was the fore
 head of most females ; and when the lower arch of the
 forehead indicated a commutual expansion of the organs of
 memory and judgement, there was the constitutional ideal
 of a poetical construction.
     It follows, therefore, that the lower arch of the forehead
  (the protuberance of which is as remarkable in the Greek
 ideal as in the real busts of great men) must be the seat of
 memory and judgement.           Indeed, Gall and Lavater not
 only   both   concur  in  this  proposition, but afford a clue to
 discover the distinct position of these two organs.       Lavater
 has remarked, that he never observed anv one with project
 ing eyebrows who was not a calculating and enterprising
  genius ; and that a perpendicular indenture of the fore
  head above the nose, was equally indicative of acuteness
  and discrimination.     Professor Gall, though he has con
  founded the organs of memory and judgement, concurs
  singularly with Lavater ; for he places the organ of calcu
  lation, which depends evidently on memory, at the ex
  tremity of the eyebrows ; and the organ of association

faculty of judgement, on either side of the perpendicular
indenture of the forehead.           So much for anatomical coin
cidence.     Experience     is equally convincing.         For the fore
head of all eminent men is strikingly marked with the
sinus described, among which none are more remarkable
than Sierne, Johnson, and St. Evremond.                   Besides, it if
certain,  in  all application    or  study    in which   the judgement
is principally concerned, there is a contraction of the
brows, and the consequence of that contraction will be to
deepen the indenture.
   The Lecturer then proceeded to an ingenious expo
sition of the different forms of the eybrows,                    stating
them to be strong hieroglyphs of the mental charac
ter, and exhibiting drawings, of them                   under different
gradations,    from    the  elevated    stare   of astonishment   to the
arched curve of wit; the irregularly depressed line of
sorrow and debility, or the more regular depression of in
tense application.       A scale therefore of gradations might
be formed, and the knowledge of man as an intellectual
being reduced to science.

    At a meeting of this society, on the 29d of February, a
communication from the Rev. Mr. Fleming of Flisk was
read, describing the mineralogical appearances which occur
on the north bank of the Frith of Tay, from Dundee op to
Kingondie quarry.          The rocks are claystorie, claystone
porphyrv, felspar porphyry, greenstone, sandstone, and
amygdaloid.       The sandstone occurs in bason-shaped ca
vities in the porphyry, and contains subordinate beds of
greenstone; but he deferred giving any decided opinion
concerning the geognostic relations of these rocks till h*
should examine the south shore of the Frith of Tay.
   At the same meeting, the Secretary read a communica
tion from Mr. Macgregor, Surgeon to the 25th regiment, giv
ing an account of the mineralogy of the district around the
town of Lanark, particularly at the celebrated falls of Coras
Lin and Stonebyres. Near the former, porphyry- slate and
felspar-porphyry      occur.       At the latter, the waters are
poured over beds of fine-grained sandstone, which, in de
scending, gradually becomes coarser in texture, till it passes
into a conglomerate, consisting of masses of quartz, jas-

Er, etham   Bridge, the traces of  a coal deposition, and  a  por
tion of a coal-field make their appearance ; many alternat
ing beds of sandstone, bituminous shale and clay ironstone
occurring along with thin beds of slate-coal and cannel-
coal.     Mr. Macgregor stated it to be his opinion, that the
sandstone exposed on the banks of the Clyde and of the
Mouse river near Lanark, belongs to one and the same
formation ; and that the Mouse has gradually scooped out
the present channel, in the same way as the Clyde is sup
posed to have done, and that there are here no marks of
any violent convulsion of nature, as some have imagined.
    An extract of a letter from Lieutenant Huey of the 73d
regiment was also read, mentioning the circumstance of
a large marine animal, supposed to be about 30 feet long,

                KIRWANIAN SOCIETY        OP DUBLIN.
     April 1. The   reading of  a  long paper by  M. Donovan,
 Esq., member of      the  Kirwanian Society, entitled " Ob
 servations on the Inadequacy of the Hypotheses, at present
 received, to explain the Phxnomena of Electricity," was
 commenced.
     After a statement of Dr. Franklin's doctrines, Mr. Do
 novan referred them to five general and ultimate proposi
 tions.     He conceived that the elasticity attributed to the
  electric fluid was assumed on insufficient grounds, and
                                                          brought

                  Kirwanian Society of Dublin.              39 J
 brought forward an experiment in which bodies similarly
 electrified attracted instead of repelling each other.      He
 then argued in opposition to Dr. Franklin's opinions con
 cerning the existence, equal distribution, and relative pro
 portion of electricity in bodies; he showed that the train
 of phenomena depending on attraction and repulsion are
 not explained by this hypothesis; and that the reasonings
 on the subject are contradictory to facts, and against them
 selves.
    April 15 the reading was continued.  Mr. Donovan con
 ceived that the impermeability of glass, as assumed by Dr.
 Franklin, was incompatible with some of the Doctor's own
 principles; and, if impermeability were proved, that the
fact would offer insurmountable obstacles to the admission of
 the remaining principles of the hypothesis. He also produced
 an experiment which seemed decisively to prove that glass
is permeable.      He then proceeded, at some length, on the
doctrine of plus and minus, and made an experiment to
 prove that Leyclen phials when fully charged do not indi
 cate the states of electricity usually attributed to them : he
 showed that when a phial is supposed to contain an excess,
it will manifest unequivocal indications of a diminution on
the same surface ; and noticed a variety of other pheno
mena contradictory to the hypothesis.         He concluded his
observations on Franklin's hypothesis, by making some
remarks on its insufficiency to explain excitation.
    May 13. The reading was continued.  The next hypo
thesis which came under examination was that of Ecles,
which has been generally attributed to Svmmer and Dr.
Priestley. After stating the hypothesis, he proceeded to ex
amine its principles.      Some observations were first made
on the improbability of the existence of two distinct fluids.
The author then proceeded to show, that even allowing the
properties assumed as belonging to these fluids, yet still the
phenomena of attraction and repulsion are not explained ;
and that some consequences         fairly deduced from the hy
pothesis are contradicted by well-known facts.         He made
some remarks on Ecles's objections to the permeability of
glass as maintained by Dr. Franklin, and showed that these
objections were invalid.      He further observed, that strong
objections to some parts of the hypoihesis arise out of allow
ing permeability to glass.     It was next shown that on these
principles, the Leyden phial, in the operation called charg
ing, should have even its natural quantity diminished to
one half, far from having one of its powers doubled as is
supposed in the hypothesis.       He concluded his objections

  to Ecles's doctrines with observing, that the great princi-
  pie upon which the whole is founded is demonstrably false.
     At the same meeting a paper, by Dr. Ogilby, (one of the
 vice-presidents,) " On a Formation of Porphyrv which oc-»
 curs in the counties of Antrim and Down," was read. The
  paper was accompanied by a collection of specimens, illus
 trative of the series from the older to the newer beds of this
 formation.     Alter some general remarks upon the porphy
 ries of the Wernerian Geognosy, which have been confined
 to the class of primitive rocks, it was stated as probable,
 in consequence of Professor Jameson having recently dis
 covered transition and flcetz porphyries in Scotland, that
 still more extended observation might develop a series frorn
 the oldest or primitive porphyries of Werner, through the
 transition and flcetz observed by Jameson, to others of still
 later formation, or approaching nearer to the oldest alluvial
 products.     A considerable extent of country between the
 siruill towns of Doagh and Kells, in the county of Antrim,
 called Sandy Braes, and which, had been first noticed (though,
 never described) by the late celebrated Dr. Mitchell, consists
 of porphyritic rocks. Dr. Ogilby has since observed a con
 siderable detached portion, which he considers of the same
 formation, near the town of Newton Glens, on the NE
 coast, and has also found traces of it near the'towns of
 BroughShane and Templepatrick, and at Killymorris in the
 same county ; and, from the. specimens deposited in the
 Dublin Society's Museum, it would also appear to occur
 near Hillsbro', in the county Down.
     After some remarks upon the general appearances of the
 hills composed of these rocks, which are low, irregular and
 obtusely conical in their form, the series of minerals was
 described   in the following order, commencing with the
 lowest or oldest member he could discover of the series.
 ). Porphyritic clay-stone, the basis of which passes on the
 one side into clay of little induration ; and on thq other
 into compact felspar, and rarely, a mineral approaching
jn its characters to red jasper.         2. Felspar porphyry,
 3. Porphyry with a basis of compact felspar and finely
disseminated hornblende, w hich may be called Greenstone
Porphyrv.      Some specimens of this rock showed a strong
tendency to the porphyry slate of Werner.        4. Pitchstone
and pearlstone porphyry, in some of the specimens of which
the passage of pearlstone into pitchstone was very distinct.
     A transition of the pitchstone into hornstone porphyry
was also observable.      The semi and common opal of dif
ferent shades of yellow, and apparently of cotemporam ous

                  Kirwanian Society of Dublin.              399
  formation with the containing rock, occur not unfrequently.
  It has not been fully ascertained whether the pitchstone
  and pearlstone    porphyries occur in beds or veins, but the
  former appears the more probable. The top of Cairnairney-
  hill at Sandy Braes, and of Courtmartin, Tiveraw, and the
  Knocking at Newton Glens, Dr. O. considers as the newer
  beds or deposits which remain, of this formation.      A re
  mark which appears to merit attention, was made respecting
  the Cjuartz and felspar crystals which occur in these por
  phyries.    The felspar in particular has considerable lustre,
  hardness, and regularity, and may he considered as the
  glassy subspecies of Werner, in the newer beds of this for
   mation as at the top of Cairnairney, while these characters
  jn general diminish the nearer we approach to what are
   considered the mechanical deposits, or the older beds of the
   series.  The paper concluded with some theoretical remarks
   relative to the geognoslic situation and mode of formation
  of porphyry.     If the trap rocks of Antrim belong, as is
  commonly supposed, to the newest flcetz formation of
  Werner's arrangement, it will then follow that this por
  phyry is newer than any hitherto observed by Professor
  Jameson, and will probably hold a place in the system un
  der the name of the Newest Flcetz Porphyry.       The answer
  to Mr. Jameson's query respecting the pearlstone of Sandy
  Braes will be then obvious.
      At the fourth meeting held on the 20th, Dr. Ogilby
   submitted to the Society some remarks upon Mr. Davy's
  late proposal of rejecting the oxvniuriate of lime from the
  process of bleaching, and substituting the oxymuriate of
  magnesia, and he presented the results of several experi
  ments upon this subject.
      After some observations upon Mr. Davy's notion that
   the residual muriate of lime, which remains in solution
  after the usual process of steeping in the oxymuriate, pos
  sessed a caustic property and destroyed the fibres of the
  cloth, it was argued that the singular mode of reasoning
  on the assertion made use of by Mr. Davy, " that if a
  strong solution of muriate of lime rendered the cloth un
  sound, a we?k one ought to be proportionally detrimental,"
  could not be for a moment attended to by the bleacher,
  without rejecting every article essential to his process, as
  potash, sulphuric acid, &c. which in their concentrated
  state will dissolve or burn the cloth.      Notwithstanding,
  however, that Mr. Davy had been guided in making his
  new proposal by views of the subject altogether erroneous,

  the action of muriate of lime on linen cloth was deemed

 worthy of trial, and accordingly cuttings of full bleached
 linen were steeped in solutions of the neutral salt, of different
 degrees .of strength, some of them nearly saturated ; and
 after continuing the process with fresh solutions for four
 times, each twenty-four hours, in every experiment, and
 at the end comparing the linen with some of the same
which had not been steeped, it was found perfectly sound,
and not perceptibly reduced in the texture.           It was there
fore stated as probable, that if accidents ever occur in the
 process it must be owing to disengaged muriatic acid, or
to negligence in washing the cloth after the operation of
 Steeping.
    The assertion of Mr. Davy that the oxymuriate of mag
nesia has superseded the use of that of lime, in Ireland,
was contradicted.       Not a single bleacher in the country
uses it; for, if eligible even, it is not within his reach, mag
nesia being 2*. or 3$. per pound.         It appears from the arti
cle Bleaching, in the Edinburgh Cyclopaedia, that the oxy
muriate of magnesia has been employed by the calico
printers of Scotland, in the process of clearing, tor some
time back.     Mr. Davy is not mentioned as the proposer of
it in that article.

                       [Continued from p. 244.]
    The author adds the following reflections which are com
pletely independent of the theory of probabilities, on which
he founded the preceding reasoning.
    The system of elements which most reduces the errors
will certainly be the most probable, if all the observation!
be equally accurate : but if there are two systems of ele
ments, one of which represents, in the best manner, a cer
tain number of observations, and the other of which best
agrees with other observations, then we fall again into per
plexity and uncertainty, and we may propose innumerable
systems for lessening the errors: we may instead of the
small squares propose small equal powers of any given or
der, but the squares are always the most simple  the other
powers would lead us into endless calculations.           If the ex
ponent pair   of   powers   is infinite, we  recur  to  the  method
which demands that the extreme errors shall be minima.
    He finds that the principle of Boscovich returns to the
method in which it might be proposed to satisfy rigorously
a number of equations equal to that of the unknown quan
tities, and in which we should only consider all the rest as
¦o many proofs to enable           us to judge of the precision
                                                              which

  which we may flatter ourselves we have obtained  adding,
  as a second condition, that if the sum of the errors, taken
  with their natural sign, be reduced to zero, we cannot obtain
  more accurate results than by a number of equations of a
  less unity than that of the unknown quantities.
      To conclude, M. Gauss states that the principle of the
  email squares which he has made use of since the year 1 795,
  was published by M.Legendre in 1605 in his Memoir upon
  Comets.
      From this declaration a new question arises. In speaking
  of the above method, both authors use the expression of
  mon principe des moindres carres.               To whom belongs the
  merit of this principle which M.Gauss made use of 16
  years ago, and which M. Legendre seems to have become
  acquainted with so recently ? The answer is very simple.
  It is impossible that M. Legendre can be under any obliga
  tions on this point to M. Gauss, who had not published
  any thing : we are convinced that M. Gauss had discovered
  the theorem, but it is equally clear that M. Legendre not
  only discovered it for himself, but was the first to make it
  public.
      Finally, we may remark that M. Laplace, although he
  has in no shape laid claim to the honour or the discovery,
  has at least directly demonstrated and clearlv developed, by
   an analysis peculiar to himself, a truth which was scarcely
   suspected ; namely, that the corrections furnished by the
   methods of the small squares are the most precise which
   can possibly be procured.         We shall add, for the benefit of
   those who     are  familiarised  to  astronomical calculation, and
"
   who use     the   processes   of  transentlent    geometry, that it is
   sufficient to follow attentively the course and mechanism of
   the numerical calculation of M. Legendre, in order to be
   thoroughly convinced that his method has all the advan
   tages which M. La Place's analysis ascribes to it.           To con
   clude  : as   the   results obtained    are  only  the most probable,
   the calculator ought not to dispense with ulterior proofs.
   These cannot be obtained except by a rigorous calcula
   tion made upon the elements corrected and compared di
   rectly with all the observations.             In fact, the equations
   upon   which    he   wrote,  are only   approximations, since they
   are linear ; and it is not impossible that this revision will
   furnish him, for his elements, with slight modifications,
   which, without carrying him far from the results of the
   small squares, will give still more precision to his Tables.

       * The storms of thunder commenced much sooner at Wait ham stow than
    they were heard at Clapton.      This would induce a belief that the storms
    were low in the atmosphere.       At Epoing, ten miles to the north-east, the
    thunder began and »:ided about the same time as at Hackney.          From the
    accounts which I have often received of the time of the occurrenceof storms
    in different parts of the country, I have been induced to think that fre
    quently a si. 1 ultaneous production of .hem took place in very distant masses
    of atmosphere. This can orly be psceruined by noting down accurately
    the precise period of their commencement and time of their duration in
    different places.     A circumstance to which 1 wish to call the attention of
    meteorologists.

LX.     Some Account of the Methods of laying the Founda
    tions of Bridges,    &c       By the Author      of"    Some Account
    of the different Theories of Arches," &c. in the Philoso
    phical Magazine for December             1811.
The      practice of laying the foundations of bridges in deep
water, generally adopted by the ancients and moderns, has
been to lay the piers dry, either by turning the water into
a new course temporarily,          or by the erection of a coffer
dam round the site of the pier; so continuous, as to pre
vent the water interfering with the works after it had been
once pumped out*.               They have also practised another
method somewhat more ingenious.                 The emperor Claudius
practised it in erecting the port of Ostia ; Draguet Reys,
in erecting the mosque in the sea at Constantinople ; and
Sir Samuel Bentham is said lately to have introduced it in
to this country, in the construction of some works at Sheer-
ness.     A strong grating of wood-work covered with plank
ing at once forms a floating raft, and the floor upon which
the stone pier is to be erected : the pier is composed of
stones well secured together and rendered by cement water
tight: the whule body is made to float upon the water
until it has advanced in height, so, that if it were sunk it
should be above low-warer mark, or higher, as might be
found expedient : this levity is' obtained either by the
assistance of vessels to which the raft is attached by ropes;
or by the pier being worked up with sufficient vacuities to
render it specifically lighter than an equal bulk of water:
the pier is then sunk either by letting the water into the
vacuities, or by loosening the ropes (as the case may be),
the bed of the river being previously prepared by machines
of the description of ballast-heavers that it may ground
level : should the pier not ground level it is raised by
pumping out the water from the vacuities, or by means of
machinery in the vessels, and the operation is performed
until it grounds to the satisfaction of the architect.
    Mr. Labelye in the erection of Westminster bridge, pro
bably conceiving that he had improved upon this latter
method, erected the piers of that structure in caissons or
water-tight boxes j the bulk of the box producing a mass,
    A cofferdam is a double inclosiire of limber
                                                   consisting of piles driven
close together, and strengthened at intervals by larger piles and horizontal
pieces: the space between the inclosures is filled with bricks and sand, or
other materials, to serve the double purpose of giving weight to the dam,
and excluding the water; and is an increased expense of about one-third
of that of erecting the piers.

though    loaded   with the pier, specifically lighter than an
equal  bulk of water.    After each pier was erected, the sides
of the box served again for the boxes of the other piers:
the pier was sunk and raised after the same manner as be
fore described : there are not any piles under the piers of
Westminster bridge ; and only one of the foundations was
found incapable of supporting its charge.         Mr. Mylne, in
the erection of Blacktriars bridge, adopted the same method
as Mr. Labelye did at Westminster bridge in regard to the
caissons ; but he piled the foundations, and by a machine
cut the piles off level with the bed of the river.        In con
templating    the conspicuous irregularities in the latter bridge,
much advantage does not appear to have been gained by
this extra expense, admitting the natural foundations to
have been the same, which it is understood was the fact.
    The practice adopted in the middle ages, probably from
the time of St, Benezet the shepherd of Avignon, in the
twelfth century, the first superior of the order of hospi
tallers called Pontifices, as at the bridges of Avignon, St.
Esprit; Lyons, London, York, Newca:>ile, Rochester, &c.
until modern times, was to drive piles in the bottom of the
river in the site of the intended pier, and then to cut them
off a little below low water : the interstices were then
filled with stone and strong cement} upon the piles they
laid a grating of timber boarded with thick boarding, which
was the floor to receive the pier; the workmen taking ad
vantage of the times of low water until the pier had risen
to the level of high-water mark: this method is of the
purest simplicity, nor does it require the a d of any ma
chinery beyond a pile engine.          The foundation of the
piers of London bridge, as appeared from the pier which
was taken down when the two small arches were converted
into one, was formed of a quadruple row of piles driven
close together on the exterior of the site of the pier, form
ing a case to receive the stone and cement : it was not as
certained whether there were piles in the heart of the pier ;
for as soon as the exterior piles were taken out, the great
force of the w ater cleared away the remainder, which was
driven down the river.
    With a view to protect the piers of London bridge, there
have been constructed round them what are called starlings:
a starling is an inclosure of piles driven close together into
the bed of the river, and tied together and secured by hori
zontal pieces of timber, and the space within them is filled
With chalk, gravel and stone, so as to form a defence to the
internal pilot upon which the stone piers are erected.

                 the Foundations      of Bridges, (£c.         4 11
   Tt has been very    improperly stated, that starlings are ne-
     ary to defend the piers when constructed after the man
ner last described : on the contrary, the use of starlings is
not to defend piers of any particular construction ; they
have been used generally, when, by the plan of the bridge,
too little waterway has been left; and are a very defective,
extravagant and absurd remedy, tending to increase the evil
the effects of which they are meant to oppose.           The fol
lowing table exhibits the proportion of the waterways at
the three bridges in London.
                          Area of the River.   Solids. Waterway.
   London Bridge               19,386         11,581     8,005
   Westminster ditto           19,010          4,242    14,768
   Blackfriars  . . ditto      19,083          4,001    15,082
   Hence it appears that three- fifths of the water at London
bridge is dammed up: the consequence has been, that the
river at this part, by the increased velocity of the water, has
had increased action on the bed, and it has been deepened
14 feet below its general surface, and the piers have been
and are always subject to be undermined ; while at the
other bridges, where the waterway is duly proportioned to
the quantity of the water, the bed of the river has remained
stationary, and starlings or any other expedient have not
been necessary to protect their piers.
   It is manifest, upon whatever principle of construction
the piers of London bridge might have been built, with
the same proportion of solids to waterway, starlings, or
some other means having a similar effect, must have been
resorted to; and it may be inferred that, had the same pro
portion of waterway to solids been preserved, as in the
other two bridges in London, there would have been in
herent in it the same probability of duration ; nor would
there have been any more occasion to have recourse to
starlings.
   The method practised bv the builders in the middle ages
has got into great disrepute, from the prejudice in those
times in favour of arcs of circles for the forms of their
arches ; and they were unable, or wanted courage, to erect
arches of a great span, with a small versed sine : where
the heichts of the banks of rivers have permitted them to
use an arc of a circle with an elevated versed sine for the
form of the arch, they have exceeded both the ancients and
moderns in the length of the chord.
   The piers of their bridges were generally numerous, and
their arches small, rendering an easy ascent to the passen
ger : an over anxiety for security induced them to make

 multiplied, became as great an evil as that which it was
 intended to prevent. There is sufficient evidence to show,
 that timber always kept under water is imperishable, and
 that piles,        they are not undermined bv an improper

turned from its proper course, or to 3tem the torrfent of

tion.
   London    is not yet sufficiently Wealthy for any projector,
however venturous, seriously to propose the method of
turning the course of the river Thames, in order to lay the
foundation of a bridge.      However great may be the com
merce of the countrv, it has not been as profitable as the
conquests of a Trajan: but the time may come, after
having had recourse to the cofferdam, when his example of
turning the Danube may be imitated in respect lo the
Thames.      The emperor Claudius, although he was an idiot,
seems to have been a very able architect : he erected per
haps the most magnificent temple, namely the Temple of
Peace, left by the Romans : ceitainly there are in that struc
ture the most scientific examples of vaulting remaining of
ancient architecture.     He also invented, or approved the
invention by which the foundation of the port of Ostia was
laid : whether he understood the art of making stone walls
swim, remains in doubt. The invention of caissons or
wooden boxes belongs to an age when both iron and stone
had been made to float, and when that knowledge would
seem to point out thai caissons are altogether useless : at
least the emperor Claudius would have discovered, alter he
had made stone piers swim by means of ropes, that there
 would not be any occasion for boxes of wood, when the
pier itself by having some vacuities in it could be made to
answer the same purpose.
    It is due to those whose public virtue leads them to
adorn the metropolis, and add to the advantages which
so eminently belong to    it,   that their labours, disinterested
as those labours must be where there has not been any ra
tional hope of profit, should be attended with as little ex
pense as possible: with that view the attention of your
 readers has been called to the different modes      bywhich the
foundations of the piers of bridges have been laid that they

employ, whether they should adopt the expensive methods
by   turning the water into a    new course, orby  cofferdams,  

dinary abilities,  or whether they shall adopt the cheap
methods of the emperor Claudius or St. Benezet, which re
quire somewhat more talent and judgement.

 have been called my Artificial Commas, in imitation of
 Mercator's artificial commas 53 in the Octave, (Holder's
 Treatise, 1st Edit. p. 79), the reason or derivation of whose
 curious approximate common-measure to Intervals, was
 unknown, I believe, until I had expressed and arranged
 Intervals in the notation by 2, f and m, when the number
 of ms to any note in such new Notation, was found to
 agree exactly with Mercator's numbers.            With respect to
 these and all other artificial commas, it is to be observed,
 thai they form a sort of musical (whole number) logarithms,
 having the least Interval as their unit, and will, by addition
 and subtraction, correctly show the values and relations of
 intervals larger than their unit, and between which no dif
ferences occur smaller than tlieir unit ; all smaller intervals,
 and some of those very near to the value of the unit, are
 however erroneously expressed by them : but in perfect
 Harmony, as I have before observed (vol. xxxvii. p. 274),
 no less Interval than 2 occurs, and therefore they may be
 safely used, in all its calculations.

of this Grand harmonic Scale ; at the multiplicity of whose
Notes, the intelligent student need not be at all alarmed,
since the excellent contrivance of Mr. Liston's Organ, en
ables the whole to come into play when wanted, through
the means of I he 12 ordinary finger-keys, and a pedal' to be
pressed now and then, when the key changes, so as to re
quire the use of notes beyond those twelve that are in the
scale at the time ; and at others, when certain notes require
altering a comma to perfect the harmony, all of which are
marked in numerous examples and pieces of music, in Mr.
Liston's Book, and in other printed Music that he has ready
provided, for those Professors or Amateurs who may honour
him by a trial of his Instruments, at Messrs. Flight and
Robson's.
   The commendable disposition shown by the people of
this metropolis, for encouraging an extension and improve
ment of the Musical Scale of Keyed Instruments (for with
Voices and Violins, &c. Mr. Liston's scale always has and
always will be in use), in the instances that 1 have men

  LXII.     On Vegetable Wax, &c.           By R. M ac-Culloch,
         M.D.    Wvolwich.      Communicated by the Author.
  It    is now well known that wax is a vegetable product, as
   well as the result of an animal process in bees and other
   insects, and the wax of various plants has been successively
  examined by different chemists.          Some slight differences
  have been observed in the several varieties, but they are not
   sufficient to lead us to consider them as different species ;
  rather, like the generality of the resins, to be varieties of
   one common substance. To those already described there
  is still to be added one, which as far as I know has not yet
  been noticed.      This is a substance held in solution in tbe
  essential oil of the rose (the attar of roses) and in that of
  lavender.     I have not searched among the other oils, but it
  will probably be found in some of them. All the varieties
  of these two oils do not however contain it; it is frequently
  absent in the oil of lavender, although but rarely in that of
  the rose.
      I am not acquainted with the circumstances under which
  this variation occurs.     When these oils are cooled below a
  certain point, a portion of this matter is deposited in the
  form of minute crystals, giving them an appearance some
  what similar to that which the fixed oils assume on freezing.
  On the addition also of alcohol it is separated in the form
  of minute brilliant scales, and by this method I obtained
  the portion which I examined.          It is equally separated by-
  water, which, if enough be used, dissolves the whole of the
  oil, and leaves it in a pure state. -It is thus that it is col
  lected in the pipes of the stills in which rose-water is made,
  as it is volatilized in combination with the oil, and precipi
                                                               tated

  4i 4                On.  Vegetalle Wax,     &c.
  tated by the action     of the water which is condensed in the
   worm.     That with which I made the following experi
  ments was procured from lavender; but it seemed to differ
  in no respect from that which I have procured from the
  oriental atiar of roses, or from the distillation of rose-water.
     Although I have called it wax in consideration of its
  vegetable origin, it bears in fact a much nearer resemblance
  to spermaceti in its general properties.          Like that, its feel
  is greasy, and it is deposited in a crystallized mass at the
  bottom of the vessel, just as that substance is deposited
  from the oil of the Cachalot whale.
     The few comparative experiments which follow, will
  show its nature more completely. Having but a very small
  quantity, 1 could not conveniently determine its specific
  gravity ; but it is much lighter than either wax or sperma
  ceti, since it swims in sulphuric ether. It crystallizes from
  its solutions in resplendent scales, and in this property it
  approaches rather to spermaceti         than wax.     Its colour is
 white, and its texture flaky.           It is fusible at 96°, while
  wax is only, fusible at 120°, and spermaceti at 1023. This
 account of the fusibilities of wax and spermaceti differing
 from that commonly received, which slates them at 142°
 and 133° respectively, it is necessary to say that the mode
 which I took to determine this temperature, and to which
 I was compelled by the scantiness of my materials, was by
 causing them to melt on hot water in which a thermometer
 was immersed, and noting the heat at the moment of con
 gelation.     In boiling alcohol it dissolves readily and in as
 large proportion as spermaceti, more readily and in larger
 proportion than wax ; and it is deposited again on cooling.
The three substances seemed equally soluble iu boiling
ether, which however dissolves less of them than alcohol
does.      Its habits with the other compound inflammables,
and with the alkalies, resemble those of wax and spermaceti,
and afford no distinction.
     It is volatilized without apparent change in a tempera
ture considerably lower than spermaceti, and I need not
add, that its vapour is equally inflammable.           1 had no adi-
pocire    with  which   to compare   it.
     Considering these circumstances, we may perhaps regard
it as a vegetable concrete oil, resembling spermaceti rather
than wax, yet differing from it in the characteristic circum
stances of superior volatility and inferior specific gravity,
and bearing a relation to essential oils similar to that which
spermaceti does to the fat ones.

      Farey Senior.
                             To    Mr. Tilloch.
  Sir,    w    hen I first read in your account of Mr. Robert
  Bakewell's Lectures, at the Russell Institution, p. 234, of
  your March Magazine, that Mr. B. exhibited to his auditors,
   " a Geological Map of England, drawn for the purpose" of
  his Lectures, and said, 'Mhat, so far as he knew, this was
. the Jirst attempt to represent in a Map the geological out
  lines of England," I supposed this statement, of a claim
   to originality in mineral Maps of England, to be made, by
  an error or misconception of your Reporter, and which from
   its manifest injustice to others, would receive a speedy cor
  rection from Mr. Bakewell, or some of those who attended
  his Lectures : after waiting, however, the conclusion of his
   three courses, without seeing anything further on the sub
  ject, I am induced -to request your permission to point out,
   that it is incredible that Mr. B. should have been unin
   formed, that Mr. William Smith of Buckingham-street,
   had nearly completed such a Map years ago, as very often
   has been mentioned in your Magazine*, in Dr. Rees's Cy
   clopaedia, &c; not to mention a work, to which Mr. B.
   himself refers (at p. 236), my Derbyshire Report, vol. i.
   p. 108; nor is it more likely, that Mr. B. was uninformed,
   that a primary object of the Geological Society of London,
   as expressed in their printed
                                        " Geological Inquiries," was to
   prepare
             " Mineral Maps of districts," or that he was alto
   gether ignorant of the progress, that G. B. Greenough,
   Esq. their very able and indefatigable president had made,
   in a Map of England and Wales, and another of Scotland,
    which have been very liberally shown (as his important
    collection corresponding to them has) to great numbers,
    besides the members of the Society assembled at their
    meetings; which last Maps, from combining, all that had
    been learnt from Mr. Smith, either directly or through me,
    or others who have examined his Maps aiid collection, with

426          Mr.   Farey's Remarks on the Account             of
the extensive and systematic observations of Mr. G. him
self, and the more local observations of others on the Bri
tish strata, and with most of what has been from time to
time published on the British strata, and on the unst rati Red
districts of Cornwall, the central and norlhern parts of
Wales,      thei Malvern Hills, Charnwood Forest, parts of
Westmoreland,        Cumberland, and Northumberland, &c.
and of great part of Scotland (with which last districts
Mr. Smith had not much concerned himstlf ), are, doubt
less, much more extensive and correct, than anything that
Mr. B. would be able to produce, or at least, to which he
could justly lay claim, without acknowledgement of the
sources whence he derived part at least of his materials.
 I was, therefore, and still am desirous, sir, of thinking,
that Mr. B. only intended to sav, that this was the first
time that a Geological Map of England had been ex
hibited in a course of public Lectures expressly on the
 subject; which yet, if it be literally true, will scarcely
render this claim of Mr. B. a fair one, as it is stated,
 when it is considered, that Mr. Greenotigh's Maps have,
 often I believe, been exhibited to ecological assemblies of
             and that Mr. Smith's were more than once, I br
 fiersons,
  ieve, exhibited to numerous meetings of the Board of
 Agriculture, and have so often been shown publicly, at
 meetings congenial with Mr. B.'s previous pursuits in life*,
 at Bath, Woburn, Holkham, G >swell-strcet, he. as I have
 mentioned in your xxxvth M. p. 114, and elsewhere. Let
 it not he supposed, that I am herein laying any claim to a
 Geological Map of England of my own, since it is well
 known to my friends, that the obligations w hich I have felt
 myself under to Mr. Smith, as the original piacliser and
   romoter of useful and general investigations oj the Strata,
   ave, as much as the want of time for                it,
                                                 prevented mv
 attempting any general Map, such as those of Mr. Smith
 and Mr. Greenough above mentioned          while at the same

or rather the account of them that you have published,
permit me to mention, that I still with additional reason,
as I conceive, adhere to my former position, in the Derby
Report, &c. with respect to the metalo-basaltic Limestone
Rocks of Derbyshire, having lower places in the series than
any other Rocks that I have seen, or know by the Reports
of others, in the British Islands; and still conclude, as
I mentioned in your lO-2d page (vol. xxxix.), that the same
do not appear in the north-west of Yorkshire, in particular,
as Mr. Bakewell is made to assert, p. 236 ; since on inquiry,
I am told, that his reasons for so saying are, that " the
quality of the Limestone and the Mineral Veins are the
same ," which I hold to be very inadequate marks of the
identity of strata: Purely Mr. B. might have done, or can.
now tell us, whether the succession upwards, from what
he calls the 4th Limestone, is the same, or at all allied,
to that I have described in Derbyshire ? but above all,
whether he was able to detect, all or any considerable pro
portion of the species of sheds and other Reliquia in the
Yorkshire Limestones, that the late Mr. William Martin
has figured and described    in his " Petrificata Derbiensia" ?
Shropshire   or North  Wales,   I have not seen, except in the
distant horizon, but from what I have read of Mr. Arthur
Aikin's on those districts, and learnt from my valuable
friend Mr. John Lloyd, of Wygfair, (who descended into
Llden Hole, many years ago,) and others, I conclude the
limestone Rocks there, to be the same with that which un
derlies the great South Wales Coal bason, of which 1 have
made mention in the preface to mv Report, p. xiii, and
which overlies a Red- Marl series, such as I have described
at p. 2/0, in your 39th volume, but' not the same pro
bably.
   That the Caverns in Limestone Rocks, were not generally
formed bv the washing of subierranean currents, at least,
are not now enlarging or deepening by that means (as I
hear that Mr. B. maintains respecting certain Caves in or
near Cumberland), must be abundantly evident, to those
who will examine the bottoms of such Derbyshire caverns
or opens, as are connected together, and which will be
found in great part filled up with mud, sand, shale-grit and
quartz gravel, etc., washed into them from the surface of
the shale, by means of some of the Water-swallows that
I have mentioned, Rep. i. p. 295 : Merlin's Cave, in the
Land occupied by the late William Langsdon, Esq. (but as
I am told, not belonging to him, as I have stated) and now

'   428    Mr. Farey's     Remarks on    Mr. Balewelfs        Lectures.
     by Mr. Thomas Bird, I believe, in Eyam, is a very com
     plete instance of this filling up of caverns by subterranean
     currents, instead of their being formed thereby.
         Respecting the opening of the fissures occupied bv mi
     neral veins, Mr. B. (p. 314) appears, like Dr. James Miller,
     when speaking of the Wernerian Theory (as I have ob
     served in the note, p. 74 of my Report) to overlook the
     causes assigned, and principally insisted on by M. Wer
     ner himself, in his " new Theory" of Veins, laielv trans
     lated, viz. slips " in rainy seasons," and the yielding and
     cracking of the mass by iis own weight, when the rock
     was " at first wet and possessed little solidity," and part
     of it fell lo i he free side !. The suggestions which Mr.
     Bakewell offers, at the bottom of page 315, as to the pro
     bable voltaic influence which the sides or cheeks of the
     Vein have had on the metallic deposits within              it,   is   in
     genious, and accords well with most of the facts which                I
    .know, particularly ihat remarkable one, that the bearing
     measures (Rep.   i.  246), or particular beds of Rock between
     which the ore   is  principally lodged in the vein, were         in
                                                                      se

     the Rock, as    in Ashovcr Vellcy, Crich, Matlock High-Tor
     and Masson Hills, &c, the bearing-measures therein, are
     found to conform to ihis shape of the floor, with very va

 LXIV.       On the Effects produced by the Use of the Oxy-
     muriates of Lime and Magnesia in Bleaching.                 By Mr.
     William Moore.
                           To   Mr. Tilloch.
 Sir, Tn the proceedings of the Kirwariian Society of
 Dublin, published in your Magazine for last month, Dr.
 Ogilby having stated some assertions he said were made
 by Professor Davy, as to the theory and effects of oxymu-
 riate of lime in bleaching; as I have been present at the
 lectures when those assertions are said to have been made,
 I am confident Dr. O.'s statements are incorrect 5 I there
 fore trouble you with the following narration of facts :
     Sir Humphry Davy, having stated that muriate of lime
 had been proved by experiments to have a deleterious effect
 on linen cloths, recommended the use of oxymuriate of
 magnesia for that of lime in bleaching. His reasoning as
 to the muriate of lime was, " that bodies in their nascent
 state acted with more energy than when they had been
 formed ; and not as Dr. Ogilby says, that " if a strong so
 lution of muriate of lime rendered cloth unsound, a weak
 one ought to be proportionally detrimental."             The Doctor's
 experiments to prove that muriate of lime had not an in
jurious action on linen cloths, I have repeated, viz. having
 steeped cuttings of full bleached linen in solutions of the"
 neutral salt of different degrees of strength, some nearly
 saturated : ihey were steeped* only for twenty-four hours;
and upon being well washed and dried, they were found to
be so rotten as not to require any longer trial.                 The re
 petition of Dr. Ogilby's experiments was "deemed worthy,"
 not from an idea " that Sir Humphry Davy's views on this
 subject were all together erroneous," as the Doctor modestly
 asserts,    but from a presumption that the Doctor might
 possibly be mistaken.
     Dr. Ogilby also contradicts an assertion which he says
 Sir Humphry Davy made ; namely, " that magnesia had
 entirely superseded the use of lime in Ireland for bleach
 ing ;" and the Doctor says, that not a single bk-acher uses
 it. To refute this, I need only state (as nearly as possible)
  the words made use of by the Professor in the lectures.
  He said that he was happy to state that some hints which
  he had the pleasure         to give in a preceding course of
    * The Doctor
                 repeated the immersions four time?, for twenty-four  Iiouri
  each time.

  430         Method of preparing             a cheap and durable
  lectures had been acted upon by an enlightened individual,
  Mr. J. Duppy junior*, of Dublin, who had tried magnesia
  instead of lime; and that it succeeded to his wishes.                       As
  Dr. Ogilby was present at the lectures in Dublin, 1 am at
  a loss to account for his mis-statements.                   Unwilling to at
  tribute them to any improper motive, I conclude that they
  were made in ignorance of the facts.

  LXV.      Method       of preparing      a cheap and durable Stucco, or
     Plaster, for outside or inside Walls.                   By H. B.    Way,
      Esq. of Bridport Harbour f.
  Sir,    In  consequence          of your expressing         an opinion    that
  a general   knowledge of my method for preparing a stucco,
 or plaster, for outside walls of houses much exposed to sea
 breezes or bad weather, would be of service to the public,
  I have inclosed an account of the process, and I will with
 pleasure furnish any further particulars of this business for
 the Society of Arts, or permit any gentleman to examine
 it who may wish for more information on the subject.
 You know the situation of my house, which is greatly ex
 posed to the spray of the sea and bad weather; and I can
 truly add, that by means of this stucco it is perfectly free
 from damp, and the plaster remains compact and durable.
                              1 remain, sir,
                                    Your obedient humble servant,

    * The Professor showed die letter to this effect from Mr. Duppy, which
 he had received that morning, as also some pieces of culico goods which
 had been bleached by the magnesian process; and Mr. Duppy also thought
 the colours were superior in brilliancy to those prepared by lime, as the
 former process directed.

432       Method of preparing    a cheap and durable
 composition were measured, (according to the account for
 merly given,) contains exactly thirteen gallons of water,
 wine measure, and would hold exactly 1 cwt. 1 qr. 7 lb. net
 of the sand used ; the weight of the lime I do not know,
 and my being able to ascertain exactly the weight of the
 sand, arose from my waggon being employed to carry what
 was used at Yeovil and East Coker, from hence, and for
 what I sent to Yeovil I was paid Is. Qd. per cwt.          From
 the sand here succeeding so well, Thomas Everett would
 not be prevailed on to engage to do any of that sort of
 work with hill or river sand, to be got on this shore. The
 work he did for me was all by the day ; what he did at
 Yeovil and East Coker he agreed for at eight-pence per
 yard, of nine feet superficial measure for labour only for
 the two coats, at four- pence per square yard for one coat,
 all the materials being brought to the spot at his employer's
 expense, and who also found scaffolding and scaffold
 ropes : this, I think, is considerably higher than by my
 calculation of the expense of what I had first done he
 ought to have charged ; but its being done at a distance of
 twenty miles from where he lives, and in the most busy time
 of the year for mason's work, I suppose must account for it
 in the first instance, and having once made that price, he
would not now work under ; but I believe, for a considerable
 building, and with sufficient notice, and being allowed 6d.
 per mile in lieu of wages and travelling expenses for him
 self and an assistant, out and home, he would go to any part
 of the kingdom, on being paid 8d. per yard for the work.
 It has been the general received opinion here, that plaster
 made with sea sand, unless well washed in fresh water,
 would be always damp; but, on the contrary, I find from
 what has been done in my dining-parlour and passage, it
has been always quite dry, although the whole of the sand
with which it has been done has been thrown up by the sea,
and must have been alwavs at spring tides covered with sea
water; indeed, it sometimes happens that, for months to
gether, there is none to be collected on our shores at this'
place, that Everett thinks fine enough for the purpose ; and
as I am now and then applied to for getting
                                               it,
                                               I     have lately,
when my horses were at leisure, got     a  small quantity col
lected and hauled in for my own use, or, in case of its being
wanted,I     charge id. per cwt. for it, where it   isdeposited.
As design at some future time to make some alteration in
  I
the passage done with the stucco in April 1806,      I   had four
pieces   taken  off, which
                        I    tied up separately, each  ina  piece

          Stucco, or Plaster, for outside or inside Walls.             433
of brown     paper, and had them packed in a box, with a layer
of sand between each piece, and at the bottom and top of
the box, and directed it for you, and sent it with some goods
I  shipped on Saturday last to my friend Netlam Giles, Esq.
No.   2,  New Inn, St. Clement's.               I have requested of him
that he   will have the goodness          on  its arrival to forward it to
you.     The vessel    it  goes by     is  the  sloop Mary Anne, John
Anning, master, bound to Dounes Wharf, Hermitage,
Wapping.        It is possible that the pieces of stucco sent may
imbibe some of the saline particles from the sand it was
packed in, but this did not occur to me at the time, or they
should have been packed in saw-dust, as they were perfectly
dry when packed, so much so as, when struck upon with
the knuckle, to give a sound similar to what an earthen
vessel would do if dry and not cracked.                   Should there be
any   further  information       requisite,   on  your letting me know,
it shall immediately be sent you. It had almost escaped
me to say, that the small quantity of six yards, done last
October with stone lime for trial, was done from your in
timating to me, when I had the pleasure of seeing you in
Dorsetshire, that stone lime was likely to answer; but it
would I think look better if white-washed ; the difference
in point of expense is materially in favour of the stone lime.
The cost of my waggon-load of it at the kiln, about a mile
from hence, would be only 10s., whereas about the same
 quantity of chalk-lime at the kiln, full eight miles from
hence, would cost \l.4s,, and I cannot get any chalk-lime
nearer.     1 have only now to add that 1 am, very respect
fully,

    LXVI.      Cases    of Hernia.        By   John Taunton, Esq.
                               To  Mr. Tillock.
Sir,    The      following      statement     of the situation and occur
rence     of hernia      at different periods        of life, has been ob
tained principally from patients relieved by the City of
London Truss Society*, and entirely under my own ob
servation within the short period of four years and a half.
It  appeared to me to form an interesting article               of reference,
   * The following are the outlines of the plan of this most excellent Insti
tution.   Editor. " The objects of this Charity are to provide trusses for
every kind of rupture  to furnish bandages and other necessary instru
ments for all cases of prolapsus  to perform every necessary operation
to administer surgical aid promptly  and to supply medicines and attend
ance during the cure of the patient.
   " Annual subscribers of one guinea or more to this Charity shall be go
vernors as lung as they continue such subscription ; and be at liberty to re
commend three patients within the year for single trusses, or one patient for
a doulle, and one for a single trust, for each guinea subscribed.
   " Subscribers of ten guineas or upwards shall be governors for life, with
the same privileges ; besides being members of all committees. The moneys
arising from all life subscriptions are regularly invested in the public funds.
   " Mr. Taunton attends at the City Dispensary on Wednesdays and Satur.
days, at one o'clock precisely, to examine the cases recommended; or the
patients may apply at his house, No. 21 , Greville-street, Hatton Garden, any
morning before nine o'clock.
   " Governors recommending patients who cannot come to London, on ac
count of the distance, are required to send to the surgeon the name, age, and
residence of the patient, the exact measure round the body at the pnrt where
the hernia is seated, and the particular situation of the hernia, and also to
say if it can be returned when the patient lies down in bed.  All letters or
orders for trusses must be sent post paid."
                                                                              to

438        On the Culture and Preparation      of Hemp
  rotten dung has been spread, say about a ton to the load :
  this is well ploughed in, and the ground well ploughed two
  or three times, and well dragged and harrowed, to get the
  soil as fine as possible, and about two or two and a half
 bushels of seed sown to the acre ; what produces no seed,
 called by some male or summer hemp, and by others cinner
 hemp, is drawn about five or six weeks after the plant comes
 up, it is at that time in blossom ; when drawn, it is tied up
 in bundles, and carried to some meadow land, and there
 spread to ripen : when ripe and dry, it is bundled and
 stacked.      What stands for seed has no flower that can be
 discovered ; it is the female hemp, and is generally ripe
 early in September, when it is drawn, bundled up, and
 stowed up in the field for the seed to dry and harden, when
 it is thrashed out in the fields. Most commonly in Dorset
 the seed is sold on the spot, at from 2s. 6d. to 7s. per
 bushel ; an acre of hemp produces eighteen or twenty bu
 shels.     In Somerset they have sometimes thirty bushels of
 seed to the acre.      In the sowing season I have known 21s.
 per bushel paid for seed ; when thrashed the hemp is carried
 to the meadows, and spread to ripen as the other, and
 stacked in the same way, to prepare it for sale; it is sent to
 the houses of the poor in the parishes round which it is
 raised, to be what is called scaled, that is, each separate
stalk of hemp is broken in the hapd, and the hemp, which is
 the outside rind or bark, is stripped off, in which state it is
sent to market. The scaling is the employment of old men,
women and children, and of the whole of the labouring
family in the evening, as in winter they make but poor
wages of       it,and one principal inducement for them to do
it  is, that the woody parts of the hemp make them            fire,
                                                               a
but  it  soon burns out.     Complaints are made of great deal
                                                      a
of the hemp being often wasted from improper management,
and want of care in the scaling of    it
                                       ;   at the Comptons and
Bradford,      a good deal more hemp would be raised       ifthey
could get  it    scaled, which they find much difficulty in do
ing  ;  andif    itwere possible to construct a  mill that would,
swingle   it  at    moderate expense, on some such plan as the
                     a
flax swingling mills, and to afford some encouragement to
the erecting them, as well as flax swingling mills,        would
                                                          it
encourage the growth of both articles materially      ;  an acre
of hemp   in    a good season will produce'14, 16 or 18 weights,
of 32 lbs. to the weight    in   Dorsetshire; in Somersetshire
they reckon their weight two pounds less, and they some
times get as much as 35 weights to the acre       j  the price     of

           in Dorsetshire, and the Growth         of Sea-Cale.            439

    Ground well manured             Hemp.
    But sometimes they dress the ground well for hemp every
third year. The quantity of hemp sown in Dorset is very
trifling in comparison to what is sown in Somerset.  In the
former it is chiefly confined to eight or nine parishes;
whereas very large quantities are raised in Somerset, in the
parishes of Misterton, Crewkerne, Hinton, St. George,
Lopen, Seavingtons, Ilminstcr, Stocklinch, Donyatt, King-
stone, Shipton, Beauchamp, Barington, South Petherton,
Martlock, Norton, Chiselborough,Stoke-under-ham,           Mont-
a-cute, Odconibe, the Chinniocks, the Cnkers, the Comp-
tons, Bradford, and a great many other parishes.             Mr.
Emanuel Pester, of Preston, near Yeovil, is in the middle of
the hemp and flax county, and he can doubtless obtain and
       every information that may be wished on the subject,
    five                           in
  eing so extensively engaged     agricultural pursuits himself,
and so competent to give that sort of information wanted;
a  bounty of 3d. per stone on hemp, and Ad. per stone on
flax, was for many years given        Government, but
                                        by                   now     is
discontinued     ;  was paid"
                     it        bythe Clerk of the Peace for the
counties; and as the late Mr. Wallace managed that for the
county or Dorset uncommonly well,            most probable that
                                              it   is
a  very  correct return for the county  of Dorset   could be ob
tained from the office of the Clerk of the Peace for this
county, of the quantity raised each year of both articles,
during the continuance of the bounty; also from Devon
and Somerset similar returns could be got.        There are large
quantities of     hi
                  mp raised   inSuffolk, the writer thinks, near
St. Edmunds Bury and Stow market,                  in
                                               that county.   He
has been told they make linen so fine of hemp, as to be
worth 5s. and 6s. per yard, and used for shirts in preference
to Irish, being considered much more durable and better, so
much so, as to iuduce the Irish to imitate the fabric, and
stamp the cloth, Suffolk Hemp.               also raised
                                             It   is        Nor  in
folk, in the neighbourhood of Lvnn and Wisbeach, but                        it
must be watered and prepared in some other way indeed            ;
he   isconvinced that all the hemp imported from the Baltic
is  prepared differently from the mode used           Dorset and
                                                         in

to the different ports it was shipped at for this country.
The giving the former bounty on the growth, and increas
ing it on hemp and flax", would encourage the growth ; but
if given on the number of acres sown, the grower, as his
ground would be in high order for a crop of turnips and
wheat after, might be careless ahout his crop of hemp, as
the bounty, to be worth notice, must be worth more than
the value jaf the seed in common years and the labour of
sowing.
   Hemp in this county and the next is never sown in new
ground fresh broke up, but flax always by choice, when
fresh ground can be got.     Mr. John Pitfield is going to
break up great part of the West               Gift   at Bridport Harbour,
and sow it with flax this season.                 The writer, while on the
subject of hemp, is led to mention, that when travelling in
the year 1792, in the province of Massachusets near Bos
ton, in North America, was assured that considerable quan
tities of hemp were raised in the township of Sunberry,
about ten miles from Boston, and that it was always raised
on the same ground every year, no other crop being sown
in their hemp lands, and that it was manured every year, at
the rate of about ten tons of manure to the acre of hemp.
Respecting seed, he cannot learn that there is any for sale
at Bridport, with the buyers who purchase it up for' the
growers at the hemp harvest, and he expects that very little
can be got from the growers round here.        Somersetshire is
a more likely place to get       as he has known some of the
                                   it,
hemp farmers to have upwards of an hundred acres of hemp
in one season; round this they generally are only          small
                                                                in in
                                                                        a
way.   A    change of hemp seed        much wanted
                                              is         Somer
set and Dorset.     Trials have been made two or three limes
to getit  from Russia    but
                         ;         not possible to get new seed
                                   it    is
from the interior early enough in the fall at the shipping
ports, and some old seed which has been shipped has not
answered the purpose      ;  new could have been got,
                              if                          would    it
as generally, have been used for      change, as the new Riga
                                              a
barrel flax seedis   bythe flax-growers.    As the seed sown in
Russia was considered         good sample, and its appearance
                              a
much liked, possibly         might, at
                             it           future period, be ob
                                                   a
tained in the fall from Odesea, or some other port on the
Black'Sea, as  it    understood that
                    is                     good deal of hemp
                                                   a
shipped at Riga and St. Petersburgh grows much nearer to
the Black Sea than the Baltic       or possibly the seed of the
                                         ;
Italian hemp raised in the neighbourhood of Bologna, or
that of America, might be obtained in time to answer.
                                                        Perhaps

          Dorsetshire, and on the Growth       of Sea-Cale.   441
Perhaps tares, called by some vetches, might be cleared
from the ground early enough for manuring and sowing the
ensuing crop of hemp, and vetches might make it worth the
farmer's attention: to this an objection was stated, which
I do not just now remember. On talking with the gentle
man before mentioned, and stating the American practice,
with what had passed on it with my neighbours, he said,
he had long been persuaded that it was a good practice, and
that he had the last season a very good crop of hemp on a,
piece of ground that had hemp the year before, and that he
did not let the hemp stand for seed, but had it all down at
the usual time for drawing the summer or male hemp, and
 the ground immediately sown with turnips, which were fed-
 off with sheep, and the ground then slightly manured, and
 hemp sown again at the proper season ; and that he had
 then, October 27, 1808, a piece of turnips after his hemp,-
 which were worth 6/. per acre.              It is to be dbserved,
 that   the acre here  meant   is the British acre of one hundred
 square poles,     three   hundred and four square yards each.
 The manure mostly used for hemp is good rotten stable
 dung, which is much preferred to any other, though lime
 is frequently used ; but manufacturers pretend to assert,
  (with what foundation I cannot say,) that they can di
 stinguish a material difference in the quality of the hemp,
 where lime has been used instead of dung, as from lime
  they say hemp is more harsh and brittle, and not of Such

     Account    of the Culture of Sea-Cale, or Sea-Kale.
   The mode which I consider the hest for the culture of
sea-cale, is to draw lines in a very dry soil and dry situation,
on ground with a southern aspect, about two feet one way
by about eighteen inches the other, and where the lines
cross to put in three or four good perfect seeds in a square
or triangle, about three inches apart; this may be done any
time in November or December in open weather, and it will
require no other care afterwards but keeping the ground
clear from weeds till the autumn of the following year,
when ali the plants but one of the finest in each square may
be taken up, which if wanted will serve to form other beds
set the same distance apart.     The ground in the intervals of
the plants should be dug in the spring and fall of the year,
taking care not to injure the plants. The leaves should be
left on the plants till they fall off naturally, which will not
in general be sooner than the latter end of November.         In
the autumn of the second year the same attention should
be paid to the plants, and to remove the dead leaves.
   In the third year, about the middle or latter end of No
vember, when the leaves have been cleared away, and the
ground dug, each plant should be covered over close with a
tub, pan, a heap of small stones, coarse cinders, or coarse
bark, raised about ten or twelve inches over the crown of
each plant, and from about the latter end of February to the
latter end of March the plants will be very fine and fit for
use. I prefer that which has been bleached with our round
sea-gravel, about the size of large peas or beans, to any
other mode whatever.        The plants should be cut but once
in a year, as cutting it oflciier weakens and lessens the size
of the plants. If it is not desired to have the plants large,
they may be bleached and cut a year sooner.
   I have sent a specimen of the sandy soil in which it
grows naturally here, as I think the generality of gardeners
are too careful, and manure the ground too highly for it.
In the month of April last, after cutting my plants, I co
vered the ground all over, at least six inches above the
crown of the plants, with this earth : they soon shot up
through   it,  and never looked finer or produced     a   larger
quantity  of  good seed than that year.
I    am thus particular in order to show that this vegetable
will succeed as well, if   not better in poor ground than in
rich, provided   the soil be  dry, and care taken in the ma
nagement;  I    speak from   long experience, having been well
acquainted with the management of this valuable plant from
                                                             my

my youth.     When I cut the sea-cale for use, I immediately
draw up the earth with a trowel, so as completely to cover
the whole of the plant ; this I fancy makes them grow
more luxuriantly.     This plant, if properly managed, is su
perior  to  asparagus, and if more is cut than wanted for
immediate use, it will keep for some days in a pan of cold
water, but of course it cannot be better than when recently
cut.   It precedes the use of asparagus, being ready for th«
table in February and March.

LXVIII.    On a gaseous Compound of carbonic Oxide and
  Chlorine.   By John Daw, Esq. Communicated by Sir
  Humphby Davy, Knt.              LL.D.     Sec.    R.S.*
Since    the influence of electricity and solar light, as che
mical agents, are analogous in many respects, and as the
former produces no change in a mixture of carbonic oxide
and chforine, it was natural to infer the same respecting the
latter. MM. Gay Lussac and Thenard assert that this is
the case ; they say that they have exposed a mixture of car
bonic oxide and chlorine, under all circumstances, to light,
without observing any alteration to take place f. Mr. Mur
ray has made a similar statement J.
   Having been led to repeat this experiment, from some
objections made by the last-mentioned gentleman to the
theory of my brother, Sir Humphry Davy, concerning
chlorine, I was surprised at witnessing a different result.
   The mixture exposed, consisted of about equal volumes
of chlorine and carbonic oxide ; the gasses had been pre
viously dried over mercury by the action of fused muriate
of lime, and the exhausted glass globe into which they
were introduced from a receiver with suitable stopcocks,
 was carefully dried.   After exposure for about a quarter of
an hour to bright sunshine, the colour of the chlorine had
 entirely disappeared ; the stopcock belonging to the globe
 being turned in mercury recently boiled, a considerable ab
 sorption took place, just equal to one half the volume of
the mixture, and the residual gas possessed properties per
 fectly distinct from those belonging either to carbonic oxide
 or chlorine.
    Thrown into the atmosphere, it did not fume. Its odour

 was different from that of chlorine, something like that
 which one might imagine would result from the smell of
 chlorine combined with that of ammonia, yet more into
 lerable and suffocating than chlorine itself, and affecting
 the eyes in a peculiar manner, producing a rapid flow of
 tears and occasioning painful sensations.
    Its chemical properties were not less decidedly marked
 than its physical ones.
    Thrown into a tube full of mercury containing a slip of
 dry litmus paper, it immediately rendered the paper red.
    Mixed with ammoniacal gas, a rapid condensation took
 place, a while salt was formed, and much heat was pro
 duced.
    The compound of this gas and ammonia was a perfect
 neutral salt, neither changing the colour of turmeric or lit
mus ; it had no perceptible odour, but a pungent saline
 taste ; it was deliquescent, and of course very soluble in
water; it was decomposed by the sulphuric, nitric, and
phosphoric acids, and also by liquid muriatic acid ;.but it
sublimed unaltered in the muriatic, carbonic, and sulphu
reous acid gasses, and dissolved without effervescing in
acetic acid. The products of its decomposition collected
over mercury were found to be the carbonic and muriatic
acid gasses; and in the experiment with concentrated sul
phuric acid when accurate results could be obtaified, these
two gasses were in such proportions, that the volume of the
latter was double that of the former.
    I have ascertained by repeated trials, both synthetical and
analytical, that the gas condenses four times its volume of
the volatile alkali, and I have not been able to combine it
with a smaller proportion.
    Tin fused in the gas in a bent glass tube over mercury,
by means of a spirit lamp, rapidly decomposed it; the li
quor of Libavius was formed ; and when the vessel had
cooled, there was not the least change of the volume of
the gas perceptible ; but the gas had entirely" Tost its offen
sive odour, and was merely carbonic oxide ; for like car
bonic oxide it burnt with a blue flame, afforded carbonic
acid by its combustion, and was not absorbable by water.
   The effects of zinc, antimony, and arsenic heated in the
gas, were similar to those of tin ; compounds of these me
tals and chlorine were formed, and carbonic oxide in each
experiment was liberated equal in volume to the gas decom
posed. In each instance the action of the metal was quick ;
the decomposition being completed in less than ten mi
nutes j but though the action was rapid, it was likewise
                                                      tranquil.

                    of carbonic Oxide and Chlorine.                       445
tranquil, no explosion ever took place, and none of the me
tals became ignited or inflamed.
   The action even or potassium heated in the gas was not
violent.  But from the great absorption of gas, and from
the precipitation of carbon indicated bv the blackness pro
duced, not only the new gas, but likewise the carbonic
oxide, appeared to be decomposed.
   The white oxide of zinc heated in the gas quickly decom
posed  it,  just as readily indeed as the metal itself; there was
the same formation of the butter of zinc but instead of     ;
carbonic oxide being produced, carbonic acid was formed;
and, as usual, there was no change of volume.
   The protoxide of antimony fused                    in
                                               the gas rapidly de
composed       it
                ; the butter  of antimony   and   the infusible per
oxide were formed         there was no change of the volume
                          ;
of the gas, and the residual gas was carbonic oxide.
   Sulphur and phosphorus sublimed              the gas, produced
                                                      in
no apparent change        the volume of the gas was unaltered,
                          ;
and Uncharacteristic smell was undiminished.
    iv^ixed with hydrogen or oxygen singly, the gas was not
inftamed       bythe electric spark, but mixed with both, in
proper proportions, viz. two parts          volume of the former
                                                 in

                                                                 a
plosion was produced, and the muriatic and carbonic acid
gasses were formed.
   The gas transferred to water was quickly decomposed,
the carbonic and muriatic acids were formed, as in the last
experiment, and the effect was the same even when light
was excluded.
    From the mode of the formation of the gas and the con
densation that takes place at the time, -from the results of
the decomposition of its ammoniacal salt, and from the
analysis of the gas       by
                          metals and metallic oxides,        appears it
to be a   compound of carbonic oxide and chlorine condensed
into half the space which they occupied separately.
   And from its combining with ammonia, and forming
with this alkali      neutral salt, and from its reddening lit
                      a
mus,  it   seems to be an acid.        Itsimilar to acids in other
                                            is
respects   ;  in decomposing the dry sub-carbonate of ammo

dependent of these circumstances, were power of saturation
to be taken as the measure of affinity, the attraction of this
gas for ammonia must be allowed to be greater than that of
any other substance, for its saturating power           greater isno      j

acid condenses so large a proportion of ammonia ; carbonic
acid only condenses half as much, and yet does not form a
neutral salt. The great saturating and neutralizing powers
of this gas are singular circumstances, and particularly
singular when compared with those of muriatic acid gas.
   In consequence of its being decomposed by water, I have
not been able to ascertain whether it is capable of com
bining with the fixed alkalies. Added to solutions of these
substances it was absorbed, and carbonic acid gas was dis
engaged by an acid .
    I
    have made the experiment on the native carbonates of
lime and barytes, but the gas did not decompose these bo
dies. This indeed might be expected, since quick-lime, I
find, does not absorb the gas : a cubic inch of         exposed it,
to the action of lime          in
                             tube over mercury, was only
                                    a                                 di

                                                       a
no further absorption was afterwards observed to take place.
But even this circumstance does not demonstrate that the
gas has no affinity for lime, and       not capable of combin

bonic acid, substituting this gas for the new compound, the
result was the same; in two days only about one-tenth of
a  cubic inch was absorbed.

   The former appeared to require for saturation ten times
its own volume; six measures of the liquor condensed
about sixty of the gas.   The liquor thus impregnated was
thrown into water, and      pretty appearance was produced

 I   cannot account for the assertion of MM. Gay Lussac
and Thenard and of Mr. 'Murray, that oxymuriatic gas
does not, w hen uuder the influence of light, exert any ac
tion on carbonic oxide:     was inclined at first to suppose
                                    I
that the difference between their results and mine, might
be owing to their not having exposed the gasses together to
bright sunshine; but have been obliged to relinquish the
                               I

                 of carbonic Oxide and Chlorine.             447
idea, since I have found that bright sunshine is not essen
 tial, and that the combination is produced in less than
twelve hours by the indirect solar rays, light alone being
necessary.
    The formation of the new gas may be very readily wit
nessed, by making a mixture of dry carbonic oxide and chlo
rine in a glass tube over mercury : if light be excluded, the
chlorine will be absorbed by the mercury, the carbonic oxide
alone remaining ; but if bright sunshine be immediately ad
mitted when the mixture first is made, a rapid ascension of
the mercury will take place, and in less than a minute the
colour of the chlorine will be destroyed, and in about ten
minutes the condensation will have ceased, and the com
bination of the two gasses will be complete.
    It is requisite that the gasses should be dried for forming
this compound ; if this precaution is neglected, the new
gas will be far from pure ; it will contain a considerable
admixture of the carbonic and muriatic acid gasses, which
are produced in consequence of the decomposition of hy-
grometrical water. Indeed there is considerable difficulty in.
 procuring the new gas tolerably pure ; a good air pump is
 required, and perfectly tight stopcocks, and dry gasses, and
dry vessels.
    I have endeavoured to procure the gas, by passing a mix
ture of carbonic oxide and chlorine through an earthenware
tube heated to redness ; but without success.
    The specific gravity of the gas may be inferred from the
specific gravities of its constituent parts jointly with the
condensation that takes place at their union. According'to
Cruickshank, 100 cubic inches of carbonic oxide weigh
29-6 grains, and according to Sir Humphry Davy, 100 of
chlorine are equal to 76'37 grains : dence, as equal volumes
of these gasses combine, and become so condensed as to
occupy only half the space they before filled, it follows that
 100 cubic inches of the new compound gas are equal to
 10597 grains. Thus this gas exceeds most others as much
in its density as it does in its saturating power.
    To ascertain whether chlorine has a stronger affinity for
hydrogen than for carbonic oxide, I exposed a mixture of
the three gasses in equal volumes to light.       Both the new
compound and muriatic acid gas were formed, and the affi
nities were so nicely balanced, that the chlorine was nearly
equally divided between them.        And that the attraction of
chlorine for both these gasses is nearly the same, appears to
be confirmed by muriatic acid not being decomposed by car
bonic oxide, or the new gas by hydrogen.

   The chlorine and carbonic oxide are, it is evident from
these last facts, united by strong attractions ; and as the pro
perties of the substance as a peculiar compound are well
characterized, it will be necessary to designate it by some;
simple name.         I   venture to propose that of phosgene, or
phosgene gas;         from   <?(»;, light, and  ytvoaai, to produce,
¦which signifies formed by light; and as yet no other mode
of producing it has been discovered.
    I have exposed mixtures consisting of different propor
tions of chlorine and carbonic acid to light; but have ob
tained no new compound.
   The proportions in which bodies combine appear to be
determined by fixed laws, which are exemplified in a variety
of instances, and particularly in the present compound.
Oxygen combines with twice its volume of hydrogen and
twice its volume of carbonic oxide to form water and car
bonic acid, and with half its yoluine of chlorine to form
euchlorine ; and chlorine reciprocally requires its own vo
lume of hydrogen and its own volume of carbonic oxide
to form muriatic acid and the new gas.
   This relation of proportions is one of the most beautiful
parts of chemical philosophy, and that which promises fair
est, when prosecuted, to raise chemistry to the state and
certainty of a mathematical science.
LXIX.      New Tables fur finding the Deviation of a Star in
    North Polar Distance arid Right Ascension. By Mr. T.
    Firminger,          late Assistant   Astronomer    at the Royal
    Observatory,       Greenwich*.
In    the present improved state of astronomy, every means
which    tends to simplify calculation is readily embraced by
tjie practical astronomer. With this view a variety of tables
at different times have been published, and some of them
so concise and simple that they seem to afford but little if
any room for further improvement ; whilst others, however,
Have not vet been so far improved, but that they still admit
qf a considerable degree of simplification ; and of these the
means of determining the nutation of a star in north polar
distance from tables as heitherto published, is an instance.

published at the end of the Greeenwich Observations of the
year 1798, wherein the argument is applied to take out
the equation by double entry, induced me to compute new
tables for more readily finding it.         The formula which
I deduced for this purpose, is expressed by -~ l",22 x st

the ellipse of nutation be hereafter determined of different
values from that which has been used in the above for

LXX. A       Narrative     of the Eruption of a Volcano in the
   Sea  off   the  Island   of St. Michael. By S. Tillard,
   Esq. Captain in the Roi/al Navy. Communicated by the
   Right Hon. Sir Joseph Banks, Bart. K.B.P.R.S.*
Approaching          the island of St. Michael's, on Sunday the
12th of June 1811, in His Majesty's sloop Sabrina under
my command, we occasionally observed, rising in the ho
rizon, two or three columns of smoke, such as would have
been occasioned by an action between two ships, to which
cause we universally attributed its origin.                This opinion
was, however, in a very short time changed, from the
smoke increasing and ascending in much larger bodies than
could possibly have been produced by such an event ; and
having heard an account, prior to our sailing from Lisbon,
that in the preceding January or February a volcano had
burst out within the sea near St. Michael's, we immediately
concluded that the smoke we saw proceeded from that
cause, and on our anchoring the next morning in the road
of Ponta del Gada, we found this conjecture correct as to
the cause, but not to the time ; the eruption of January
having totally subsided, and the present one having only
burst forth two days prior to our approach, and about three
miles distant from the one before alluded to.
   Desirous of examining as minutely as possible a conten
tion so extraordinary between two such powerful elements,
I set off from the city of Ponta del Gada on the morning of
the 14th, in company with Mr. Read, the Consul General
of the Azores, and two other gentlemen.                     After riding
about twenty miles across the NW. end of the island of
St. Michael's, we came to the edge of a cliff from whence
the volcano burst suddenly upon our view in the most ter
rific and awful grandeur. It was onlv a short mile from
the base of the cliff", which was nearly perpendicular, and
formed the margin of the sea; this cliff being as nearly as
I  could judge from three to four hundred feet high.                  To
give you    an   adequate    idea   of  the   scene   by description is
far beyond my powers ; but for your satisfaction I shall
attempt it.
    Imagine an immense body of smoke rising from the sea,
 the surface which was marked by the silvery ripling of the
waves, occasioned by the light and steady breezes incidental
 to those climates in summer.            In a quiescent state, it had
 the appearance of a circular cloud revolving on the water

  452      A Narrative of the   Eruption of a Volcano
 like  an horizontal wheel, in various and irregular involu
 tions, expanding itself gradually on the lee side, when sud
 denly a column of the blackest cinders, ashes, and stones
 would shoot up in form of a spire at an angle of from ten
 to twenty degrees from a perpendicular line, the angle of
 inclination being universally to windward : this was rapidly
 succeeded by a second, third, and fourth, each acquiring
 greater velocity, and overtopping the other till they had
 attained an altitude as much above the level of our eye, as
 the sea was below it.
    As the impetus with which the columns were severally
 propelled diminished, and their ascending motion had
 nearly ceased, they broke into various branches resembling
 a groupe of pines, these again forming themselves        into
 festoons of white feathery smoke in the most fanciful
 manner imaginable, intermixed with the finest particles of
falling ashes, which at one time assumed the appearance of
 innumerable plumes of black and white ostrich feathers
 surmounting each other ; at another, that of the light wavy
 branches of a weeping willow.
    During these bursts, the most vivid flashes of lightning
 continually issued from the densest part of the volcano ;
 and the cloud of smoke now ascending to an altitude much
 above the highest point to which the ashes were projected,
 rolled off in large masses of fleecy clouds, gradually ex
panding themselves before the wind in a direction nearly
horizontal, and drawing up to them a quantity of water
spouts, which formed a most beautiful and striking addi
tion to the general appearance of the scene.
    That part of the sea where the volcano was situated, was
upwards of thirty fathoms deep, and at the time of our
viewing it the volcano was only four days old.      Soon after
our arrival on the cliff, a peasant observed he could discern
a peak above the water : we looked, but could not see it ;
however, in less than half an hour it was plainly visible,
and before we quitted the place, which was about three
hours from the time of our arrival, a complete crater was
formed above the water, not less than twenty feet high on
the side where the greatest quantity of ashes fell ; the dia
meter of the crater being apparently about four or five hun
dred feet.
    The great eruptions were generally attended with a noise
like the continued firing of cannon and musquetry inter
mixed, as also with slight shocks of earthquakes, several of
which having been felt by my companions, but none by
myself, I had become half sceptical, and thought their
  .                                                   opiniou

            in the Sea off Ike Island of St. Michael.     459
opinion     arose merely from the force of imagination : but
while    we were sitting within five or six yards of the edge
of the cliff, partaking of a slight repast which had been
brought with us, and were all busily engaged, one of the
most magnificent bursts took place which we had yet wit
nessed,    accompanied by a very severe shock of an earth
quake.      The instantaneous and involuntary movement of
each was to spring upon his feet, and I said " This admits
of no doubt." The words had scarce passed my lips, be
fore we observed a large portion of the face of the cliff,
about fifty yards on our left, falling, which it did with a
violent crash.      So soon as our first consternation had a
little subsided, we removed about ten or a dozen yards
further from the edge of the cliff, and finished our dinner.
    On the succeeding day, June 15lh, having the Consul
aud some other friends on board, I weighed, and proceeded
with the ship towards the volcano, with the intention of
witnessing a night view; but in this expectation we were
greatly disappointed, from the wind freshening and the
weather becoming thick and hazy, and also from the vol
cano itself being clearly more quiescent than it was the
preceding day. It seldom emitted any lightning, but oc
casionally as much flame as may be seen to issue from the
top of a glass-house or foundery chimney.
    On passing directly under the great cloud of smoke, about
three or four miles distant from the volcano, the decks of
the ship were covered with fine black ashes, which fell in-
termixt with small rain. We returned the next morning,
and late on the evening of the same day I took my leave of
St. Michael's to complete my cruize.
    On opening the volcano clear of the NW. part of the
island, after dark on the 16th, we witnessed one or two
eruptions that, had the ship been near enough, would have
been awfully grand.       It appeared one continued blaze of
lightning ; but the distance which it was at from the ship,
upwards of twenty miles, prevented our seeing it with
effect.
    Returning again towards St. Michael's on the 4th of
July, I was obliged, by the state of the wind, to pass with
the ship very close to the island, which was now completely
formed by the volcano, being nearly the height of Mat
lock High Tor, about eighty yards above the sea. At this
time it was perfectly tranquil ; which circumstance deter
mined me to land, and explore it more narrowly.
    I left the ship in one of the boats, accompanied by some
of the officers. As we approached, we perceived that it
                                                          was

454       A Narrative   of tlie Erupt ion of a Volcano.
 was still smoking in many parts, and upon our reaching
 the island found the surf on the beach very high.      Rowing
 round to the lee side, with some little difficulty, by the aid
 of an oar, as a pole, I jumped on shore, and was followed
 by the other officers.    We found a narrow beach of black
 ashes,  from   which   the side of the island rose in general
 too steep to admit of our ascending; and where we could
have clambered up, the mass of matter was much too hot
to allow our proceeding more than a few yards in the as
cent.
    The declivity below the surface of the sea was equally
steep,     having seven fathoms water scarce the boat'*
length    from  the shore, and at the distance of twenty or
thirty yards   we  sounded twenty-five fathoms.
    From walking round it in about twelve minutes,               I
should judge that it was something less than a mile in cir
cumference ; but the most extraordinary part was the cra
ter, the mouth of which, on the side facing St. Michael's,
was nearly level with the sea.      It was filled with water, at
that time boiling, and was emptying itself into the sea by
a small stream about six yards over, and by which I should
suppose it was continually filled again at high water. This
stream, close to the edge of the sea, was so hot, as only to
admit the finger to be dipped suddenly in, and taken out
again immediately.
    It appeared evident, by the formation of this part of the
island, that the sea had, during the eruptions, broke into
the crater in two places, as the east side of the small stream
was bounded by a precipice, a cliff between twenty and
thirty feet high forming a peninsula of about the same di
mensions in width, and from fifty to sixty feet long, con
nected with the other part of the island by a narrow ridge
of cinders and lava, as an isthmus of from forty to fifty
feet in length, from which the crater rose in the form of an
amphitheatre.
   This cliff, at two or three miles distance from the island,
had the appearance of a work of art resembling a small fort
or block house. The top of this we were determined, if
possible, to attain ; but the difficulty we had to encounter
in doing so was considerable; the only way to attempt it
was up the side of the isthmus, which was so steep, that
the only mode by which we could effect        it, was by  fixing
the end of an oar at the base, with the assistance of which
we forced ourselves up in nearly  a   backward direction.
   Having reached the summit of the isthmus, we found
another difficulty, for
                      it    was impossible to walk upon    it,as
                                                             the

      On the primitive       Crystals   of Carlonate of Lime.                         455
the descent on the other side was immediate, and as steep
as the one we had ascended ; but by throwing our legs
across     as would be done on the ridge of
          it,                                 house, and               a
                                    it by
moving    ourselves forward        our hands, we at length
reached  that part of    where
                          it      gradually widened itself and
formed the summit of the cliff, which we found to have                                    a
perfectly flat surface, of the dimensions before stated.
   Judging this to be the most conspicuous situation, we
here planted the   Union, and left bottle sealed up contain

to pieces upon attempting to take them up; and              the                      by
account of the inhabitants on the coast of St. Michael's,
great numbers of fish had been destroyed during the early
part of the eruption, as large quantities, probably suffocated
or poisoned, were occasionally found drifted into the small
inlets or bays.
   The island, like other volcanic productions,           com                   is
posed principally    of porous substances, and generally
burnt to complete cinders, with occasional masses of                                      a

    surprising accuracy of whose measurements I could, in va

    offer what will not only appear interesting to crystallogra-
    phers in general, but will be peculiarly gratifying to the
    Abbe Haiiy.
      In his Traite      de   Mineralogie,       and again more recently
    in his Tableau Comparatif,           the    same primitive form  as*   is
    signed to three substances very different in their compo
    sition,   to carbonate of lime, to magnesian carbonate of
    lime (or bitter-spar), and to carbonate of iron.
      It   has been objected to Mons. Haiiy, that according to
    his method identity of form should be accompanied by
.   identity of composition, unless the form were one of the
    common regular solids.       For though in that case any geo
    metrician would readily admit         to be very probable, that
                                          it
    many different substances might concur in assuming the
    same form of cube, of octohedron, or of dodecahedron,
    &c. there doe's not appear      corresponding probability that
                                     a
    any two dissimilar substances would assume the same form
    of a   particular rhomboid of 105° and           few minutes, to
                                                       a
    which no such geometric regularity or peculiar simplicity
    can be ascribed.
        But though so accurate     correspondence, as has been hi
                                     a
    therto supposed to exist in the measures of the three car
    bonates above mentioned, might be justly considered as
    highly improbable, no degree of improbability whatever
    attaches to the supposition, that their angles approach each
    other     bysome difference, so small as hitherto to have es
     caped  detection.    And this in fact find to be the case.

    these bodies to less than five minutes of          degree.

    spect from  this quantity,   I am inclined to   think   that it will
    more likely be found to be deficient by a few minutes, than
    to exceed the measure here assigned ; and accordingly to
1   differ still more widely from those angles which I am about
    to mention.
       In the magnesian carbonate of limer or bittcr-spar, the
    primitive form is well known to be a regular rhomboid, as
    well as that of carbonate of lime, and so nearly resembling
    it, as to have been hitherto supposed         the same.         find,           I
    however,   a  difference of       10'

    crystals; for that of the magnesian carbonate            full 106j°,   is
    asI   have observed with uniformity in at least five different
    specimens of this substance obtained from situations very
    distant from each other.
       The primitive angle of iron-spar             still more remote
                                                           is
    from that of the carbonate of lime, which                exceeds       it              by
    nearly two degrees.       I have examined various specimens
    of this substance, some pure white, others brown, some
    transparent, others opake. That which gives the most
    distinct image   by reflection    of
                                       is   brownish hue, with the
                                                     a
    semi- transparency of horn.        was obtained from
                                        It                     tin mine,        a
    called Maudlin Mine, near Lostwithiel               Cornwall. Byin
    repeated measurement of small fragments of this specimen,
    the angle appears to be so nearly 107°, that           cannot formI
    any judgement whether         in
                                   perfect crystals     will prove to be
                                                                    it
    greater or less than that angle.
       In this instance the carbonate of iron         nearly pure, and
                                                                 is
    so perfectly free from carbonate of lime, as to render                                 it
    highly probable that in other specimens having the same
    angle, but containing also carbonate of lime or other ingre
    dients intermixed, the form         really dependent on the car
                                            is
    bonate of iron alone.
      It   appears however not unlikely, that when substances
    which agree so nearly in their primitive angle are inter
    mixed in certain proportions, they may each exert their
    power and may occasion that confused appearance of cry

other substances produced in the distillation of wood; and
on their analogy with the native Bitumens," was read.
    When wood is submitted to destructive distillation, there
is obtained, among other products, a black substance re
sembling common tar. This tar is very inflammable, and
so liquid that it may be burnt in a lamp.           By washing it
with water either hot or cold, or submitting it to the action
of lime or of the mild alkalies, a large portion of acetic
acid is separated, and the residue becomes pitchy and tena
cious.     It is entirely soluble in caustic alkali, in alcohol,
in ether, in acetic acid, and in the mineral acids. The fat
oils and the recent essential oils dissolve but little of it} but
if the former are made drying, and if the latter have become
brown by keeping, they ihen act more readily and copi
ously.     Coloured oil of turpentine takes up a considerable
quantity, but naphtha only acquires a scarcely sensible
brown colour by digestion upon it. When carefully di
stilled at a gentle heat it is decomposed into an oily mat
ter, at first limpid and afterwards brown, a quantity of
acetic acid combined with a little ammonia; and a spongy
coal remains in the retort.        In this process no inflammable
gas is given out ; but at a high temperature the oil is more
or less decomposed, and an inflammable gas is produced,
which, however, does not burn wijh a flame by any means
so bright as the gas from pit-coal.        If this destructive di
stillation is not carried very far, the matter in the retort
will be found, when cold, to be solid, brilliant, shining,
and possessed of a conchoidal fracture:           its taste is burn
ing and pungent, and its odour is that of wood smoke ; it
is fusible and readily inflammable.         When kept melted in
an open vessel till it ceases to be fusible, it becomes more
and more brilliant, its fracture passes to splintery, and it
assumes the perfect appearance of asphaltum.             In propor
tion as it approaches this state it becomes less and less so
luble in alcohol, and at length scarcely gives a stain to this
menstruum.        Naphtha has no action on     it,   and in this cir
cumstance alone     it   differs from asphaltum.        Dr. M. then
proceeds to an examination of the Bitumens, and shows
that the difference between the products of recent vegetable
matter, and of the bitumens when subjected to distillation,
consists in the former yielding empyreumatic acetic acid
and  a   black pitchy matter insoluble in naphtha; while the
latter afford ammonia and naphtha, but little or no acid.
He then enters into      a   detailed investigation of the proper
ties of the very important class of Lignites, or those sub-
                               G     3,

  stances, such as peat, surturbrand, Bovev coal, &c. in which
  the traces of vegetable origin are not obliterated.
     Submerged wood from peat mosses gave a brown oil
  smelling of wood-tar, and refusing to dissolve in naphtha.
     A compact pitchy-looking peat gave a fetid oil resem
  bling in odour neither wood-tar nor bitumen, and very
  slightly soluble in naphtha.
     Bovey brown coal gave an oil resembling in odour that
  of wood-tar, but much more soluble in naphtha: that por
 tion of the oil which was insoluble in this menstruum had
 a strong odour of wood smoke.
     The oil of jet was almost perfectly soluble in naphtha,
 and smelled strongly of petroleum ; but it afforded also em-
 pyreumatic acetic acid.
     Thus it appears that there exists a class of fossils of un
 doubted vegetable origin, which exhibit the gradual pro
 gress from wood to bitumen, and in which this change
 lias been brought about by the action not of heat but of
 water.
     The experiments, however, of Sir James Hall seem to
 show that heat with compression is also capable of con
verting wood into coal.  A critical examination of this fact
was the next object of Dr. M.; and he found on heating
wood in close gun-barrels that a black coaly-looking sub
stance was indeed produced, but that it consisted wholly of
charcoal, empyreumatic acid, and wood-tar, and did not
contain the smallest portion of real bitumen.         Hence the
experiments alluded to do by no means prove the possibi
lity of converting vegetable matter into real coal by mere
heat.     It appears however to Dr. M., that the consolida
tion of bituminized vegetables into coal is not unlikely to
be the effect   of subterranean heat.
    The   paper concludes by showing the identity of the pitch
procured from the distillation of wrfod and the pigment
called Biitre ; and points out methods of obtaining it in a
state better fitted than common bistre for the purposes of
the artist; and also enumerates several other uses to which
this substance may be (Economically applied.
    Some notes on the mineralogy of the neighbourhood of
St. David's, in Pembrokeshire, bv Dr. Kitla, (Prof. chem.
Oxford, and member of the Geological Society,) were read.
    The country about St. David's when viewed from an
eminence presents the appearance of an extensive uneven
plain, interspersed with numerous detached hills or rocky
summits of an irregular conical shape. The two highest of

these hills are Penbury and Carn-Llidy, the western por
tion of the latter of which forms the promontory of St.
David's- head.
   These hills present no appearance of stratification, and
are composed of feldspar and homblend in various propor
tions and states of aggregation.     They are each surrounded
by mantle-shaped strata of slate, elevated at a high angle,
and presenting the characters      of grauwakke-slate.    This
latter is traversed by veins of quartz, from which very fine
specimens of rock-crystal are procured. No carbonate of
lime appears to be contained either in the unstratified trap
or in the slaty grauwakke; nor did there occur in them,
with the exception of one equivocal instance, the smallest
trace of any organic remain.
   May 15. The president in the chair.  An account of
the island of Teneriffe, by the hon. Henry Grey Bennet,
 (member of the Geological Society) was read.
   The greatest length of this island from north to south is
about seventy miles, its greatest breadth does not exceed
thirty miles.     In the south-western part of the island is si
tuated the mountain called by the Spaniards El Pico di
Tiede, but better known by the name of The Peak of Te-
nerifle, the height of which, from the mean of several ob
servations, appears to be about 12,500 English feet.
   The rocks and strata of this island appear to be wholly
volcanic.     A long chain of mountains passes through the
interior, sloping on the eastern, western, and northern
sides to the sea, but on the S. and SVV. elevated into
nearly perpendicular mountains which are intersected by
deep and narrow ravines.
   The lowest bed of the island is porphyritic lava composed
of homblend and feldspar, in its upper pari porous, sco-
riform, and sometimes passing into the state of pumice.
Upon this rests a bed of the same substances as already
mentioned, but in structure nearly approaching to green
stone.    This is covered by a thick bed of pumice, which,
itself is overspread with basaltic lava, on which in many
places rest beds of tufa and volcanic ash.
   This basaltic lava decomposes sooner than any of the
other rocks, and contains the greatest variety of imbedded
substances : it is sometimes divided by a layer of olivine
in crystals some inches long, and is often intersected: by
thick veins of porphyritic slate.      Zeolite and chalcedony
also occur in it.
   The number of small craters and extinct volcanos is pro
digious :  they arc to be found in all parts of the island,

but none    of them have been in activity of late years. The
great streams of Java have flowed from the peak : those of
the years 1704 and 1797 (which was the last) are basaltic.
This latter flowed so slowly, notwithstanding the sharp de
scent of the mountain, that it was several days in advancing
three miles.     On the south-western side of the peak is afi
ancient lava not at all decomposed several miles in length,
and in a perfect state of vitrification resembling obsidian.

and W. Franklin, M. D. were elected ordinary members.
    "An account," by Thomas Webster, esq. (member of
the Geological Society,) "of some new varieties of Alcy-
onia, found in the Isle of Wight," was read.
    In viewing the rocks about Ventnor Cove and in various
parts of the underclifF, Mr. Webster remarked, in the
sandstone stratum immediately under the chalk-marl, a
great number of small prominences resembling in form
the branches of trees.      They were of various sizes, from
half an inch to three or four inches in diameter : their sub
stance was sandstone of the same kind as the rocks they
were in ; but the part resembling the bark was somewhat
harder, which enabled it to endure longer than the rest of
the stone, and thus project above its surface. Some of
them were straight, others a little crooked, and in a few-
instances he observed them forked.         He found fragments
 of these bodies in every part of the island where the
sandstone stratum can be seen, and particularly among
the masses of rock lying under the cliffs of Western Lines.
In this last place he found that the stems above described
had frequently heads or bulbous terminations attached to
them, in form somewhat resembling a closed tulip, and in
 some of these he found distinct traces of organic structure,
from which it appeared that these heads consisted of a
 group of tululi now converted into and enveloped with
 Stony matter. Besides these extraordinary shapes which pro
jected in relief, Mr. W. observed a variety of very regular
 white figures as if painted upon the rock, being even with its
 surface. They consisted of circles from two inches to half
 an inch in diameter, ellipses of various eccentricities, and
 parallel lines both straight and crooked.
    By a careful examination Mr. W. found that these white fi
 gures belonged to the other class of bodies a'readv described;
 that the cylinders were only the internal parts of the same
body, whose various sections formed the white circular and
elliptical figures. The vast masses of rock which' have
fallen down, having separated from the cliff at the division*

between the beds, showed their upper and under surfaces
 covered with layers of these bodies heaped upon each other
 and lying prostrate in every possible direction; and in the
joints between the beds where they were not separated,
 they were distinctly seen.
     The green sandstone and the limestone he found to be
 the chief repositories of these bodies.      In the ferruginous
 sand below the green sandstone he found none, and only a
 few fragments of cylinders in the blue marl on which the
 sandstone rests.     He traced them upwards into the chert ;
 but they there became rare, and they totally disappeared in
 the chalk-marl.
     He found them, however, frequently in the fragments of
 flint lying on the shore.      Mr. Webster having brought
 away an extensive series of specimens (which he has since
 deposited in the collection of the Society), submitted them
 to the examination of Mr. Parkinson, who is of opinion
 that they belong to the genus Alcyonium, but that they are
 of three or four different species, neither of which have
 been hitherto described.       From the resemblance which
  these bodies bear to a closed tulip attached to its stalk, Mr.
 W. suggests that the name of Tulip Alcyonium may be not
  improperly applied.
      " Some observations," by James Parkinson, esq. (mem
  ber of the Geological Society,) " on the specimens of Hip
  purites from Sicily," presented to the Society by the hon.
  Henry Grey Bennet, (a member) were read.
      These specimens Mr. Parkinson considers to be such as
  demand particular attention, as they possess those charac
  ters which will probably serve to correct some erroneous
  opinions respecting the nature and habits of the animals
  of which these shells were the dwellings.                 ,
      One of the specimens contains a nearly perfect shell,
  longitudinally divided so as to display the two ridges with
  the numerous septa and chambers.
      From an examination of these specimens, and by com
  paring them with the observations he has before had an op
  portunity of making, Mr. Parkinson is of opinion that the
   structure of the shell of the Hippurites is such as would
  enable the animal to raise itself to the surface of the water.
      This opinion is in opposition to that of M. Denys de
  Montfort and most of the French or'y otologists, who con
   sider the Hippurites as belonging to what they term pela
   gian shells, or such as constantly inhabit the bottom of the
   sea, never rising to the surface or appearing on the shores,
   and therefore that there is no reason to believe them as be

coral rock varying in elevation from twelve to twenty feet,

   Deep fissures have in many places of the island rent
asunder the cliffs, and these gullies (as thev are called) are
continued across the terraces in irregular lines.    Numerous
caves are everv where to be met with, and they are some
times of very large dimensions.

-     A letter from E. L. Irton, esq. describing some remark
  able tubes found in the drifted sand at Drigg in Lancashire,
  was read ; together with an account, by W. H. Pepys,
  esq. (Treasurer G. S.), of a chemical examination made by
  him of the substance of these tubes.
     These tubes are nearly in a perpendicular position, im
  bedded in the midst of the hills of drifted sand, on the sea
  shore, without any communication with the surface; and
  there are ramifications extending from them which gene
  rally point downwards and terminate in fine points.        The
  tube sent to the Society is above an inch in diameter, and
  of an irregular form : the outside consists of black and
  white sand agglutinated together; the inside is smooth, and
  has a vitrified appearance.       When dug out of the sand it
  was soft, and in some degree flexible ; and the inside coat
  ing at its first exposure to the air was soft to the touch and
  rather unctuous ; but in less than a quarter of an hour it
  hardened into the state in which it now exists.
      The tube when found was filled with the sand of the hill,
  and that sand is quite different from the sand of which the
  outside of the tube consists.
  > Both the sand and       the vitreous part of the tube scratch
  glass ; and on the latter, when viewed by a lens, there are
  seen small air-blebs, such as are common to imperfect vi
  trification.    Both are insoluble in sulphuric      and nitric
  acids; infusible before the blowpipe without addition, and
  partially fusible on the addition of boracic acid ; but with
  soda a complete fusion took place, and the residue was
  nearly soluble in water.
      A paper by Dr. M'Culloch (member of the Society),
  "  On the vitrified Fort of Dun MacSniochain, near Oban
  in Argyleshire," was read.
      In the discussion which some time ago took place re
  specting the vitrified forts of Scotland, the question on
  which the two contending parties were most at issue, was,
  whether the vitrification wa3 the effect of design or of acci
  dent.  It occurred to Dr. M. that light might be thrown on
  the subject by examining with mineralogical accuracy the
  substance of which these structures were composed, and
  noting the changes which each had undergone in conse
  quence" of the fire, and also by observing whence the stones
  had been derived which were used in them; and that the
                                                         question

   468                    Geological Society.
  question   of accident or design might   be illustrated, by exa
   mining in  the laboratory the degree of heat required to pro
  duce the appearances in the stones which actually existed in
  these structures.
     The fort of Dun MacSniochain stands on a long narrow
  bill, which is nearly precipitous along three parts of its cir
  cumference, and at the other end it rises from the plain
  with  a very accessible   acclivity. The walls, which are all
  at present buried under the soil, are about eight or ten feet
  in thickness.     They bear marks of vitrification through
  their whole extent; but in no case does it appear to have
  extended more than a foot or two upwards, and the most
  perfect slags are found at the bottom of the foundation.       In
  the higher parts of these are stones roasted by the action of
  the heat, but unverified, and at length the marks of lire
  almost entirely disappear. The hill consists of alternate
 beds of schistus and limestone, but the latter is the predo
  minant rock.
     It is perfectly insulated in a great alluvial plain. The
 mountains of Benediraloch, which bound the plain to the
 west, consist of granite gnejss, mica-slate, quartz and por
 phyry.     On the edge of these rocks are found large de
 tached masses of puddingstone,          consisting of rounded
 pebbles of greenstone of different varieties, of amygdaloid
 and quartz cemented by a paste which appears to consist
 chiefly of trap sand, united by the hard variety of calca
 reous spar.    The paste contains also in small quantity zeo
 lite, prehnite, garnet, and diallage. This puddingstone
 where nearest the fort is at least half a mile distant from
 it. The walls of the fort consist principally of granite
 gneiss, mica-slate, clay-slate quartz, puddingstone and py-
ritical slate entangled together with a verv 'small proportion
of the particular rock on which the fort itself is founded:
puddingstone forming the greater part of thrm.          This pud
dingstone Dr. M. shows to be the only verifiable ingre
dient of the walls ; and from the distance from which it
must have been brought, and the great quantity of it em
ployed in the work, he considers it probable that the build
ers of the fort must have been acquainted with its verifiable
nature, and that it was on account of this quality that they
had employed so great labour in transporting it.            For if
their object had not been to produce vitrification, but mere
ly to erect a dry wall of stone, the limestone of the hill
would have answered their intentions,, or perhaps the loose
stones of the adjoining plain.
    That they did not obtain the puddingstone from the
                                                             latter

latter source, is evident; for although the plain and shore
are covered with fragments, these consist almost entirely of
the primary rocks : and besides the pieces of the wall
which have not felt the fire, there are angular fragments,
showing pretty clearly that they were not collected on an
alluvial plain, but broken from the rocks where they are
found?
    Dr. M. next proceeds to describe the various states in
¦which the different stones are found.
    The puddingstone exhibits the greatest variety of
 changes.     It is found in every state, from a black glass to
a spongy scoria capable of floating in water, sometimes ex
hibiting the gradual succession of changes from incipient
calcination to complete fusion.        To ascertain the degree of
heat necessary to produce the corresponding changes in this
 rock, Dr. M. submitted various parts of it to the furnace,
and found that some of the fused substances must have been
brought to that state in a heat not less than 100° of
Wedgwood's scale ; a heat at which many varieties of
 earthen- ware are baked.                         
    Dr. M. next gives a short account of the vitrified fort of
 Craig Phadric in Invernessshire, and of another in Gallo
way ; in both of which, but more particularly in the
 former, he observed circumstances quite analogous to what
he had already found at Dun MacSniochain ; and the con
clusion he has been led to form is, that the vitrification of
 these forts is the effect of design.
    The Society adjourned till November.
                      RUSSELL INSTITUTION.
    May.  In    the fourth Lecture   Mr. Bakewcll proceeded to
 describe  the stratified  rocks containing rock-salt and coal.
 The coal districts in England and in other parts of the
 world, he said, were generally separated from the compact
 limestone which contains metallic veins, by thick beds of
 coarse grit-stone and sand-stone, in which some vegetable
 remains first make their appearance.             In the midland
 counties of England, there arc two kinds of rock interposed
 between the coal and the lime, forming together a mass of
 three hundred yards in thickness.      The lower bed consists of
 a dark reddish-brown shale, in which strata of micaceous
 sand-stone and beds of dark limestone occasionally occur.
The upper rock was called by Mr. Whitehurst mill-stone
 grit, from its containing beds of hard siliceous grit-stone,
 used for mill-stones.      This rock varies both in colour and
                                                           quality

 470                     Russell Institution.
 quality   in different parts.   It  was    first observed by Mr.
 Whitehurst that under this rock no coal          is ever found. This
 observation Mr. Bakewell said was correct, as applied to
 workable coal, or such beds that were of sufficient thickness
 to be got with profit; but very thin seams of coal, as well
 as vegetable impressions, are not unfrequent in these rocks.
 They extend over a considerable part of the northern coun
 ties, and form the range of central hills from the north of
 Derbyshire to Craven in Yorkshire.              Mr. Bakewell said
 he was inclined to believe that the lower bed, a dark-brown
 shale, changed its quality as it passed into Cheshire, and
 was there the red sand rock of that and the adjacent
 counties.     He observed that he did not consider some dif
 ference in external character alone sufficient to disprove the
 identity of strata which may spread over a larce tract of
 country.     In this red sand rock the rock-salt oF Cheshire
 is found.     He described the various repositories of salt in
Spain and different parts of the world, and observed, that
it had been found at the height of 9000 feet above the level
of the sea; and from its position, as well as from the dif
 ference of its constituent parts from those of sea-salt, he
was inclined to believe that it had not been formed by the
evaporatoin of sea-water, as some geologists have asserted.
The rock-salt of Cheshire is remarkably free from im
 purities, containing, according to the correct analyses of
Dr. Henry, not the least sulphat of magnesia, and not one
grain in 1000 of muriate of magnesia.            In the same quan
tity  of  sea-salt not  less than  46  grains   of   these two saline
impurities    occur.
    In the strata over these rocks we meet with beds of coal
occupying distinct districts called coal-fields.          Mr. B. then
described the various kinds of stone-shale, and iron-stone,
that alternate with coal, and the appearances which offer
indications of its presence.      The position into which coal
strata are thrown by faults and dykes in different parts of
England were explained by drawings and sections.                    A
most singular elevation of a bed of coal in the vicinity of
the red rock in Lancashire was particularly noticed. Whete
this rock comes nearly in contact with the coal, the stratum
is raided up vertically, whilst seven other beds of coal in
the same field are all inclined at an angle of 25 degrees.
Mr. Bakewell stated, that he had communicated an account
of this coal-field to the Geological Society, as he conceived
that it might lead to some discoveries respecting the geo
logical relations of the red sand rock with the coal strata.
The obstacles which impede the working of coal-mines
                                                                from

                 London Philosophical      Society.            471
from the fire- and choak-damps were described. The nature
 and properties of these noxious vapours were illustrated by
experiments, and some account given of the different modes
of clearing the mines in different districts.
    Mr. Bakewell observed, that Dr. Miller and other writers
 on the coal districts of England had entirely overlooked
 the coal of the West Riding of Yorkshire, although the
 quantity procured there supplied a population nearly equal
 to that of London, besides the extensive manufactories of
 that county.    He described the manner in which the quan
tity of coal in the coal-fields of Northumberland       and Dur
ham had been estimated ; from whence it appeared that at
 the present rate of consumption they would be entirely ex
hausted in the space of three centuries.          Were there no
other repositories but these, he observed that it would be
 come the duty of a wise statesman to prevent exportation
to foreign countries, and to plant all our waste lands, and
 provide against impending though remote calamity.             Let
any person, said he, reflect on the condition of the metro
 polis were it deprived for three months of the supply of
 coal.   All the wood in the country would be destroyed,
our manufactories would be annihilated, and a scene of
national calamity would ensue, of which we can scarcely
form an idea.
    But besides extensive coal-fields in Yorkshire and other
 parts of England, at present scarcely touched, there exists
a great repository in South Wales of one thousand square
miles of coal, which, from the thickness of the different
strata, he calculated would supply the consumption of Bri
tain for several thousand years to come, estimating that
consumption at twelve million tons annually.            He con
cluded by giving a short outline of the coal districts in
different parts of the world, and the periods at which coals
appear to have been introduced for fuel.          It may excite a
smile, said he, at the ignorance of our ancestors, to find an
act of parliament in the reign of Elizabeth, prohibiting the
burning of coal in London during the sitting of parlia
ment ; but probably posterity at no distant period may
look with equal surprise at the general indifference evinced
by landed proprietors of the present day, respecting the
mineral substances on their own estates.

   Mr. Clarkson next proceeded to investigate the charac
ters of moral existence, observing, that pathognomy had
                                                          already

already proved its action, and anatomy the effects of it's
action, in the second division of the face.        All that was
necessary, therefore, was an ideal standard, by which to
judge of the moral or immoral propensities of the individual,
and this the Greeks had already erected.        Their statuaries
had two objects in view ; one of which was to eradicate all
violent passions from the faces of their deities, (and this
they effected by reducing and softening down the muscles
of the cheeks and nose,) and the second was to leave upon
 their faces the character of some quality for which they
were distinguished, (and this they effected bv strict phy
 siognomical rules.)      He then detailed the different phy
siognomical    expressions  of the ancient gods ;  the senti
mental laxity of Venus, the purity of Diana, the fortitude
 and taste of Minerva, the pride of Juno, the benevolence
 of Apollo, andthe conscious calm security of Hercules,  all
 of which he proved by drawings and busts of the antique
physiognomically exprest; nor could his conclusions, he
said, be denied without a ridiculous dilemma, that the head
of one deity would have answered as well for another. We
need look no further, then, for a standard for the nobler pro
 pensities of our nature. Nor were the characteristics of the
ignobler less apparent to investigation.     Drunkenness and
every species of intemperance distort and caricature the
face in proportion as they destroy the intellect and the
sentimental emotions  and here the Lecturer alluded to
the head of Nero at the Museum, asserting that it was im
 possible to contemplate that head without recognising in
it the intemperance, the gluttony, the pride, and impiety
of that sanguinary monster. Originally handsome, every
thing proclaimed the lapse of the man into the brute : the
elevated chin, the swollen throat, and depending cheeks,
the breathing nostrils, and staring eyes, spoke a language
not to be mistaken.
    Mr. C. next adverted to the contrast observable in the
faces of Cupid, or Venus and Minerva.         It was as evident
as the contrast between ambition and love, the master-
passions of human nature.        In the former, the cheeks are
rotund ; in the latter, concave;  in the former, the nostrils
are dilated, in the latter, rectilinear and compact;  the in
terval, therefore, affords a standard to judge of the mixture
of these passions in the individual. But the Greek head
of Pan, the lecturer observed, was a kind of silent phy
siognomical lecture.      No one will pretend to say that it
does not express passions in quiescence, and no one can
doubt the nature of the passions it conveys.  The diagonal
                                                        bearing

              London Philosophkcd    Society.               473
bearing of the eye, the brutal projection of the mouth, the
lapse of the eyebrows and nose, and the complete distor
tion of the latter characteristic, express a total debasement
and abandonment of the mind.          If, then, we assume the
face of Pan as the lowest state of sensual degadation        to
which man can fall, as the boundary which separates him
from brutes, and assume the unpolluted face of the Greek
ideal as the shade which mingles him with gods, we ohiain
another standard to judge of moral brutalization or refine
ment.
    We are sorry that our limits will not allow us to follow
the lecturer through a masterly analysis of the passions,
their physiognomical effects, and their modification by the
different temperaments of the body, whether phlegmatic,
sanguine, or melancholic.       We have stated enough in de-;
tailing his remarks on Greek statuary to render his object
lucid and practicable,  the erection of a standard for moral
 propensities as well as intellectual energies.
    Animal life and its territory was the last division of his
 subject.    Its indications, he said, were extremely simple,
 and easily explained.     All relaxation is accompanied by a
 separation of the jaws  total debility is accompanied by a
 total laxity of the under-jaw, the extreme of which is death.
 Firm strength is designated by a firm closure of the teeth,
 the last extreme of which is the elastic unnAtural animal
 power, which imparts its convulsive violence to madness,
 and which, as well as anger, classically called a short macU
 ness, is expressed by a vehement compression of the jaws
 or gnashing of the teeth.     A rectilinear chin, said Mr. C.
 like a rectilinear forehead, is the ideal standard. All great
 philosophers have possessed an angularity of chin.       Glut
 tons, and men who sacrifice intellect to sense, the contrary.
 The chins of the fair sex are always smaller and chaster in
 their form than those of men.        A chin that projects, un
 less beyond a certain point, displays animal strength; that
 which recedes, animal deficiency. The same rules, there
 fore, which apply to the forehead apply to the chin.       Nor
 is the mouth a less strong hieroglyphic than the eyebrow.
 Every one is aware of the distortion to which contempt
 and sensuality subject the mouth ; but there is a more ge
 neral and universally applicable axiom depending on this
 subject, for the forehead of brutes is not more dissimilar
 from that of man than their mouths.          The intermediate
 degrees between them are pregnant with the same deduc
 tions.   A scale, therefore, may be applied to all the gra
dations of character in the human face; and if a scale, the

47*          Earthquakes and Volcanic Phenomena
ground plot for the elevation of physiognomy as a portion
of the great scientific fabric is marked out and arranged.
    Mr. C. then descanted on the benefits which would re
sult from thus reducing physiognomy to something like.*
regular science ; for man, as he is at present constructed,
will and must form some physiognomical opinions ; and it
is surely much better that he should form them upon scien
tific principles, than on the vague suggestion* of fancy or
association.     But Mr. C. protested against an individual
assuming    the  right of judging his neighbour's character in
the present imperfect state of the study, or without long
initiation. When, however, certain pathognomical indi
cations coincide, a very accurate judgement may certainly
be formed by a student who has refined his perception of
character by experience as well as rule. These indications
may be discovered in the regular or irregular walk, in the
erection or depression of the head, in the shortness or
length of the neck, in the steadfast or wavering look of the
eye, when the individual isxngaged in conversation; in the
attitude or gestures, whether violent or relaxed, of the
 speaker; in the sound of the voice, whether base or treble;
 in the address, whether open, imposing, or retiring; and
lastly, in ihe first words uttered on acquaintance.       Sir. C.
concluded by an interesting argument on the physiogno
mical effects of education, and the drama, which afforded
us a degree of pleasure invariably our attendant when list
ening to his ingenious inquiries.

   EARTHQUAKES        AND VOLCANIC PHENOMENA IN THE
                           WEST INDIES.
In the    short space of time between the 26th of March and
 the 2d  of May last,    a succession of dreadful physical events
has demolished some of the finest cities in South America,
 and shaken several of the islands to their foundations,
wasting them with fire, and covering them with ashes and
dust. The General commanding the troops of Coro de
Domingo Campo Verde writes to the Governor of the pro
vince of Coro, that the city of Barquisimcto was on the
 26th of March buried in ruins by a most dreadful earth
quake.     And he communicates the following moral event,
which immediately succeeded.            The inhabitants of the
district, conceiving the phasnomenon to have been an im
mediate manifestation of divine displeasure for having re
                                                           belled

                        in the West Indies.                    475
belled    against their sovereign, returned to their allegiance.
 "  All the villages," says the General, " belonging to this
district and the city of Jouyo, with the greater part of the
villages belonging thereto, have come and offered sub
mission under the banners of Ferdinand VII." and sub
sequently adds, " By the panic and terror with which
the inhabitants are struck since the earthquake, 1 have no
doubt that the army of Coro will eventually conquer
the province of Venezuela."
    During this terrible commotion of the earth, which
appears to have broken out at intervals between                 the
 5i6th and 28th, the following cities were destroyed in the
province of Coro : Barquisimeto, totally destroyed ; Ari-
laqua, sunk ; Santa Rosa, also sunk ; Caudare and Phelipe,
destroyed ; ami St. Charles and Caramaoate greatly in
jured.     In the province of Caraccas, the same calamity has
 been equally tremendous.       The cities of Caraccas, Victoria,
Valencia, Porto Cavello, Laguira, New Barcelona, Mai-
quetia and Cumana have been almost entirely ruined.
    The same or similar subterranean causes, which have so
 severely desolated the continent, about the end of April
 manifested their influence among the West Indian islands :
 and the following letters furnish several interesting and af
 fecting circumstances.
          Extract of a Letter from Barladoes, May 2.
     * As far as I can relate, I will give you a true account of
 a most awful event, as witnessed and experienced by myself.
     "  I was lying in bed about six o'clock in the morning,
 when T observed my chamber more dark than usual. Some
.time after I arose and opened one of my windows, when            I
 observed to the north a dark thick cloud, similar to the
 usual indication of a great deal of rain (which would have
 been very acceptable) ; but at the same time        I perceived a
 most remarkable bright cloud to the southward ; so much
 so, as to reflect light on the houses.     We had had what we
 conceived to be several rolling claps of thunder during the
 night, and the last was a quarter past seven, when an in
 stantaneous total darkness ensued, and from that time till
 one o'clock I never saw so dreadful a phenomenon.                 I
 never beheld so dark a night in the gloomy month of No
 vember : in short, every thing appeared like chaos, and the
 lamps, handed about the streets in hundreds, were scarcely
 sufficient to give light to the persons who held them,
 much less to any one else.          To paint the horror of the
 scene i3 utterly impossible.     During the time of the dark
 ness we were assailed by immense falls of calcareous matter
  (as I think) to such a degree that it was dangerous to go
                                HhS                             out

476           Earthquakes and Volcanic Phcenomena
out of the house : indeed it was impracticable to do so
without a hood or umbrella; and these were only tempo
rary screens, for by the time you had proceeded one yard
you were completely covered by this stuff.
   " At ten o'clock the rev. Mr. Garnett had the church
bells rung, and gave prayers: but such a scene of horror,
dismay, terror, and consternation, cannot be imagined by
one who did not see it. Thousands of people of all descrip
tions flocking to church, without rank or distinction, mis
tress and servant kneeling and praying by the side of each
other, all fearing some dreadful catastrophe would hurry
them out of the world before they could make their peace,
and firmly believing they should never see the light again.
I must confess to you I gave myself up, for the lava was
gathering very fast on us, and no prospect but of starving
or perishing under it. At first what fell was a large black
substance, very coarse, but it gradually became as fine as
Scotch snuff, and in a few hours the streets and the tops
of the houses were many inches thick in this matter.
     "About half past one o'clock a small glimmering of
light began to appear, and by half past two o'clock we could
make out people in the streets.      It then gradually got lighter,
so that we could see volumes of this matter floating in the
air, but so thick as still to obscure the sun, nor have we
yet seen the sun clearly.       About half past six last night we
saw like rays of fire in the southern quarter again. From
all these circumstances I am led to think there must have
been an explosion of some volcano very near us.              To-day
we have been busy in endeavouring to remove the lava, but
I much fear, without we have a heavy fall of water to assist
us, we shall be very long about         it,  and God only knows
how      will end. The whole island
         it                               is  in one complete sheet
of lava; the canes are all weighed down with it, and the
poor cattle and horses must die for want        if  we are not im
mediately   relieved.   We     cannot  see  twenty   yards before us
for the immense volumes of this stuff continually falling
from off the tops of the houses     ;   for so soon as  it    dry,
                                                             is        it
is exactly like flour. I   am inclined to think now, the thun
 der Ithought     heard
                  I      in  the night was the explosion of some
volcano.      I herewith have sent you some of this dust,
 which hope you will receive safe."
         I
    To this we subjoin the account that has reached us from
St. Vincent's, where     a  volcano which had long been quies
 cent has broken out with extraordinary violence.
    Extract   of  aLetter from St. Vincent, May 6.  " Having
 been informed that you had not sailed from Grenada               by
                                                                   the
 April fleet, hasten to give you some account of
              I                                               a most
 alarming circumstance which took place here last night

                           in the West Indies.                         477
and this morning.  About sun-set, on Thursday evening, we
observed an immense quantity of fire and smoke to proceed
from the volcano, and continued till one o'clock this morn
ing, when a most tremendous explosion took place, and
continued till four, throwing up immense quantities of
stones and ashes all over the island.  On the estates in the
vicinity of the mountains the ashes are said to be from two
to three feet deep ; that two of the principal rivers have
been dried up, and new ones formed ; and that many of the
estates in that quarter have been much injured.   One white
person and six negroes have been killed.    Although Kings
ton is at the distance of about twelve miles from the
volcano, the inhabitants were so much alarmed, that many
of them went on board of the vessels in the bay for pro
tection, and it was not until past 8 o'clock that one person
could distinguish another, in consequence of the atmo
sphere being darkened     by the quantity of ashes.     I ana
much afraid that the extent of the damage sustained is not
yet    known."
A     second Communication from Mr.             William Moore,           on
        the Use of Oxymuriate of Magnesia             in Bleaching.
                        To Mr. Tilloch.
    Sir,  Since   my former communication to you, I have
 received a letter from my brother (Mr. J. W. Moore, of
 Dublin), inclosing a copy of a letter he received from Mr.
 John Duppy junior, relative to the use of oxymuriate of
 magnesia by that enlightened gentleman in his manufactory
  near Dublin.
    I will thank you to add it        (if
                                   possible) as an appendix to
 my former paper on this subject*:             as follows:
                                                 it   is                "I
 have used the oxymuriate of magnesia on the large scale,
 ever since December 1810, and since then have been daily
 extending the application of it. To the communication
I   made Mr. Davy on this subject,      do not feel
                                            I         could add
                                                             I
 any thing^ further, unless in generally stating my since ex
 perience, as confirming its superiority over the oxymuriate
 of lime for whitening the grounds of delicate dyes, such as
  yellows, madder reds, &c."
    The inaccuracy of Dr. Ogilby's statements are still
.further confirmed        this second letter of Mr. Duppy's;
                            by
  and although   Idid not entertain    doubt as to their fate in
                                            a
 ihe scientific world yet they might deter the manufacturer,
 from adopting these improvements.        Under theset impres
 sions have been induced to trespass on your indulgence.

         I remain with respect, Your much obliged,

478              Meteorological   Observations
    Copper and Manganese.  In the hill about a mile north of
Stapleford, in Nottinghamshire,     consisting of Gravel Rock,
very similar to that of w hich Alderley-Edge     NW of Mac
clesfield in Cheshire is composed, but not resting on and
surrounded by Red Marl as that Hill does, but on and by
Coal-measures, a vein of Ore of Manganese, Iron, and
Copper, with much Mica, was lately discovered, on the
Estate of Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren, Bart., who has
caused some of the Ore to be smelted and the copper re
fined, which proves to be of the very best quality.          Sir
John had a Coal-seam seven feet thick lately in work, about
300 yards S of this mine, and has proved the same Coal-
measures at about 4 or 500 yards N, while Lord Middle-
ton's large Collieries in Trowel are not more than 800
yards distant, in the same direction.
Meteorological Observations made at Clapton in Hackney,
              from May 21, to June 20, 1812.
    May 21.  W.S.W. Cloudy morning; afterwards rain,
and long showers ; fair, but damp evening : various clouds
in the lucid intervals.
    May 22.  N. Cloudy in the morning.        Fine afternoon,
but very cold with said, and irregular masses of cumulus
and cumulostratus.
    May £3.  N. Features of various modifications in dif
ferent heights.    Fair day.
    May 24.  Clouded day ; in some places a wavy, in others
a mottled appearance of the sky : a little rain fell during the
day.
    May 25. W.S.W. Small rain kept falling almost the
 whole of the day, but held up in the evening, which be
came fair.
    May 26.  Fine warm morning; cirrus, cirrocumulus and
 cirrostratus in different altitudes, approaching to cumulo
stratus here and there ; and a sort of partial haze of a
brownish colour floated gentle along in the south-west.
Wind very calm.
    May 27.  S. Fine warm day; cirrus, cirrocumulus,
cirrostratus and cumuli irregularly disposed.
    May 28.  S. Clouds in two strata, followed by a fine
 warm rain in the evening.      The sun appeared just as it was
setting, over a cirrostratus in the horizon ; it appeared
 deep golden red, and threw a fine crimson blush on a cir-
rostratus thinly diffused in a higher atmosphere.
    May 29.  S. All the modifications of cloud appeared
                                                             in

                         made at Clapton.                       479
in different stations, and fine petroid cumuli in particular
prevailed : slight showers in the course of the day : thunder
showers at night.
                             some lofty cirrus cloud and scud
below sometimes appeared, but in general the clouds were
of one character, particularly in the afternoon, being com
pact, but rather rocky cumuli.
   May 31.  Clouds in two strata, followed by nimbifica-
tion ; generally cloudiness by night with rising wind.
   June l . S.W. Rainy morning, but the rain was ge
nerally small. Evening irregular features of different clouds,
and sun at intervals.      Fine clear night.
   June 2.  W.S.W. Clear very early, then the sky be
came obscure; cumuli rose and general            cloudiness pre
vailed: the day, however, became fair with various clouds.
   June 3.  S.W. Clouded morning, followed by some
rain; fair afternoon ; the higher masses of cloud in dif
ferent strata put on the character of cirrocumulus ; indeed
among others that kind of large and clear feature of this
cloud appeared which I have remarked to attend warm and
healthy weather : cirrostratus, cumulostratus, &c. appeared.
Night very clear.
   June 4. S.W. Fine warm day, with diurnal cumuli,
and some features of the other modifications;           the clouds
increased in the evening, but the night was fair.
                                                     the day ap-
peared   cumuli; evening cirri     appeared  aloft scattered irre
gularly.
   June   6.  Fine day, with cumuli; in the evening fine
clear sky and beautiful yellow sunset, with lofty cirri scat
tered about, which became tinged with crimson.
   June 7. S.E. Clouds       early ; fine clear dry day, with
only  a  few little irregular cumuli here and there.
   June 8. N. Cloudy in the morning ; sun out by times
in the day. Cloudy night again, and cooler than hitherto.
   June Q.  N.W. wind prevailed ; the morning was cloudy,
the day became warm and fair, with masses of cumulus and
some streaks of cirrus ; in the evening nimbi, but no rain
fell hereabouts.
   June 10.  N  E  SW. Sun and clouds in the morning;
cloudy evening, and rather warmer again towards night.
   June 1 1 .  Fair aay ; some features of loose cirrocumulus
early; cirri scattered above, floating cumuli below prevailed
all day; the cirri in the evening became denser and co
loured by the setting sun, and were accompanied by some
cirrostrali.
                                                              June

460        Meteorological       Observations made at Clapton.
    June    12.  Clouded morning ; cumuli, 8cc. per day; fine
evening ; feature of cirrostratus.
    June 13. W.S.W. Fine morning very early; about
four o'clock I observed features of cirrocumulus, cirrus,
Sec. by about eight a mist, which had been coming on
slowly,     became thick, and the sky clouded ; the afternoon
was fair with much cloud.             The evening clear, except some
cirri and cirrostrati.
    June    14.   SW W. Very early the cirrus appeared
breaking       out  into various and beautiful cirrocumuli, and
lower some cirrostratus seemed scattered along ; the wind
was quite calm, and the day became hot; cumuli sailed un
der the above clouds ; cumulostratus formed, but subsided ;
the evening was clear, except cirri fibrous and ramifying
about in many directions and coloured by the setting sun *.
    June 15»  W.S.W. Fair day, with irregular features of
several modifications in different altitudes ; the quantum of
cloud increased in the afternoon, and wind rose.
    June 16.  S.W. Before light a hard shower, cumulo
stratus prevailed; fair afternoon with rows of plumose
cirri, &c.
    June 17.     S.W  S. Very early cirrus confused and
plumose with diverse kinds of loose cumuli ; then cumulo
stratus and hard showers, which prevailed all day ; fair
evening.
    June 18.  W  S.W. Fair morning, clouds in different
altitudes; rainy evening and night, with pretty strong w ind.
    June 19.  S.W. Wind and rain, which continued all
night; also remained this morning: the day however be
came fair with cirrus and cirrocumulus aloft, and cumuli
under nimbification commenced again in the evening with
wind.
    June 20.  S.W. Showery, and rather windy all day.
Fine evening ; confused cirrus, cumulostratus, &c. as usual,
between two nimbi.
   Clapton,   June 21,  1812.                        THOMAS FoRSTER.
    While the obliquely descending and angular fibres of the cirrus ap
peared to be equalizing the electricity of the surrounding air, they were
also carried gently forward by the wind : this shows that wind may pass
through a mass of atmosphere without destroying the inequality of its elec
tricity, which is slowly effected by the agency of its proper conductor, the
cirrus.

I.   Experiments which prove Plalina, when combined unth
    Gold and Silver, to be soluble in Nitric Acid.     By Mr.
    Pekcival Johnson.
                        To  Mr. Tilloch.
Sir, During        the practice of a profession where much
depends     on depriving gold of its alloys, having heard it
suggested that platina might be used as an advantageous
one, under the idea of its being but slightly affected by
the nitric acid, I determined on a closer inspection of its
action on that metal than had hitherto been described.
The insertion of the following remarks on my experiments
will oblige me.
    I find, although platina when in a pure state is not acted
upon by the nitric acid, that when alloyed with gold and
silver it is perfectly soluble, and with silver alone partially .
80.
   From l to 15 per cent, of platina to the gold was entirely
dissolved, leaving the gold a good colour and perfectly pure,
having previously mixed the gold with three times its
weight of silver for quartation.
    Twenty per cent, last -rVhs, leaving the cornet flaked
and black inside; 30 per cent, lost ^ths with the same ap
pearances.
   The buttons have an indented crystalline and red appear
ance after cupellation, more so in proportion to the quantity
of platina, and in the two latter proportions are rounded at
the edges.
    By mixing double the quantity of silver the gold was
freed   of upwards of   20 per cent, of platina,   and more ac-

gold seems to be a necessary component for the perfect so
lution ; for by mixing the following proportions of silver'
and platina, the results were thus :
    Platina and silver equal to 1 per cent, of the former left
in dilute acid a light powder partly subsiding.                    5 per cent,
gave    the   acid   a  straw     colour,    half  the    platina    employed
being dissolved.           10 per cent, a very bright straw colour,
having dissolved the same proportion.
    15 per cent, a bri*ght light brown, having dissolved 4-ths
of the platina. 25 per cent, a deep brown, dissolving -J-ds
of the platina.
    The two latter proportions required concentrated acid
 after the action of the dilute.

    It may    also be worthy the notice of your readers, that we
 find palladium to be such a general alloy of Brazil gold as
 often to alter the colour thereof. We have particularly ob
 served it in the Brazil coin, many of which were rejected
 at first sight, suspecting them to be counterfeits. We found
 it a short time since in a Brazil bar to the amount of nearly
 20 per cent, altering the colour thereof to nearly that of
 the metal palladium.

 IVIy    brother, Sir Humphry Davy, appears to me to have
 demonstrated, in his last Bakenan Lecture, the existence
 qf a class of bodies similar to metallic oxides, and consist
 ing of metals in union with chlorine or oxymuriatic acid.
     These combinations are the principal subject of the fol
 lowing pages.          I shall do myself the honour of giving an
 account of the experiments E Have made to ascertain the
 proportions of their constituent parts, and likewise of de
 scribing some that have not yet been noticed.
     I shall have to relate also the attempts I have made to
  ascertain the proportions of sulphur in several sulphurets,
  and the experiments I have performed to estimate the quan-

       Combinations   of different Metals and Chlorine, &c.      5
thy of oxygen in some metallic oxides. The general ana
logy of definite proportions led me to both these under
takings.      This analogy, it will be perceived, I have con
stantly kept in view, and have had recourse to, both for
detecting inaccuracies in my own experiments, and in
considering the results of the experiments of others.
     As the nomenclature connected with the old hypothesis,
respecting oxymuriatic acid, is inconsistent with the new
views of this substance, I shall venture to call the com
pounds of the metals and chlorine to be treated of, by the
names which my brother has proposed for them.
       1.  On the Combinations   of Chlorine and Copper, &c.
     There are two distinct combinations of chlorine and cop
per, both of which may be directly made by the combustion
of this metal in chlorine gas. When the gas was admitted
i mo      an exhausted   retort containing copper filings,    the
 filings became ignited, a fixed fusible substance quickly
 formed, and the interior of the retort soon became lined
 with a fine yellowish brown sublimate.          The former sub
 stance evidently contains least chlorine ; for when it was
 heated alone in chlorine gas, it absorbed an additional por
 tion, and was converted into the latter. Hence the fixed
 compound may, in conformity with the principles of Sir
 Humphry Davy's nomenclature, be called cuprane, and the
 yellow sublimate, cupranea.
     Cuprane may be procured in several other ways.             It
 may be obtained       by heating together copper filings and
 corrosive sublimate; and it was thus first discovered by
 Boyle, who called it resin of copper, from its similitude to
 common resin. Two parts of corrosive sublimate, and one
 part of copper filings, I have found the best proportions of
 the materials.
      Ft may be obtained by boiling copper filings in muriatic
  acid, or by exposing slips of copper partially immersed in
  this acid to the atmosphere.      In ilie last instance, I have
 found the changes connected whh the formation of cuprane
 rather complicated ; the copper* exposed receives oxygen
  from the atmosphere, and acid from the ascending muriatic
  acid fume?, and is thus converted into a green insoluble
  salt ; and this absorbing more muriatic acid, slowly passes
  into the deliquescent muriat, which flowing into the mu
  riatic acid is changed by the action of the immersed cop
  per into cuprane.
      M. P roust, the first modern chemist who examined cu
  prane, and who is commonly considered as the first dis
                                   A 3                     coverer

6       An Account of some "Experiments on the
coverer of this compound, found it produced by the action
of muriat of tin on muriat of copper; he named it white
muriat of copper, and ascertained that a similar substam e
results from the decomposition of the common deliques
cent muriat by heat.
   Cuprane, bv whatever means prepared, possesses the
same properties.     It is fusible at a heat just below that of
redness, and in a close vessel, or a vessel with a very small
orifice, it is not decomposed or sublimed by a strong red
heat; but if air, on the contrary, is freely admitted, it is
dissipated in dense white fume3.        It is insoluble in water.
It effervesces in nitric acid. It silently dissolves in
muriatic acid, from which it may be separated by the addi
tion of water, which precipitates it unaltered ; and it is de
composed by a solution of potash ; or by heating it with
the fused hydrated alkali ; when it affords the orange oxide
of copper. Its colour, transparency, and texture appear
alone to vary. It is generally op;\ke, of a dark-brown co
lour, and of a confused hackly texture; but I have ob
tained it by cooling it slowly after it has been slronsrly
heated, of a light yellow colot r, semi-transparent, and cry
stallized, apparently in small plates.
   Cupranea is only very slowly formed by heating cuprane
in chlorine gas. The best mode that I have found, of
procuring     it,   is   by
                      slowly evaporating to dryness, at      tem  a
perature not much above 400" of Fahrenheit, the delique
scent muriat or copper.       Thus made,        has the same ap
                                                    it
pearance, and the same properties, as when directly formed.
It   isof a yellow colour, and pulverulent.       Exposed to the
atmosphere,     it converted,
                     is             the action and absorption
                                          by
of water, into the deliquescent muriat, and its colour,
during this      eration, changes from yellow first to white,
                al
and lastly to green.           It
                                decomposed
                                    is            heat   by
                                                         and even
                                                              ;
in chlorine gas when the experiment            made on

                                               is
the gaseous state, and cuprane remains.
    I have employed the same methods for ascertaining the
proportions of the constituent parts of both these com
binations.    I have separated the copper                by
                                                   iron, and the
chlorine  by  means of nitrat of silver.
   A solution of 80 grains of cuprane                    in
                                                   nitro-muriatic
acid, precipitated by iron, afforded       1*8 grains of copper,

   A solution of the same quantity of cuprane in nitric
acid, precipitated        by
                        nitrat of silver, afforded 117-5 grains
of horn silver dried, till        ceased to suffer any loss of
                                     it
                                                                      weight

SO grains of cuprane appear to contain 5 1-2 grains of cop

  A   solution of 40 grains of cupranea in water, acidulated
with muriatic acid, precipitated by iron afforded 18'8 grains
of copper.
   And a solution of 20 grains of cupranea in water, preci
pitated by nitrat of silver, afforded 43 grain3 of horn silver.
   Hence 100 of cupranea, omitting the very slight loss,
appear to consist of                                 1

  The deliquescent muriat     and the native muriat of copper
of Peru,    belong to a class of compounds apparently
distinct from the preceding combinations of copper and
chlorine.
   The deliquescent salt is well understood ; and its com
position may be inferred, independent of its water, from
that of cupranea.
   The native muriat is less known, I shall therefore relate
the experiments I have made on this interesting mineral.
   The specimen I have examined is part of a very fine one,
presented to Sir Humphry Davy by William Jacob, Esq.
M.P. and deposited in the Museum of the Royal Institution.
It consists of muriat and carbonat of copper, of red oxide
of iron, and of green coloured quartz.          The muriat if
partly crystallized j the crystals, from the trials 1 have made
of them, appeared to be pure, and they were, on that ac
count, made the subject of my experiments.
    The crystallized muriat dissolves entirely and without
effervescence, in all the acids in which I have tried       and      it,
 the deliquescent muriat      of copper      in each instance
                                                   is
 formed, and    a combination of brown oxide of copper with,
the acid employed.
   * This! have ascertained   by synthesis; 12 grains of pure silver dissolved
in nitric acid, and precipitated with muriat of ammonia, yielded 15-9 grains
of fused horn silver.   I    do not give the particulars of the experiment,
which was very carefully made     ; because the result very nearly agrees with
that of Klaproth, and of other chemists.
                                      A  4                           Heated

8               An Account of some Experiments   on the
    Heated slowly in a bent luted glass tube, connected with
mercury, the native muriat affords water and oxvgen gas,
and the residue is an agglutinated brownish mass, which
 dissolves in muriatic actd and gives a greenish precipitate
 with potash, and is apparently a mixture of brown oxide of
copper and cuprane. When the heat is raised rapidly, to
redness, the water expelled is impregnated with muriatic
 acid and muriat of copper.      I have obtained from 25 grains
of the mineral heated to redness t^l eas ceased to be pro
duced, just two cubic inches of oxygen.           This expulsion of
oxygen seems to be owing to the action of chlorine on the
 brown oxide to form cuprane ; and there is, I have ascer
tained, a similar production of oxygen when heat is applied
 to a mixture of the deliquescent muriat and brown oxide
of copper.
    From these results, which perfectly agree .with those ob
tained by eminent chemists on the continent, who have ex
amined different specimens of this mineral, it appears to be
a submuriat of copper, differing in a chemical point of
view from the deliquescent salt, merely in containing a
smaller proportion of acid.
    The following experiments were made w ith the design of
ascertaining the proportions of its constituent parts.
    Fifty grains of the crystals in powder, boiled in a solution
of 50 grains of potash, afforded 36'5 grains of brown oxide
of copper heated to dull redness.
    And 20 grains dissolved in nitric acid, and precipitated
by means of nitrat of silver, afforded l2-9 grains of dry
horn silver.
    Hence, considering the deficiency of weight, as indicat
ing the quantity of combined water, 100 of the native sub
muriat of copper seem to consist of
            73*0 brown oxide           ri5"8025 chlorine
            16*2   muriatic acid  =   <
            10*8 water                 (_    *47    hydrogen.
    This analysis, allowance being made for difference of
theory, nearly agrees with thai of Klaproth.
    M. Proust, I believe, first discovered an artificial com
pound similar to the native sub-muriat of copper.           He ob
tained      in
          it,   the preparation  of  the   nitro-muriat  of copper,
and aWo         bypartial abstraction of the acid of the deli
                     a
quescent muriat,          means of an alkali.
                         by                      I      have fount
that it   may     be   procured   in    several  other   ways.   1
may be made directly         adding the hydrated blue oxide o
                              by
copper to      solution of muriat of copper; and
                a                                     it    may b
very readily and cecononiically prepared,        by     exposingt

     Combinations       of different Metals and Chlorine, &c. 9
the   atmosphere slips of copper partially immersed in mu
riatic acid ; and it is also produced by the exposure of
cuprane to the atmosphere,             [ts production in the last in
stance is accompanied with that of the deliquescent muriat;
and the formation of both seems to be owing ro the ab
sorption of water and oxygen ; for cuprane, I have found,
though apparently not in the least acted on by dry oxygen
gas, is quickly changed when moistened with water and
confined in a jar of this gas, and there is a rapid absorption
of oxygen*.
    I have not examined all the specimens obtained bv these
different methods minutely, though sufficiently, I conceive,
to ascertain their identity, and their similarity to the native
compound.         The colour of all of them is greenish while,
like that of the native, in a finely divided stale.               When
heated, they all afford water, oxygen gas, and a mixture
of cuprane and brown oxide of copper.
    I have analysed only the submuriat, precipitated from a
 solution of muriat of copper by a weak solution of potash.
    Fifty grains of this, well washed and dried, boiled in a
 solution of potash, afforded 36-3 grains of dried brown
oxide of copper.
    And 20 grains dissolved in nitric acid, and precipitated
by nitrat of silver, afforded 12*75 grains of dried horn sil
 ver. These results differ so little from those obtained with
 the native, as fairly to permit the conclusion, that the com
 position of the artificial and native submuriat of copper is
 the same.

       2.  On the Combinations of Tin and Chlorine,             &c.
    Tin, like copper,       is capable   of combining with two dif
ferent    proportions of chlorine.           The liquor of Libavius,
 one of the combinations, is directly formed by the com
 bustion of the metal in chlorine gasr^ and the other, I find,
 may be produced by heating together an amalgam of tin
 and calomel.         Thus obtained, it is similar to that which
 may be procured by evaporating to dryness the muriat
 containing the gray oxide of tin, and fining the residue in
 a close vessel.       Both are of a gray colour, and of a resinous
 lustre and fracture, and both inflame, like tin itself, when
 heated in chlorine gas, and are converted into the liquor
 of Libavius by the absorption of a fresh portion of chlorine.
    * I have been iu formed that submuriat of copper is sometimes found in
 tbc neighbourhood of volcanoes, particularly in that of Vesuvius.     By
 means of the above facts, it is evident that its production might be ac
 counted for in such situations.
                                                                  Hence,

portion of chlorine, it may be called stannanea, and the

    Stannane is fusible at a heat below that of dull redness ;
it bears this temperaiure, if air be nearly excluded, without
undergoing any change; but when subjected to a heat as
¦strong 3s glass will bear wiihout being fused, it appears to
be, from the slight fume produced, partially decomposed.
    It affords the liquor of Libavius when heated with cor
rosive sublimate, nitre, red oxide of mercury, or with the
hvperoxvmuriat of potash.          In the three last instances,
oxide of tin is also formed; and with the hyperoxvmuriat
the action is so violent that inflammation is actually pro
duced.
    The liquor of Libavius and aurum musivum are formed
when stannane is heated with sulphur.
    Stannane, by the. action of water, appears to be converted
into the insoluble submuriat of tin, and the acidulous
muriat.
    The stannanea or liquor of Libavius, that I have exa
mined, was made by heating together an amalgam of tin
and corrosive sublimate, in the proportions commonly re
 commended.       1 have obtained this compound in another
way, by treating the concentrated solution of the peroxide
of tin in muriatic acid, with strong sulphuric acid ; a gentle
heat applied to this mixture, contained in a retort, expels
the fuming liquor, which may be condensed, as usual, in
a cold receiver.
    The only new and remarkable property which I have
observed the liquor of Libavius to possess, is its action on
oil of turpentine.      I was led to make trial of it from' an
idea of Sir Humphry Davy, that the combinations of the
metals and chlorine might be soluble in oils.        In the 6rst
experiment,    when   I   poured the fuming liquor  into the oil,
inflammation immediately look place, with violent ebulli
tion and production of dense reddish fumes.        I have used
other specimens of oil of turpentine, expecting a similar
inflammation, but without its occurrence, though there has
been in every instance a considerable action.      The mixture
 of the two being made in a retort connected with mercury,
 no gas was generated, oxide of tin appeared to be formed,
and a viscid oil was produced, which, like the fat oils, left
a permanent stain on paper, and had little smell or taste,
and which, digested         with alcohol, imparted something
which occasioned a permanent cloudiness on the admixture
of water, and an odour to me not unlike that of artificial
                                                       camphor.

apparently     mere mechanical mixture, entirely dissolved
                a

this solution decanted from the residual mercury, quickly
precipitated the tin        very beautiful plumose form
                                in   a                            and       :

   As therefore 675 grains of stannane contain 42 grains
of tin, 100 appear to consist of

   * A little muriatic acid was added before the zinc was introduced, to dis

papeared to be owing to the decomposition of water, chiefly in consequence
of the Galvanic effect of the contact of the two different metals, zinc and
tin.

the oxide      of silver is partially reduced by the solution of
  stannane ; and an oxide of tin is thrown down in mixture
  with the horn silver from the liquor of Libavius.
     M. Proust, to whom we are indebted for very excellent
 investigations of the different combinations of copper and
 tin, first discovered a submuriat of tin.        He found that a
  solution of potash precipitated from the solution of muriat
 of tin this compound, and not the pure gray oxide of tin.
     T have obtained it by his method, and all its properties
  which I have observed are perfectly' agreeable to its sup
 posed composition.
     It is decomposed by a red heat. Subjected to distillation
 in a small bent glass tube connected with mercury, no gas
 was produced, water containing muriatic acid and muriat
 of tin was expelled, and a sublimate like stannane was
 formed, and the fixed residue was gray oxide of tin.
     It effervesces violently with nitric acid; and strong sul
 phuric acid exptls from it muriatic acid fumes.
    It dissolves without effervescence in the muriatic and
 acetic and in the dilute, nitric, and sulphuric acids ; and
 all these acid solutions, as they give a black precipitate
 with a solution of corrosive sublimate, appear to contain
 the tin in the slate of gray oxide.
    The complete analysis of this submuriat of tin is diffi
 cult.    The oxide it contains cannot be-accurately separated
by potash, nor can nitrat of silver be employed to ascertain
the proportion of muriatic acid.
    I have found 50 grains of
                                     is by it,
                                      dissolved in muriatic acid,
to afford, when precipitated          zinc, 31 grains of metallic
tin. Now as this submuriat           similar to the submuriat of
copper, the analogy being imperfect onlv                   in
                                                   the latter con
taining the peroxide, and the former the protoxide,                is it
                                                                           is
natural to infer that the proportion of muriatic acid                  si
milar in    both.    But be proportion of muriatic acid in the
                      i
submuriat of copper    is   apparently half of that which exists
in the muriat :     hence, supposing the composition of the
submuriat of tin to be similar, 100 of        will consist of
                                                      it

                        To  Mr.   Ttlloch.
Sir,   In   the present uncertainty which is extended over
geological science, and the great diversity of opinion which
prevails even with regard to its first principles, it is not to
circumstances of local particularity that our attention
should be directed so much as to facts universal in extent,
and which point towards a knowledge, however imperfect,
of the internal construction of our globe. It has indeed
been well remarked, that the inclination of its superficial
strata enables us to extend our views far beneath the limits of
human labour ; yet, even taking this into the account, we
cannot but confess our inability to pierce beyond the sur
face.    Mathematicians have determined 12 miles for the
mean depth of the ocean ; while the continents, so far as
our knowledge extends, appear to consist of substances of
from 2 to 2^ times the density of water, and to rest on
granitic masses whose density does not exceed this limit.
The superficial density "of our globe may therefore be staled
at about   li.  Yet the mean density is known to amount
to nearly five times that of water.        The great mass there
fore which composes the nucleus of the earth must have
about this density. With this fact appears intimately con
nected a question of great importance on the formation of
mineral veins, whence is derived the matter which occupies
them ? A Neptunist will say, From above, by infiltration;
while those who maintain the Plutonic system answer,
From below, by injection, when fused. The arguments on
both sides have been handled with great ability ; but the
density of many of these extraneous masses affords one
which, though hitherto unnoticed, appears to me at once
to decide their origin.    If it be from above, how happens
it that the source above, from whence it introduced itself,
has never in one single instance been discovered ? Per
haps the supply is already expended; perhaps it has already
been carried down, with the rest of the debris of the soil, to
the ocean.     Still, however, its existence is hypothetical.
On the other hand, the Huttonian explanation is subject to
no such embarrassing queries.           The density of metallic
veins, deviating in so remarkable a manner from every sur
rounding phenomenon, directs us immediately to look for
their source in the great reservoir which we know to con
tain all the more solid parts of our planet.       It is evidently
                                                               no

   14        New Method of making Bricks                 so as to form
  no answer to this argument to state that many veins, which
  traverse the strata, contain no metallic substances.                         As
  long    as   one   instance     can    be  found    where    this is the  case,
  its force remains unbroken.                   

      P. S.  We mav likewise remark, from the consideration
  of the    great density of the earth, that the opinion of many
  philosophers,         that granite forms its solid nucleus, must be
  unfounded.
  IV. New        Method of making Bricks, so as to form cheaper
      and firmer Buildings, and useful underground Drains.
      By John Stephens, Esq. of Reading*.
  Sir,    I   have sent, for the inspection of the Society of Arts,
  &c. three closure bricks, which on examination you will find
  to have been cut three-fourths of the way through in the
  middle by a wire, and the whole of the way through at each
  end, which leaves the ends square and handsome for work.
      The bricklayer to divide each brick in length has only to
 take the brick in his left hand with the mark or cut down
 wards longitudinally,             and by one smart blow with the
 trowel he will have two complete king closures, with which
 he can easily make four common closures.
      I have shown them to many workmen, who all approve
 of them. I had two hundred and fifty of them made by a
 brick maker for an experiment, and I have ordered two
 thousand more. The builders who do the principal part
 of my work have had some on their own account, and have
 since increased their orders.                 I have no doubt when they
 are better known they will come into general use.
      A considerable saving in labour and waste of bricks may
 be effected by their use, particularly in walls where piers
 are built, and where there are "many openings; the work will
 also be rendered more substantial.
     There will be a saving in room and materials where the
 back of a chimney is built against a straight wall, particu
 larly in flues for low buildings.

   They will be found useful in cities or large towns by be

be a check to the ravages of fire.
   They will be useful in preventing the passage of rats and
mice, and the disagreeable smell occasioned when they die
betwixt lath and plaster or wainscot.
    They will also answer for draining land, and will form
cheaper small drains from houses than any other method.
    They may be cut in other forms or directions for parti
cular purposes according to the uses for which they are in
tended.
    The additional expense of dividing them by the wire is
about two shillings per thousand ; it is generally done after
they have been mouldtd one or two days, according to the
dryness of the season.
    I natter myself that, if this communication meets with
the approbation of the Society, it will render a benefit to
the public.                                    .

    Dear Sir,  On inquiry from builders, I am informed,
that the saving by the use of the bricks I have invented, will
be from two-and-half to nearly five per cent, in a five-
window house in brick work and labour, in a front of forty
feet with or without piers.
    In ornamental brick piers for gateways, I think the sav
ing of bricks by means of cutting may be very considerable,
and in the labour still more, besides the work being done
more sound and substantial.
    I am using a few of them in an eleven-inch brick-wall,
(a system hitherto entirely new,) in a westernly aspect, as
a preventative or guard against the effects of weather, and
it will, in point of dryness, be equal to a fourteen-inch wall.
I have inclosed a letter from Benjamin Garroway, a brick
layer, who has requested me to let him have all the bricks
I have of this kind, and to bespeak more for him. I have
also sent a certificate from Mr. Robert Wright, who is ex
tensively engaged in buildings.
   The drains for agricultural purposes might be done by
women or children, except the digging of the drains, espe
cially two-inch drains.        With respect to longer drains, if
they are required of four inches, and to be covered with

in order to promote strength in covering.
    It would be of great importance if parliament would al
low a drawback of the duty on all bricks employed in
draining.
    Every brick intended for the operation I recommend, is
taken off the stack two or three days after it is moulded. It
is then put on a stookpr board, and a wire about the size of
Nft. 23 is pressed on the upper side of the brick, so as to
pass through each end of it ; it is then immediately placed
on the stack again, and afterwards burned.

Description of the Drawings of Mr. Stephens's Method of
  cutting Bricks for various Purposes.         See Plate I. fig. 2.
   Fig. 2. of Plate I. is a plan of the upper surface of a
common brick ; the line a a is a cleft cut nearly through
the brick while it is soft by means of a piece of wire, as is
shown in the section fig. 3, where the section of brick is
shown at BB, placed on the wooden block A ; a piece of
wire bji with a loop at each end is pressed down into              it,

as to divide   it into two parts, except the part C, which the
wire will not cnt through because of the curvature                ac
                                                                  it
quires in being pressed into the brick. A brick of this
kind being burnt, may be broken in two halves           by one cleft
with the trowel, which will be found very useful             in
                                                              many
cases which constantly occur in brickwork, and will be far
superior to the present mode of hacking the' bricks, both
for the soundness and appearance of the work, and will be
done      less time.
         in
    Figs. 4. and 5. show the application of these divided
bricks to draining, where AB are the ends of the two halves
of brick, and CD tiles, forming the top and bottom of the
     a
drain: this method forms          square drain.
                                    a
    Fig. 5. shows how triangular drain may be made with
                            a

on Musical Composition, of which the last thirteen pages
 (from p. 124 to the end) treat on
                                                    " the derivation of the
 scale, tuning, temperament, the monochord, &c."                             He
 remarks that " no two major kevs at all related to each
other can exist, on the same keyed instrument, perfectly in
tune;" and adds that in a lecture on this subject, he caused
the keys of E major with four sharps, and E flat major
with three flats, to be tuned "perfectly" (perfect) on the
same piano-forte; namely, first the triads E, G*, B  A,
C*, E B, D», F* ; and then, having two notes G* and
D*, already tuned, which would serve for Ab and Eb, C
was added to them; and lastly, the triads of Eb, G, Bb >
and Bb, D, F.

declared       a    preference     for the equal temperament.            And
indeed, if we had no better unequal temperament than this,
I think there would be no disagreement of opinion about
them.       It is strange that the Doctor should write in this

 VI.    Description of a temporary Rick to sea/re Corn in
     Sheaves in the Fields till quite dry ; also Clover, Peas,
     and Beans.      By William Jones, Esq.                    of Foxdown-
     Hill, near Wellington, Somersetshire*.
 Sir,    The    very unusual quantity of rain that fell during
 the months     of August and September 1 SOO, with scarcely
 two days of dry weather following, in this neighbourhood,
 put farmers to the necessity of having recourse to various
 modes of preserving their corn ; and as 1 understand the
 Society of Arts has offered a gold medal for the cheapest
 and best mode of harvesting corn, and also for making hay
 in wet weather, superior to any hitherto practised, 1 beg
 leave to communicate some experiments I made last sum
 mer, and the result of them.              In the first place, I put some
 wheat in small round ricks, or wind-rows, made in the
 common way of this county; but afterwards recollecting
 that the uncommon wetness of the ground might render
 the under part damp, I thought it prudent to examine them,
 (about ten days after they were set up,) and found my ap
 prehensions so well founded, that I had the whole spread
 abroad; and have no doubt that, if they had remained a little
 longer, the corn would have been materially injured, not
 the bottom only, for it had contracted dampness a great
 way up the ricks, insomuch that I turned my attention to
 devise some better mode of preserving my barley in case
 the weather continued so rainy, as it afterwards proved.
 I  had observed in some wet seasons before this, that many
 of our farmers, not being able to get their barley dry enough
 to put into a large rick, had set up narrow ricks, containing
 the produce of an acre or two, each in different parts of the
 same field it was grown, for the sake of expedition ; and
 though some straw was put under them, yet the bottom
 contracted a great degree of dampness, so as to occasion it
 to smell old, and the clover was killed where these, ricks
 had stood.      My object was to prevent both these injuries;
 and it occurred to me, that four gate-hurdles would answer
 both purposes, bv setting the two outside ones perpendi
 cular, and two middle ones inclining against and supporting
 each other.     These hiirdles are usually eight feet jor.g; the
 two heads in which the four bars are mortised have pointed

       Description   of a temporary Rick for Corn,   S&c.   19
ends  of about a foot and a half long; the two outside ones
are to be forced into the ground nearly to their full length,
so that the middle brace may rest on the ground to afford
some support, and the two middle ones about six inches to
keep them steady.     The foot of the second hurdle should
be set two feet from the foot of the first, the third three
feet from  the second, and the fourth two feet from the
third, making seven feet, and occupying a space of seven
feet by eight, for barley or oats ; but wheat being longer in
the straw, requires the distance to be wider, viz. three feet
from the first to the second, three feet from the second to
the third, and three feet from the third to the fourth, which
will be nine feet by eitiht.
    It will be proper to put seven or eight small stakes, (a
little bigger than a man's thumb,) from the second bar of
the first hurdle to the second bar of the second hurdle, and
from the second bar of the third to the second bar of the
fourth, to support the sheaves from the ground, to admit
air under and prevent injury to the growing clover; or
small poles may be used extending from one outside hurdle
to the other.    The appearance of the ends of the hurdles
will be as in the engraved plans, Plate F. fig. 1, and section
Plate II. fig. 1, which show where the small stakes are to
be placed to prevent the sheaves touching the ground ; for
there will be but a slight pressure on them, since the ground
ends of the sheaves are to be put against the hurdle AB,
and the ears of the corn a little elevated to rest against the
hurdles CD, and the ears a little elevated against the centre
hurdle CD; so that the ears of the corn will be all within
side, and have the benefit of the air between C and D. It is
to be observed that, the hurdles CD being but six inches in
the ground, and the hurdles AB nearly eighteen inches,
the two former will be a little higher than the two lat
ter; which is necessary for two reasons, one      is,  that the
higher these are, the higher the air  is  admitted to the mid
dle of the rick, and the more they elevate the tops of the
sheaves in the middle,       for the ground ends should be
lowest to shoot off the rain.      But as  itwill be found that
after two or three rows are placed around the tops of the
hurdles, (for the ricks should be circular,) that the ground
ends of the sheaves being largest, the tops will become
nearly level, when   it will be necessary to put four sheaves
as at GG in the middle horizontally,        forming  a  square,
opening in the centre, which will admit air from the top of
the middle hurdles CD, through this space to the middle
of the rick, as the ears of each sheaf are just to meet only

SO             Description     of a lemporury Kick   to secure Corn
in the middle resting on these four sheaves*, which will
give such an elevation to the top3 of them, that the ground
ends will be sufficiently inclining downwards to shoot off
any rain that may fall.    In forming the roof,- the sheaves
are   of course to be put further in every time thev are put
around, till the roof terminates in a point, when two sheaves
with the tops downwards spread abroad and bound with a
straw band, will secure it from a great deal of rain ; but if
the corn is to remain out long, a little reed or thatch may
soon be put on each rick.
    Fearing I might not have been sufficiently explicit in de
  -
scribing this plan, it has occurred to me that it would be
better to send a model, containing 100 sheaves, made to a
scale of an inch to a foot, as to the length of the hurdles,
the distance from each other, and the size of the sheaves,
also to exemplify every particular of it.
    The weather being so rainy for some days after my barley
was cut, with every appearance of more rain, I determined,
on having a few hours intermission of rain, to get the mid
dle of the field, which was a little more dry than the rest,
and to put it in small ricks, containing more than the pro
duce of an acre, on these hurdles in the same field ; it was
in such a damp state as to be totally spoiled in a common
rick, but was taken from these ricks into a barn in the
month of January last, perfectly dry, the straw much better
than could have been expected, the grain good, having
been proved to grow well ; for having some doubt on ac
count of being put together so damp, I had it first tried
by putting a. few grains in a cloth into the earth, and have
since sown              it,
                  and no other this spring, and      never had
                                                           I              a
better prospect of good crop. a       The remaining part of the
barley that was left on the ground, was not taken in till
ten days afterwards, the grain much grown,             great deal
                                                            a
wasted             by
              frequently turning, and the straw spoiled.
 I    flatter myself      will be admitted that in wet seasons,
                               it
or when harvest         so late that, as the days decrease the
                              is
dews increase, and of course remain so long that there are
but few hours in        day for drying, even
                              a                  there should be
                                                      if
no rain, that this method will afford perfect security to com
that       cut dry, and put up in this manner immediately
              is
from the scythe or sickle, because,        there should be grass
                                                if
in       it,
        the ground end of every sheaf will be without side,
        If
       the corn should be very damp, and the rick made h!«rh four other
                                                                ,

                                            a
operate as bond to connect the sheaves in the middle, so that they can
                   a
not possibly slide outwards.
                                                                    exposed

                    in Sheaves in the Fields            till     quite dry.                   81
exposed  to the sun and air to dry ; and as for the grain, no
part of it can get damp, because the ears hut just meet in
the middle, through which the air passes from the boltom
to the top sufficiently to dry it. I have mentioned sheaves,
because in this country barley and oats are generally bound
as well as wheat; but both the former may be placed in
these ricks without binding, as I had some barley put in
one of them (by way of experiment), and think it to be
the better mode when there is much grass in     carefully                      it,   by
keeping the ears together when carried to the hurdles,
where     man
            a     ready to put
                        is         up to another on the top,

and to place the ears inwards     and       done in as short
                                                ;            it   is                          a
time as the like quantity    put on    waggon, with this ad
                                       is               a
vantage, that whereas     waggon  with
                                  a     three or four horses
go over  the clover to the great injury of    in wet weather,          it
by  this method the corn         carried
                                       is    women or children in

their arms to the hurdles, without the least injury to the
clover      ;consideration fully adequate to
                a                                    little extra ex       a
pense,      any,
            if     besides that  of being   more  expeditiously   se
cured     for every practical farmer will he sensible in how
short   a ;
          time an acre of corn may be carried from the cir
cumference of an acre to its centre.             As to the time of
fixing these hurdles,      have ascertained that two people can
                              I
fix them       five minutes, and one rick would contain the
                 in
produce of two acres of barley or oats.          The other advan
tages, besides the corn being thus sooner secured, are, that
no more attendance on              required, so that
                                      it   is            farmer's at           a
tention may be better directed to his other harvest con
cerns, and that one or two of these ricks at time (as may                   a
be convenient) mav be taken into           barn to thrash, whereas

and expense of thatching the remainder, and be subject to
the risk of rain before       may be covered again.

hard    ;but the greater part of these were so soft as to be

vantage to clover hay,        and   clover    seed,   before     may be

situation to dry without being so frequently turned as to
deprive the hay of its finest parts, and subject the seed to
great waste.      In cases also when meadow hay may be dry
enough    to  put in large cocks on the appearance of rain,
how much injury do they receive                 the bottom being ren

the same state of dryness, how many of such cocks may be
put on four hurdles? and the bottom instead of being wet
and injured will be perfectly dry, having air circulating

 like quantity of good hay in another; the former was very
 deficient both in colour and taste to the latter, and the qua
 lity of   it,
             of course, much deteriorated.
    We know that straw, particularly of barley or oats, will
 be much injured           being long on the ground exposed to
                              by
 soaking dews, and perhaps alternate rain and sunshine, and
 may  it not, when protected from them                 this mode, be far
                                                            by
 superior for cattle to what we are at present aware of? Be
 sides the advantages of grain, hay, and straw, being thus
 better preserved, and less expense of labour than                repeat by
 edly  turning       in
                     rainy  seasons,    there     another
                                                      is    advantage   of
 no small consequence, that the crops may be removed,

              in Sheaves in the Fields  till quite dry.      23
and put on hurdles in another field,, (without any hindrance
to sheep feeding therein) when the land from whence they
were taken may be immediately ploughed; for instance,
after pease, to facilitate abetter fallow, (than if delayed,)
to be succeeded by wheat, and ploughing clover lays- for
wheat, and also preparing land for turnips after vetches, to
accelerate the sowing ; in which case, the delay of a few
days has frequently occasioned a total loss of the crop.
    It is an essential consideration, that the expense attend-    '
ing improvements, should not counierbalan.ee their utility:
and 1 flatter imself, there can be no objection to this mode
on that score, because gate hurdles are useful appendages
to a farm, in any county, for other purposes, when not used
on this occasion, a(tv.l in this and other counties are re
quisite for dividing turnips for sheep ; and as to expedition,   -
which is of great importance in harvest concerns, four of
these hurdles (as 1 have already observed) may be fixed in
five minutes.
    If, therefore, the Society for the Encouragement of Arts,
Manufactures and Commerce, instituted for the laudable
purposes which it professes, should think my plan com
bines utility with cheapness ami expedition, I should con
sider myself flattered bv their approbation, and feel a de
gree of satisfaction in the reflection, that I have not turned
my thoughts in vain to a subject which must be allowed to
be of great importance.

 To C. Taylor, M.D. Sec.
    Sir,  I   have been favoured with your letter, acknow
ledging your having received my model of a temporary rick,
and recommending me to send certificates of its use.
    I have to add, that the barley 1 had put on these hurdles
last year, was done in my presence, by the same man who
removed it afterwards to the barn, thrashed and sowed it ;
 he is ready to attest my former statement, of the hurdles
 requiring only five minutes time to fix in the ground, of
 the barley preserved bv thein growing perfectly well, with
 a prospect, from its present appearance, of yielding a good
crop; and with this further remark, that it was so damp
 when put upon the hurdles, that he was apprehensive it
 would be spoiled, and was much surprised, when he took it
 into the barn, to find it so perfectly dry.
                                  B 4                   I notice

      '
24        Description   of a temporary Rick  to secure Corn
    I   notice your query, whether these hurdles could not be
applied to the purpose of temporary hovels for sheep, in wet
weather? I think thnt if two of them were fixed eight feet
apart, and two others placed on the top of them, covered
with straw, reed, rushes, heath or furze, they would form
a covered hovel of eight feet square, and afford great pro
tection to sheep in wet weather, (particularly just after be
ing shorn,) and ewes in the lambing season also, if some
that were the most forward with lamb were selected and
put into inclosures, where one end of each hurdle might
be put against a hedge, or against a wall, or end of.a hovel.
These hurdles, covered in like manner also, wpuld be use
ful, if a number of thein, proportioned to the quantity of
sheep, were put in the form of a square, in any part of a
field, in hot weather, to afford shade.       They would induce
the sheep to lie there, and answer the purpose of folding,
as they could easily be moved to such part of the field as
wanted improvement, and be more at ease than when
creeping under hedges, to the no small detriment of their
wool.
    I   have to report to the Society, that I have this harvest
made      use of the hurdles on a larger scale, viz. to keep
raking wheat separate from the sheaf, and which was too
damp to put in sheaf; and also in small ricks of wheat for
 seed, to save the trouble of taking it from a larger rick,
 before the whole was wanted to be thrashed ; and for my
 tithe wheat, that was not sufficiently dry to put into a
barn.
    I   had also five   acres of white pease, which were drilled
 where     a crop of  vetches had failed, so late as the 12th of
 May; they proved to be a very great crop, but they ripened
 so late, and the tops of the haulm were so green, from
 having shot out to an extraordinary length, that they were
 not aM carried till the 27th of last month.        At one time I
 almost despaired of ever getting them dry, owing to the
 heavy dews which fell during the night, and continued
 during most of the day, so as to afford but a few hours to
 dry my crop.        I therefore took up six waggon loads from
 the middle of the field, on the 25th of last month, and put
 them on twelve gate hurdles adjoining each other, for the
 purpose of making one roof, and set the hurdles in the
manner of my ricks. The first two loads were put on four
 of these hurdles at one end, which would contain four loads
 if necessary ; the next two on the adjoining four hurdles ;
 and the other two loads on the four remaining hurdles; so
that though these three ricks were close to each other, yet

             in Sheaves in the Fields      till quite dry.         25
being set up separately, they admitted air between each
from the bottom to the top, and yet adjoined sufficiently
to make one continued root' to be thatched together.
    When these six loads were removed from the field, I had
room to turn the remaining parcels towards each other, and
more towards the middle of the field, so as to have more
air to dry.     But they were not sufficiently dry till the 27th,
when they were carried to another set of sixteen hurdles
ready to take them, and each waggon load laid over the
whole length of 16 hurdles, not being so damp as to re
quire being carried up in separate ricks, as the former six
loads.     Some of these pease have been already thrashed,
and prove to be in very good condition, as also the haulm,
which is perfectly dry and sweet for cattle.
    One of these ricks of pease, and probably some of the
ricks of wheat, will not be taken in till the month of
 February next : they may therefore be inspected by any
member of the Society who may visit this neighbourhood.
     I have inclosed a certificate from Mr. Waldron, a gentle
man of this parish, who farms his own estate ; and another
 certificate from Mr. Hewett, also of this parish, who is
esteemed a respectable        and intelligent farmer: he rents a
 farm from Mr. Ware, brother to Mr. Ware of the house
 of Ware, Bruce and Co. London.

    This is to certify, that I      have seen some barley on     Mr.
Jones's farm at Culway, in           the parish of Wellington,     set
 upon gate hurdles in the harvest of 1809, which appeared
 to me to be a very good method to secure grain in wet sea
 sons, or when the dews remain so long on the ground, that
 it cannot be got sufficiently dry to put together on other
 ricks.    I  have also    seen  a   field of  barley at  Mr. Jones's
 this year, adjoining to my farm, sown with some of the
 barley pul on those hurdles, which grows well, and is likely
 to prove a good crop; and I think this invention of public
 utility.                                       Henry Waldron.
     This is to certify, that I have seen since this harvest, on
 Mr. Jones's farm       at Foxdown Hill, in the parish of Wel
 lington, three ricks of wheat, and two ricks of pease, set
 upon gate hurdles, which appears           to me   a very good  me
                                                                 thod

those ricks, and consider it to be a public benefit that a
farmer may have recourse to so cheap and expeditious a
method of securing his corn in difficult seasons ; whereby
he is able to put it together sooner, and of course expose
it less to the weather.

                                          AMES HeWETT.
   Sir, Agreeably      to your request, I lose no time to
give you  the  information  you desire, respecting the tem
porary corn rick, and the size they may be. made. The
space between the two outside hurdles contains about sixty
sheaves    on each side, or one hundred       and       twenty in the
whole,    to reach the top of the hurdles.
   Every round of sheaves afterwards takes forty sheaves or
upwards, say fifteen rounds high, which makes six hun
dred sheaves, and which will raise the rick about eight feet
from the tops of the hurdles.
   It will require about seventy sheaves from the top of the
above fifteen rounds, to the top of the conic roof.
   Four sheaves crossing each other, five times in the centre
of the rick, will form in the whole twenty, making as
follows :
    120 sheaves to the top of the hurdles.
   600 sheaves from the tops of the hurdles to the com
            mencement of the roof.
     72 sheaves  in the conical roofs.
     20 sheaves  in the cross or bonds of the rick.
  812     sheaves,or upwards of 81 shocks in each rick,
            whichis more than the average produce of an acre.
   The wheat in this part of the country is reaped near to
the ground, and my sheaves this year are about 4^ feet
long, for which the distance of '3 feet        inches between
                                                  <2\
the outer hurdles,  and    feet
                            3   between  the inner  hurdles,          is
calculated.    The distance should be regulated         by
                                                     the length
of the  sheaves of barley and oats.  When    shorter  than four
feet, the rick should te oblong instead of round.
   Faggots of wood, placed at intervals within the rick, will
be found particularly useful, where pease, vetches, clover,
hay seeds and meadow hay, are put into these ricks, as ihe
faggots will promote    greater circulation of air.
                        a
   The number of the cross sheaves should be according to
the dampness or dryness of the corn, either in every row,
or every second or third row.

VII.    On the Combinations        of Sulphur and Phosphorus with
    Platina*.      By Edmund         Daw, Esq. Chemical Operator
    and Superinlendant of the Mineralngical Collection in the
    Royal Institution.       Communicated by the Author.
                            1.  Introduction.
 Platina,       since its first introduction into Europe, has en
 gaged the attention      of the most enlightened chemists. The
 early experiments of Lewis, Marggraff, Bergman, &c. made
 us acquainted with many oF its properties,               fn their at
 tempts however to combine it with sulphur, they were un
 successful ; nor has this combination been hitherto found
 in nature, or been produced by anv artificial processes.
 The crude ore of platina has been ably investigated ; but the
 combinations of this metal with inflammable bodies, with
 oxygene, and with acids, have not yet been examined with
 precision.      An accurate investigation of these compounds
 is wanting to complete the chemical history oi platina,
 which, when supplied, can scarcely fail of useful applica
 tions to the arts and manufactures.
        2.  Of the  Combinations      of Platina with Sulphur.
     The early attempts        to   combine    sulphur  with     platina,
     These compounds were made in the autumn of last year ; but
                                                                  owing to
 circumstances which it is unnecessary here to mention, their publication
 has been delayed.
                                                                    were

 88                  On the Combinations  of
were founded on the analogy, that most of ihe metallic
sulphurets could be formed by the direct union of their
elements. Sulphur and platina were mixed and heated to
gether in the atmosphere, or sulphur was projected on the
metal previously heated to redness ; but by these methods
no chemical union of the substances took place.
    On resuming the subject, there appeared to me to be
two modes which had not hitherto been tried ; namely,
that of heating the ammonia-muriate of platina in contact
with sulphur; and that of exposing the metal and sulphur
to an elevated temperature in an exhausted tube.         Both
these methods seemed favourable to combination.        In one
case, the metal was in a very minute state of division, and
its neutro-saline ingredient volatile at a moderate heat ; in
the other, the volatility of the sulphur would be counter
acted, and the materials exposed to a degree of heat which
was impracticable in the atmosphere.        On making these
experiments, I had the satisfaction to find that, in both in
stances, sulphurets of platina were formed.
    As these compounds contain different proportions of
sulphur, and possess characteristic properties which will be
enumerated in the sequel, they will be distinguished by the
addition of the words super and sub to their common
names ; the former indicating the greater, the latter, the
lesser proportion of the inflammable principle : these di
stinctions ruve been already adopted by chemists.
    To avoid unnecessary details, it may be proper in this
place to state, that 'he platina employed in all mv experi
ments was procured by decomposing the 'ammonia-muriate
of this metal at a red ht;U in a platina crucible. The am
monia-muriate of platina used, was obtained by treating a
strong acid solution of purified platina with muriate of am
monia ; the yellow precipitate, after being washed with
distilled water, was dried for some days on a sand-bath at
a temperature    varying from 200J to about 3403 Fahrenheit,
and contained 41-5 grains of platina per cent.
              3.  Of Super- Sulphuret of Platina.
    This compound was obtained by heating in a glass retort
over mercury, a mixture of the ammonia-muriate of pla
tina with about two-thirds of its weight of flowers of
sulphur.    The retort was gradually heated to a dull red by
means of a spirit-lamp, and the process was continued for
a short time after the gas ceased to be produced : a quan
tity of muriatic acid gas with some nitrogene came over, a
little muriate of ammonia, with the excess of sulphur sub'

           Sulphur and Phosphorus with Platina.                              29
limed, and the super-sulphuret      of platina remained                  at the
bottom of the retort.
             Physical and Chemical Properties.
  Super-sulphuret of platina is of a dark iron-gray colour
approaching to black.   It is procured in fine powder, or in
small lumps the particles of which are loosely aggregated
together.    In the former state, it has a dull earthy appear
ance ; in the latter, it exhibits a feeble metallic lustre. It is
soft to the touch, and when rubbed on the fingers, or on
        it leaves a shining black mark, similar to that of
Eaper,
  lack lead.    It has no smell nor taste. It is not easy to
ascertain its specific gravity with precision.       From a trial
I made, it appeared to be about 3'5, distilled water being
1 ; but this is probably too low.        It is a nonconductor of
electricity.    It does not appear to be affected by the atmo
sphere, or by water ; at least, no visible change was per
ceived in it after being exposed to these agents for some
days. I have not been able to fuse it.
    The mineral acids scarcely produce any effect on super-
sulphuret of platina.     A single grain of it was boiled suc
cessively in pure concentrated nitric, nitro-muriatic,         and
sulphuric acids, but it apparently underwent no change ;
the residuum, after being washed and dried, lost no sensible
weight.      In the case or the nitro-muriatic acid, however,
there was a minute quantity of sulphur acidified, which
was indicated by a slight precipitate on the addition of
nitrate of barytes.
    A strong solution of pure potash when boiled with super-
sulphuret of platina occasioned no visible change in it ;
but when the alkali was dry and fused with                     it,

decomposition took place.        When        it  mixed with oxy-

muriate of potash and heated,      it   isdecomposed with bril

  sulphur burns with a blue name, and sulphureous acid gas

                               Analysis.
     The mineral acids could not be employed to ascertain,
 the composition of super-sulphuret of platina.              It might
 be analysed by the agency of zinc filings and the acids ; but
 it was unnecessary to resort to complicated processes, when
 methods more simple, and susceptible of greater accuracy,
 could be adopted. As it was readily decomposed by heat,
 and the quantity of metal in a given weight of the am
 monia-muriate of platina easily ascertained, it's composi
 tion could be determined both by analysis and synthesis.
     From two experiments made in both of these methods
 with considerable precaution, its component parts are de
 duced.
     First Experiment. 10 grains of super-sulphuret of platina
 decomposed by heat in a platina crucible afforded 7-17
 grains of pure platina.
     Second Experiment.       8 grains of super-sulphuret decom
 posed by heat on a piece of Florence flask, furnished 5*75
 grains of platina.
     From the first of these experiments 100 grains of super-
 sulphuret of platina contain

    For   8 : 5 75 : : 100 : 71*87.
    In the two synthetical experiments 10 gTains         of   the am
monia-muriate of platina, heated with sulphur,             furnished
in one     case 6*14   grains,  and in the other 61 grains of
super-sulphuret.
    Now 10 grains of the ammonia-muriate of platina con
tained 4*45 grains of platina.         Hence these experiments
indicate    rather  less sulphur   than   the preceding ones ; but
the difference is trifling, and ia easily accounted for.           In

collecting the results of these last experiments from the
retorts, there must have been a slight loss, which is not
noticed in the statements. Without regarding the frac

parts of super-sulphuret of platina as

                4.  Of Sub- Sulphur et of Platina.
   This substance    was procured by heating platina in con
tact   with sulphur in an exhausted tube. The tube em
ployed was about four inches long, and \\ inch in dia
meter; at the open end it was made small for the con
venience of being easily drawn off after exhaustion.         The
materials were mixed and introduced nearly in equal weights,
a stop-cock was then cemented to the tube, it was exhaust
ed, hermetically sealed, and heated for about ten minutes
in an open fire; towards the end of the process, the bottom
of the tube was heated nearly to redness, to expel the ex
cess of sulphur; the sub-sulphuret of platina alone re
mained at the bottom of the tube.
               Physical and Chemical Properties.
    Sub-sulphuret of platina is of a dull blueish-gray colour.
It is obtained in the form of powder, or in small pieces
the particles of which are loosely coherent.        Its lustre is
earthy ; but when rubbed on the fingers, or on paper, it
leaves a shining mark of a blueish-gray colour, having the
metallic lustre.    It is rather harsh to the feel. It has no
smell or taste.    Its specific gravity is about 6*2, that of di
stilled water being 1 . It is a nonconductor of electricity.
Like the super-sulphuret of platina, it does not appear to
he affected by exposure to the atmosphere, or in water.
Its chemical properties closely resemble those of the super-
             '
sulphuret.     The mineral acids scarcely affect it at a boiling
heat. It is decomposed when heated with oxymuriate of
potash or zinc filings.
                             Analysis.
    The only simple and accurate method of determining the
composition of sub-sulphuret of platina appeared to me to
be by the agency of heat, and to this mode I had recourse.
 In the direct union of its elements, there was always a loss
arising from the circumstance that sulphur remains fluid at

32                     On the Combinations         of
high temperatures in exhausted tubes; and from its being
in a constant state of motion, particles of the sub-sulphuret
formed, were occasionally deposited on the sides of the
tube with a little sulphur, and they could not easily be col
lected.
    In two different experiments carefully made, 5 grains of
sub-sulphuret decomposed             at a low red heat, in a platina
crucible, afforded 4*2 grains of platina, and 5 : 4*2 : :
 100 : 84.
    Hence 100 parts of sub-sulphuret of platina contain
                                                 Platina   ....     84
                                                 Sulphur...          16
                                                                   100
    The sub-sulphuret of platina, whilst it possesses some
properties analogous to those of the super-^sulphuret, differs
from it in colour, lustre, specific gravity, and proportion of
 sulphur; properties sufficient to establish its existence as a
distinct combination.
      5. Of the   Combinations      of Platina with Phosphorus.
    Chemists have hitherto paid but little attention to the
 combinations of metals with phosphorus.                 The papers of
 M. Pelletier appear to contain most of what is known
 concerning these compounds.                He first combined phos
 phorus with platina* by exposing the metal,                          phos
 phoric glass, and charcoal powder to a strong heat ; and
 by projecting bits of phosphorus on platina heated to red
 ness.    From the experiments I have made, 1 cannot but
 regard the methods of M. Pelletier as very imperfect.
 Platina and phosphorus combine with great facility, at a
 heat considerably below redness ; at a red heat, a portion
 of the phosphorus is expelled, and at still more elevated
 temperatures the combination is nearly destroyed.
     Phosphorus, like sulphur, appears to combine in two
 different proportions with platina.               The same methods
 employed in forming the sulphurets were successfully
 adopted in making the phosphurets of platina, and they
 will be marked by the same distinctions.
               6.  Of Super-     Phosphuret      of Platina.
     This compound was procured by heating together the
  ammonia-muriale of platina with about two-thirds of its
 weight of phosphorus in small bits, in a retort over mer
  cury.    Towards the end of the experiment, the retort was
         * Atmalu  de Chintie, tome i. p. 100, and tome xiii. p. 105.
                                                                      heated

             Sulphur and Phosphorus with Platina.               33
heated to a dull red for a few minutes to expel every thing
volatile. A quantity of muriatic acid gas having the odour
of phosphorus and some nitrogene gas came over, a little
muriate of ammonia with the excess of phosphorus sub
limed, and super-phosphuret of platina was formed.
               Physical and Chemical Properties.
  The physical   and chemical properties of super-phosphuret
of platina  resemble those of the super- sulphuret.   lis co
lour is iron black, or very dark gray. It is in fine powder,
or in small pieces in a loose state of aggregation.    When
in this last state it exhibit's a dull metallic lustre.   It marks
the fingers or paper, but the lustre it gives is much inferior
to that of the super-sulphuret.       Its specific gravity is about
5*28, that of distilled water being 1.          It has no taste or
smell.   It did not appear to be affected by being exposed
to the atmosphere or water for some days.     It is a non
conductor of electricity.  When it is heated on a thin slip
of platina below redness, it becomes an ignited mass and
diminishes in bulk, but its colour scarcely varies.           On
raising the heat to whiteness by means of a blow-pipe, it
fuses, and perforates the platina with holes.     It is but little
affected by the mineral acids at any temperatures.        When
it is heated with fine zinc or iron filings, it undergoes little
change.     It is partially decomposed with vivid ignition
when heated with oxymuriate of potash, and oxygene gas
and chlorine gas are evolved.     When mixed with the same
salt, and struck smartly with a hammer, it detonates with a
loud report.     It is decomposed when heated in chlorine
gas, phosphorane is formed, and a combination of chlorine
and platina remains : but I have not yet examined these
results with precision.
                           Composition.
   It was not easy to find unexceptionable methods of ana
lysing the super-phosphuret of platina.     The mineral acids
had no apparent action on it.      Though oxymuriate of pot
ash decomposed       it,
                       the process was tedious, and the results
 by  no means satisfactory.      At  a high temperature long
continued,    itwas decompounded       ; but little dependence
could be put    inthis mode of operating, as in cases when
Hessian crucibles were used there was almost always              a
considerable loss, and platina ones could not be employed
without insuring their destruction.
    The only method which seemed to offer satisfactory re-

34                     On the Comlinations of
stills, was that employed to ascertain the composition of
the super-sulphurel by synthesis, and to this 1 had recourse.
    From several experiments two of the most accurate are
selected, from which its composition is deduced.
    First Experiment.        30 grains of the ammonia-muriate of
platina were heated with phosphorus in a small green glass
retort coated with clay, for about half an hour, during
which time the retort had been heated to a dull red.          The
super-phosphuret collected when the retort was cold, weighed
 18 95 grains.        Now these 30 drains of the metallic salt
contained 13*35 grains of platina; consequently the lS-95
grains of super phosphuret consisted of 13-35 grains of
platina + 5 6 grains or phosphorus.          This experiment indi
cates 30     per cent,  of phosphorus in the super-phosphuret.
    Second Experiment. 10 gramsof the ammonia-muriate of
platina heated with phosphorus precisely in the same way
as the last expeiiment furnished 6-34 grains of super-phos-
phuret.       This experiment very nearly agrees with the pre-      %
ceding     one.    And 100 parts of super-phosphuret of platina
may     be  regarded as composed of       Platina ....   70
                                          Phosphorus     30
                                                        100
                 7.  Of Sul-Phosphuret of Platina.
    This   substance was obtained by heating together platina
 and    phosphorus in an exhausted tube, similar to that used
for procuring the sub-sulpburet of platina.          The intensity
of their mutual attraction is beautifully demonstrated by
 this experiment.         At a temperature considerably below
 redness, thev combine with vivid ignition and flame, and
 unless the tubes are strong they are very liable to be de
 stroyed.
                  Physical and Chemical Properties.
     Sub-phosphuret of platina is of a lead grav, or blueish-
 gray colour.       It is either obtained in small porous masses,
 or (in cases when as much as 20 grains of the metal are
 employed) in imperfectly fused and crystallized pieces.
 The crystals are small cubes.          When it has undergone
 fusion its lustre is little inferior to that of lead, but in a
 porous stale it has little brilliancy.
     Its specific gravity when in porous pieces is about 6.
 After fusion there can be no doubt but it must be consider
  ably more.      It has no taste or smell. It is a non-conductor
  of electricity.     When it is heated to a strong red on a slip
                                                                 of

                Sidphuf and Phosphorus with Platina.                 35
  bf platina,   the odour  of phosphorus is exhaled, and its sur
  face assumes a     darker  tint.   When the heat is urged to
  whiteness it combines with the plaiina, which it per
  forates with holes.     It is partially decomposed with igni
  tion when heated with oxymuriate of potash.              When it is
  heated in chlorine gas, the results are similar to those ob
  tained in the case of the super-phosphuret.
                              Composition.
     The difficulties which    were opposed to the direct analysis
  of  the super-phosphuret,       equally apply to the sub-phos-
  phuret.      Its composition was ascertained by the direct
  union of   its elements; and though only comparatively small
  quantities of the materials could be employed with safety,
  yet from the manner of operating, it would seem that the
  results are susceptible of considerable accuracy.
      From several experiments I have selected two of the
» most accurate, from which its composition is determined.
     First Experiment. 10 grains of platina heated with phos
  phorus in an exhausted tube tor about seven minutes
  furnished 12*1 grains of sub-phosphuret.
     From this experiment 100 grains contain
                                         Platina   ....   82-64
                                         Phosphorus 17-36
                                                        100-00
     Second Experiment. 20 grains of platina heated with phos
  phorus in an exhausted tube, precisely as in the other ex
  periment, afforded 24-3 grains of sub- phosphuret.              This
  experiment, which I regard as the more accurate of the two,
  gives the component       parts  of sub-phosphuret of platina      as
                                          Platina   ....   62-3

                                                          100 o
     The difference   between    these  experiments     is  not consi
  derable.     From a comparison of them with others, 1 shall
  venture to consider the mean as the nearest approximation.
  Hence luo parts will be composed of

36                    On the Comlinations       of
the ammonia-muriate of platina, it is possible to question
the accuracy of the preceding statements         relative to the
super -sulphuret and super-phosphuret of plaiina;           they
may perhaps be considered by some persons as compou°ds
of oxide of platina and the respective inflammable princi
ples.     From the experiments I have made on this metallic
salt, I consider it as a compound of platina, chlorine,
 ammonia and water.        But should the facts I have to relate
 be considered as inconclusive with regard lo this point,
still, il appears to me, they can only be explained by ad
mitting the constitution of the above combinations of
 platina to be such as I have stated.
    When the ammonia- muriate of platina is exposed to a
 dull red heat in a retort over mercury, (after being dried
for some lime at a temperature above 2li!J,) it is entirely
decomposed, the only products are muriatic acid gas in
 quantity, nitrogen gas, aqueous muriatic acid, sublimed
muriate of ammonia, and pure platina.        In this experiment
 the following changes may be presumed to take place.
 One portion of the ammonia is decomposed, its nitrogen is
evolved, its hydrogen combines with the chlorine, to form
muriatic acid gas, one part of which assumes the gaseous
state, the other part is found in combination with the re
 sidue of the ammonia and with the W3ter.         This explana
tion appears to be strictly conformable to facts ; at high
temperatures, ammonia is well known to be resolved into
hydrogene and nitrogene gases, and muriatic acid eas to be
formed from chlorine and hydrogene gases. As the gaseous
products are the same, and the general results precisely
analogous, whether the ammonia- muriate of platina be de
composed alone, or in contact with sulphur or phosphorus,
the same explanation of the facts will equally apply to them all.
    I have found that when metallic oxides arc heated with
freshly sub'imed muriate of ammonia, a quantity of water
is formed, atnmoniacal gas is evolved, and compounds of
the metals and chlorine are obtained ; nor are these results
affected, even when the muriate previously contains water.
As in the case when a mixture of red precipitate and mu
riate of ammonia are heated together, w hite, precipitate ap
pears to be the o      combination of mercury formed, from
                      ily
which     calomel may be obtained     by heating    with quick

the results   of my inquiries should admit of immediate use
ful applications.
   If the ammonia-muriate of platina be regarded as a com
pound of oxide of platina ar.d muriate of ammonia, I do
not see how the preceding facta can be explained.           If its
composition is such as I have stated, Sir H. Davy's theory
happily applies to all the phaenomena.
   I have made some experiments on those substances
which are considered as triple compounds of oxide of
platina, acids and fixed alkali; and they all appear to me
to be compounds of chlorine, platina and alkali : thus they
are decomposed when heated with sulphur and phosphorus,
and furnish substances      which Sir H. D.ivy has denomi
nated sulphurate and phosphorate ; compounds precisely
similar to those obtained w hen these inflammable bodies
are heated directly in chlorine gas.
   At Sir H. Davy's request, I made a number of experi
ments on those substances which have been considered as
oxides of platina, and the evidence of facts obliges me to
regard almost all the statements in our elementary books,
relative to the oxides and salts of platina, as incoirect.       It
is unnecessary     in this place to detail the experiments on
which these opinions are founded ; they will more properly
form the subject of a distinct paper.
   It is also said to be a distinguishing property of platina,
that it is precipitated by sulphuretted hydrogene in the me
tallic state. This is not the case. It is obtained in the form
of a black powder resembling the super- sulphuret in some
properties, but differing from it in others ; thus, it is soluble
in nitro-muriatic acid, and contains a large quantity of sul
phur.     Sulphuret of potash likewise precipitates platina in
combination with sulphur; but I have not yet satisfied my
self as to the true constitution of these compounds.
   In forming the combinations of platina with sulphur and
phosphorus, it was not easy to obtain uniform results,
owing it seems to their partial decomposition at high de
grees of heat, and the difficulty of regulating the tempera
ture with precision.     The doctrine of definite proportions,
which has been so amply illustrated by the researches of
the most enlightened chemists, served in some measure to
direct me in my experiments, and the results I have obtained
appear to hanrionfze with this doctrine.        Thus, the 3ub-
sufphuret    and sub phnsphurct    of platina contain one pro
portion,    and   the  super-sulphuret and snper-pho«phuret
two proportions of the inflammable principles.         A tabular
view of these combinations      will exhibit them in a more di-

exhihited in a remarkable manner in the energy with which
thev combine. I am acquainted with no simple or accurate
method of analysing combinations of the metals with phos
phorus.        As chlorine decomposes the phosphtirets of pla
tiua with facility, it seems to offer a simple mode of exa
mining refractory compounds of this kind.
      Zinc has been supposed to have but little affinity for
 sulphur, because chemists have not been able to combine
 these substances       directly.   In the preceding pages it is
 stated, that zinc filings decompose the super-sulphuret of
 platina with ignition. The experiments I made in the
 autumn of last year, lead me to conclude that the affinity
  of zinc for sulphur is at least equal to that of iron. The
 intensity of their mutual attraction is evident from the
 circumstance, that zinc filings and sulphur when exposed
  to an elevated temperature         in exhausted      tubes combine
  with vivid ignition and flame.              I also found that zinc
  filines hv the agency of heat decompose the sulphurets of
  lead, molvbdena, copper and nickel, and sulphuret of zinc
  is formed.
       The corn! inations of platina with sulphur and phosphorus
  will probably admit of some useful and (economical appli
   cations.      The sulphurets of platina are insoluble in all the
  mineral acids, and this propeny seems to afford an easy
  method of obtaining pure platina from the crude ore. For
   this purpose the nitro-muriatic solution should be neutra
   lized by ammonia, the precipitate washed, dried, and heated
   with an excess of sulphur ; sulphurets of the diffe rent me
   tals in the crude ore would thus be obtained, and they may
   be all separated from the sulphuret of platina by the agency
   of the mineral acids. As the super sulphuret has the pro
   perty of giving to paper, &c. a considerable degree of lustre,
   it may perhaps be used as a pigment, in cases where per-
   matipucy and lustre are required.
        Platina is well known to be admirably adapted for vessels
    and instruments employed in cecononiical or experimental
    processes ; but iis application is very limited in conse
    quence of its high commercial value. It would be a very
    desirable and important object to be able to give a perma
    nent coating of platina to kitchen utensils, steel instru
                                                                  ments,

the agency of acids and other corrosive substances,                   f can
not but indulge a hope that these new compounds will
admit of some applications of this kind.                  I made some at
tempts to plate steel, iron, copper and brass with the super-
sulphuret and super-phosphuret of platina, hut obtained no
very satisfactory resuhs ; the coatings were in some cases
very partial, and in others not permanent.                   It will be un-
necessaiy to enter more into detail, as Mr. James Siodart
and myself intend to resume the subject, and to make the
experiments in a more refined manner.
     It seems probable that the combinations of sulphur and
phosphorus with platina exist in nature, and M. Proust*
considers the black powder remaining after the ore of
platina has been digested in nitro-muriaiic acid, as contain*
nig both sulphuret and phosphuret of platina: new re-,
searches however are wanting in order to establish this point.
    The phosphurets of platina described in this paper differ
materially from the combination obtained by M. Pelletier,
both in the proportions of phosphorus they contain, and in
their sensible properties. The methods hitherto employed
to form the class of metallic phosphurets appear to be very
imperfect, and can scarcely furnish in any instance correct
 results ; thev are quite impracticable in some cases.                  Thus
 the phosphurets of gold and mercury can only be formed
 at comparatively low temperatures ; and the phosphuret of
 gold is entirely decomposed by a moderate heat.                       Oiher
 instances might be mentioned in which the existing com
 binations are partially destroyed at more elevated tempe
 ratures, as the phoaphuret of nickel and the super-phos
 phuret of platina.          The new mode 1 have adopted, that
 of heating the metals and phosphorus in an exhausted tube
hermetically sealed, seems to me to be simple and accurate,
 and in its application promises to furnish more correct re
 sults than have yet been obtained.

    wanted intelligence respecting the best mode of dibbling
    acorns, I have made an improvement on the aenrn dibble
    in the Society's Repository, which I presume will answer
    well the desired purpose.            I therefore send herewith a
    drawing of      it,requesting you will have the goodness to lay
    it before the Society of Arts, &c.
       Thorn bushes and thickets are the natural guardians of
    young oaks from the depredations of cattle of all kinds, on
    forests and other grounds on which they pasture. By
    means of this implement, acorns may be deposited in the
    interior of bushes, as well as in open grounds, with rapidity
    and accuracy.        And presuming that such an implement
    would be of great utility to many individuals, and also to
    Government,      I  wish much to have         it made known as ge
    nerally as possible among those who are most likely to
    profit     byit; and which       I think may be best effected       by
    the Society of      Arts, &c. giving an engraving of             their

 IX.     Examination of a Species of Plumbago from Africa.
     By Edmund Davy, Esq. Chemical Operator and Su-
    perintendant of the Mineralogical Collection in the Royal
     Institution.    Commimicaledby      the  Author.
 This      substance was brought from Mozambique, on the
 pontinent of Africa, where it is said to occupy a consider
 able extent of surface.      I am not aware that it has been
 described by mineralogical writers ; I shall therefore notice
 its physical and chemical properties.
     Its colour is iron-gray.     It is disseminated in small la
 minae, in a loosely aggregated matriv, composed of feldspar,
             and mica.     The laminae intersect each other in
 3uartz,
   ifferenl directions, but exhibit no appearance of crystalliza
 tion. Its lustre is metallic, like that of polished steel.       It
                       '                                          is

42                       Examination of a
is soft and unctuous to the feel, and strongly marks the fin
gers or paper, like common plumbago.                  It is a conductor
of electricity. The specific gravity of the pure substance
T could not ascertain, as it was intimately blinded              with its
matrix ; but when separated as much as possible from eanhy
particles, it was l-6, distilled water being 1.               I have not
been able to learn its geological situation, or the nature of
the rocks with which it is associated ; but from the cir
cumstance of its occupying distinct strata, and from its
specific characters, it probably resulted from the degrada
tion of the primary granite, and might be classed among
that order of rocks termed secondary.              If regard were only
paid to its external characters, this substance             would pro
bably find a place among the ores of moKbdena ; but the
effects of chemical agents on it proved that it could not
belong to this class of bodies. It was unaltered before the
blow-pipe on platina, charcoal, and borax. It was scarcely
affected by any of the mineral acids.                A little of it was
boiled successively      in concentrated test nitric, muriatic,
nitro-muri.mc, and sulphuric acids ; but its lustre remained
unimpaired, and it lost no perceptible weight.                   On exa
mination, however, these acids were found to have taken
up a minute quantity of iron, which was indicated by a
slight blue precipitate on the addition of prussiate of potash.
    When the ore was exposed to'the agency of pure potash,
or to nitre at a red heat, it appeared to be unaffected, and
in the first trials with these substances no satisfactory re
sults were obtained.       Decided evidences of its composition
¦were gained by heating it to redness in contact with arsenic
acid, an experiment which I found had been previously
made by the illustrious Scheele*, who seems to have con
sidered the carbonic acid not as a product, but as a consti
tuent part of plumbago.
                              Analysis.
    I was necessarily confined to the use of very small por
tions of the ore, not only oh account of the limited quan
tity in my possession, but likewise in consequence of its
highly refractory nature. In no instance was I able to
consume so much as five grains in close vessels, so as to
obtain decisive results.       From several experiments I have
selected three of the most accurate, and from them I shall
venture to state its composition.
    First Experiment. 75 grains of the ore (carefully separated
 from the matrix) were mixed with 30 grains of arsenic

acid and exposed to a strong red heat for about 25 minuted
over mercury, in a small green glass retort coated with
clav.     Nine cubical inches of carbonic* acid gas were ob
tained, besides a quantity of oxygen, and white crystallized
oxide of arsenic sublimed.                After the residuum had been
well    washed    with   distilled     water,     and dried at a low red
heat, it weighed 4^ grains, and appeared to he unaltered in
Its general characters.           A half of a grain of earthy matter
was n'iw separated Irani the 4| grains, which, on examina
tion, was found to be silex, alumine, and a minute quantity
of iron.      Now, from the accurate experiments of Messrs.
Allen and Pepysf, 100 cubical inches of carbonic acid gas
contain 28-60 grains of carbon.                    And 9 cubical inches
contain 2-57 grains.               Hence these 7^ grains of the ore
 furnished                 4'-25 grains of ore unaffected

     Second Experiment.           5  grains of the ore were heated with*
 35 grains of oxvmuriate of potash, in a similar manner as
 the preceding experiment.                6 cubical inches of carbonic
 acid gas were obtained, and a quantity of oxygene.                    The re
  siduum carefully collected was treated with pure muriatic
  acid, and digested for some minutes at about 70^ Fahren
  heit.    The acid solution was then passed through a filter,
 and the solid matter collected, washed, dried, and heated to
  redness.     It weighed 3' I grains, and had all the appearance
  of the native ore, except that its lustre was very slightly
  impaired.      A few minute particles of silex were disse
  minated in it. The acid solution gave only a slight indi
  cation of iron with prussiatc of potash, and no ascertain
   able quantity of earthy matter separated, when it was neu
   tralized with carbonate of potash.

about 70 grains of oxvmuriate of potash (previously fused)
and healed in a plaiina crucible.     At a dull red heat the mix
ture became an ignited mass : the heat was increased until
all the ox\ gene was expelled from the salt. The ore' was
not much affected bv this treatment.        About 150 grains of
pure were now introduced, and the heal raised to a strong
red : after half an hour the crucible was examined, a quan
tity of the ore still remained. A fresh portion of nitre was
added, and the heat raised and continued for about two
hours, during which time fresh portions of nitre were oc
casionally introduced.
   The crucible was now examined, and exhibited to the
eye no remains of Jhe ore.         The solid matter was treated
with diluted test muriatic acid, anil after being digested for
some time at a moderate        heat, it wholly dissolved except
a quarter of a grain, which proved to be principally silex
with a little dust from the charcoal. Theacid solution was
treated with a slight excess of ammonia, and after a short
time a whitish flocculent precipitate appeared.        It was col
lected on a filter, washed, and heated to a strong red in a
platina crucible.     It hardened in the fire, and had now the
characters of alumine coloured by iron.         It was bruised t6
powder and digested in diluted test muriatic acid; the
greater part of it remained insoluble, and was principally
alumine with a little silex.        The acid solution was now
treated with prussiate of potash, and afier some time the
prussiate of iron was collected on a filter, washed and dried.
As no ascertainable quantity of it could be separated from
the paper, the filter was burnt in a platina crucible, and a
red heat continued until all the carbonaceous matter was
consumed.      The oxide of iron obtained, weighed a quarter
of a grain, and was partly attracted bv the magnet.
   This experiment affords only an imperfect approximation
as to the real quantity of iron in the ore.        If the iron be
considered as existing in the ore in the metallic state, it can
scarcely be estimated at more than two or three per cent.
   The preceding experiments furnished distinct evidences
as to the nature of this substance, that* it is a species of
plumbago, and consists almost entirely of carbonaceous
matter.    In its general characters, it seems to bear a strik
ing resemblance to the artificial products of gome iron fur
naces in the East Indies, well known by the name of Kish
                                                             iron.

iron.     I am not acquainted with any varieties of plumbago
which contain so small a quantity of iron, or which ex
hibit snch refractory properties.          Those examined by
Scheele, Pelletier,    and  other able chemists,   furnished more
iron, and differ in other respects from the subject of this
paper.
X. Mr. Bakewell            in Reply to Mr.  Farey's Geological
                            Observations.
                          To Mr. Tilloch.
 Sir, Tn the last number of The Philosophical Magazine
                                                 J
 you have inserted some strictures of Mr. . Farey on what
 he is pleased to call an erroneous statement in my Lectures,
 respecting a map of England, which I asserted to be, ai far
 as  I knew, the first attempt to present in a distinct view " a
 geological ou:line of the arrangement of the most im
 portant mineral substances in South Britain."             I believe
 this was what I stated in my lectures, and notwithstanding
 Mr. Farey's two pages on the subject I repeat the assertion
 again.
     The week previous to the publication of Mr. Farey's
 letter, Mr. Greenough favoured me with the inspection of
 his map, which I had not before seen, or even heard of.
 With respect to what Mr. Farey or Mr. Smith may have
 done towatds producing a Geological Map of F.ngland
 I am still unacquainted; nor am I very desirous to learn,
 if the imaginary "zigzag fault" and "great Derbyshire
fault," in the former gentleman's Survey of Derbyshire, be
 specimens of what we may expect from- his geological la
 bours.     Mr. Farey has asserted that the metalliferous lime
 stone in Derbyshire is the very lowest stratum of rock in
 England ; on the contrary, I believe that the same lime
  stone, which disappears in the north-west side of Derby
  shire, rises again in the district of Craven in Yorkshire,
  and rests upon slate.      As I have visited this district se
  veral times, and Mr. Farey, front his own acknowledgement
  to me, has never seen it ; I presume that my evidence on
  the subject may be entitled to as much weight as the
  doubts of Mr. Farey, who has nothing to advance in their
  support, but the existence of his imaginary great fault, for
  which I conceive there is no proof whatever. The lime
  stone of Craven is as similar to that of Derbyshire, as the
  different beds in that county are to each other; it contains
  the same metallic ores, and rises from under a coarse mill
                                                               stone

  46     tlcply to Mr.  Farey's Geological Observations.
  stone grit anil shale grit near Furnsal, on (he river Wharf,
  in the same manner as the metalliferous) limestone of Der
  byshire.     All the ablest geologists that  I have conversed
  with, who    have examined the lime rocks of both counties,
  are convinced of their similarity; and had Mr. Farey visited
  the  country without any prejudices from his particular
  theory, I ain satisfied he would have formed the same con
  clusions.
     As Mr. Farey has written so much and so frequently on
 what he calls a great Derbyshire Fault, which extends from
 the south side of Nottingham        to Ashburn in Derbyshire,
 and from thence in, a circuitous path to Macclesfield in
 Cheshire, and further to the north, where he ceases to trace
 it ; I am sure geologists will be obliged to him to inform
 them where be has actually found this fault 'in situ' in
 any part from Nottingham       to Ashburn ? what is its exact
 breadth ? whether it he merely a slip, or whether it be
 filled with mineral matter? and of what kind?          He will
 also inform them how the limestone has passed over or
 under this fault, so as to appear again with veins of lead ore
 at Breedon and in other situations on the south side of the
 Trent. It will scarcely satisfy the curious to be told that
 these lime rocks are mere anomalous masses, though it
 may be an easy method of dismissing a difficulty which
 destroys the very existence of Mr. Farey's Derbyshire fault.
 1 am    inclined to believe that Mr. Farey has written so
 much in sober seriousness respecting this great pheno
 menon, that he earnestly believes in its reality; but 1 pre
 sume that he has the singular satisfaction of enjoying this
 opinion undivided.      I never have met with any one resi
 dent near its supposed course, or who has paid attention
to the subject, who believed that it had any other existence
than in the mind of the discoverer, who has given to it a
local habitation and a name.      With respect to the existence
of what Mr. F. calls the Zigzag Fault, the most intelligent
coal workers that I have conversed with who have pits in
the vicinity are not disposed to admit its existence. The
western side of Derbyshire adjoining Cheshire and part of
Staffordshire is much broken by faults ; but I have seen no
proof offered that any one of these faults extends over a
considerable tract of country*      On the southern side from
Nottingham      to Derby,  the  very existence of such a fault
as Mr. Farey describes       has no where been proved        in
any part that I am acquainted with.        The loose sand r<>ck
and gravel of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire appears to
have beeu thrown over the surface in extensive patches
                                                         which

          Reply to    Mr.    Farey's Geological Observations.        4?
which terminate upon the red marie on the southern side;
but there are no indications of the surface having been
fractured along the line where the termination of the sand
rock is observed.          I therefore repeat again my request, that
Mr. Farey would distinctly point out the situations where
this greil fault, on which he has written so much, can be
seen and proved to exist.              A particular fracture at any one
part,   will   not  be  sufficient    to  prove the identity of a fault
in any other part, without further evidence than the con
jectures of the observer.
    The assumpiion of imaginary facts in geology has a ten
 dency to retard the progress of the science more than any
 other cause.        The application of conjectures to explain the
 operation of causes which we have not been able to prove or
 trace, may be allowed where such conjectures are kept di
 stinct from facts ; but when they are confounded with
 them, and reasoned upon w.th as much solemn gravily as
ifthevwere real entities, they " darken council bywords
 without knowledge."
     At the conclusion of Mr. Farey's letter, he attributes to
 me the adoption of Mr. Whitehurst's                   opinion that the
 toad-stone ot Derbyshire has bten injected in a slate of
 fusion between the beds of limestone. This opinion 1 have
 most distinctly disavowed ; though I am inclined to believe
 that the basaltic amygdaloid of that county has been the
 product of submarine volcanoes thrown over the lime at
 different periods of time when the whole of that country
 was under the surface of the ocean.                  This was offered
  merely    as  a  conjecture,      to  which  no   importance was at
 tached.
                            I am, sir,
                                  Your obedient servant,
    July 14, 1812.                                       R, BAKEWELL.
     P.S.  It is with some reluctance that I have been com
  pelled to enter the lists of controversy with Mr. Farey ; but
  as I am at this time examining for the Earl of Moira a part
  of Chamwood Forest, I lake the opportunity of observing
  that Mr. Farey's statement, that there is no appearance of
  stratification in the slate rocks of this district, is erroneous.
  All these rocks which I have examined are composed of
  grau wacce, roof slate, horn-stone slate, and porphyritic
  slate, which are most distinctly stratified, but in an op
  posite direction to the slaty cleavage of the stone.            On the
  mineralogy      of  this  district   I shall probably   offer some re
  marks to the public.

On the Decomposition         of White Oxide of Arsenic              Ij)   Lime.
                   By    William         Lambe,      M.D.
                              exposing pieces of marble in
                                 a by
 I   prepared some lime                                                        a
crucible to the heat of        smith's forge, making       so             it
caustic, that no effervescence took place Dy the affusion of
diluted muriatic acid, though       few minute bubbles were
                                             a
still formed.    To effect this,    found
                                        I     necessary to keep

the marble in this strong heat two complete hours.                             I
mixed three ounces of this lime with its weight of white
oxide of arsenic, -which    had previously sublimed and pul
                            I
verized.    The mixture was introduced into coated class       a
retort, to which     tube was joined, the end of which was
                     a
plunged into water in     pneumatic trough
                           a                     and the retort

was gradually made red hot.      The water at first rose into
the tube, showing an absorption of gas               by
                                               the matter in the
retort; but when the retort became red-hot, its neck became
covered, internally, with moisture, and      cubic inch or two
                                                     a

proportion in water.     After this, the water rose again into
the tube, and undulated for some time, up and down, with
a  strong vibratory motion.      Finally, three or four cubic
inches of gas were expelled,      far the greater part of which
                                        by
proved to be carbonic acid.
   On breaking the retort (which was done as soon as                           it
was cool) the lime was found to be converted into car
bonate of lime; being completely neutralized, and effer
vescing strongly with an acid.
     It   readily demonstrable, that the carbonic acid and

pense of the arsenic.    Some of the oxide       retained is  the         by

be attributed, therefore; to the admission of atmospheric
air.
   When   I    used common lime, which was very caustic,                        I
found the production of carbonic acid, apparently, much
more abundant.          From three ounces of this lime, and an
 equal weight    of white  arsenic,     procured 90 cubic inches
                                                I
 of carbonic acid, and the lime was likewise converted into
 carbonate of lime.
    Finally,   I have once used lime which had been exposed
 to so intense      aheat that the crucible was partly melted.
 This lime put into an acid did not emit the smallest bubble
 of gas. Heated, in close vessels, with its weight of white
 oxide of arsenic, some carbonic acid was produced               but        :
 the matter        the retort did not prove to be carbonate of

 lime; but another compound with the nature of which
I  am at present no further acquainted, than that          dissolves   it
 in muriatic acid without effervescence, and forms              cry-        a
 stallizable salt.

                                 To    Mr. Tilloch.
 Sir,    The  subject of stratification has lately been so ably
 treated in your valuable Magazine                      by
                                         Mr. John Farey, that
it  cannot fail to excite    very great interest among those;
                                       a
 interested     the success of geological and philosophical
               in
 pursuits.   With   patriotism truly laudable, Mr. Farey in
                             a
 vites his countrymen to the study of the subject at home;
   Vol.40. No. 171. July 1819.            D               as

  30              On certain Points     connected  with
  as sufficiently rich in   itself to afford ample compensation to
  the most unwearied investigation.          Iain induced to trouble
  you with this letter, in consequence of a call made on your
   readers by Mr. John Farey, in your Number for February,
   tor information on some particular points connected with
   the super-position of the strata, as well as from some re
  marks said to have been made on a similar subject by Mr.
   Robert Bakewell in your Number for March.
      Mr. Farey, lam afraid, must have mislaid his notes, made
   along with me in the Forest of Dean eighteen months ago,
   when I detailed to him the regular succession of the upper coal
   series from the upper red down to the yellow lime; at the
   same time offering to show him in several places the yellow
   limestone emerging from under its massy incumbent, as
   sociated in situations where the thickness of the covering
  stratum could have been nearly ascertained, or even sub
  jected to accurate measurement.          Mr. Farey however says,
   in page   103,  that he has  never   been  able, satisfactorily, to
   ascertain which was the incumbent measure or stratum to
   the yellow, or, as it has been termed by some since the
   able analysis of Mr. Smithson Tennant,             the magnesian
   lime.    In an arrangement I have made for my own use, I
   term it the second limestone, reckoning upwards and be
  ginning with the Derbyshire series.
      It may be proper to observe, that I conceive the super
   stratum to the yellow lime to be that which is denominated
   by Jameson the old red formation, and in my arrangement,
   the great red, in contradistinction particularly to the marly
   red, which surmounts the upper coal series.         The thickness
   of this stratum is variable. Where its immense buds are
   allowed without the intervention of faults or waves to stretch
   themselves out in regular succession, I have not estimated
   it at less than 1600 yards, and in some places, particularly
   from the high grounds to the south of Ross in Hereford
   shire to its termination or regular ending at Berristone Hill
   between Ross and Ledbury, not less than 2000 yards.
      This vast stratum is composed of alternations of parti
   coloured stone, in which the red colour predominates;
   breccia, regularly stratified clay, clay more friable and in a
   marly state.     The joints of the rocks afford gypsum.         The
   beds of clay, rock salt, or salt spriugs, as at Droitwich,
   Nantwich, &c. : the marl, sometimes stratified gypsum. It
   appears to me extremely probable, that the gypsum pits de
   scribed by Mr. Farey, page 104, had been worked in a lower
   bed of the great red, and immediately over the yellow lime.
   This, however, ought not to be admitted as proof, unless

          the Super-position    of the Strata of England.         Si
the fact were established by other circumstances, since the
whole of the great red, and frequently the third limestone
series above it, farms deep red soil, iu which gypsum is
frequently found.
  >, Ascending   the series, the great red may universally be
considered as the next stralum in the order ; and one of its
most distinguishing characters is the plum-pudding-stone,
Or breccia, which occupies a superior situation in the mass*
forming bold edges, and stretching into table land, where
the stratification has become more horizontal.              It is an
opinion not unfrequcntly advanced by geologists, that frag
ments of breccia are a certain indication of an approach to
a primitive country.        I should rather infer, that such frag
ments betokened an approach to the upper beds of the
great red.    What gives considerable strength to the former
opinion is the fact of the most mountainous districts, hi
therto considered primitive, being contained in the superfi
cies occupied by this grand boundary to our two great coal
series.     How different is the fact where elevation of surface
continues ! On these extensive plains of breccia, where
the measures      are fairlv extended, rests the third, or great
limestone series.     This is the limestone which underlays the
Staffordshire, Shropshire,         South Wales, and Forest of
Dean coals.      It is also the same as the Bristol limestone*
which is seen on the banks of the Avon, rising rapidly from
tinder the coal measures.           This rock is also various in its
thickness : in the Forest of Dean I estimate it at 200 yards,
and from the enlarged dimensions of its beds on the west
side of the great Welsh bason, its thickness must be from
250 to 300 yards.
     Immediately upon this rock rests from foftv to sixty yards
of what by manv would be termed alluvial sandstone. It
is easily distinguishable      from every other sandstone by its
fjure siliceous base.     It also contains from 15 to 20 yards of
breccia in solid stratified blocks, and several veins of the
same, in a more disintegrated state, which open and shut
in the same way as metallic veins.          How irreconcileable to
these facts are the opinions of those who determine the
class of the stratum, whether it be alluvfal or not, by the
absence or presence of a single pebble 1 These regularly
stratified beds of breccia, and veins of the same, rest under
more than 50 veins of coal, and nearly two perpendicular
miles of higher strata.      The upper bed of this peculiar sand
stone series partakes in some places of the nature of lime
stone, and abounds with vegetable impressions.            In Wales
it is called the Farewell Hock, because it terminates the coal
                                 D a                             and

59                On certain Points connected with
and iron stone measures,       reckoning downwards, in some
places,   as  in the Forest of Dean, the lowest coal is only se
parated from it by a few inches of clay.
    The measures which rest upon the third limestone I de
nominate the upper coal series: the boldest feature in djis
assemblage is a gray greenish micaceous sandstone, measur
ing in thickness fully 200 yards ; this forms uncommonly
bold high land, from Myrthr Tidvil to Caerphilly, along
a considerable extent of the South Wales coast, and in the
Forest of Dean, fine plains with rounded edges, from 7 to
 800 feet above the level of the sea.      In Wales it is called
the Gray Rocks, and the Pennard Rock in the neighbourhood
of Bristol.
     Between this and the Farewell Rock are contained the
iron-making coals aud ironstone of the South Wales Bason,
 the former of which, according to Mr. Martin, amounts
 to 95 feet of workable coal.        I have not seen any state
 ment, nor have I heard of any coal being worked in South
 Wales at any great height in this series above the Gra\
 Rock. Should this prove the case, the Forest of Dear
 supplies the void that would otherwise have been occasionec
 in the general section, as it contains from 3 to 400 yards o
 coal measures, occupying a higher range in the series, am
 immediately above the great Gray or Pennard Rock. Thes
 measures      are composed of twelve seams of coal, and ar
 surmounted by a considerable thickness of a straw- coloure
 sandstone, containing occasionally beds of red marl. Frot
 this circumstance, and from the absence of red groun
 upon the surface of the coal measures in the Forest of Dear
 and in South Wales, as far as I have seen, I am induct
 to think that this sandstone, containing the red marl, whe
  there is cover, is overlaid by the upper Somersetshire coal
  and these again, by cliffe or shale, on which rest the upp
 red, which 1 conceive to be a species of red calcareous ma
  Subject to this arrangement, we find that the upper series
  formed into three distinct divisions with red marl abw
  and the great red (from»under the third limestone below
  the whole thickness of which series may be estimated
   1200 yards.
     Having thus, according to my observation, supplied 1
  chasm complained of by my friend Mr. Farey, I shall shor

   I shall now beg leave to remark what is said to be stated
by Mr. R. Bakewell, in his Lectures ; namely, that the
Derbyshire fourth limestone is seen in Yorkshire, resting on
slate.    Could this fact be established, it would be interesting
in the extreme.        But when .this gentleman appeals to simi
lar instances in Shropshire and in Wales, I am afraid he re
fers to one of those numerous formations in the great red,
commonly denominated primitive. Examples of this sort are
to be found in the neighbourhood of Charnwood Forest,
Mount Sorrel, the Malvern hills, he. I agree with him as
to the fact of limestone covering slate, and this slate resting
upon granite; but I differ from him by assigning to the gra
nite a different place in the strata.     I am not yet satisfied
that the granite is the foundation of the series, but in many
cases only an accidental formation in the great red, some
times stratified and sometimes assuming the iorm of an ir-

   . regular crystallization : so that, in my estimation, the fourth
     Derbyshire limestone is not that which is generally found
     resting upon slate ; but more probably the yellow lime: this
     being the concomitant stratum to the great red, is fre
     quently subjected to those mighty derangements peculiar to
     this immense mass.       In proof of this I refer your readers
     to an examination of the country in this neighbourhood,
     from Flanly Abbey, where the yellow lime just emerges
     from under the great red, not as a regular ending or basset,
     but in consequence of a powerful lift or swell in the mea
     sures along Blassden and May Hills, passing behind Ne-
     went to the west, sometimes wheeling, sometimes advan
     cing, forming gentle helmet- topped hills covered with brush
     wood, till acquiring a more uniform and contiguous ridge,
     it makes directly to Ledbury, and subsequently the angle of
     its rise becoming much elevated it overlays the western side
     pf the Malvern hills to a considerable height.
         This limestone, as it is seen in the neighbourhood of Led
     bury and Malvern hills, ha3 been accurately described by
     Mr. Horner in the Geological Transactions.          That part of
     the limestone series which he denominates argillaceous slate,
     I  conceive to be an inferior sort of limestone, as there are
     few of the beds but what yield nodules of limestone.            In
     Kirkby in Derbyshire it wears exactly the same appearance
     when exposed to the weather. In some districts it is called
     mudstone, and is soluble in water, so as to make sinking
     through it difficult.     As a proof that the limestone now
¦»   described is the same with the yellow or magnesian, which
     forms the coping stratum of the Derbyshire and Yorkshire
     coal fields, I have to state the fact of the Derbyshire thick
     first coal having been worked many years ago, from under
     the crop of the yellow lime, near the town of Newent in
     Gloucestershire.      Appearances had been so favourable in
      the crop as to induce the proprietors about ten or twelve
     years ago to sink a shaft, between 80 and 90 yards deep, and
      put up a powerful engine.       This pit was sunk in the lower
      beds or mudstone of the yellow lime.        The coal was found
      six feet thick, but of an inferior quality ; the roof also, from
      the numerous joints in the mudstone, was so heavy as to
      break timber two feet in diameter. Before abandoning the
      work, those concerned had, by cutting a drift across the
      rising plane of ihe measures, ascertained the existence of
      the lower coals, which, upon comparing with the Derby
      shire section, I found exactly to correspond with the small
      coals found under the Greasly Sheanich and Allreton coals.
      This curious circumstance was further corroborated to me
                                                                      at

     inch    the time that the reductions of the latitude and
  longitude of the stations used in carrying on the trigono
  metrical survey of this country have been in part published,
  many gentlemen engaged in the pursuit of practical astro
  nomy have either made use of them in settling the position
  of their observatories, or have employed themselves in the
  verification of these results with a series of astronomical
  observations made at the different stations or objects that
  have been given in the survey.       Some of these verifications
  were attempted with sextants;         but as the sextant itself
  cannot be depended on generally, to an accuracy nearer
  than 20 or 30 seconds, this combined with the errors
  arising from the artificial horizon used with it render such
  observations, in deductions where an uncertainty of only a
  few seconds is to be looked for, of little or no value, even
  though a mean, from a great number of repetitions, should
  be taken.        The usual method which astronomers have
i adopted to determine the difference in latitude between two
  places, not very Jistanl from each other, has been by ob
  serving the zenith distances at the two places of a number
  of stars which pass near the zenith of each place; these,
  when properly reduced, give the difference of latitude be
  tween the two places, or the number of degrees in the con
  tained arc. The instruments generally employed in such
  operations have been those denoted by the name of Zenith
  Sectors, and they are the best instruments when well con
  structed     for this purpose, admitting of a more accurate
  measure, from being divided on an arc of a much larger
  radius than can be used in the construction of instruments
  for other astronnmcial observations.        The zenith sector in
  the Royal Observatory at Greenwich is divided upon an arc of
  twelve feet radius; its principal use there is for determining
   the error in collimation of the two mural quadrants ; and
   this has been done from a series of observations upon the
                                  D4                        meridional

same time both with the sector and quadrants.           The zenith
sector used by Lieut. -colonel Mudge in the trigonometrical
survey is divided on an arc of eight feet radius.               And
from the credited ability of the maker of this latter instru
ment, and the progressive state of improvement in the con
struction of astronomical instruments at the period it was.
finished, a much greater degree of cpnsislency might have
been expected, than what is found amongst the deduc
tions of the observations made with               it,
                                                 that have been        al
ready published.        The number of observations made at
each station, however, must tend to render the final result
almost free from error, and the amplitude of the celestial
arc as correct as perhaps         can be obtained.
                                  it                  The observa
tions made with this instrument for determining the length
of degree of the arc of the meridian have tended to show
     a
that the plumb-line with which the instrument was adjusted,
is  deflected from the perpendicular, from local attractions
upon the earth's surface, and that consequently the ob
served measure of the celestial arc contained between the
zenith of two places        isnot their true difference in latitude.
Over     asmall country like that of England, the difference of
latitudes of places may be determined with almost any de
gree of accuracy       by   trigonometrical survey
                            a                         and

 sumed that the general survey which has been carrying on
for several years past, under the direction of the Ordnance,
has not been deficient in this respect, as the persons to
 whom the operations have been intrusted are provided
 with the best instruments perhaps that from the state of
 modern improvements could have been contrived for the
 purpose.      Although 2enith sectors are undoubtedly the
 most accurate        instruments for determining zenith               di

A T the meeting on the 28th of March, Professor Jameson
read an account of a flcetz gypsum formation, which oc
curs on the banks of the White- adder, near Kelso. Like
wise of a beautiful flcetz quartz found in beds in the coal
districts of Fifeshire ; and of the occurrence of basalt,
amygdaloid, and trap-tuff, in a coal- formation, newer than
the old red sandstone, and its accompanying porphyry, but
probably older than the general mass of the rocks of the
newest flcetz-trap formation.  At the same meeting, Mr.
Leach read a description of the Pig of Orkney and Shet
land, which he inclined to consider a3 a distinct species.
 And the Secretary laid before the meeting a very full
 and interesting thermometrical Register and meteorological
Journal to Davis Straits and back again, kept by Mr. John
 Aitken, surgeon.
     At the meeting on the nth of April, Dr. Macknight
 read a mineralogical description of Tinto, a noted mountain
 in Lanarkshire.     It appears to be of flcetz formation ; pro
 bably resting on the grey wacke which pervades the whole
 mountainous districts in the south of Scotland.         Around
 the base is found conglomerate, containing rounded masses
 of grey-wacke, iron-clay, flinty-slate, splintery hornstone,
 quartz, felspar, mica, &c.     Where the rock becomes finer-
 grained,    it approaches  in some  places to grey-wacke, and
 in others to those portions of the old red sandstone forma
 tion which are conjectured to alternate with the newer
 members of the Transition series.        Over the conglomerate
  masses of claystone, greenstone       and greenstone passing
  into clinkstone and porphyry-slate successively appear,
  till we reach the summit, which, along with the whole of
  the upper part, is found to consist of compact felspar and
  felspar-porphyry.  The disposition of the rocks in this
  mountain is conformable to the idea of secondary deposi
  tion, by assuming a finer and more crystalline texture as
  they ascend ; and the occurrence of claystone and felspar
  in a position corresponding to what is observed on the
  Eildon Hills, the Pentlands, the Ochils, Papa Stour, Dun
   dee, and in other places, seems to favour the hypothesis
  of a particular overlying formation, in which these sub
   stances are prevailing ingredients, extending over a consi
   derable portion of the lower country of Scotland.

     In the bed of the Clyde, to the eastward of Tinto, amyg*
 daloid appears, having nodules of calcedony coated with
 green earth ; also calcspar, and portions of steatite.  To
 wards the north, the conglomerate forming the base of
 Tinto passes into the sandstone of which the whole in
 ferior districts of Lanarkshire are composed. It is to the
 waste of this rock that we owe the splendid scenery of
 Cora Linn, and the other celebrated falls of the Clyde,
 which exhibits in its course so many charms of nature,
 and may indeed be said to carry along with it beauty and
 fertility.
    At the same meeting, the Secretary communicated a very
 eurious Meteorological Journal kept by Governor Graham
 d,uring his residence in Hudson's Bay.
                KIRWANIAN SOCIETY OF DUBLIN.
    The proper business of the Society had been suspended
 in  the early part of the month, on account of the illness
 and death of the late Mr. Kirwan, whose relation to the
 Society was of so particular and interesting a nature.
    June 17. The reading of Mr. Donovan's paper was con
 tinued.    The next hypothesis which the author examined
 was that given in the Encyclopaedia Britannica, which pro
fesses to explain     the phenomena of electricity " from the
 known laws by which other fluids are observed to act upon
 one another."       It was first argued that the property of
 perfect   mobility,   although assumed, was nevertheless in
 compatible    with    the  hypothesis : and some observations
were made on the supposed identity of electricity, light,
and elementary fire. The principle which assumes the
pressure and equilibrium of the electric fluid was next ex
amined.      The causes of pressure and equilibria were con
sidered : it was shown, that in the hypothesis, the properties
necessary for producing these effects, far from being im
plied, are even denied to belong to the electric matter.
Some phenomena of the transit of electricity through
vacua, which the hypothesis professes to explain, were
shown to be not the less involved'in difficulty, from the
unsupported nature and insufficient application of this sup
posed pressure.      The evidence for the existence of vibra
tions was then questioned, and conceived to be invalid ; a
particular direction of them was argued to be inconceivable,
from the very definition offered of a vibration.     The dif

down in the hypothesis, was shown to exist in the mode

        for the phenomena of attraction and repulsion was

pressure between the cylinder and rubber, or of any reflec
tive power of the amalgam.         Concerning the charging of
the Leyden phial, it was observed that the vibrations in
which the charging depends, by counteracting, should de
stroy each other.     Some arguments against the opinion
that points do show the direction of the electric fluid, were
then adduced; and the reading concluded by showing that
notwithstanding the hypothesis disclaims the doctrine of
accumulation and diminution, yet that both states must be
inferred by legitimate deductions from the remaining prin
ciples of the hypothesis.

    Comets.  Two comets        were discovered in 1811, in the
South of France : they have been most minutely observed
and calculated by the astronomers of Paris.             The first,
which was announced without any person paying the
slightest attention to         it,
                            latterly excited much of the public
attention, from the instant of its acquiring        tail of several
                                                                 a
degrees in length.      The second has not as yet excited any
great sensation, nor           calculated to do so, because
                               is   it                            is            it it
not yet visible except with telescope, and because, as
                                         a                                      is

                   it
   The first was discovered at Viviers on the 26th of March
1811     by M. Flaugergues, corresponding member of the
Imperial Institute, who communited his first observations.
The comet was then very feeble in point of light, without
a   tail or any apparent nucleus.       This last circumstance
rendered      very difficult of observation.
              it                                  On the loth of
April, M. Burckhardt succeeded               seeingin    with the    it
searcher of his telescope, but in the telescope itself         was         it
invisible, because     magnified too much.
                          it                     We notice this
fact in order to spare some trouble to the curious in future,
numbers having flocked to the Imperial Observatory last
October, to see the comet in our large telescopes, when they
might have seen      more distinctly at home with the smallest
                        it
                                                                          glasses*

   asses. Obliged to have recourse to his colleagues, M.Burck-
SIarclt received   from M. Bouvard such observations as
the limited time would permit him to make.           As soon as
he had a sufficient number (this may be three, only provid
ing they are neither too near nor too distant from each
other) M. Burckhardt calculated the orbit.        The smallness
of the arc and the uncertainty of the observations rendered
this labour very troublesome.       Nevertheless this first ap
proximation was sufficient to announce that the comet
would soon disappear, because it proceeded to lose itself in
the rays of the sun, i.e. to rise and set almost at the same
time with the sun.      M. Burckhardt also announced that
the comet would re-appear about the middle of August;
that it would then be nearly at the same distance from the
earth, but twice as much nearer the sun, and that in this
way its light would be quadrupled: that on the 13th of
August it ought to rise an hour and a half before the sunj
that on the 1 5th of September, the day of the perihelion,
passage, it would be so near the sun as to set no longer)
that from this epoch it ought to augment in size and lustre
for about a month, because it would then approach the
earth ; that it would afterwards gradually become feeble^
but that we might follow it with glasses to the month of Ja
nuary, perhaps even a little longer : lastly, that the distance
of the comet from the earth would be alwavs considerably
greater than that from the earth to the sun. These pre
dictions, which were confirmed by the event, excited no
sensation because they came too soon.          M. Olbers, a di
stinguished astronomer, one of the deputies from Bremen,
at the baptism of the King of Rome, carried with him from
Paris the elements calculated by M. Burckhardt.         M. Ger-
gone of Nismes made use of them for constructing an
ephemerides of the course of the comet from February
 1811 to the end of March 1812.       This labour, which was
merely an object of curiosity, as long as the comet by its
brilliancy attracted all eves towards   it, becamea   matter of
utility when it  was necessary to use telescopes to view it.
   Astronomers nevertheless, after having determined so
long beforehand every thing which they thought pro
per for interesting the public, continued to observe the
comet in silence, and to compare their observations with
calculation, in order to rectify the trifling but inevitable
errors in the first attempt at finding an orbit.         M. de
Flaugergues, who first saw the comet, calculated all his ob
servations.    After having by himself determined the ele
ments of the orbit, he thought he discovered some resero*

blance with those of a comet observed in China 510 years
ago. This remark, if it could have been verified, would
give the true measurement of the revolution and of the
ellipsis of the comet ; but this knowledge is by its nature
very uncertain, when we have no other observations than
those of a single appearance.      M. de Flaugergues, on go
ing back to antiquity, found several comets, the appearances
of all which differed by 510 years ; and they would give a
high degree of probability to his conjecture, if the indica
tions of historians were not too vague to admit of the
orbit being calculated.     We have therefore nothing certain
as yet on this head.        Messrs. fiouvart, Gauss and Lin-
denau, who have also determined the orbit, think on the
contrary, that the period could not be less than 1000 or
 1500 years, and that it might be much more.        When we
have eight months observations we shall perhaps be in a
little less uncertainty on this subject j but even this is very
problematical.       The above comet after all that has been
 said of it had nothing in it more remarkable than any other
comet.      After having determined the route which it ought
to take, astronomers can only repeat what is printed in
every treatise of astronomy.        But they ought not to con
 fine themselves to this dry detal : we ought to have some
 dissertations on the physical constitution of the comet, on
 the nature and cause of that long tail, which in telescopes
 looks like a veil attached to a woman's head, and which is
 symmetrically unfolded on both sides in two opposite curves,
 at first distant, but which end by approaching and being
 melted into each other.      Astronomers in this respect are
 no further advanced than our ancestors.       The explanation
 which Newton gave of the tails of comets, accounts on 3
 large scale for the most remarkable phenomena, i. e. for the
 direction, which is always, with a slight variation in the
 prolongation of the line which unites the centres of the
 sun and of the comet, with a slight curvature which in
 clines it towards the place which the comet has quitted ;
 but it is difficult thereby to account for the inclination of
 the other branch in a contrary direction j and this pheno
 menon has been remarked by all astronomers.        Wherefore
 does this tail, or that atmosphere of which the tail is the
 prolongation, appear separated in every point from the
 head or nucleus ?
     This obscure interval, which has been remarked in a
 similar manner constantly, does not take place in all co
 mets; but it is not without example. Is the separation
 real ? Is it an optical illusion, and, if it does take place,
                                                          what

what can be the cause of it ? To these questions geome
tricians and astronomers will make no answers, because
they do not know any good one3, and because they neither
desire to give or to receive any other kind.      In the absence
of these solutions so desirable, recourse was had to the
foreign Journals for the calculations which were repre
sented as curious observations.      They gravely informed us
how many miles the comet travelled in a given time  vain
inquiry !  which an astronomer is sometimes teased into,
but to which he can never attach any real importance. The
comet, at the time of its greatest rapidity of motion, never
equalled that of Venus, far less that of Mercury. We see
Venus almost at all seasons; she approaches the Earth
much more closely than any comet ; no person ever asks
how many leagues she travels daily ; and no person even
took it into his head that she would fall upon the Earth.
It must be confessed, however, to the glory of the present
age, that these terrors are greatly diminished, and men of
strong minds have testified their displeasure at them.
    The second comet was discovered at Marseilles, on the
 1 6th of November,   by M. Pons, who had formerly been
the discoverer of seven or eight others. The director of
the Imperial Observatory of that cityj M. Blanpain, com
municated the discovery to us, at the same time transmit
ting the observations which he had made on the 1 7th, 1 8th,
and 19th of the same month. Its movement was daily about
 10' right ascension, against the order of the signs, and 33'
declination towards the north pole. It was then very feeble,
and very difficult to see at Paris: the bad weather also
frustrated the attempts of our astronomers, and they ex
perienced many obstacles in making some doubtful obser
vations.    M. Burckhardt however calculated the orbit; and
although   he considered it only as an awkward attempt, it
was found almost entirely similar to that which M. Gauss
determined from observations perhaps a little better, be
cause they were made in a climate more to the southward*
However this may be, the comet has already passed its peri
helion, and will soon disappear ; its smallest distance from the
Sun was as 8 to 5 of the distance from the Earth to theSum
In spite of this distance, which accounted for its dullness
and the slowness of its movement, if the weather had been
more favourable, it would have been easier to have ob
served it than the beautiful comet which we still see, be
cause its nucleus was more apparent and better defined.
We know that it does not resemble any of the 100 comets
whose orbits are known.

                      New Lunar Tables.
    The calculation of these two orbits, notwithstanding the
difficulties with which it was attended, was a mere recrea
 tion to M. Burckhardt, which did not hinder him from
putting the finishing stroke to the immense researches
which he had undertaken on the subject of the moon's mo
tions.    Six years have scarcely passed, since the Institute
and the Bureau des longitudes lavished their encomiums
on the tables of M. Burg, the Vienna astronomer.         These
tables, constructed on several millions of excellent observa
 tions, supported besides by the analytical inquiries of Count
Laplace, and augmented by several new equations, have
been generally adopted by astronomers, and nothing hitherto
has warranted the least suspicion of their accuracy.        M.
Burckhardt's first idea therefore was not precisely to make
 new tables, but of a form more convenient for calculators.
 Mayer had remarked, that he could diminish considerably
 the number of the equations and arguments, by employing
only the true place of the sun, and by correcting suc
cessively the arguments by the equations already calculated.
This form was attended with inconveniences, which induced
 M. Schulze of Berlin to re-model Mayer's tables in order
 to bring them to the mean arguments.            M. Carlini of
 Milan has recently announced that he has formed the pro
ject of a similar transformation for the tables of M. Burg.
M. Burckhardt first entertained this idea, and on this oc
 casion he wished to ascertain if there did not exist other
equations which deserved to be entered in the lunar tables.
 Formerly, when an astronomer undertook new tables for
 any planet, he commenced them de novo, and risked doing
 them less accurately than his predecessors.    By the method
now adopted, we are no longer exposed to these retrograde
 movements : the moderns seek for the corrections ot the
 tables most accredited, which they compare with observa
 tions : they equal the errors of these tables to a function
 which comprehends the corrections of the elements em
 ployed, and the new equations which they wish to intro
 duce-.   In this way they determine at once the slight cor
 rections of the elements already known, and the coefficients
 of the neglected equations.
    In this wav M. Burckhardt went to work : he began by
 giving to M. Burg's tables the new disposition which
 brought them to the mean arguments, and comparing them
 under this new form, not only with all the observations
 calculated by M. Burg, but also with thousands of more

recent observations, he met with several advantages in this
tedious process: namely, that of subjecting to a new ex
amination the coefficients so well discussed by M. Burg,
of extracting them directly from the observations, with the
changes which the mean arguments occasioned, of intro
ducing the new equations which the observations required
clearly ; and yet not to lengthen the calculations, since, if
on one hand it increased the number of the equations, on
the other it simplified the formation of the arguments}
which is an inestimable advantage, particularly for the cal
culators of ephemerides.
     After having finished this work, M. Burckhardt sub
jected his tables to a new proof, by comparing them with
 all the passages of the moon by the meridian which could
 be observed in the first ten months of 1811, either by him
 self at the Observatory of the Military School, or by M.
 Bouvard, at the Imperial Observatory.
     We cannot say more at present on the subject of these
 tables, for they have been but a very short time in our
 possession ; but every thing inclines us to think that they
 will be at least as precise, and above all more convenient
 even than those of M. Burg, and we trust that astronomers
 will be gratified by their immediate publication.

  We      are informed that Professor Barton has discovered
 the substance called Caoutchouc, in considerable quantity,

  Philadelphia, and in other parts of the United States.         He
  finds it in the berries of Smilax cuduca, and other species

  the infant berry,  in which it occurs as a mere viscid
  fluid, to its complete formation in the adult fruit, in
  which it shows itself in elastic plates, already formed.
     This, it is believed, is the first instance of the discovery

DESCRIPTION  OF THE ERUPTION OF SOUFFRIER MOUN
  TAIN, ON THURSDAY NIGHT, THE SOTHof APRIL, 1812,
  IN TUB ISLAND OF ST. VINCENT.
   The Souflrier Mountain, the most northerly of the lofty
chain running through the centre of this island and the
highest of the whole, as computed by the most accurate
survey that has yet been taken, had for some time past in
dicated much disquietude; and from the extraordinary fre
quency and violence of earthquakes, which are calculated to
have exceeded two hundred within the last year, portended
some great movement or eruption.            The apprehension,
however, was not so immediate as to restrain curiosity, or
to prevent repeated visits to the crater, which of late had
been more numerous than at any former period, even up
to Sunday last, the 26th of April ; when some gentlemen
ascended  it,  and remained there for some time.      Nothing
unusual was then remarked, or any external difference obr
served, except rather       stronger emission of smoke from
                             a

between 4 and 500 feet in depth : exactly in the centre of
 this capacious bowl rose a conical hill about 260 or 300
feet in height, and about 200 in diameter, richly covered
and variegated with shrubs, brushwood, and vines, above
half way up, and for the remainder powdered over with vir
gin sulphur to the top.      From the fissures in the cone and
interstices of the rocks a thin white smoke was constantly
emitted, occasionally tinged with a slight blueish dame.
The precipitous sides of this magnificent amphitheatre were
fringed with various evergreens and aromatic shrubs, flowers,
and many alpine plants.       On the north and south sides of
the base of the cone were two pieces of water, one perfectly
pure and tasteless, the other strongly impregnated with
sulphur and alum.        This lonelv and beautiful spot was
rendered   more enchanting by the singularly melodious
notes of a bird, an inhabitant of these upper solitudes, and
altogether unknown to the other parts of the Island : hence
principally called, or supposed to be, invisible; though it
certainly has been seen, and is a species of the merle.
    A century had now elapsed since the last convulsion of
the mountain, or since anv oilier elements had disturbed
the serenity of this wilderness than those which are common
to the tropical tempest.         It apparently slumbered in
primeval solitude and tranquillity, and from the luxuriant
vegetation and growth of the forest, wtuch covered its sides
from the base nearly to the summit, seemed to discoun
tenance the fact, and falsify the records of the ancient vol
cano.     Such was the majestic, peaceful Souffrier on April
the 27th ; but we trod on " ignem repositum cineri doloso,"
and our imaginary safety was soon to be confounded by
the sudden danger of devastation.        Just as the plantation
bells rang twelve at noon on Monday the 27th, an abrupt
and dreadful crash from the mountain, with a severe con
cussion of the earth, and tremulous noise in the air, alarmed
all around it. The resurrection or this fiery furnace was
proclaimed in a moment by a vast column of thick black
ropy smoke, like that of an immense glass-house, bursting
forth at once and mounting to the sicy; showering down
sand, with gritty calcined particles of earth and favilla
mixed, on allbelow.       This driven before the wind towards
Wallibon and Morne Ronde, darkened the air like a cata
ract of rain, and covered the ridges, woods, and cane-pieces
with light gray-coloured ashes, resembling snow when
slightly covered by dust. As the eruption increased, this
continual shower expanded, destroying every appearance
of vegetation. At night a very considerable degree of ig

    nil ion    was observed  on the lips of the crater; but it is not
    asseried     that there   was as yet any visible ascension of
    flame. The satne awful scene presented itself on Tues
    day, the fall of favilla and calcined pebbles still increasing',
    and the compact pitchy column from the crater rising per
    pendicularly to an immense height, with a noise at inter
    vals like the muttering of distant, thunder.      On Wednesday
    the 29th all these menacing svmptoms of horror and com
    bustion still gathered more thick and terrific for miles
    around the dismal and half-obscured mountain.           The pro-
-
    digious column shot up with quicker motion, dilating as it
    ro«e like a balloon.     The sun appeared in total eclipse, and
    shed a meridian twilight over us, that aggravated the wintry
    gloom of the scene now completely powdered over with
    iallmg particles.     It was evident that the crisis was as yet
    to come-«-ihat the burning fluid was struggling for a vent,
    and labouring to throw off the superincumbent strata and
    obstructions which suppressed the ignivomous              torrent.
    At night, it was manifest that it had greatly disengaged it
    self from us burthen, by the appearance of fire flashing now
    and then, flaking above the mouth of the crater.
        On Thursday, the memorable 30th of April, the reflection
    of the risin j; sun on this majestic bodv of curling vapour
    was sublime beyond imagination  any comparison of the
    Glaciers, of the Andes, or Cordilleras, with          it,can but
    feebly convey an idea of the fletcy whiteness and brilliancy

    day  a   ferruginous and sanguine appearance, with much
    livelier action in the ascent,   amore extensive dilatation, as if
    almost freed from every obstruction : after noon, the noise
    was incessant, and resemhled the approach of thunder still
    nearer and nearer, with      avibration that affected the feelings
    and hearing: as yet there was no convulsive motion, or sen
    sible earthquake       Terror and consternation now seized all
    beholders.     The Charraibs, settltd at Morne Ronde, at the
    foot of the Souffrier, abandoned their houses, with their
     live stock, and every thing they possessed, and fled preci
     pitately towards town.        The negroes became confused,
    forsook their work, looked up to the mountain, and, as          it
    shook, trembled, with the dread of what they could neither
    understand or describe  the birds fell to the ground, over
    powered with showers of favilla, unable to keep themselves
    on the wing  the cattle were starving for want of food, as
    not blade of grass or leaf was now to be found  the sea
        a                       a
    was much discoloured, but in no wise uncommonly agi-

tated ; and it is remarkable,     that throughout the whole of
 this violent disturbance of the earth it continued quite
 passive, and did not at any time sympathize with the agi
 tation of the land        About four o'clock P. M. the noise
 became more alarming, and just before sun-set the clouds
 reflected a bright copper-colour, suffused with fire. Scarcely
 had the day closed, when the flame burst at length pyrami
 dally from the crater through the mass of smoke; the roll
 ing of the thunder became more awful and deafening ;
 electric flashes quickly succeeded, attended with loud claps:
 and now, indeed, the hurlyburly began. Those only who
 have witnessed such a sight can form any idea of the mag
 nificence and variety of the lightning and electric flashes ;
 some forked zisizau playing across the perpendicular co
 lumn from the crater  others shooting upwards from the
 mouth like rockets of the most dazzling lustre  others like
 shells with their trailing fuses flying in different parabolas,
 with the most vivid scintillations from the dark sanguine
 column, which now seemed inflexible, and immoveable by
 the wind.      Shortly after 7 P.M. the mighty caldron was
 seen to simmer, and the ebullition of lava to break out on
the N.W. side.        This, immediately after boiling over the
 orifice and flowing a short way, was opposed by the ac
 clivity of a higher point of land, over which it was im
pelled by the immense tide of liquefied fire that drove it on,
forming the figure V in grand illumination. Sometimes,
when the ebullition slackened, or was insufficient to urge it
over the obstructing hill, it recoiled back, like a refluent
billow from the rock, and then again rushed forward im
pelled by fresh supplies, and scaling every obstacle, carry
ing rocks and woods together, in its course down the slope
of the mountain, until it precipitated itself down some vast
ravine, concealed from our sight by the intervening ridges
of Morne Ronde.        Vast globular bodies of fire were seen
projected    from  the  fiery furnace, and? bursting, fell back
into it,   or over it, on the surrounding bushes, which were
instantly set in flames. About four hours from the lava
boiling over the crater, it    reached the sea, as we could ob
serve from the reflection of the fire and the electric flashes
attending it About half-past one, another stream of lava
was seen descending to the eastward towards Rabacca. The
thundering noise of the mountain, and the vibration of
sound that had been so formidable hitherto, now mingled
in the sullen monotonous roar "of the rolling lava, became
go terrible, that dismay was almost turned into despair.
At this time the first earthquake was felt: this was followed
by   showers of cinders, that fell with the hissing noise of

              The late Phenomenon at Barbadoes.                     71
hail during two hours.      At three o'clock, a rolling on the
roots of the houses indicated a fall of stones, which soon
thickened, and at length descended in a rain of inter
mingled fire, that threatened     at once the fate of Pompeii
or Herculaneum.       The crackling and coruscations from
the crater at this period exceeded all that had yet passed.
The eves were struck with momentary blindness, and the
ears stunned with the glomeration of sounds.             People
sought shelter in cellars, under rocks, or any where,  for
every where was nearly the same ; and the miserable negroes
flying from their huts, were knocked down or wounded,
and many killed in the open air.       Several houses were set
on fire. The estates situated in the immediate vicinity
seemed doomed to destruction.         Had the stones that fell
been proportionally heavy to their size, not a living crea
ture could have escaped without death : these having un
dergone a thorough fusion, they were divested of their na
tural gravity, and fell almost as light as pumex, though in
some places as large as a man's head.        This dreadful rain
of stones and fire lasted upwards of an hour, and was again
succeeded    by cinders from three till nix o'clock in the
morning.       Earthquake followed earthquake almost mo
mentarily, or rather the whole of this part of the island was
in a state of continued oscillation ;  not agitated by shocks,
vertical or horizontal ; but undulated like water snaken in
a bowl.
   The break of day, if such it could be called, was truly
terrific.   Darkness was only visible at eight o'clock, and
the birth of May dawned like the day of judgement : a
chaotic gloom enveloped the mountain, and an impenetra
ble haze hung over the sea, with black sluggish clouds of
a sulphureous cast.      The whole island was covered with
favilla, cinders, scoria, and broken masse3 of volcanic mat
ter. It was not until the afternoon, the muttering noise of
the mountain sunk gradually into a solemn yet suspicious
silence. Such were the particulars of this sublime and
tremendous scene, from, commencement to catastrophe.

                               possible,

                              hasten
a most awful visitation of Providence which took place yes
terday in this neighbourhood,         and     believe generally
                                               I

72           The late Phenomenon at Barbadoes.
    '? Early in the morning,  as we imagined from its dark
ness,   my wife requested me to view the skv, which had a
very odd appearance.     Upon looking at mv watch, we were
very much surprised to find it was so late as half-past six
o'clock A. M. which neither of us could credit, until, on
comparing it with hers, they were found to agree.
    " In the north-east, in which the sun ought to have been
Been, as it had been up three-quarters of an hour, a very
large and dense cloud of ferruginous colour, and at no great
height above the surface, obscured the firmament, but in
such a manner that the trees and shrubs in the garden, and
the country to the north and east of our house, presented the
same lights and shadows as they usually do when the moon
is sometimes bright and sometimes dark in alternation.
    "  Another cloud, not quite so dense, of a dusky blue co
lour, and about the same height, hung over the edges of the
whole southern horizon, under which the sky appeared of a
silvery colour, from which issued a very shining light, by
which objects to the northward, when our backs were turned
to the light, were seen as distinctly, if not more so, as at
noon-day; while objects between us and the light were
scarcely perceptible.
   " Above these clouds, and in every other part of the sky
which was not occupied bv the ferruginous clouds, were
other clouds of a whitish gray colour, which were carried
over the islands with great velocity from the north-east, in
which direction the wind blew the whole dav with very little
variation; although under them there was not a leaf stirring,
or breath of air moving.
   " A solemn and unusual stillness pervaded every place,
now and then interrupted by the sound of negroes at work
with their hoes, which the surrounding silence seemed to
augment.
   " forcibly struck with all these appearances, I could not
help expressing to Mrs. D. my apprehensions that this island
was about to be visited with some dreadful commotion ; and
as our house was on the acclivity of a lull, about sixty feet
above the level of the works, at which our friends Mr. and
Mrs. H. resided, I thought it advisable we should join them ;
which we did without delay.
   " By the time we reached the works it was seven o'clock;
and as the darkness began to increase considerably, all the
negroes were recalled from the fields, and ordered to their
houses, where most of them went to bed with much indif
ference, considering the darkness only as an early night.
    " At half-past seven o'clock it was so dark that candles
                                                         were

                  The late Pheenomenon at Barladoes.                                19
were brought in.      At eight o'clock it was pitch dark in the
open air;     or, in other wonls, so ilark that we could not
perceive our hands when held up before our faces at two
feet distance.     No nighi at home in winter, when neither
the inoon nor a star is to be seen, was ever more sombre.
This darkness continued of the same intenseness until 25
minutes past twelve o'clock  that              is,
                                             for the space of four
hours and 25 minutes, at which         time  wc  perceived very                     in
distinctly the outlines of large and near objects. At half-
        twelve o'clock we distinguished them more correctly                          ;
        which period the light increased until between three
and four o'clock P. M. but was very obscure.
     " From the time at which got up the morning until
                                         I             in
we went to bed at home in the evening at eight o'clock
 there was    a constant fall from the clouds of        substance in
                                                                 a
 extremely fine tlakes, which when first gathered from our
 clothes had the appearance of the dust of wood-ashes            but            ;
 which, when suffered to accumulate, assumed the restm-
 blance of powdered rotten-stone, and possessed the same
 quality of cleaning brass.
     " In order to ascertain the quantity which had fallen,
 Mr. H. last night took up that which lay upon foot square,       a
 when    it  measured three pints, somewhat pressed into the
 measure, and weighed one pound and three-quarters.
     "i This morning another square foot, where the surface
 was hard and level, gave,        five-eighths and one half of an
                                   in
 inch in depth, three pints loosely filled up in measure, and
 one pound seven ounces and          half in weight.

  was considerably deeper.      But assuming the product of mv

    "  The fall of this  substance was least in the morning and
evening,    and    greatest  between  nine and twelve o'clock.
Diinng    this  last  period,  when  any of us went out into the
air, we perceived a smell similar to that which arises from
water thrown upon hot embers  but with no increase of
heat, to the best of my percepiion : on the contrary, ac
cording to my own sensations, it was rather colder during
the continuance of this phenomenon than in common.
    " I had unluckily left my thermometer behind me, and
did not get it until one o'clock P. M. at which time 1 hung
it in a gallery facing the south, and open to the air, when
it settled at 77$, and continued at that height until rive
o'clock in the afternoon, afier which I forgot to examine it.
    " All those who ventured out with lanterns during the
darkness reported they had heard strange noises and cries in
the air ; but as they also added, that these noises and cries
had followed them, and that objects had been seen or felt
flitting past them, it was no difficult matter to convince
most of them that these sounds arose from the birds and
bats, which the lights they carried with them had attracted.
Many animals, which had been loose at the commencement
of the darkness, found their way to the lig.hr s in the houses,
and remained at the house during the continuance of the
darkness.
    " Some land birds flew into the rooms where the windows
were open, and some few sea birds were known from their
cries to be hovering about the buildings.
    " After this dismal scene had continued some time, my
apprehensions were considerably lessened, by bringing to
my remembrance the account of the younger Plinv of the
eruption of Vesuvius ; and the fact mentioned to me by
yourself, of a substance similar in some degree to what has
fallen here, having been gathered off the sails of a ship, at
a great distance from any known land ; from whence I be
gan to hope, that as no cinders had made their app> arance,
the phaenomenon, which was alarming us, might be the ef
fect of some distant volcanic eruption, and not the fore
runner of any more dreadful visitation than thai which was
existing at the moment.
    " This idea has been strengthened by the following cir
cumstances :
    " About one o'clock in the morning Mr. H             and se
veral others on the plantation heard a very heavy and quick
firing, neither as minute guns from a ship in distress, not in
continuance as from ships engaged, but in peals at intervals,
 from (he southward.          The same firing wad heard so di
                                                         stinctly

              The late Phenomenon at Barladoes.               75
btinctly in town and its vicinity, but in a westerly or north
westerly direction, that it is said our Governor, who is also
commander of the forces in the leeward island, repaired
about two o'clock to the garrison, which was kept under arms
all the night, from a surmise that Admiral Sir Francis La-
forey, who had sailed to the northward the evening before
at sun-set with the Dragon and a tender only, had fallen in
with the enemy's fleet of four sail of the line and four fri
gates, which, by accounts from Madeira, are reported to
have passed that island.
    " As nothing has transpired this forenoon to countenance
either the supposition of an engagement, or of a ship hav
ing been lost last night off our coast, it is very possible, and
by no means improbable, that the noise in question may
have proceeded from a volcanic eruption, which, without
arty earthquake having been perceptible in this island, may
have produced those phenomena which I have attempted to
delineate.
    " During last night the weather has been rather calm than
otherwise; and this morning the appearance of the coun
try resembles the land in the neighbourhood of the river
Nith, near its entrance into the Solvvay frith, when it has
been overflown by a high tide?      Many shrubs and low trees
 with spreading branches have been split by the weight of the
 substance    which has fallen on them, and the sugar-canes
 are bent down to the ground.
    " On removing the substance from the surface, the grass
 continues as green at least as it was before, without any ap
pearance of being scorched.
    <c
        The thermometer this day, when placed in a room open
 to the air, but not exposed to the direct or reflected rays of
 the sun, has varied from 70 to 80, which is three degrees
higher than it was yesterday at the same hour of the day.
    " Being now relieved from the darkness and its conco
 mitant fears, we are beginning to distress ourselves about the
 effect which the fallen substance is likely to produce on the
 fertility of the land : to ascertain which with as little delay
 as possible, my father-in-law and I have this morning planted
 various seeds, useful and ornamental, in this substance
 singly, and also in it when combined with different propor
 tions of the soil ; trusting that the same good Providence,
 which has carried us in safety through the danger of yester
 day, may be pleased to render this visitation a blessing and
 not a curse to the island.

 this substance, I will send you by the first good opportunity

   June 21.  W.S.W.  S.W. Hard showers with fair in
tervals, in which confused cirrus, cumulostratus, &c. were
seen.    Fine evening^
   June 22.  S.W. Fair day; cumulostratus prevailed; in
the evening features of flimsy ill-formed cirrus, and cirro-
cumulus by night.
   June 23.  W.S.W. Fair day, with cumuli and cumulo-
strati petroid and mountainous; also some features of cir
rus, &C.
   June 24.  W.S.W.  N.W. Confused cirrus spread
about aloft ; cumuli lower, cumulostratus, and a slight
shower about noon ; many nimbi seen above, but no other
fell in rain hereabouts.
   June 25.  Much cloud of ragged cumulostratus, red
dened by the setting sun ; cumulostratus, Sec. and very cool ;
some rain had fallen during the night, but the day was fair,
with petroid cumuli, &c.
   June 26.  N.E. Rainy and windy morning; various

   78                 Meteorological    Observations
       June 29.  N.W. Clear morning ; cumuli, and some ill-
  defined cirri in the day; rainy appearances at night.
       June 30.  VV. Sky for the most part clouded, the sun
  only breaking out at times. Very cool and winterlike for
   the time of vear.
       July 1.  W. Cloudy and rainy by times, and very cold.
       July 2.  W. Cloudy, with Borne rain in the morning;
  the day became fine with rainy features of cumulus, cirrus, &c.
       July 3.  W.N.VV. Cloudy morning; fair day, with
  slight showers, and fine evening; the clouds were petroid
  cumuli and cumulostrali, with some cirrus, cirrocumulus,
  and cirrostrntus ; in the evening the cirrocumulics was lofty,
  flimsy, and semitransparent.
       July 4.  Clear early, then petroid cumuli, with fibrous
  and brushlike cirri above ; curnulostrahis also formed, and
  indeterminate features of a sort of cirrocumulus very large
 and irregular; clear evenirig, with some clouds ; wind S.
      July 5.  Clouds of mixed and indeterminate modifica
 tion, followed by scattered cirrus, cumulus, &c. ; wind
 S. and S.W.
      July 6.  N W. Flimsy masses of cloud early ; fair day,
 with fibrous cirri stretched along above cumuli.
      July 7 . W. Hot day; therm. 79°. Features of cirrus,
 cumulus, and cumulostratus ; the under surface of which
 had often a wavy appearance.          In the evening the loftv and
 spread    masses   of cloud   showed  a tendency lo cirrocumulus,
 with large nubecula, such as I have frequently noticed on
 warm evenings, but they were not very well defined. Some
 cirrocumuli were flocky and of smaller nubeculce.
      July 8  S.  S.E. Clear morning; the first clouds were
 flimsy; cirri passing to irregular cirrocumuli, afterwards
 cumuli and cumulontrnti ; very clear evening again, and fine
 yellow sunset. Thermometer in shade when highest 73°.
By night an obscuration of the stars' light occurred.
     July 9.  S.E.  E. Cloudy morning, clear day, with
 cumuli; fine clear evening, and yellow colour at sunset.
Therm. 73°; like yesterday.
     July 10.  Clear hot morning, with ea3t wind; sums
long and light inas»e3 of cloud showed a tendency to cirro-
cumulus, aticrward cumuli and cumuloslrati. The wind be
came north-east in the afternoon, got high, and blew over
clouds which obscured the sky.           1 observed that the cumuli
in the fine part of the day were hazy and ill-defined.
     July 1 1 .  Clear early, then clouded, and somewhat hazy ;
it cleared again, and various small cumuli prevailed ; wind
still N.E.

    July 12, N. Cumulostralus \n the morning, with nim-
bification, afterwards fair, cumuli and cumulostrati, with a
disposition above to cirrocumulus.         By 6unset the under
surface of a mass of a kind of cumulostralus refracted a rich
crimson light, from which hung golden dependent fringes ;
the sky beneath of a fine yellow ; clear and cool night.
    July 13. N.E. Clear early, then cumuli formed; small
and fleecy specks by degrees became larger; neighbouring
ones were lost, and the cumuli became large, but ill-defined ;
some higher masses of cirrostralus and cirrocumulus ill-
defined.
     July 14.  In the morning I saw cumulostrati below cir
rocumulus ; wind S. E.        In the afternoon a nimbus came
up from W.N.W., after which the wind blew from that
quarter; clear night.
     July 15.  Cumuli, with fibrous cirri higher up; they
ramified in various directions; those which appeared the
 lowest were more comoid, and some extended their fibres
in every direction ; air dry, and wind W.N.W. Towards
 evening the cirri became more confused, passed to cirro-
 cumulus, and in some places to cirrostratus, through which
 the moon appeared obscurely, and predicted rain; but the
 night became tolerably fair; wind westerly.
     July 16.  Clouds followed by small rain, which held up
 after noon, and the evening was fair ; wind S.
      July 17.  Wind S. and S. E. ; warm day; atmosphere
 rather misty, with clouds in different stations, and ill-de
  fined cumulostralus ; fleecy cumulus; and in the upper re
 gions a tendency to cirrocumulus; upper current of air by
  passing clouds from the north at 6\ p.m.
      July 18.  Fair hot day; cirrus continued forming aloft,
  of nimbiform appearance ; in the evening it approached to
  the nature of cirrostralus,      and exhibited itself in fine
  streaks, like the grain of polished wood, and in rows like
  the mackerel back feature well known by that name.          Cu
  muli occasionally thickening into almost cumulostralus
  also prevailed; some tendency also appeared to cirrocumulus.
  Wind westerly.                                            v
      July  19.  Cloudy    morning;   cumulostralus   beneath   a
  veil of cloud.    Showers in the evening.    W.
       July 20.  Showers; some of them accompanied by high
   wind and thunder; in the clear intervals confused and irre
  gular cirrus and cirrocumulus, with cumuli, scud, &c. Wind
  westerly.

                               [     81   ]
     XVI.    Description  of a new Thrashing Machine.         By
                    Richard Tawney, Esq.
                          To   Mr. Tilloch.
Sir,   It    having been     long thought in this part of the
kingdom     a desideratum   to   in/ne in a thrashing machine with
a small power the qualities of clean and good work ; the
following description, accompanied by a drawing of one
which a short time since I had made for my own use, and
which most effectually answers the purpose, will, perhaps,
be not unworthv a place in the Philosophical Magazine.
    I was induced to the attempt by observing that in every
machine in this neighbourhood, both fixed and portable,
a very    large portion of the power was lost by friction,
seldom less than half, and wished to try what could be ef
fected by a machine constructed with a view to reduce the
friction as much as possible.
    The drawing presents an elevation and section of a ma
chine to be worked by two men, with each a winch upon
the axis of a wheel (which, as they could not be well shown
in a geometrical view, are purposely omitted) turning by
a small rope a pulley fixed upon the axis of the drum.
    It will be seen that the w het! is hung upon friction rollers,
and it was my intention to have nut rollers to the drum axis
as well; but as these were found to enhance the price, and
thereby defeat the general utility of the plan, the latter
were omitted, and the friction kept down by making the
brasses and axis as perfect and as small as they well could
be with safety.
    It should be. mentioned that the drum, rollers, and plates,
are upon the principle of the machines made by a Mr.
Wilson, of Leicester, which for quantity and goodness of
work are the best of a great number that I have seen.            In
these machines, as will be observed in the section, the
feed rollers are placed horizontally,           and they are fed by
laying   the  corn  upon   a   board    inclining  to them from the
top. One roller is turned by a small strap from the drum
axis; and as the two are made to touch by a thin well
turned iron wheel or rlanch at each end, the other roller is
moved by friction.-i-Lest this should be thought strange
in a machine purposely made to avoid friction, it must be
remembered that, as the wheels are small, the points of con
tact are trifling, and that there are no other means- of ob
taining an equable motion so good.
    Voh40. No.      IJ2.  August 1812.                F         The

82              Description     of a new Tktashing Machine.
    The axis of the second roller is hung at each end upon a
 pivot, so that when the feed is too great the roller will
  open, and be brought back again by a weight suspended at
 the end of a small lever.
    The drum is made open, and the beaters fixed upon a
 ring at each end.
    My machine is greatly improved by giving the drum (as
 well as the large wheel) a              fly
                                         motion.      The rings are made
 thin and light of wood, and the beaters of bar iron.                    The
 more simple way perhaps would be to make the rings of
 cast iron, and throw the weight to the rim.
    The leading feature of Mr. Wilson's machine                           the  is
 situation of the parallel ribbed plates against which the
 corn      beaten or rubbed.
          is                         Compared with other machines,
 they may be said to be divided                one part
                                               :            fixed upon the
                                                             is
 levers which carry the feed rollers, the distance of which                         is
 regulated     by     screw through the lop of the frame;  the
                          a
 other    isfixed in the frame which carries the iron gratine,
 and with that the distance              is
                                          regulated         byscrew at each
                                                                 a
 corner.
     Itwill be seen that the straw after passing the first p!ate
 may take        different direction before it enters upon the se
                    a
 cond plate and grating, and to this circumstance                   think I         is
 to be attributed the machine's superior work.                   By placing
 the feed rollers so far from the ribbed plate, and beaters,
 the straw        not at all broken, but will admit of being tied
                    is
 up in boltings, as well as          ifthrashed
                                                    is by
                                                       the flail.
    The great wheel of this machine                    six feet six inches
 diameter  to avoid resistance from the air,                       but two
                                                                     it   is
inches        thickness, and the spokes arc made elliptical. To
               in
give  it   a     motion, fitty-six pounds of cast iron are added
                    fly
to the ends of the 3pokes, as described                      the elevation.
                                                             in
This weight           sufficient to lead the men on, so that the
                          is

                    is                              a certain number of
revolutions per minute, but to dissuade them from doing

considerably more in a good yielding year.

             3. On the Combinations       of Iron and Chlorine.
  As       there are two oxides of iron, so there are also two
  distinct combinations of this metal and chlorine.                  0n»
  may be directly formed bv the combustion of iron wire in
  chlorine gas; it is that volaiile compound described by Sir
  Humphry Davy in his last Bakerian Lecture, which con
  denses after sublimation in the form of small brilliant iri
  descent plates.        The other, I find, may be procured by
  heating to redness, in a glass tube with a very small orifne,
  the residue which is obtained by evaporating to dryness the
  green muriat of iron ; it is a fixed substance requiring a red
  heat for its fusion ; it is of a gravish but variegated colour,

84          An /ccount of some Experiments          on the
of a metallic splendour,  and of a lamellar texture.  As it
absorbs chlorine when heated in this gas, and becomes en
tirely converted into the volatile compound, and as the vo
latile compound may likewise be obtained by healing, in a
glass tube nearly closed, the residue from the evaporation
of the red muriat, it is evident that the fixed compound con
tains less chlorine than the volatile, and that the former,
consequently, may be called ferrane, and the latter ferranea.
    Ferrane dissolves in water, and forms the green muriat
of iron; but     the solution of the whole substance is not
complete.     There is always left a small and variable quan
tity of black oxide, which may be considered, on account
of its variability, in a state of mechanical mixture, rather
than of chemical union with the ferrane.
    Ferranea    is,
                  entirely soluble in water.   The solution          is
identical with the red muriat of iron.
   The analysis of both these compounds          easily effected
                                                    is
by means of nitrat of silver.
   Fifty grains of ferrane were put into water the insolu:
ble residue separated from the solution             by
                                                  decantation        ;
washed, dried, and heated to redness for          minute, pre

                                                   the magnet.
The solution entire, precipitated by nitrat of silver, afforded
102'5'grains of dried horn si'ver, which indicating 25"l 125
grains of chlorine, the proportion of iron, omitting the
3  grains of oxide, appears to be 21 6875.     And hence 100
of ferrane seem to consist of
                        33-43 chlorine

                                 of
         Zinc, Arsenic, Antimony, and Bismuth.
 I   have   attempted,      by   several methods,   to obtain    mora
                                                                 than

      Comlinations  of different Metals and Chlorine, &c,    83
than one combination of these different metals and chlorine,
but without success.
    I have procured a compound of manganese and chlorine,
by evaporating lo dryness the white muriat of this metal,
and heating to redness the residue in a glass tube, having
only a very small orifice.     Muriatic acid vapour was pro
duced, and a fixed compound remained, which required a
red heat for its fusion, and was not altered by the strongest
heat that could he given to it in the glass tube ; but was
rapidly decomposed when heated in an open vessel, muriatic
acid fumes being evolved, and oxide of manganese formed,
which was black or red, according to the intensity of the
heat applied.    The compound of manganese and chlorine
is a very beautiful substance, it is of great brilliancy, ge
nerally of a pure delicate light pink colour, and of a lamellar
texture consisting of broaJthin plates.
    There is not much difficulty in obtaining this compound
pure.     Iron, with which manganese is commonly con
taminated, may be separated by two or three repetitions of
the solution of the compound in water, the evaporation to
dryness of the clear filtered muriat, and fusion of the re
sidue procured by evaporation.         Indeed, I think this a
good general method for purifying manganese from iron.
One of the combinations of the latter metal and chlorine
being volatile, heat must separate it from the compound of
manganese.      And I have thus obtained it so free from iron,
that triple prussiat of potash added to its solution in water
gave merely a while precipitate without the slightest tint of
bine.
    This compound deliquesces when exposed to the atmo
sphere, and is converted     into the white muriat.   Like fer-
 rane, it affords a trifling residue when heated with water.
The residue is oxide of manganese, white at first, but soon
becoming red, and even black ; it varies in quantity, ac
 cording to tbe exclusion of qir in the formation of the
 combination.
    Fifty grains of the compound dissolved in water, with
 the exception of one grain ; this residue was separated by
 decantation of the fluid, washed, dried, and heated to red
 ness, it was in the state of black oxide.      The colourless
 solution was precipitated by nitrat of silver. The horn
 silver formed, when dried, was equal to 1 0S grains. Hence,
 omitting the one grain of mixed oxide, 100 of this com
 pound appear to consist of
                         54 chlorine
                         46 manganese

                              lead by muriatic acid, and it
was well washed, dried, and fused in a glass tube with a
small orifice. The strongest red heat that I could apply to
it, under these circumstances, did not occasion its sublima
tion.
   Fifty grains of   itthat had been fused were dissolved in
water.    This solution, heated with nitrat of silver, afforded
52-65 grains of dry horn silver.       Hence 100 ot horn lead
appear  to be composed     of
                         25" 78 chlorine

   This compound, when heated with water, affords           small          a
residue of oxide of zinc, which, as in the preceding                            in
stances, may be considered as          the state of mechanical
                                                in
mixture.
  In consequence of    its powerful attraction for water,                      it   is
a  very deliquescent substance    on this account
                                        j              neces         it   is

ception of one grain of oxide of zinc, which was separated
by decantation and dried and ignited, and its quantity as
certained to be as stated.     The solution precipitated                            by
nitrat of silver afforded 99 grains of dried horn sdver.
Hence, excluding the one grain of oxide, 100 of butter of

     A   compound    of   chlorine and arsenic                 has      been   long         >
known, bearing       the name      of     the    fuming liquor of arsenic.
It may be formed in several ways                ;     the combustion of
                                                     by

    arsenic and corrosive sublimate, or of arsenic and calomel,
   and by the distillation   of niuriat of arsenic with concen-
'
   trated sulphuric acid.     The old method by means of cor
   rosive sublimate appears best adapted for procuring it in a
   pure siate. About six parts of corrosive sublimate to one
   of arsenic are, I find, proper proportions.       The mixture
   of the two substances should be intimate, and the heat ap-.,.
   plied to the retort for the distillation of the fuming liquor,
   gentle.    When the liquor was not colourless at first, I have
   purified it by a second distillation.
      The fuming liquor of arsenic, it is well known, is de
   composed by water. The precipitate produced appears to
   be merely white oxide of arsenic; for, independent of other
   circumstances, it does not afford the fuming liquor when
   heated with strong sulphuric acid.
      The fuming liquor, when gently heated, dissolves phos
   phorus, but ii retains on cooling only a very small portion
   of this substance. The warm solution is not luminous in
   the dark.
      The fuming liquor also, when warm, readily dissolved
   sulphur; indeed sulphur fused in the liquor seems capable
   of combining or of mixing with it in all proportions ; but
   on cooling the greatest part of the sulphur is deposited, and
   assumes a fine crystalline appearance; the form of the
   crystals was apparently the octahedron.       This deposition
   seems to be merely sulphur with a little of the fuming
  liquor between the interstices of the crystals ; for the crystals
   bear washing, and become tasteless superficially, but re
  main still acid internally, where the water has not pene
   trated.
      ft likewise dissolves resin. That which was called rosin
  was    the subject of experiment.       The solution was of a
  blueish green colour ; but when gently heated it became
  brown, and remained so on cooling.        The portion of resin
  the fuming liquor is capable of taking up is very consider
  able; when the resin was added in excess, a viscid mixture
  was formed.       The resinous solution was decomposed by
  water, and the resin was separated apparently unaltered
  mixed with white arsenic.
      The fuming liquor is capable of combining with oil of
  turpentine and with olive oil.         When the mixture was
  made with either of these oils, there was a considerable
  elevation of temperature, and a homogeneous colourless
  fluid was in each instance obtained.
      In these and some other properties, the fuming liquor of
  arsenic is analogous to the fuming compounds of chlorine

having the power of dissolving sulphur, and phosphorus,
and resin, and of entering' into union with the fixed and
volatile oils.
    It is difficult to ascertain the proportion of the consti
tuent parts of this compound by the ordinary modes of
analysis. I have chosen therefore a synthetical method in
preference; and from repeated experiments I find that two
grains of arsenic require for complete conversion into the
fuming liquor, four cubic inches exactly of chlorine gas.
    The experiments were thus conducted : the arsenic in
one piece was put into a small glass retort having a stop
cock, the retort was exhausted, and a known volume of
chlorine gas was admitted from a graduated receiver by
means of other stop-cocks, and the absorption of chlorine,
after the entire conversion of the metal into the fuming
liquor, was considered as the proportion condensed by the
arsenic.
    Now, since 100 cubic inches of chlorine gas weigh just
7<5'5 grains, two grains of arsenic combine with 3*06 grains
of chlorine, the weight of four cubic inches of the gas.
 Hence 100 of the fuming liquor appear to consist of
                        60'48 chlorine
                        39*52   arsenic
                       100-00
    As   the  fuming liquor   gives the white oxide when decom
 posed    by   water, arsenicane    may be substituted for Us old
name.
    The butter of antimony          is  a well known substance.
That which I have examined            was obtained by heating  to
gether coruesive sublimate and antimony, or antimony and
calomel ; and was always purified by a second distillation
 at a low temperature.        The best proportion of corrosive
 sublimate and the metal for making the compound, 1 have
found to be 2§ parts of the former to one part of the latter.
    The butter of antimony, like arsenicane, is capable, when
 rendered fluid by heat, of dissolving resin and sulphur, and
 of combining with the fixed and volatile oils. It affects
 the oil of turpentine very like the liquor of Libavius ; the
 action is considerable, much heat is produced, and the oil
 is rendered brown.
    When the butter of antimony is decomposed by a suffi
 ciently large quantity of the hydrosulphuret of potash, that
 compounds formed which is commonly called the golden
 sulphur of antimony, and which when decomposed by heat
                                                            I have

       Comlinations     of different Metals and Chlorine, &c. 89
I  have found      to afford merely water and sulphuret           of anti
mony     *.
    To ascertain the proportion of antimony in the butter of
antimony 605 grains ot this substance colourless and cry
stallized, weighed in water, were heated in a solution of
hydrosulphuret of potash. The whole of the antimony
was dissolved, and the hydrosulphuret of potash being iu
excess, there was no precipitation on cooling.                  The solu
tion was decomposed by muriatic acid, and the golden
sulphur thus thrown down was collected on a filter, well
washed and dried ; healed slowly to redness in a glass tube,
steam in plenty was disengaged                with very slight traces of
sulphur, and sulphuret of antimony remained, which fused
into one mass weighed 45 grains.                  According to the ex
periments of Proust, which I have repeated with the same
result, sulphuret of antimony contains 74*1 per cent, of
 metal.      Hence 45 grains of sulphuret or the 60 5 of butter
of antimony, from which the sulphuret was procured, must
 contain 33*35 of metal; and considering the remainder
 27-15 of the 60-5 as the proportion of chlorine, 100 of the
 butter of antimony seem to consist of
                               39 58 chlorine
                               6042 antimony

 limate and calomel.            Two parts of corrosive sublimate to
 one part of metal, I have found good proportions for its
  preparation. There is some difficulty in procuring it pure and
  entirely free from the mercury revived ; this is most readily
  effected by keeping the butter of bismuth in fusion, at a
  temperature just below that at which mercury boils ; the
  mercury slowly subsides and collects in the bottom of the
     * These results
                      appear to me to demonstrate the truth of M. Proust's
  Opinion, that the golden sulphur is a hydrosulphurettcd oxide of antimony.
  From my experiments, the only difFerence of composition between kenne*
  mineral and the preceding compound seems to consist in the former con
  taining a smaller proportion of sulphuretted hydrogene than the latter ; for
  I have obtained by the decomposition of kermes mineral, by heat, a com.
  pound of sulphuret of antimony and protoxide, and I have converted kermes
  into the golden sulphur by means of water impregnated with sulphuretted
  hydrogene.
                                                                     vessel,

affords a pure or nearly pure butter of bismuth.    Thus pre
pared, it is of a grayish white colour, opake, uncrystallized,
and of a granular texture.     In a glass tube, with a very
small orifice, it bears a red heat without subliming.
   As a hydrosulphuret of bismuth is produced when the
butter of bismuth is heated with the hydrosulphuret of
potash, and as this hydrosulphuret, like that of antimony,
affords, when decomposed by heat, a sulphuret and water,
I have applied the same mode of analysis to this compound
as to the last.
   Fifty-five grains of butter of bismuth were decomposed
in a warm solution of hydrosulphuret of potash. The dark
brown hydrosulphuret of bismuth thus formed, and not
dissolved, was collected on a filter; the hydrosulphuretled
solution was decomposed by muriatic acid, the slight pre
cipitate of hydrosulphuret produced was added to the first
portion, and the whole was well washed, dried, and heated
to redness in a glass tube ; the sulphuret of bismuth thus
obtained, fused into one mass, weighed 44*7 grains.            I
had previously ascertained the proportion of metal in this
sulphuret, and found it to be 81*8 per cent. 44*7 grains
of sulphuret, or 55 grains of the butter, must therefore
contain 36*5 grains of bismuth; and hence, 100 of bis
muth appear to consist of
                     33-6 chlorine
                     66'4 bismuth
                   100 0
    The butter of bismuth may be called bismuthane.
    Among the preceding combinations of the metals          and
chlorine, there is a surprising difference in respect to vola
tility and fusibility. Iron and manganese, two difficultly
fusible metaJs, form with chlorine readily fusible com
pounds, and a combination of the former metal and chlorine
is even volatile ; the compounds of tin and chlorine, and of
chlorine and antimony, are very volatile substances, though
the metals themselves are fixed at very high temperatures ;
on the contrary, the combinations of chlorine with bismuth,
zinc, and lead, do not exceed in fusibility, indeed are not
quite so fusible as the metals themselves.     I can offer no
explanation  of   these phenomena.
    Another singularity attending the liquid fuming com
pounds of chlorine, such as the liquor of Libavius, the
fuming liquor of arsenic, and the oxymuriats of sulphur
and phosphorus,    is,  that they do not become solid at low
                                                 temperatures.

velocity, or deeper soundings are required, it will be neces
sary to bring the ship to, which must be attended with
much danger if in a gale, or in a convoy during foggy
weather  and with much loss of time to the trader, who
is running to procure a good market. These considerations
have been the cause of a neglect, that has cost this country
numbers of lives.        But in a military point of view, where
is the captain who would dare stop his ship in chase to
sound ? though on an unknown coast. Thus, under the
present system of soundings he has but the option of risk
ing his ship, or his reputation I
   To many persons, who hear so much talk of longitude
and improvements in navigation, it will he natural to sup
pose that the exact position of a ship is easily arid generally
known ; but such persons are probably strangers to an act
of parliament of the 14th of his present majesty's reign,
which holds out a reward of
  5000/. </'o

    Nor is it an uncommon thing to have an error of from
one to two hundred miles in a passage from America or
the West Indies.
    These considerations show how requisite it is to be able
 to take correct soundings at all times and in all weathers,
 under full sail or brought to ; in chase or chased  to be
able to employ any seaman, and not particular men, who
have required a long training to the business,  to be able
to repeat soundings often, w ithout impeding the progress
of the ship ; for it frequently happens, and in the East
 Indies particularly, that a ship is carried away by currents
from 40 to 100 miles, while the captain has perhaps no
other means of ascertaining or correcting the position of
the ship but by soundings.
    Having said thus much on the general question of
soundings, it will be necessary to describe the new sound
 ing machine, to point out the severe trials it has been put
 to, and final I v to show how far the invention has fulfilled
 the object for which it was invented.
    The inventor is Edward Massey of Newcastle, in Staf
 fordshire.   He was bred to the trade of clock- and watch
 maker under his father, and obtained two premiums from
 the Society of Arts, Manufactures,         and Commerce;      the

                             The machine consists of a ro
                          tator a formed of an air-tight
                          tube, with four vanes solidly
                          fixed to the tube, but inclined to

about two        feet long by means of the screw /, and by
means    of  a  prolongation of the brass plate at          j,   to which
a nut is screwed on the opposite side of the bar.                      This
prolongation acts as an axis or centre in the iron bar, to
enable the brass plate to move between two small cheeks
at /, the screw at / going through the two chteks and
plate at right angles with the surface of the plate, thus
allowing the plate to move between the cheeks for the
space of about an inch to obviate the eddy of the plate.
The line is fixed at m, and the lead is cast on to the bar
about an inch below j. The brass plate projects about six
inches, lest the rotator should be affected by the eddy of the
lead.
    When the machine reaches the ground, or is attempted
to be drawn up again, the rotator falls into the position be
low c, which prevents the rotary motion, but as an addi
tional security a locking plate d is acted upon by a bolt
which is fixed to and put in motion by the flirt piece
During the descent, the flirt piece is kept in an upright
position by the water, but ceases to be so when the ma
chine becomes stationary or is hauled up.
    Thus it appears that the whole of the apparatus, which
really indicates the soundings, is comprized in the space of
about one foot, that is to say, from the summit of the ro
 tator to the locking plate, without any dependance on the
 length of the line or rate of sailing.
     Such is the description of the machine.              No sooner was
 it completed, than it was judged to be of sufficient cor
 rectness to stand the test of the severest trials. Testimonies
 are frequently obtained on very light grounds ; but those
 obtained for this machine are of a very different stamp.
 Captain Malcolm, of the Royal Navy, having used Mr.
                    *
 Massey's log during his passage to and from the West
 Indies, recommended the sounding machine to the attention
 of Admiral Montagu, who commanded at Portsmouth.
 The admiral ordered " the masters of His Majesty's ships
 the Royal William and Resistance                to proceed off the Isle
 of Wight,      for  the  purpose     of  trying the correctness of the
 machine;" and the joint report of the masters in date 20th
 June 1606, was, that " sailing at the rate of 5^ or 6 knots
    
      Capt. Malcolm, in a letter of the 12th of May 1806, says, *' I used the
 Log Machine during my passage to and" from the West Indies, and found
 it gave the ship's run perfectly correct.    The captain had purchased it of
  Tape Whittle, of the merchant service, who had carried the log out from
 Liverpool to Newfoundland, from theuce made Cape St. Vincent, with an
 error only of /no milts, and then proceeded to Naples, where he sold it to
 Capt. Malcolm.

they got true soundings in 1 7 5 fathoms of water, when by
the hand-lead they could scarce get ground : the vessel was
hove to immediately, and they sounded by a correct hand-
lead and the machine, which agreed exactly.- This operation
was used several times, and not the smallest error found."
Three days after Capt. Hope, of the Espoir, reported to Ad
miral Montagu as follows : "Yesterday having a fresh breeze,
going at the rate of 8 knots, I obtained soundings frequently
from 30 to 33 fathoms, with 55 fathoms of line out, exactly
corresponding with the soundings laid down in the general
charts." It is to be observed that Captain Hope adds in
his letter to Mr. Massey, " at the same time the experiment
was made with the deep sea- lead, and found impracticable,
in consequence of the velocity witji which the sloop was
going through the water."
    These official certificates were so strong, that the Navy
Board judged it expedient to recommend that further ex
periments should be made on board the Channel fleet, then
under the command of the Earl St. Vincent.           His lordship
when transmitting the reports he had received to the Board
says,
        " I had intended to have made further trial of the
sounding machine under the inventor's immediate inspec
tion, in other of the detached squadrons from the fleet
under my command ; but the reports from Sir Charles Cot
ton are so satisfactory and decided, that unless you wish for
further information, I do not propose any longer to detain
that ingenious man from his family."            On the 8lh of
January 1807,     Sir  Charles Cotton writes:  "  I have the ho
nour to   inclose   for your lordships' information the several
reports   on   Mr.   Ed.  Massey's Patent Sounding Machine,
made to me by Captains Bedford (of the Prince of Wales),
Lukin (of the Mars), and Neve (of the San Joseph) ; from
all of which it appears to be an invention of great utility
in navigation."      The following extracts from the reports
of the above-mentioned captains must at once stamp the
value of the discovery.
    Capt. Bedford reports to Sir Charles, as follows:
    " In compliance with your directions, I have caused re
peated trials of Mr. Edward Massey's Sounding Machine,
and, as far as I have seen, the construction and principle
appear simple ; and I think it a discovery of the greatest
importance to navigation.       The depth of water is easily and
correctly   ascertained  (even if the ship be going six or seven
knots, in sixty fathoms water) by affixing a second lead,
and preventing the line from being checked; and should
you not succeed in gaining bottom, you always ascertain

    These testimonies induced the Navy»Board, in February
 180?, to order 500 machines for the use of the Royal Navy,
and about eighteen months after gave            further order for  a
 250 more*.      Thus was the machine introduced into the
 Roval Navy.
    Every thing now appeared to be settled, nor was any ob
jection to the iiew sounding machine ever hinted at, when
 Captains Hotham and Bedford discovered, that          soundings            if
beyond 80 fathoms were attempted, the air-tubes of the
 rotators were frequently flattened, and that few of the ro
 tators could withstand the pressure of 112 fathoms.
    No sooner was this unexpected failure made known to
 the inventor, than    was instantly remedied

   and brass disks were introduced into the interior of the
   tube as a support, and they have rendered it proof against
  any pressure to which the machine has hitherto been ex
   posed, as will be seen by the extracts from the following
  letters.
       1 . From Mr. Thomas Stokes,          master cf the fleet off
  Cadiz, May 31, 1810.           He says, " I have had the oppor
  tunity of trying one of the rotators in a calm, and sunk it
   180 fathoms, and it came up as perfect as when it was put
  in the water. I therefore congratulate you on having got
  over the only objection that seems at present to be against
  the sounding machine."
      2. From Mr. Alexander Lumsdale, master of the Cale
 donia, 120 guns, September 7, 1810, who writes: "The
  late improvement you have made in the rotator, has made
  it a very complete thing.        I have tried it in nearly 200 fa
  thoms without its receiving the least injury, and am of
 opinion the great utility of the sounding machine only re
 quires to be generally known, to make it more sought
 after."
      3'. From    Mr. John Tapper, master of the Clyde, July
 22, 1810, who says: " I have to acquaint you that I made
 frequent trials of your improved rotator in 200 fathoms
 with a lead of 14 lbs. attached to the proper lead* issued
 from the dock-yard in the manner Mr. Stokes requested,
 and found it equal to the pressure of the water with the
 above-mentioned depth and weight.              It came up in perfect
 good state, not a drop of water had penetrated through it.
 My opinion is that no alteration is necessary."
      He then proceeds on a subject that has not been men
 tioned in this Report, that is to say, Surveijing, and he con
 tinues thus: "The machine is altogether an excellent in
vention, and I found it of very great use to me in sounding
the river Tagus, where the water is deep, from 20 to 30
fathoms,         in a boat with sails set, I could get true sound
 ings in sailing to and fro, but with the common lead,                    I
 should luive been obliged to lower the sails, so as for the

or 40 fathoms above the machine, by which means the buoyancy of the line
Is compensated, with leu danger of the line breaking when the machine
it  hauled in.
                                                                    boat's

 enabled   me to sound the river in less than half the time,
 and with more accuracy."          But as this letter only relates to
 the survey of a river, it will be proper to add the following
 txtraci from a letter of Mr. Nalh. Denliam, master of the
 Daphne, October 10, 1909.            "Having been on a survey
 between the islands of Jersey and the rocks to the south
 ward called the Minquies, as also ranging round the island
 of Jersey, and along the French coast, &c. by order of
 Rear-admiral D'Auvergne, &c. I used your valuable ma
 chine for soundings while running on rhumb lines from
 one head laud to another on the opposite shore, such as
 from La Corberre Jersey, to the Isle of Brahatj from La
 Rocheport to Choseys ; from thence to Cape Frehel, &c. &c.
 by which means I was able to make a direct course, and
 get perpendicular soundings without heaving to, so essential
 to surveys, but saving also much time and trouble, &c."
    Thus has ihe progress of the sounding machine been
 followed through all its stages; a machine calculated to
 preserve the lives and properties of thousands, to give ease
 and comfort to those heroes who devote themselves to the
 defence    of their country.          May it prove a source of
 emolument to the inventor ! for, if his labours are to
 avert desolation from the families of Britons not only-
 in the present but in future ages, his own family can
 never be neglected by a liberal and grateful nation.
    The inventor has presented one of the machines to the
 Royal Institution, which is preserved in their repository by
order of a General Meeting.
 XIX.    On   the  Prtparations of Gold lately employed            me
    dicinally.    By A. S. Doportal, M.D. &c. and                  Th.
    Pellbtibr, Apothecary*.
After       having enjoyed some reputation as a medicine,
gold    had ceased to be administered to the patient, and
taken an opposite direction.         Lately, however, Dr. Chres-
tieii, of Montpellier, a physician of great reputation and
successful practice, has revived its use.              He has employed
it in siphvhtic and lymphatic affections, and chiefly in
Clark's mode. The preparations he uses are metallic gold
in a state of minute division, oxide of gold precipitated by
potash, the oxide precipitated by tin, and the triple muriate
                  * Am. dt  Claim, vol. lxxviii. p. 38.
                                    Gi                               of

100   Preparations    of Gold lately   employed   medicinally.
of gold   and soda.     These he considers as superior to mer
curials.     Some experiments by Mr. Vauquelin, on the
preparations of gold thus introduced into notice, have al
ready been given : but we shall now present our readers
with some remarks on the subject by the gentlemen above
mentioned, one of whom enjoyed the advantage of a per
sonal acquaintance with Dr. Chrestien at Montpellier.
   The first preparation of gold employed by this physician
was the metal in a state of minute division.           To obtain
this, he found an amalgam, by triturating leaf-gold with
seven times its weight of mercury in a marble mortar with
a glass pestle, and then expeliing the mercury by means of
a powerful lens in the height of summer, or dissolving it
out by pure nitric acid.
   The present writers recommend rather to precipitate a
solution of muriate of gold by a solution of sulphate of
iron at a minimum, filtering, and washing the precipitate
with water, acidulated by muriatic acid, in order to dis
solve out the oxide of iron mingled with the precipitated
gold.     When the gold is thoroughly dried, it is in the
form of a deep brown powder, though in the metallic
state; all metals losing their brilliancy by being minutely
divided.
   To prepare the oxide of gold precipitated by potash, they
direct one part of nitric acid at 40"' [sp.gr. 1-396] to be
mixed with four of muriatic acid at 12° [1-089] ; and cu
pelled gold to be heated with eight times its weight of this
menstruum in a matrass with a long, narrow neck, till it
boils gently.      When no more gold will dissolve at this
temperature,     the  solution is to be poured off, and evapo
rated to dryness in another matrass by a gentle fire.        The
residuum of this evaporation is to be dissolved in distilled
water, and filtered.
   The filtered solution is to be treated with potash, to se
parate from it the oxide of gold ; but in this there are great
difficulties, and the whole cannot be thrown down, with
out part of it being reduced to the metallic state.          The
cause of this is not known ; but the authors ascribe             it,
1. To the formation of     a  soluble triple muriate, which takes
place   when    the  potash is  poured into the solution of mu
riate of gold :    2. To the excess of acid always present in
this muriate  :   3. To the more or less caustic state of the
alkali employed   :   4. To the greater or less quantity of this
substance added to the muriate of gold.
   When   a   solution of caustic potash    is  poured into  asa-
                       »              -                   turated

      Preparations      of Gold lately employed medicinally.            101
turated solution       of gold by muriatic acid, a yellow precipi
 tate is formed      *, which, when collected on a filter, does
pot amount to more than 40 grs. of oxide from 72 grs. of
the metal in the solution.              The remaining liquid is of a
very deep colour, and contajns a triple muriate of gold and
potash.      A fresh quantity of the caustic alkali will cause
 no further precipitation, unless the liquid be kept several
hours in a gentle heat : but in this case, a new precipitate
will fall down, extremely bulky, and of a deeper colour
than the former, and apparently at a different degree of
oxidation.       Several weeks are necessary to complete the
precipitation; and even at last a certain portion of gold
 will remain, which must be thrown down by a slip of tin,
if we would lose nothing.
    If the solution of gold be very acid, there will be scarcely
any perceptible precipitation ; and this might be expected,
as the alkali finds a sufficient quantity of free acid, to form
piuriaie of potash enough for the production of the triple
salt.     Indeed, no precipitation at all ought to take place,
when the solution is extremely acid ; but here, experience
does not entirely agree with theory, for a very small quan
tity of oxide of gold is always produced.
    The causticity of the potash is of greiit importance; for
if the neutral carbonate be employed, no change will take
place without the assistance                of heat.     This, expelling a
considerable portion of carbonic acid gas, will a'ter the
colour of the solution from vellow to greenish.                    If it be
then filtered, traces of the purple oxide of gold will be
found ; and it will effervesce with acids, having it3 fine
golden colour restored.            A few drops added to a glass of
water will not colour it; but, if the water be acidulated,
the colour will inslamlv appear.               The same solution yields
by evaporation white, transparent, alkaline crystals, inter
spersed with black spots.             These crvstals dissolve in water
without colouring it ; and on filtering the solution it passes
transparent, leaving a little gold on the filter. The ad
dition of any acid, however, causes its colour to re-ap
        v     '
pear.
    What is      the chemical nature of the crystals obtained ?
Though this       was not minutely ascertained for want of time,
it appears      certain, that they were composed of carbonic
and muriatic       acid, potash, and gold ; but whether consti
tuting a quadruple salt, a triple, or two salts, one the
triple muriate of gold and potash, the other subcarbonate

of potash, tlie authors cannot say; nor could they fnrrq
 any judgement from the figure of the salt.
     It may not be amiss to observe, that, in an impure nitro»
 muriatic solution of gold, saturated carbonate of potash
will precipitate the copper, without throwing down the gold,
if no heat be employed.
    As too large a quantity of alkali, added to a solution of
muriate of gold, will cause a portion of the precipitated
oxide to be redissolved, it is necessary to add the alkali
cautiously, to boil the solution at every addition of alkali, and
to separate the precipitate by filtration, whenever a sensible
quantity appears.
    The precipitate must be washed but slightly, it being
partly soluble in water, as Mr. Vauquelin remarked; and
it must be dried in the shade and in a cool place, other
wise it will be a mixture of oxide and metallic uold.
    It may be known whe'her the oxide be pure, by treating
it with muriatic acid, which in this case will dissolve it
completely; but, if it be mixed vyith metallic gold, part
will remain undissolved.
    The oxide of gold precipitated by tin, which Dr. Chres-
tien also recommends, may be obtained either with metallic
tin, or with its solution.
    For the first, slips of tin well cleaned, are to be put into
an aqueous solution of muriate of gold.           These w ill soon
be covered with a layer of pulverulent matter, of a colour
more or less deep ; which will be renewed several times,
after being removed.       When this cease? to be re- produced,
the liquor is to he filtered, and the precipitate washed in
distilled water, dried in the shade, and powdered.          This    is.
the purple powder of Cassius.
    If the oxide of gold be precipitated by solution of tin,

tion, otherwise the product will vary both in its nature and
quantity.     A  uniform solution may always be obtained by
dissolving slips of tin     inmuriatic acid at 12° [1*089],       fil
tering, evaporating to the point of crystallization, dissolving
the crystals   in pure water, and filtering again.     Part of this,
solution should immediately be mixed with the liquid mu
riate of gold   ;  and the union of the two salts produces          a
precipitate, which should be increased          by
                                               adding fresh quan
tities of the muriate of tin, as long as any thing       isthrown

                                           is
and powdered.       The quantity obtained, appears to depend
on the quantity of water added to the solutions of gold and
tin. The more they are diluted, the more the tin thrown  is
                                                              down.

         Preparations  of Gold lately  employed medicinally.   103
down.       One drachm of gold, the solution of which was
mixed with ten quarts or' water, mixed with a very dilute
solution of tin, yielded five drachms and a half of a very
fine purple precipitate.
     It does not appear to be a matter of indifference which
of these two precipitations is used.           When metallic tin
is employed, the precipitate is brown; and the gold, if
not in the metallic state, is nearly approaching it.            On
the contrary, the precipitate produced by muriate of tin
at a minimum         of oxidation, is of a deep purple colour;
and, though it contains a little metallic gold, has much
more of the oxides of gold and of tin ; whence, it is ob
vious, the efficacy of the two preparations cannot be the
tame.
    The muriate of gold is so greedy of moisture, that it
 soon deliquesces : whence it can be employed only in the
 liquid staie ; and, as its great causticity renders even this
 difficult, Pr. Chrestien thought of uniting it with the mu
 riate of soda; thus producing a triple muriate, less deli
 quescent, aud less caustic.
     For this purpose, a solution of muriate of gold in di
stilled water, obtained as described above, is to be employed;
 and it is particularly important that this salt has not an
excess of acid.        Into this solution is to be poured an
 aqueous solution of pure decrepitated muriate of soda, so
 as to combine an equal quantity of the dry salt with the
 gold dissolved.      The two solutions being mixed, the fluid
 is to be evaporated by a gentle heat in a glass capsule,
 taking care to stir it well toward the end of the process.
 When the mass is sufficiently dry, it is to be powdered
 while hot in a giass or stone mortar; and the powder is to
 be kept from moisture, which it attracts in a slight degree.
      In this preparation the management of the fire is of great
 importance : for, if the desiccation of the salt be not carried
far enough, it will contain too much acid ; and, if it be
 urged too far, it will be in part decomposed, and mixed
 with a little gold.
     The enlightened physician who extols the use of these
 preparations, employs them externally and internally ; but
 recommends them to be mixed with other substances, lest
 their action should be too violent, if given alone. Thus
 for a long time he did not give the triple muriate of gold
 and soda, otherwise than mixed with twice its weight of a
 powder composed of starch, charcoal, and the lake used by
 painters.     As the alumine of the last, however, might take
  up   a portion of the muriatic acid, and the charcoal might

revive the gold, Dr. Chrestien changed this powder for
liquorice root, orris root, &c.
     Beside this, he joined the compounds of gold with ex
tracts of the attenuant plants; sugar, with which he forms
lozenges ; syrups, in which he dissolves them, &c.                  He
mixes them also with Galen's cerate, when he wishes to
promote suppuration; and with lard, when he would em
ploy them in frictions on the soles of the feet, after the
 method of Cyrillo.
     The writers of the present article do not approve of the
combination of the preparations of gold with these dif
ferent substances, as all vegetable and animal substances,
dissolved or not, revive gold from its acid solution.             They
recommend them to be given alone, or dissolved in di
 stilled water: or, act least, if they must be mixed, to mix
 them as short a time as possible before they are used.
      In this way Dr. Duportal asserts that he has found
 good effects front them in siphylitic complaints.                In 4
 chancre corroding one of the corpora cavernosa               he found
 them of real advantage : but the most striking instance of
 their efficacy was in a cancerous ulcere that had destroyed
 the upper lip, attacked the soft parts of the nose and left
 cheek, destroyed the square bones        [os  ca>res\, and rendered
 the maxillary bone     carious.    Being   called  to consultation
                                                     a
 with    Dr.  Payen  on  this very  serious  case, in   which all the
 common       methods    had   been   tried  in  vain,  Dr. Duportal
 hoped to oppose the progress        of   the disease    by  the use of
 Dr.    Chrestien's  medicine,    assisted  by    attenuant extracts.
 In consequence, the patient was directed daily to rub into
  the gums the triple muriate of gold and soda          ;   and to take
  oxide of gold precipitated      by   potash,   with  pills composed
  of the extracts of white henbane, hemlock, and sharp-
  pointed toad-flax.      The ulcer was daily washed with Sy
  denham's liquid laudanum, sprinkled over with powder of
  red bark and camphor, and dressed with            a     digestive, in
  which, oxide of gold was mixed.            Under this treatment,
  which has been continued two months, gradually increas
  ing the dose of the substances, the ulcer has assumed          a  pro
  mising appearance; the carious points have disappeared;
  the suppuration furnishes laudable pus in moderate quan
  tity; the patient daily improves in flesh and strength and     ;
  there is   every reason to believe that this evident meliora
   tion will continue.     That  it    cannot be ascribed to the
  means employed in conjunction with the preparations of
  gold is evident, for they had been used previous to these,
   Without effect.

      XX. Mr, Hume's        Remarks on his Test for Arsenic.
                          To Mr. Tillock.
{Sir,    The   great importance of a sure method to delect
arsenic, whether the question be considered judicially or
chemically, induces me once more to address you upon
this subject, particularly as the test, originally discovered
by myself, is now clearly demonstrated to surpass all others
in precision and efficacy ; for, such is its power that, by
proper management, it will prove the existence of white
arsenic, even if dissolved in more than four hundred thou-
tand times its weight of water, when, probably, in such a
rare state of dilution, this dreadful body ceases to be a di
rect poison.
     In my letter to you, inserted in the xxxiiid volume of
your excellent Magazine, and in two other letters published
afterwards in the " Medical and Physical Journal," dated
 May and October 1810, 1 have, in general terms, described
 the best process for discovering the arsenic to be, that of
 combining it with silver.       To effect this, I advised that the
 arsenic should be nearly saturated with any alkali; and
 that nitrate of silver, the common lunarcaustic, should then
 be applied to the surface of the solution in which the poi
 son' is suspected to exist ;  if a bright yellow colour appear
 on presenting the nitrate of silver, we may conclude with
 out reserve, that some of this poison is in the mixture un
                                '
  der examination.
      By the three letters just quoted, it will be seen that this
  plan is not confined to any particular alkali, as the sole use
  of such addition is merely to neutralize the arsenic, so that
  the nitrate, or indeed any other salt of silver, may be more
 feadily decomposed, and beyond this point the quantity of
  alkali should not pass.'
      But, lest any one disapprove of this scheme, urging the
  difficulty of assigning the quantity of alkali requisite for the
  point of saturation, I shall give, in the present communica
   tion, another prescription, which has so completely suc
  ceeded with me that, I presume, it must now supersede all
   other tests for arsenic, and become the standard to future
   operators. The name which I shall beg to offer for this test
   \s,ammoniaco-nitrate of silver ; and though the proportion of
   the water to the other ingredients is of little consequence,
   till the liquor when finished will always be sufficiently
   uniform, and quite free from any imperfection whatever,
   provided the articles themselves be pure.

  tion of ammonia till a precipitate is formed. Continue to
  add the ammonia, now and then shaking the bottle, till the
  precipitate shall be taken up and the solution again become
  transparent, or nearly so, as the ammonia need noi be in
  great excess, if in any ; for, solution of ammonia being
  lighter than water, the superfluous portion would remain oq
  the surface of any fluid to which this test-liquor may be
  applied,  a circumstance not noticed by other analysts.
     Here we have one simple liquid, which, if kept in a
  phial with a gla-s stopper, will not easily spoil, and may
 be always at hand.      Its application is also equally simple ;
  for nothing more is required than to dip a piece of glass
  into this liquor, and apply it to the solution containing ar
 senic.     Should the material suspected to contain arsenic
 be of a dry nature, such as a mixture of sugar, meal, bread,
 meat, or any other kind of food, let some boiling water be
 poured upon the suspected substance, and filtrate the solution
 through paper.      The strip of glass may be procured at any
 glazier's shop; but, if not at hand, a few drops of the. test
 From the phial may be put in, as there is here not so much
 uncertainty from an excess of alkali, nor even of the test*
 liquor itself.
     In the 2d volume of Medico-chirurgical Transactions,"
 there is a " Case of Recovery from Arsenic," by Dr. Roget,
 in which my test of silver was employed with great advan
 tage. The whole chemical part of this paper is, however, de-
 Scribed     in such a way, that whoever reads the " case"
 would readily believe       that Dr. Marcel, and not I, had
 originally projected this most delicate test ; especially when
my pretensions are so pointedly censured and slurred over
by Dr. R. who has indted condescended to quote, though
not accurately, my letter to you.
     Jn that paper Dr. Roget has ushered in my own process for
detecting arsenic with ammonia and nitrate of silver ; but this
is described as altogether a new test, to which no reader
would suppose I had the least claim. On the present occasion
I shall make but few remarks upon the injustice done me by
this gentleman's publication; but it is evident that my own
observations upon the test by means of silver, are placed in
the Medico-chirurgical      Transactions as original matter; as
well as the remarks I made on some of the peculiar and
reciprocal habitudes of white oxide of arsenic, the arsenical
acid, and nitrate pf silver, which are all derived from the
                                                            three

                    of which has been
three letters, only one                            quoted by Dr. R.
Many of my expressions and even words              have been warped
from iheir proper authority without a fair acknowledgement
of   the source; I need mention but one instance here, and
that is, where I have pointed out the difference between
the arseriite and arseniate of silver j the first, as a beautiful
yellow ; the second, as a precipitate of a red-brick colour.
    These gentlemen seem to have taken the same quantity
of ammonia as well as of the solution of silver in every
case; for they used apparently the same glass-rods to de
tect the tenth as for the Jijty thousandth part, of a grain of
arsenic.    The diameters of these rods were, we must be
lieve, always alike, as no caution on this score was ob
served by Dr. Marcet, to whom the chemical part is chiefly
ascribed ; therefore, unless the two solutions be propor
tioned to each other in point of strength and dilution, the
application of the test in the way Dr.      fi.
                                             has recommended,
must be fortuitous    if  not erroneous, otherwise the caution
given, (p. 157,) that " the quantity of either ammonia or
nitrate of silver employed, can scarcely be too small,"                    is
quite insignificant.
    Why two glass-rods were employed when one must ne
cessarily have two ends,   I  cannot explain     nor can
                                                   ;        con1
ceive whv      glass-rod should be used for the ammonia, and
               a
a  clean glass rod for the solution of silver:  such niceties
are surely unnecessary to the success of the experiment                    ;
I  would rather have inculcated more attention to be paid
to the solution of silver, which should always be prepared
                                                                                '

solved    for this circumstance
           ;                        of great moment
                                   is                     in

    Having brought my test to such perfection,          itproper

          in
enabled to apply its powers with the same success.
    The first solution, with which      Imade the experimc nts,
was prepared in this way.       One grain       weight of white
                                                  by

                                 a
boil, when. the oxide          became entirely dissolved.        As the
 vessel with its contents had been previously weighed, any
 deficiency by the operation of boiling was easily remedied,
 by adding to the fluid, when cold, more distilled water to
 complete the 5000 grains, being thp original weight of the
solution.
    Fifty grains of this solution, containing ,TT,n pf a grain
 of arsenic, were further diluted with 500 grains of distilled
water, and to this the test-liquor was applied bv means of
a small strip of glass.          Another 50 grains of the solution
 was treated in the same way with 1000 ;  a third with
 1500, and so on, progressively, in the same ratio, until I
bad arrived at 5000 grains of the distilled water.              At this
point I deemed it but fair to stop, being perfectly             assuretj
of the efficacy of the test in any case that can possibly re
quire its aid, since the proportion of the arsenic to the
water was in the last experiment as about one to 500,000,
a degree of nicety to which I had never expected to attain,
    J must observe, that, in proportion to the degree of di
lution more or less time should be allowed for the effect to
become perceptible; for, in the last experiment the test did!
not act till some minutes had elapsed, and then the fluid
became slightly tinged without losing its transparency,
appearing more like very dilute white wine and water.                  In,
the course of some hours, perhaps IS, an evident dark-
coloured precipitate had assembled at the bottom,                 asure
indication of the presence of arsenic; for all these precipi
tates, even the beautiful yellow, lose their first colour and
become dark vetting aside all hopes of our converting
                ;
them into pigments.
  I   prefer cylindrical glass vessels to watch-glasses for such
experiments     ; and where very minute portions of arsenic
are to be made manifest              by
                                    these means,   it   is prudent to
place a  similar   vessel,  filled with   distilled water, near  to the
first, so that      by
                     contrasting    the  contents   of these two   ves
sels the slightest change will be more conspicuous.

    Animal Fluids.            By   William     Thomas Brande, Esq.
    F.R.S. Communicated to the Society for                   the Improve-
    ment of Animal Chemistry, and by them                     to the Royal
    Society*.
                                 SECTION I.
                                  Introduction.
In    the   following pages T shall have the honour of laving
before     this  Society an account of some experiments upon
the   blood,    which     were originally undertaken with a view to
ascertain    the  nature      of its colouring matter. The difficulties
attendant      on   the    analysis of animal substances have ren
dered some of the results less decisive than I could have
wished, but I trust that the general conclusions to which
they lead, will be deemed of sufficient importance to occupy
the time of this body.
    The existence of iron in the blood was first noticed by
Menghini t» and its peculiar red colour has been more re
cently attributed to a combination of that metal with phos
phoric acid, by MM. Fourcroy and Vauquelin %.                           The
very slight     discoloration       occasioned   by  the addition   of   in
fusion    of  galls   to  a  solution   of the  colouring   matter,   under
circumstances most favourable to the action of that delicate
test of iron, first led me to doubt the inferences of thqse
able chemists, and subsequent experiments upon the corji*
binations to which they allude, tended to confirm my
suspicion, and induced me to give up no inconsiderable
portion of the time which has elapsed since the last meet
ing of this Society, to the present investigation.
    An examination of the chyle and of lymph, in order to
compare their composition with that of the blood, formed
an important part of this inquiry, especially as those fluids

 110                  Chemical Researches on t!w Blood,
 have not hitherto been submitted to any accurate analysis?
 on account of the difficulty of procuring them in sufficient
 quantities, and in a stale of purity.     Whilst engaged in
 assisting Mr. Home  in  his physiological researches, several
 opportunities occurred of collecting the contents of the
 thoracic duct under various circumstances, and in different
 animals; on other occasions Mr. Brodie has kindly fur
 nished me with the rhaterials for experiment.
                              SECTION         IT.
                       On the Composition     of Chyle.
  The contents of the thoracic duct                  are suhject to much
variation. About four hours after                   an animal   has taken
 food, provided digestion has not been interrupted, the fluid
 in the duct may be regarded as pure chyle; it is seen en-
 tering.by the lacteals in considerable abundance, and is of
 an uniform whiteness throughout.      At longer periods after
 a meal, the quantity of chvle begins to diminish, the ap
 pearance of the fluid in the duct is similar to that of milk
and water ; and lastly, where the animal has fasted for
twenty-four hours or longer, the thoracic duct contains a
transparent fluid which is pure lymph.
   A. The chyle has the following properties.
    1. When collected without any admixture of blood, it
is an opake fluid of a perfectly white colour, without smelly
and having a slightly salt taste, accompanied by a degree of
sweetness.
  2. The colour     of litmus is not affected by       nor that of
                                                           it,
paper 'stained  with turmeric, but      slowly changes the blue
                                         it
 colour of infusion of violets to green.
    3. Its specific gravity      somewhat greater than that of
                                    is
 water, but less than that of blojd; this, however,           pro     is
bably liable to much variation.
   4. In about ten minutes after          it removed from the
                                                is
duct,   itassumes the appearance of         stiff jelly* which in
                                               a
the course of twenty-four hours gradually separates into
two parts, producing       firm and contracted coagulum, sur
                            a
rounded      by   transparent colourless fluid.
                  a                                  These spon
taneous changes, which         have observed in every instance
                                I
where the chyle was examined at             proper period after
                                               a
taking food, are very similar to the coagulation of the blood
and its subsequent    separation into serum and crassameu-
lum ;   they are also retarded and accelerated                   by
                                                           similar
means.
   B. 1. The coagulated portion bears        nearer resemblance
                                                    a
to the caseous part of milk than to the brine of the blood.

                                                                           It

   ''9. It is rapidly dissolved by the caustic and subcarbo^
nated    alkalies.    With solutions of potash and soda, it
forms pale brown compounds, from which, when recent, a
little ammonia is evolved.        In liquid ammonia the solu
tion is of a reddish hue.
     3. The action of the acids upon these different com
pounds is attended with nearly similar phenomena, a sub
stance being separated intermediate in its properties between
fat and albumen.       Nitric acid added in excess redissolves
this precipitate in the cold, and sulphuric, muriatic, and
acetic acids when boiled upon it for a short time.
     4. Neither alcohol nor ether exerts any action upon the
coagulum of chyle ; but of the precipitate from its alkaline
solution they dissolve a small portion, which has the pro
perties of spermaceti : the remainder is coagulated albumen.
     5. Sulphuric acid verv readily dissolves this coagulum,
even when diluted with its weight of water; and with the
assistance of heal, it is soluble in a mixture of one part by
weight of acid, with four of water; hut when the propor
tion of water is increased to six parts, the dilute acid exert*
no action upon it.       I was surprised to find that the alkalies
produced no precipitation in these sulphuric solutions when
heat had been employed in their formation, and where a
small proportion only of the coagulum had been dissolved,
and was therefore led to examine more particularly the
changes which the coagulum had undergone by the action
of the acid.
     On evaporating a solution of one drachm of the coagu
lum in two ounces of dilute sulphuric acid (consisting of
one part by weight of acid with three of water) down to
one ounce, a small quantity of carbonaceous matter sepa
 rated, and the solution had the following properties.
     It was transparent, and of a pale brown colour.
     Neither the caustic nor carbonated alkalies produced in
it any precipitation, when added to exact saturation of the
acid, or in excess.
     Infusion of galls, and other solutions containing tannin,
rendered the acid solution turbid, and produced a more
copious precipitation in that which had heen neutralized by
 the addition of alkalies.
     When evaporated to dryness, carbonaceous matter was
deposited, and sulphurous acid evolved, with the other usual
 products of these decompositions.
     6. On digesting the coagulum in dilute nitric acid, con
sisting of one part by weight of the acid to fifteen of water,
it was speedily rendered of a deep brown colour, but no
                                                             other

  1 12           Cliemical Researches on the Blood,
 other apparent change was produced for some weeks ; when
 On removing it from the acid at the end of that period, it
 had acquired the properties of that modification of fat
 which    is described   by Fourcroy       under the name   of adepo-
 cire*.
     A mixture of one part of nitric acid with three of water,
 acted more rapidly upon the coagulum of chyle; a portion
 of it was dissolved, and when the acid was carefully de
 canted from the remainder, it was found to possess the
 properties of gelatine.          But when heat was applied, or
 when a stronger acid was employed, the action became
 more violent, nitrogen and nitric oxide gas were evolved,
 and a portion of carbonic acid and of oxalic acid were pro
 duced.
     7. Muriatic acid in it3 undiluted state does not dissolve
 the coagulum of chyle; but when mixed with an equal
quantity of water, or even more largely diluted, it dissolves
it with facility, forming a straw-coloured solution, which
is rendered turbid when the alkalies are added to exact sa
turation, but no precipitate falls, nor can any be collected
by filtration.      When either acid or alkali is in excess in
 this solution, it remains transparent.
     8. Acetic acid dissolves a small portion of the coagulum
of chyle, when boiled upon it for some hours. As the so
lution cools, it deposits white flakes, which have the pro
perties of coagulated albumen.
     9. The action of oxalic acid is nearly similar /to that of
the acetic, but neither citric nor tartaric acid exert any
action upon this coagulum.
     10. The destructive distillation of this substance affords
water slightly impregnated with carbonate of ammonia, a
small quantity of thin fetid oil and carbonic acid and car-
buretted hydrogen gas.
    The coal which remains in the retort is of difficult in
cineration ; it contains a considerable portion of muriat of
soda and of phosphat of lime, and yields very slight traces
of iron.
    C. 1. The serous part of the chyle becomes slightly tur
bid when heated, and deposits flakes of albumen.
    2. If after the separation of this substance the fluid be
evaporated     to half its original bulk, at a temperature not
exceeding     200°    Fahrenheit ; small crystals separate oii
cooling,    which,   as far as I have been able to ascertain, bear
a strong resemblance to sugar of milk : they require for so-

the flame of a spirit lamp, fused, exhaled an odour similar
to that of sugar of milk, and burnt away without leaving
the smallest perceptible residuum.

   The fluid found in the thoracic duct of animals that have
been kept for twenty- four hours without food, is perfectly
transparent and colourless, and seems to differ in no re
spect from that which is contained in the lymphatic-ves
sels.    It may therefore be regarded as pure lymph.
    It has the    following properties   t  :
    1.  It is miscible in every proportion with water.
   2. It produces no change in vegetable colours.
   3. It is neither coagulated by heat, nor acids, nor alco
hol, but    is generally rendered slightly turbid by the last re
agent.
   4. When evaporated to dryness, the residuum is very
small in quantity, and slightly affects the colour of violet
paper, changing it to green.

I could not discover in it the slightest indications of iron.

Society *.
    When the lymph was submitted to the electrical action
of a battery consisting of twenty pairs of four-inch plates
of copper and zinc, there was an evolution of alkaline mat
ter at the negative surface, and portions of coagulated al
bumen were separated.              As far as the small quantities on
which I operated enabled me to ascertain, muriatic acid
 only was evolved at the positive surface.

    Some Remarks on the            Analysis of the Serum of Blood.
    This fluid     has been so frequently and fully examined by
 chemists,     that  1 shall not enter into a detailed account of
 its composition, but merely state such circumstances re
 specting it as relate particularly to the present inquiry, and
 have not hitherto been noticed by the experimentalists to
 whom I have alluded.
    The fluid which ooze9 from serum that has been coagu
 lated by heat, and which by physiologists                  is termed se-
 rosity,   is  usually regarded      as  consisting    of   gelatine, with
 some uncombined soda, and minute portions of saline sub
 stances, such as muriate of soda and of potash, and phos
 phate of lime, and of ammonia.              Dr. Bostock regards it as
 mucus f.
     From some experiments which I made upon the' serum
 of blood, on a former occasion, I was induced to regard the
 serosity as a compound of albumen with excess of alkali,
  and to consider the coagulation of the serum analogous to
 that of the white of egg, and of the other varieties of liquid
  albumen.
     To ascertain this point, and to discover whether gelatine
  exists in the serum, I instituted the following experiments.
     Two fluid ounces of pure serum were heated in a water
  bath until perfectly coagulated: the coagulum, cut into
  pieces, was digested for some hours in four fluid ounces of
  distilled water, which was afterwards separated by means
  of a filter.
     The clear liquor reddened turmeric paper, and afforded a
  copious precipitation on the addition of infusion of galls,
  and when evaporated to half an ounce it gelatinized on
  cooling.      It was rendered very slightly turbid by the addi-

tion   of dilute sulphuric anil muriatic acid; but alcohol  pro
duced    no effect.
    From the result of these trials, it might have been con
cluded that gelatine was taken up by the water ; hut as an
alkaline solution of albumen forms an imperfect jelly when
duly concentrated, and as albumen and gelatine are both
precipitated by tannin, I was inclined to put little reliance
on the appearances just described, until I had examined the
solution by the more accurate method of electrical decom
position.
    Upon placing it in      the Voltaic circuit my suspicions
were justified,    by the rapid coagulation which took place
in contact     with the negative wire.   I therefore made some
other experiments in order to corroborate this result.
    One fluid ounce of pure serum was dissolved in three of
distilled water : the conductors from a battery of thirty
pairs of four-inch plates were immersed in this solution at
a distance of two inches from each other; the electrization
 was continued during three hours and a half, the solid al
bumen being occasionally removed : at the end of that
period, no further coagulation took place, and a mere de
composition of the water was going on.
    Having ascertained in previous researches, that gelatine
 is not altered during the electrical decomposition of its so
 lution carried on as just described, my object in this ex
 periment was, to ascertain whether any gelatine remained
 after the complete separation of the albumen had been ef
 fected.     I accordingly examined the water from which the
 coagulated albumen had been removed, and found that it
 was not altered by infusion of galls, nor did it afford any
 gelatine when evaporated to dryness.
    Two fluid ounces of dilute muriatic acid were added to
 one of serum. The mixture immediately assumed a gela
 tinous appearance ; it was heated, and a more perfect co
 agulation of the albumen took place; the liquid part was
 separated by a filter.    No effect was produced upon it by
 Voltaic electricity, nor did infusion of galls occasion any
 precipitation.
    I repeated the first experiment with the addition of twenty
 drops of a solution of isinglass to the serum. The liquid
  which now separated, after the albumen had been entirely
  coagulated by the action of electricity, was copiously pre
 cipitated by infusion of galls.
     It may be inferred from these experiments, that gelatine
 does not exist in the serum of the blood, and that the se-
 rosity consists of albumen in combination with a large pro-
                                H 2                      portion

portion of alkali, which modifies ihe action of the re-agents
commonly employed, but which is readily separated by-
electrical decomposition.
   To ascertain whether iron exists in the serum of the
blood, one pint was evaporated to dryness in a crucible,
and gradually reduced to a coal, which was incinerated and
digested in muriatic acid, to which a few drops of nitric
aci dwere added ; some particles of charcoal remained un
dissolved ; the solution        was    saturated  with ammonia,
which afforded a copious precipitation of phosphate of Kme,
accompanied with slight traces only of oxide of iron.
                           SECTIOxN       V.
      Some Experiments       vpon the Coagulum of Blood.
   Mr. Hatchett's valuable      researches on the chemical con
stitution of the varieties of coagulated albumen, have
shown that that substance varies but little in its properties,
whether obtained from the cras6amentum of the blood, or
from washed muscular libre, or other sources; but that
the proportion of earthy and saline matter is different in
the different varieties*.
   It will also be remarked, on referring to the dissertation
which I have just quoted, that the ashes obtained by in
cinerating the coal left after the destructive distillation of
albumen, did not contain any appreciable proportion of iron.
   Assuming the existence of iron in the colouring matter
of the blood, I made the following experiments upon the
crassamentum of that fluid.
   Two pints of blood were collected in separate vessels.
The one portion was allowed to coagulate spontaneously ;
the other was stirred for half an hour with a piece of wood,
so as to collect the coa^uhini, but to diffuse the principal
part of the colouring matter through the serum.              These
two portions of coamiluin were now dried in a water-bath,
and equal weights of each reduced in a platina crucible to
the state of coal, which afterwards W'as incinerated.          The
ashes were digested in dilute nitro-muriatic         acid, and the
solution saturated with liquid ammonia, in order to preci
pitate the phosphate of lime as well as any iron which
might have been present.
   The precipitates were collected, dried, and treated with
dilute acetic acid, by which they were almost entirely dis
solved, some very minute traces only of red oxide of iron
remaining, tbg quantity of which was similar in both cases,
and so small as nearly to have escaped observation.

    It is reasonable to infer, if the colouring matter df
the blood were constituted by iron in any state of com
bination, that a larger relative proportion of that nieial
would have been discoverable in the former than in the
latter coagulum ; but frequent repetitions- of these experi
ments have shown that this is not the case, and the following
result appears to complete the evidence on this subject.
    The colouring matter of a pint of blood was diffused by
agitation through the scrum, from which it was allowed
gradually to subside, the coagulum having been removed :
atter twenty-four hours, the clear serum was decanted off,
and the remainder, containing the colouring matter, alter
having been evaporated to dryness, was incinerated, and
the ash examined as in* former experiments.                        But the
traces of iron were here as indistinct as in the other in
stances above mentioned, al t hough a considerable quantity
of the colouring matter had been employed.
    The minutia? of analysis I have purposely excluded, as
leading into details which would exceed the proper limits
of this paper, and unnecessary in the present investigation.
I shall now merely dwell on the principal results which
have been obtained, and on the general conclusions which
 these afford.

 XXII. An      Attempt to determine the relative Quantities               of
     the constituent Parts of artificial Carbonate of Lime.              By
     M. J. Berzeltus.
 Bucholz        found that several fossil carbonates oflime, as
 calcareous spar, chalk, &c. contained 5fH parts of lime, 43
 parts carbonic acid, half part water *.              Bui Klaproth says,
 that both the natural and artificial carbonates of lime con
 sist of 45 parts carbonic acid and 55 parts limef, from
 which the latter in several of his analyses calculates the
 quantity oflime in calcareous carbonates.
    Though I had no reason to question the correctness of
 Bucholz's account, it occurred to me that the artificial car
 bonate of lime (of which he had not communicated anv se
 parate examination) might possibly approximate the state
 ment of Klaproth ; and as it was requisite that I should
 know this to a certainty, for the sake of several other ana
 lytical experiments, I determined to investigate the com«
 position of this compound with the utmost exactness.

118              On artificial Carlonate    of Lime-
    I precipitated a muriatic  solution of pure carbonate of lime
with a very pure neutral      alkaline    carbonate. The deposit
was voluminous, and took place without effervescence: but
having stood for a lew minutes on a warm place, a strong
disengagement of carbonic acid ensued, and the precipitated
carbonate of lime fell to the bottom in a pondtrous powder,
leaving the fluid clear. It therefore appeared that the cal
careous earth in the moment of precipitation was capable
of attracting more carbonic acid than it could afterwards
retain, at the common temperature of the atmosphere.           The
precipitate, placed on a filter, was washed as long »s the
percolated liquor appeared to be acted upon by a solution
of silver,' and was dried at a heat ex feeding 4- 100°, but
which nevertheless did not scorch the paper.
    1. Five grammes of this carbonate of lime were poured
by small portions into a glass phial containing nitric acid,
the weight of which was previously well ascertained. The
phial during the solution was kept in a slanting position,
so that nothing could be thrown out by the effervescence.
After a complete dissolution, ihe mass was gently shook in
the phial for a few minutes, to favour the evolution of such
carbonic acid gas as might possibly remain in the fluid.
The mass had lost 2' 18 grains, which, when deducted from
5 grains, give 43*6 per cent, carbonic acid.
    2. Five grains of the same carbonate of lime were ignited
in a covered plat ma crucible in a small furnace for two
hours, by which the mass had lost only l-53 grains, or
30-6 per cent.      When afterwards dissolved in nitric acid,
it further lost 0'65 grains, or precisely as much as in the
preceding experiment.
    3. Displeased with the less favourable result of the latter
attempt, I weighed an ignited Hessian crucible, and put in
 5 grains of the s;une carbonate of lime.          Covered with a
close fitting crucible, it was ignited in a furnace for one
hour, and was found to have lost 1*7 grains, or 37 per cent,
of the weight of the mass.          It was then exposed for one
 hour   to  the strongest    heat   that could be produced in an
air furnace, and had on cooling Inst 2' .8 grains, or exactly
as in the previous instances.          The remaining 2-6C grains
of lime earth correspond to 56*4 per cent, of the weight
 of the carbonate of lime.      I slacked it with water, whereby
 jt heated much and fell asunder, but dissolved thereafter
 in nitric acid, almost in a moment, without any discover
 able sign of hissing, and without any loss of weight.
     Bucholz had found 43 per cent, acid and           \ per cent,
 water. Did then this { per       cent,  escape in my experiment

(three times repeated) evaporated in the carbonic acid eas ?
or, in Bucholz's case, might not a small portion of carbonic
acid gas have remained in the liquor ? As Bucholz is one
of our most accurate chemists, and therefore I suspected a
mistake in my own experiment :
    To ascertain the point, I dissolved in nitric acid in a
weighed apparatus 5 grains of white marble coarsely
bruised.    The gas was conducted through a glass tube, also
weighed, and filled with dry muriate of lime kept cold by
snow placed around it. The pieces of marble were dis
solved in two hours.      The tube had gained so trifling an
addition of weight, that I have great reason to believe that
the increase was derived from a particle of water that had
spurted into it during the dissolution.           The total loss
was 2-! 82 grains. The carbonic acid gas had thus departed
without any hygrometric or evaporated water; for it did
not deposit any in the muriate of lime.          But it might be
objected that when the globules of gas are surrounded by
the new formed salt and the acid, which strongly retain the
water, then all evaporation is prevented.          I therefore re
peated the experiment with the acid diluted bv double its
weight of water, and dissolved 5 grains of marble (herein.
The tube now gained during the passage of the gas 0 05
grain, and the vessel lost 2-175 grains; which, deducting
the 0-05, leaves 2-125.       I weighed the glass immediately
on taking it up, and then shook it gently for a few minutes,
during which it again lost 0-062 ; so that its total loss be
came 2-lb7, that is 0*007 more than in the foregoing trials.
It did not lose any further weight in seven hours, slightly
covered with paper in - 5° temperature.         This experiment
shows, that when the nitric acid is too much diluted, the
accuracy of the result may be affected in two ways ; partly
by water evaporating along with the gas, and increasing its
weight, and partly by a portion of the gas remaining dis
solved in the diluted fluid, and carrying with it a further
 portion of water in its escape.
    I conclude from these experiments, that carbonate of
 lime, as well the natural as the artificial, consists of 5(5-4
of lime, and 43-6 of carbonic acid, and that it does not hold
any water of crystallization.

The                                       London, August  '-'0, 1412.
        attention of the philosophical world has been lately
attracted by the most singular phaeivomenon         in the history
                               H4                                  of

 of the human mind that perhaps ever existed.              It is the
 case  of a child, under eight years of ape, who, 'without any
previous knowledge of the common rules of arithmetic, or
 even   of  the use and power of the Arabic numerals, and
 without    having given any particular attention to the sub
ject, possesses (as if by intuition) the singular faculty of
 solving a great variety of arithmetical questions by the mere
 operation of the mind, and without the usual assistance of
 any visible symbol or contrivance.
    The name of this child is Zerah Colburn, who was born,
 at Caiut (a town lying at the head of Onion river, in Ver
 mont, in the United States of America,) on the 1st of Sep
 tember 1&04.       About two years ago (August 1 8 10) al
 though at that time not six years of age, he first began to
 show those wonderful powers of calculation which have
 since so much attracted the attention and excited the asto
nishment of every person who has witnessed his extraor
 dinary abilities.     The discovery was made bv accident.
 His father, who had not given him any other instruction
than such as was to be obtained at a small school established
in that unfrequented and remote part of the country, (and
which did not include either writing or cyplieiing,) was
much surprised one day to hear him repeating the products
of several numbers. Struck with amazement at the cir
cumstance, he proposed a variety of arithmetical questions
to him, all of which the child solved with remarkable fa
cility and correctness. The news of this injanl prodigy
soon circulated through the neighbourhood ; and many per
sons came from distant parts to witness so singular a cir
cumstance.      The father, encouraged by the unanimous
opinion of all who came to see him, was induced to un
dertake, with this child, the tour of the United States.
They were everv where received with the most flattering
expressions; and in the several towns which they visited,
various plans were suggested to educate and bring up the
child, free from all expense to his lamily.         Yielding, how
ever, to the pressing solicitations of his friends, and urged
bv the most respectable and powerful recommendations, as
well as bv a view to his son's more complete education, the
father has brought the child to this country, where they
arrived on the 12th of May last: and the inhabitants of
this metropolis have for these last three months had an
opportunity of seeing and examining this wonderful phe
nomenon *, and of verifying the reports that have been cir*
culated respecting him.

      Many    persons of the first eminence for their knowledge
ia     mathematics,    and well known for their philosophical
inquiries,     have  made  a point of seeing and conversing with
him ; and they have all been struck with astonishment at
his extraordinary powers.          It is correctly true, as staled of
him, that " He will not only determine, with the greatest
 "    facility and dispatch, the exact number ot minvtes or se-
 " conds in anv given period of time ; but will also solve any
" other question of a similar kind. He will tell the exact
     product arising from the multiplication        of any number,

 "    number consisting of the like number of figures. Or,
 w any number, consisting of six or seven places of figures,

 '*
      singular faculty consequently extends not onlv to the
 <!
      raising of powers, but also to the extraction of the square
 " and cube roots of the number proposed ; and likewise to
 "    the means of determining whether it be a prime number
 " (or a number incapable of division by any other num-
 "     ber) ; for which case there does not exist, at present, any
 "    general rule amongst mathematicians."           AH these, and
 a variety of other questions connected therewith, are an
 swered by this child with such promptness and accuracy
  (and in the midst of his juvenile pursuits) as to astonish
 every person who has visited him.
       At a meeting of his friends which was held for the
 purpose of concerting the best method of promoting the
 views of the lather, this child undertook, and completely
  succeeded in, raising the number 8 progressively up to the
  sixteenth power!!! and in naming the last result, viz.
  28t,474,y76, 7 10,656 he was right in every figure. He
  was then tried as to other numbers, consisting of one
  figure; all of which he raised (bv actual multiplication and
  not by memory) as high as the tenth power, with so much
  facility and dispatch that the person appointed to take
  down ihe results, was obliged to enjoin him not to be so
  rapid 1 With respect to numbers consisting of two figures,
  he would raise some of them to the sixth, seventh, and
  eighth power ; but not always with equal facility: for the
  larger the products became, the more difficult he found it
   to procecl.      He was asked the square root of 106929, and
   before the number could be written down, he immediately
   answered 327.       He was then required to name the cube
   root of 268,336, 1 S5, and with equal facility and prompt
   ness he replied 645.      Various other questions of a similar

all of which he answered in a similar manner.          One of the
party requested him to name the factors which produced
the number 247483, which he immediately did by men
tioning the two numbers 941 and 263; which indeed are the
only two numbers that will produce it. Another of them
proposed 17 1395,      and   he named the following factors
as the only ones that would produce it; viz. 5x 34279,
 7X24485, 59X2905, 83X2065, 35x4897, 295X581, and
413x415.       He was then asked to give the factors of
36083; but he immediately replied that it had none; which
in fact was the case, as 36083 is a prime number.           Oilier
numbers were indiscriminately proposed to him, and he
always succeeded in giving the correct factors, except in
the case of prime numbers, which he discovered almost as
soon as proposed.     One of the gentlemen asked him how
many minutes there were in forty-eight years ; and before
the question could be written down he replied 25,228,800;
 and instantly added, that the number of seconds in the same
period was 1,513,728,000.         Various questions of the like
kind were put to him ; and to all of them he answered
with nearly equal facility and promptitude; so as to asto
nish every one present, and to excite a desire that so ex
 traordinary a faculty should        possible) be rendered more
                                   (if
 extensive and useful.
  It   was the wish of the gentlemen present to obtain          a
knowledge of the method       by which the child was enabled
to answer, with so much facility and correctness, the
questions thus put to him: but to all their inquiries upon
 this subject (and he was closely examined upon this point)
 he was tumble to give them any information.        He positively
 declared (and every observation that was made seemed to
justify the assertion) that he did not know how the answers
 came into his mind.     In 'the- act of multiplying two num
 bers together, and in the raising of powers,     it  was evident
 (not  only from  the motion   of  his lips, but also  from some
 singular facts which will be hereafter mentioned,) that some
 operation was going forward in his mind      ;   yet that opera
 tion could not (from the readiness with which the answers
 were furnished) be at all allied to the usual mode of pro
 ceeding with such subjects    :   and moreover, he     isentirely
 ignorant of the common rules of arithmetic, and cannot
 perform, upon paper,     a  simple sum in multiplication       or
 division.   But, in the extraction of roots and       inmention
 ing the factors of high numbers     it does not appear that any
                                                         operation

           Singular arithmetical Powers of a Child.            123
operation can take place ; since he will give the answer im
mediately, or in a very few seconds, where it would require,
according to the ordinary method of solution, a very diffi
cult and laborious calculation : and moreover, the know
ledge of a prime number cannot be obtained by any known
rule.
   It has been already observed, that it was evident, from
some singular facts, that the child operated by certain rules
known only to himself. This discovery was made in one
or two instances, when he had been closely pressed up:>n
that point.     In one case he was a-ked to tell the square of
4395 ; he at first hesitated, fearful that he shnuld not be
able to answer it correctly : but when he applied himself
to it he said it was 19,316,035.            On being questioned as
to the cause of his hesitation, he replied that he did not
like to multiply four figures by four figures : but, said he,
"  1 found out another way ; I multiplied 293 by 293, and
,f then
          multiplied this product twice by the number 15,
" which produced the same result." On another occasion,
his highness the Duke of Gloucester asked him the pro
duct ot 21,734 multiplied by !>4i: he immediately replied
 11.801,46*2: but, upon some remark being made on the
suhjecr, the child said that he had, in his own mind, mul
tiplied 65202 by 181.         Now, although in the first instance
it must be evident to every mathematician that 4395 is equal
to 29* X 15, and consequently that (4sg5)J= (293) ' x (i5)*;
and further that in the second case 543 is equal to 181 X3,
and consequently that 21 734 X ( 181 x 3) = (2 1 734 x 3) x
181 ; yet, it is not the less remarkable tint this combination
should be immediately perceived by the child, and we can
not the less admire his ingenuity in thus seizing instantly
the easiest method of solving the question proposed to him.
   It must be evident, from what has here been stated, that
the singular faculty which this child possesses is not alto-
gether dependent upon his memory.              In the multiplication
of numbers and in the raising         of'   powers, he is doubtless
considerably     assisted by    that   remarkable    quality of the
mind :   and   in this  respect  he  might   be  considered as hear
ing   some re semblance     (if the  difference  of age did not  pre
vent the justness of the comparison) to the celebrated Je«
dediah Buxton, and other persons of similar note.             But,
                                                                 in
the extraction of' the roots of numbers, and in determining
their factors (if any),  it   is clear, to all those who have wit
nessed the astonishing quickness and accuracy of this child,
that the memory has little or nothing to do with the pro
cess.    And  in  this particular point consists the remarkable

                        \
 1 24        Singular arithmetical    Powers of a Cliild,
 difference between the present and all former instances of
an apparently similar kind.
     It has been recorded as an astonishing effort of memory
 that the celebrated Euler (who, in the science of analysis,
might vie even with Newton himself,) could remember the
 first six powers of every number under 100.            This, pro
bably, must be taken with some restrictions : but, if true
 to the fullest extent, it is not more astonishing than the
 efforts of this child ; with this additional circumstance iq
favour of the latter, that he. is capable of verifying, in. a
very few seconds, every figure which he may have occasion
for.      It has been further remarked by the biographer of
that eminent mathematician, that- " he perceived, almost,
 "at a simple glance, the factors of which his formulas
f' were composed; the particular system of factors belong-
"   ing to the question under consideration ; the various
 "   artifices by which that system may be simplified and
"   reduced ; and the relation of the several factors to the
 " conditions of the hypothesis. His expertness in this
 "   particular probably resulted, in a great measure, from the
" ease with which he performed mathematical investiga
tions by head. He had always accustomed himself to
u that exercise; and, having practised it with assiduity,
"            before the loss of sight, which afterwards rendered
 " it(even
        a matter of necessity,) he is an instance to what an
"   astonishing degree it may- be acquired, and how much
*f it                                         iMo other discipline
       improves the intellectual powers.
"   is so effectual in strengthening the faculty of attention :
"   it gives a facility of apprehension, an accuracy and steadi-
"   ness to the conceptions ; and (what is a still more valu-
,f
    able acquisition)     it habituates the mind to arrangement
" in its reasonings and reflections."
 j  It is not intended to draw a comparison between the
humble, though astonishing, efforts of this infant- prodigy
and the gigantic powers of that illustrious character to
whom a reference has just been made : yet we may be per
mitted to hope and expect that those wonderful talents,
which are so conspicuous at this earlv age, may by a suit
able education be considerably improved and extended ; and
that some new light will eventually be thrown upon those
subjects, for the elucidation of which his mind appears to
be peculiarly formed by nature, since he enters into the
world with all those powers and faculties which are not
even attainable by the most eminent at a more advanced
period of life. Every mathematician must be aware of the
important advantages which have sometimes been derived

       Caoutchouc found in the Asclepias Vincetoxicum.        125
from     the   most simple and trifling circumstances ; the full
effect   of which    has not always been evident at first sight.
To mention one singular instance of this kind. The very
simple improvement of expressing the powers and roots of
quantities by means of indices, introduced a new and
general     arithmetic of exponents: and this algorithm of
powers      led  the way to the invention of logarithms, by
means of which, all arithmetical computations are so much
facilitated and abridged.        Perhaps this child possesses a
knowledge of some more important properties connected
with this subject;          and although he is incapable at
present of giving any satisfactory account of the state of
his mind, or of communicating to others the knowledge
which it is so evident he does possess, yet there is every
reason to believe that, when his mind is more cultivated
and his ideas more expanded, he will be able not only to
divulge the mode by which he at present operates, but also
point out some new sources of information on this interest
ing subject.
   The case is certainly one,of great novelty and importance :
and every literary character and every friend to science
must be anxious to see the experiment fairly tried, as to the
effect which a suitable education        may produce on a mind
constituted as his appears to be. With this view a num
ber of gentlemen have taken the child under                  their
patronage, and have formed themselves into a commit
tee for the purpose of superintending            his education.'
Application has been made to a gentleman of science, well
known for his mathematical abilities, who has consented
to take the child under his immediate tuition : the com
mittee therefore propose to withdraw him, for the present,
from public exhibition, in order that he may fully devote
himself to his studies         But whether they shall be able
wholly to accomplish the object they have in view, will de
pend upon the assistance which they may receive from the
public.

           Vincetoxicum.      By J. Woodcock, Esq.
                           To Mr. Tilloch.
Sir,    In    addition to the notice contained in your last num

growing in the vicinity of Philadelphia, by Dr.         Barton, I
beg leave to state that I have found this singular     substance

drawn out into long and very elastic threads.                collected     J
about two drachms of this juice in          phial. On immersing

                                    is           effected  by heating

XXV. A Memoir               upon    the Organs       of   Absorption in         Mam-

                                                                                     and

                On the Organs     of Absorption.            127
and introduced into the sanguiferous system. It must be
recollected, that it scarcely requires tweniy seconds to con
vey these poisons from the peritoneal cavity to the spinal
marrow.
 The general    received ideas relative to the organs of ab«
sorption do not admit of  a doubt that the lymphatic vessels
are the agents for conveying these poisons into the sangui
ferous system.    Thus, in the experiment where the poison
was introduced into the middle of the thigh of an animal,
there was but one way of explaining its absorption : it
must necessarily be admitted that it was taken from the
Wound by the lymphatic vessels of the parts with which it
was in contact ; that after being absorbed, it was carried
by these vessels towards the glands of the groin ; that after
traversing these bodies, it was conveyed, still by the lym
phatic vessels, to the thoracic duct ; finally, that it was
introduced into the sanguiferous system by the communi
cations which the thoracic duct preserves with the subcla
vian veins, and principally with those of the left side.
     Such ought to have been, and such in fact was our
opinion at the time of the publication of the memoir upon
the strychnos.       Nor were the experiments of which I am
about to give      an account undertaken with a view to dis
cover    new   facts, but rather to add a degree of certainty to
an explanation already admitted; and our labours did not
 take a particular direction, until a great number of facts
 obliged us to modify our view of this subject.          But so
 rapid an absorption, by vessels whose principal character
 istics are weakness and slowness of action ; a poisonous
 substance, that so quickly pervades the difficult and wind
 ing route of the lymphatic glands without any alteration
 therein, were two circumstances that ought, perhaps, to
 have made us entertain some doubts of the correctness of
 the received explanation.      This explanation, however, is
  given by  so  many respectable persons, and is supported by
  experiments so positive, that even now, when we have
  many facts to oppose     it,
                             we dare not say that  it wants ex
  actness, but only    that      not admissible under every cir
                            it
                            is
  cumstance.
     Previous to any detail of our experiments,    itwill not be
  useless to relate, in few words, an opinion which for some
  lime balanced the present prevailing belief relative to the
          of absorption.
     This opi nion, professed    byBoerhaave, Haller, M6ckel,
  Ruysch, Swammerdam, and others, was, that the sangui
                                                           ferous

  128              On the Organs  of Alsorption.
  ferous veins, in common     with the lymphatic   vessels,  pos«
  sessed an absorbing power.                                     
     It is supported by different circumstances    of structure,
  and by some physiological and pathological facts.     A series
  of interesting experiments, undertaken and executed a few
 years since, at the veterinary school of Alfort, has also
  strengthened the probability of such absorbent property
 of the veins, but without producing entire conviction.        It
 is well understood, that an opinion established upon the
 physical structure of the organs, deduced from a sufficient
 and conclusive number of experiments, and supported by
 the names of Boerhaave, Haller, and Ruysch, ought not
 to be easily abandoned. Nor was less required than the
 anatomical discoveries of the last century,' the correct ex
 periments of Hunter and his brother, those of Cruikshank,
 Mascagni, Desgenettes, and others, to establish the belief that
 the lymphatic vessels only possess the absorbent faculty.
     I will further cite, in support of the general opinion,
 some very curious experiments lately made by M.Dupuy-
 tren.    This physiologist, who has kindly permitted me to
 report the principal results of his labours, tied the thoracic
 duct in several horses ; some of them died in five or six
 days, others preserved every appearance of health.          We
 know already, by an experiment of Duvemy, by some ob
 servations on the thoracic duct when obstructed, and above
all by the experiments of Latidrin, that the thoracic duct
 may cease to convey the chyle into the subclavian vein,
without being followed by the death of the animal : it is
true, we also know, that some animals died in consequence
of a ligature round the duct ; but we are entirely ignorant
of the cause of this diversity in the results. M. Dupuy-
tren, by his experiments, has found one very satisfactory.
In the animals that died in five or six days from the liga
ture round the thoracic duct, he alwavs found it impossi
ble to pass any injection from the inferior part of the duct
into the subclavian vein ; consequently, it is very probable
that the chyle ceased to be conveyed into the venous sy
stem immediately after the application of the ligature.      On
the contrary, in all the animals who have survived the ap
plication of the ligature, it has always been easy to make
everv kind of liquid pass from the interior part of the duct
to the subclavian veins, by means of the very numerous
communications between these two points by the lymphatic
vessels, placed alike in the posterior as in the anterior me
diastinum.
                                                         I  hare

                   On the Organs  of Absorption.           129
    I have personally assisted   M. Dupuytren in opening a
horse, the thoracic duct of which he had tied more than
six weeks before, and I easily satisfied myself that there
existed evident communications between the inferior por
tion of the duct and the subclavian veins, although this
canal was entirely destroyed at the place of the ligature.
     I now proceed to the experiments which I made, for
 the most part in concert with M. Dclile, to determine
whether the lymphatic vessels are really the only ones by
which foreign substances enter into the venous system.
    A circumstance that has always thrown some obscurity
over the experiments upon absorption, is the difficulty of
demonstrating, with certainty, the passage and presence of
absorbed matters, either in the lymphatic or sanguiferous
vessels.    We have not these inconveniences to fear in em
ploying the upas, or the mix vomica; for it is known that
two centigrammes of these substances produce effects too
remarkable to be mistaken.
    Would ihe ligature round the thoracic duct stop the
passage of the poison in the sanguiferous system, and con
sequently its effects upon the spinal marrow ? This was
the first question that we proposed to resolve.
    I applied in a dog a ligature to the thoracic duct, a
little before its opening into the left subclavian vein j    I
afterwards introduced a solution of the upas into the cavity
of the peritoneum. The effects of the poison were as
prompt and marked as if the thoracic canal had not been
tied. I have tried the same ligature in other animals; but
instead of introducing the poison into the cavity of the
peritoneum, I introduced it either into the pleura, or into
 the stomach, the intestines, or muscles of the thighs, &c.
The effects have always been equally rapid and intense, as
if the thoracic canal had been free.
    Decisive conclusions cannot he drawn from these first
essays, for we know that the thoracic canal is not the only
point of communication between the lymphatic and ve
 nous systems.     There is ordinarily, on the right side, a
second thoracic duct, almost as considerable as that on the
left ; ihe large lymphatic vessels often open themselves so
litarily into the subclavian veins ; and more frequently still
the thoracic duct has several mouths into the veins where
it terminates.
    One of these circumstances was found to occur in the
animals subjected to onr experiments ; and we must have
recourse to other trials, from which other results, less equi
vocal, may be deduced.

    130            On the Organs   of Absorption.
    seven hours before, in order that his abdominal lymphatic
   vessels  might be easily perceived, we made an incision
   through the parietes of the abdomen, and took from thence
   a coil of the small intestines, upon which we applied two
   ligatures about five inches apart from each other. The
   lymphatics, which had their origin in this turn of the in
   testine, were very white and very apparent from the chyle
   which they contained.      Two ligatures were placed at the
  distance of one centimetre upon each of these lymphatics ;
  wc cut these wssels between the two ligatures; we took
  great care in our experiment, and assured ourselves, by
  every possible means, that the curvature of the intestine,
  taken from the abdomen, had no further communication
  with the body by the lymphatic vessels.       Five arteries and
  five mesenteric veins ended in the portion of the intestine
  comprised between the two ligatures ; four of these arteries
  and four of the veins were tied and cut in the same man
  ner as the lymphatics ; the two extremities of the curva
  ture of the intestine were cut, and entirely separated from
  the rest of the small intestine.   Thus wc had a portion of
  the intestine about five inches in length, not communicat
  ing with the rt st of the body, but by one artery and one
  mesenteric vein ; these two vessels were separated at the
 distance of four fingers breadth. We even raised the cel
 lular substance, lest some lymphatic vessels might lie there
 concealed.     We had nothing further by which to obtain
 a positive result, than to inject a small quantity of the Jipas
 tiei/te into the cavity of the intestinal curvature.  This was
 also done with proper precautions to prevent the escape of
 the injected liquor.     The curvature of the intestine, en
 veloped in fine linen, was replaced in the abdomen ; it was
 then precisely one o'clock.       To our great astonishment,
 about six minutes alter, the general effects of the poison
 diffused themselves with their usual intensity, and in such
 a manner that every thine proceeded as if the curvature of
 the intestine had been" in its natural state.
     The animal being dead, we examined the parts ; no li
gature was displaced, nothing could make us suppose that
the poison had passed into the abdominal cavity.
      This experiment, repeated several times without any
modification in the rcsu't, appeared to us most conclusive;
it proves, at least as far as can be proved in physiology,
that the lacteal vessels are not the exclusive organs of in
testinal absorption.
     This kind of absorption, different from that of the lym
phatic, may be peculiar to the intestines; it would be itn-i
pqrtant to know, if it could be discovered to exist in the.
other parts.                                                  We

     We separated from its body the thigh of a dog, previ
 ously rendered comatose by opium, (in order to spare it the
  pain of a difficult experiment ;) this separation was so
 made, that the thigh still communicated with the trunk
 by the crural artery and vein.      We took, with regard to
 these two vessels, the same precautions as for the mesen
 teric vein and artery in the preceding experiments; that
 is, we isolated them on an extent ot four centimetres, and
 raised their cellular coat, lest    should conceal some lym
                                       it
 phatic vessels    we then inserted two grains of the poison
                   ;
 in the foot, and waited the effects. They manifested them
 selves with as much promptitude and energy as              if  the
 thigh had not been separated from the body; insomuch
 that the first signs of the action of the upas appeared before
 the fourth minute, and the animal died before the tenth.
     It may be objected, that notwithstanding all the* pre
 cautions taken, the arterial and venous parietes still con
tained some lymphatics, and that these vessels were suffi
 cient to give passage to the poison.         were easy to refute
                                                It
 this objection.
  I   repeated, upon another dog, the preceding experiments,
 with this modification, that       introduced into the crural
                                     I
artery     asmall quill, upon which      fixed this vessel by two
                                            I
ligatures    the artery was afterwards cut circularly between
               ;
 these two bands.         did the same to the crural vein
                            I                                ;   so
that there was no longer any communication between the
thigh and the rest of the body, unless           by
                                                the arterial blood
which comes to the thigh, and            by
                                       the venous blood which
returns to the trunk.      The poison introduced into the foot
produced its general effects in the ordinary time, that           is,
in  about four minutes.         It
                               may be deduced,      believe, from
                                                      I
these different experiments, that the lymphatic system            is
not, at least in certain cases, the exclusive route that foreign
substances take to arrive at the venous system.
   This new mode of absorption, much more direct than
that      the lymphatics, presents the means of easily con
          by
ceiving the rapidity with which the different deleterious
and other matters are absorbed, as well as the rapidity with
which they produce their effects upon the system.
   But what are the organs that first absorb the poison from
the parts w here     has been introduced
                       it                       ?Are they the ra
dicles of the veins, or are they rather the capillary lym
phatics, which, having immediate anastomosis with the
sanguiferous capillaries or exhalants, would immediately
diffuse the poison through the venous system            ?
   The experiments which          have just related, joined to
                                I I

 132             On the Organs    of Absorption.
those which have been made on the same subject, appear
to me totally insufficient to decide either of these questions ;
only it ought to be remarked, that our experiments are
strongly in favour of a direct absorption by the veins.
   But it is a fact rendered evident by the preceding ex
periments, and upon which it is necessary to pause a mo
ment, that the venous blood becomes charged with the
poison ; and that, by the intervention or means of this
blood, the poison produces its deleterious action upon the
system.    In fact, if in the experiments where I had sepa
rated the thigh from the trunk, we suspend the course of
the venous blood, by compressing between two fingers the
crural vein, we lessen, and even totally suspend, the pro
duction of the effects.      The blood of an animal, in which
the signs of action of the upas are developed, contains then
some portion of poisonous matter ; indeed it may be said
to be really poisoned.      It were curious and interesting to
know,   if this  blood, carried into the circulatory system of
a healthy animal, would produce effects similar to those it
had upon the animal itself.      At first sight, we are led to
believe that  this  is  extremely probable, even that it is cer
tain.   The following experiments will show with what care
we ought, in physiology, to distinguish that which is pro
bable from i hat which is proved by experiment.
   We passed the arterial blood of an animal, in which the
tetanus caused by the vpas was manifest, into the jugular
vein of a healthy animal ; the transfusion lasted near twenty
minutes, so that the healthy animal received a very con
siderable quantity of poisoned blood, which at the first mo
ment of the experiment was of a red and vermilion co
lour, and which afterwards became violet and black, when
the vpas had produced asphyxia.        There did not, however,
appear any irritation of the spinal marrow, and the animal
only experienced what happens in common transfusions
made with care.       I mean, that it had for some hours a
very  marked    acceleration  of the inspiratory and expiratory
motions, as well as a very abundant pulmonary exhalation.
Frequently repeated, this experiment has always produced
the same results.
   We were now certain, that the arterial blood of animals
poisoned by the upas tieute, the nux vomica, or the Lean of
St. Ignatius, was not susceptible of producing similar ef
fects on other animals ; it would not be, perhaps, the sane
with the venous blood. It may he presumed, that the re
spiratory action changed the nature of the poisonous sub
stance; and this alteration might, to a certain degree, give
                                                             the

                  On the Organs    of Absorption.            133
the reason, why the        transfusion of the arterial blood of
animals poisoned by the strycknos is not followed           with
bad effects.
    This circumstance did not take        place with the venous
blood,    which   returns from  the   part where the poison has
been introduced.        After the experiments reported in the
memoir upon the upas, and in this, it is impossible to
doubt, that thin blood does not transport the poison to the
lungs.      It is very probable that, introduced in the circula
tory system of another animal, it would produce effects
similar to those which it caused upon the animal on which
the inoculation of the poison was made.
    A small piece of wood covered with two grains of upas
tieule was stuck into the thick part of the left side of the
nose of a dog.        Three minutes after this introduction, we
passed into the venous system of another dog, the blood of
the jugular vein of the side where the introduction of the
poison had been made.         The transfusion commenced about
one minute before the first signs of the upas ; it did not
 cease until the death of the animal who experienced it. No
 appearance of irritation of the spinal marrow was perceived
 in the animal who received so great a quantity of poisoned
 blood.
    Although these experiments were repeated several limes,
 with variations in the mode of introducing the poison, we
 never could perceive in the healthy animal, who had suf
 fered the transfusions of poisoned blood, any thing which
 resembled the effects of the strycknos.
     Results so positive, appear to us of a nature to warrant
 the conclusion, that the venous blood of animals poisoned
 by the upas, the mix vomica, and the lean of St. Ignatius,
 is no more capable than the arterial blood, of producing
 upon another animal the effects which it will cause upon
 the animal from which it was taken.
     If there still remained any doubts, they would be removed
 by the following experiment, which was repealed several
  times.
     As in the experiments above related, we separated, from
  the body, the thieh of an animal, isolating as before the
  crnrai arterv and vein ; we introduced the poison into the
  separated foot, and transfused the blood of the crural vein
  into the jugular vein of a sound animal.        The passage of
  the blood from one animal to the other lasted more than
  ten minutes, a time more than sufficient for the production
  of the effects of the upas.       But no sign of the action of
  this poison was perceived, either in the one or in the other
                                  I 3                     animal.

  animal.   The one preserved perfect health ; the other died
  in a few days, in consequence of the amputation of the
  thigh, and the loss of blood which was transfused.
     It must not, however, be thought, that in this experi
 ment the transfused blood, by some particular cause, had
 no deleterious properties, for the following experiment
 proves the contrary.
     As in the preceding experiment, T separated the thigh
 from the body; three minutes after introducing the poison
 into the foot, I passed the blood of the crural vein into the
jugular vein of another animal ; the transfusion was pro
 longed five minutes without producing any effects.       I then
 stopped       it,
              and disposed things in such     manner that the
                                                    a
 blood of the crural vein should return to the animal to
which      belonged.
          it           Almost instantly this animal exhibited
evident signs of the action of strychnos on the spinal
marrow.
    From the different experiments reported in this memoir,
we must,      think, conclude,
               I
    1st. That the lymphatic vessels are not always the route
followed        by
               foreign matters, to arrive at the sanguiferous
system.
    2d. That the blood of animals, upon which the bitter
strychnos has produced its deleterious effect, cannot pro
duce any fatal effects upon other animals.
    As to the explanation of this singular phaenomenon,               it
would he,      think, premature to give
               I                              at present.

physiological science,   we   ought  to be sparing of conjec
tures, and prodigal of facts.

The     interesting nature of this curious fact will, hope, be
                                                           I

observations on this subject.       shall first briefly state that
                                       I
it    to M. Kirchhoff of St. Petersburg that the public are
     is
indebted for this discovery.    He very lately communicated
it  to Professor Berzelius of Stockholm.         This celebrated
chemist, immediately on his arrival           in
                                             this country, men
tioned     to Sir Humphry Davy, at whose desire
          it                                             repeated
                                                           I

        and   of Potatoes, ly     the Agency   of Sulphuric Acid.        135
the experiments, and by whose kindness 1 have been allowed
to operate in the Laboratory of the Royal Institution.
     The original experiment was made by boiling together
100 parts of starch, 400 parts of water, and one part of sul
phuric acid, for 36 hours, on a slow fire, in a covered vessel,
adding from lime to time water for that which boiled away :
towards the expiration of that lime some charcoal in pow
der was put in ; and lastly, enough of carbonate of lime to
saturate the acid : the solution was then filtered, evaporated
to the consistence of a thick syrup, and put to crystallize ;
which generally takes place in three days.                    In repeating
 this experiment I got some starch not converted, which
 was owing I believe to the heat not being sufficiently strong,
 with the intention of shortening the time of boiling.                 I in
 creased the quantity of sulphuric acid (at the suggestion
 of Professor Berzelius in a second trial) to 3 per cent. I
 have also made trials with 4, 5, 6, and 8 per cent, of acid,
 but they did not either increase the result, or shorten the
 time of boiling, as much as I expected.                 I'have also made
 experiments with the starch of potatoes, in the same pro
 portions as that of wheat which I used in my first trials :
 the only difference I could perceive between them was, that
 the sugar was not so abundant from the potatoe starch, and
  that it contained more gummy matter than the sugar ob
  tained from that of wheat.            I observed that they do not
  possess    the  property     of sweetening liquids, at all equal to
  the sugar from the juice of the cane.             I have uot been able
 to procure either of ihem sufficiently crystallized, to state the
  difference of either of them (if any) from each other, or from
  any other sugar.          My experiments at present are not suffi
  ciently complete       to  warrant my giving either a statement
  of the quantity produced, or of the expense of the process;
  indeed thi» would be foreign to my first object, which was
  to repeat the experiment; but I am convinced it cannot be
  an object at present in Britain.          1 am assured it was lately
  in contemplation to adopt it on a large scale in the Russian
  empire, as the price of cane sugar was increased so much,
  and the supply was so uncertain.
      I shall not presume to give the rationale of this process
   at present. I am ignorant of that advanced by the able dis
  coverer (M. KirchhofF); but I must dissent from the opinion
  given by M. Nasse*, who thinks the sulphuric acid is de
  composed.         1 have weighed the. quantity of lime it required
   to saturate the acid used in the experiments; and also of

 that used to saturate an equal weight of the same acid
 diluted with water, and I find them to agree exactly.
     M.Vogel*, in his remarks on this subject, seems to think
 that increasing the quantity of acid hastened the forma
 tion of the sugar. He only obtained the syrup; time did
 not permit him to go further: we are therefore, for the pre
 sent, deprived of that able chemist's remarks on this sub
ject.     Should mv future experiments on this subject prove
 sufficiently interesting, I shall have great pleasure in mak
 ing them public, and I will take the liberty of asking in
 dulgence for these, as I am but a pupil in that science in
 which there are at present so manv able proficients. If these
 remarks should induce some able investigator to pursue
 the subject, and thereby benefit science ancf the arts, I shall
 consider myself as very fortunate.
XXVII.       On the Barometer.         By Richard Walker, Esq.
             Oxf  ord.    Communicated       by the Author.
                             To  Mr. Tilloch.
Sir, Should           the following observations, forming the
conclusion of a subject, viz. " Observations on the Baro
meter," which you did me the favour to communicate,
through the channel of the Philosophical Magazine for
October 1810, and the two following numbers, be deemed
not unworthy of a place in your next number, I request
you will have the goodness to insert them.
                          I am, sir, your obedient servant,
   Oxford, August  17, 1812.                    RlCHARD WALKER.
    P. S.  I   have judged it expedient, in the course of these
observations, to descend occasionally to particular^ which,
to the generality of your readers, must be totally unneces
sary, but which to some persons, who may not before
have given much attention to            this subject, may not prove
unacceptable.
    The reason of the long interval between this and my
fornrer communications on the same subject, is in conse
quence of mv attention having been engaged in a small
work of a different nature, which 1 hope soon to have it
in my power to announce.
    The barometer, stationary, with a concave surface of the
mercury at the top, is an almost infallible indication of

rain,    at the placeof observation, or in its vicinity ; especially
if the  barometer be at or below changeable.
   The barometer, stationary, with a convex surface of the
mercury at the top, is a strong indication offair weather,
at the place of observation, or in its vicinity; especially if
the barometer be at or above changeable.
    In the first instance, I would account for this circum
stance, by the natural spring or elasticity of the air being
suspended or diminished (the density or weight of the at
mosphere remaining the same) by the intervention of vapour
collecting into amass; and in the latter instance, from
the dispersion of the interposed vapour, by which the na
tural spring or elasticity of the air is restored.
   For the same reason it           is,
                                    presume, that during

     The quick ascent into the atmosphere, of smoke, vapour,
&c. indicates fair-weather and the slow ascent, and parti
                                    ;
cularly the descent of them, indicates rain. The former, in
consequence of an influx of denser or heavier air, into the
lower stratum of the atmosphere, commonly from the north
and east points and the latter,
                      ;                  consequence of an influx

of rarer or lighter air, into the lower stratum of the at

                               is                          Hence            it
follows that, ccBleris paribus, the former state of the baro
meter      not so strong an indication of fair weather, as the
         is is

   The barometer rising, especially                if
                                                   be progressive,

                        is

conversely, the barometer sinking, whilst the wind                     is   in
the opposite points, indicates       change to the south or west
                                          a

    In the spring, and as summer advances, rain brings suc
cessively warmer weatlier after           and it
                                               ;  autumn, and as
                                                        in
winter approaches, rain brings successively colder weather
after it. Hence, successive showers gradually change, as
it were, spring into summer, and autumn into winter.
   The reason of this seems to be, that during fair weather
alone, the true character of each season, with respect to
                                                        temperature,

138                    Oti the Barometer.
 temperature, is exhibited ; whereas it is in some degree
 obscured, or suspended, during cloudy weather.
    The mercury in the barometer is usually fixed, at what
ever height it may happen to be, with a concave surface,
 during settled rain ; and fixed with a convex surface, du
 ring settled fair weather. It is essential, in order to make
 accurate observations on the barometer, that it be viewed
 with a magnifier, which is best when fixed to the-moveable
 index.
    Fogs in the morning are more visible over land than over
 water, because the greater coldness of the land condenses
 the vapour most ; but in the evening, over the water, be
 cause water is then the coldest.
    The mean height of the clouds above the earth's surface
is- about three quarters of a mile ;  the greatest height,
somewhat more than a mile  and the least height, about
ihree furlongs, and sometimes in thunder storms, even less.
     In order to make the most accurate observations on the
state of the weather, and to predict the various changes
which are about to take place in        it,
                                          the observer should be
provided    witha   barometer,   thermometer,    and hygrometer,
e.tch of the best construction.         De Luc's hygrometer,   I
think, is  the best;  and in order, at all times, to be able to
notice the changes in the direction of the wind, which are
taking place, and which     is extremely essential,   it would be
expedient   thata   wind-vane   be so constructed, as to exhibit
the direction of the wind within the room appropriated for
meteorological observations; which, in deftfet of any better
means, might be contrived,       by  the axis of the wind-vane.
without being continued so as to reach within the room,
having an index affixed to it.
    The rising of the barometer   is     more certain indication
of fair weather, than its sinking      is a

cause it   sinks for wind, as well as rain.          If therefore,
whilst the harometer   is sinking,   ihe atmosphere still remain
clear, wind may be expected.
    In winter, spring, and autumn, sudden falling of the

                                                  ;
heavy   showers,  and  sometimes   thunder.
     The principal changes in ihe atmosphere take place
about the time of the vernal equinox, viz. from the 16th to
the 28th of March.
    Rain or snow may come during              north and easterly
                                              a
wind, whilst the barometer stands higher, than when the
wind  is   inthe south or west points    ; because in the former
                                                         instance

                                     On the Barometer.                                   139
instance the clouds come from a denser to a rarer medium,
and in the latter case, from a rarer into a denser medium.
   The maximum and minimum heights of the barometer,
in this and every other country, are limited, by nature, thus :
When the atmosphere is charged with as much water in
a state of chemical combination, under the most favourable
circumstances for absorbing                         it,
                                      as the atmosphere can
 sustain,       then heaviest, and the barometer
                      is                                 at its                 is

maximum  and when the air         most free from, or contains
                                                   is
the least quantity of, water       state of chemical combina
                                              in   a
tion, other circumstances concurring,       the atmosphere                                 is
then lightest, and the barometer           at its minimum of
                                                          is
height.    Hence, caeleris paribus, the absorption of water,
by air, renders the atmosphere heavier, and its parting with
it   renders lighter*.
                it
   During many successive years of observation on the ba
rometer in England,       may be found, that its greatest
                                         it
height  will   not exceed one inch and      quarter above              a
 changeable                ;   nor its least height, the same distance below
 CHANGEABLE.
    The variations in the barometer are greatest towards the
 poles; less, in temperate latitudes; and least, between the
 tropics.
    The barometer was observed, some years ago, at Osford,
 as low as 28 inches, within two hundredths, at which time
 the weather was perfectly fair and calm            but   appeared ;       it
 afterwards that an earthquake had happened at the time, at
a   distant part of the world.        This circumstance puzzled
 ordinary   observers,     and   injured the reputation of the
 weather-glass     but ; the intelligence afterwards of the event
 which had happened restored its character.
    The moisture on the ground and in other situations
freezes, as      well known, when the atmosphere
                 is                                         warmer          is
 than 32°, the freezing point, in consequence of the cold
 produced       by
               evaporation. Under the most favourable cir
 cumstances, viz.       dry air and
                               a        brisk wind, this may hap
                                                   a

140                   On the Barometer.
   Rain happens, among other causes before mentioned,
inconsequence of a subtraction of the electric fluid) which,
when the air abounds with vapour, is easily conducted to
the earth ; hence arises the velocity of rain in thunder
showers.
    In this climate, the hottest time of the day is about
 three in the afternoon, in consequence of the continued in
fluence of the sun, whilst near its greatest height from the
 horizon; and the coldest is a short time before sun-rise,v\z.
that time at which our part of the earth has been longest
without the influence of the sun.
   The hottest month is July; and the coldest month is
January; the former, in consequence of the continued
strongest influence of the sun, whilst near its greatest ele
vation from the horizon ; and the latter, in consequence of
the continued weukesl influence of the sun, whilst near its
least elevation from the horizon.   The driest montlts are
July and August, and the wettest are October and November ;
the former, in consequence of   the small quantity of water
which has been raised into the  atmosphere previously, and
the powerful influence of the    sun, during these months,
in dissipating the vapours which are raised ; and the latter,
in consequence of the inverse effects of those two causes.
    In like manner, as the annual influence of the sun
operates upon the weather, producing different seasons, re
specting wet and dry weather, before stated ; it is not im
probable, that its diurnal influence, being a kind of epitome
of the former, may, in a smaller degree, have the same
effect in producing an effort for fair weather, whilst the
sun is nearest its greatest diurnal altitude, in consequence
of its greater power, at that lime, of dissipating vapours, or
dispersing clouds.
   The greater or less avidity with which the mercury ap
pears to rise or sink, as exhibited by the greater or less con
vexity or concavity of the mercury at the time of observa
tion, the stronger or weaker will be the indication in each
instance.
   The surface of the mercury in a barometer is best seen
when the tube, at the part to be observe d, is exposed to the
light behind, that   is,  constructed without an opake sub
stance at the back of it.
   The convex or concave surface of the mercury arises, of
course, from the adhesion of the mercury to the tube, in
rising or sinking
                :    at each observation of the barometer,
therefore, after noticing the variation in height, the index
                                                        should

                        On (fie Barometer.                  141
 should be first accurately placed, the barometer then smartly
ripped, in order to reduce the mercury to a level, and the
index again accurately adjusted.
    The principle of a barometer is so perfectly uniform in
 its effect, that although, for want of precision in their con
 struction, any two of them may not, under similar circum
 stances, respecting the state of the atmosphere, and the ele
vation in which thev are placed, stand precisely at the same
height; yet all will agree in this  they will rise or sink at
 the same time.
    The ordinary upright barometer is the only one in use,
among scientific persons, of which there are two kinds, viz.
 the cistern or bason barometer, and the syphon barometer :
 the former of these requires a floating gage, with an ad
justing screw, in order to show the precise length or height
 of the column of mercury in the tube ; which is essential
 in accurate observations, and particularly in the measure
 ment of altitudes by the barometer ; but which may be
 dispensed with in ordinary observations.
    The only objectionable circumstance in the perpendicular
 barometer is the shortness of its scale; but, since there are
 no means of extending the scale of a barometer without, in
 some degree, injuring its principle, this defect is supplied
 by a nonius or vernier.
    Barometers intended for the purpose of measuring alti
 tudes, are fitted up in a peculiar manner adapted to that
 intention.
    The attractive power of the sun upon the earth's surface,
 is to that of the moon, as 2 to 5.
    With respect to the direction of the wind, it is tolerably
 uniform within the tropics, being more immediately under
 the influence of the two principal causes of currents of air,
 viz. first the sun, which, in its course heating the places
 it successively passes over, causes a very considerable rare
 faction of the air there, which is constantly followed bv a
 current of air, to restore the equilibrium ;  and secondly,
 the current of wind, which is produced by the attractive
 influence of the saw and moon on the atmosphere, as the
 different places pass under them.
     Near the poles, the wind is probably more uniform than
 it is in the middle or temperate climates ; the lower portions
 of the air being constantly inclined towards the equator, in
 consequence of the increasing heat in that direction ; and
 the upper portions being renewed, from the more elevated
  regions of the inter-tropical currents.
     Whereas, in the middle or temperate climates, besides
 tther causes unknown to us, the direction of the wind be-
                                                          comet

   142                        On the Barometer.
   comes more        complicated,      in consequence       of its situation
   between    the two former ; being occasionally influenced by
   each of them, separately or conjointly.
      There seems to be a kind of habit in the weather, as in
   other cases : thus, towards the close of a series of dry
   weather, several efforts are apparently made towards              a series
  of rainy weather, before it actually sets in; and inversely.
      With respect to the difference of the weather, which I
  have    presumed      takes place during the increase and wane
   of  the moon ; I would account for it on a supposition that
  at each conjunction of the moon with the sun, or the time
  of the new moon, as it is called, there may be a kind of dis
  position, as it were, for clarifying the atmosphere, or reno
  vation of fair weather ; and vice versa, at the moon's op
  position, or full moon; and the reason why this change
  does not actually take place until about the third or fourth
  day after each change of the moon, because, as I have staled
  before, the former habit of the weather is not till then
  entirely conquered.
      The atmosphere becoming drier, as indicated by the hy
  grometer, indicates a disposition for fair weather, and vice
  versa.
      A cold, dry, and serene state of the atmosphere is most
  favourable for barometrical measurements.
      The limit, or boundary of the atmosphere, terminates
  where the expansive force or power of the air, Upwards, or
from the earth's surface, is completely overcome by the
 force or power of gravitation downwards, or towards the
  earth's surface, which is estimated at about 44 or 45 miles*.
      A pint measure of air, when the barometer is at 29£ in
 England, weighs eight grains, or a gallon 64 grains; but
 near the poles somewhat more; and at the equator
 somewhat less. This variation in the weight of the air, in the
 different parts of the world, is ascribed to a difference in
 the height of the atmosphere ; by which it happens, that the
 air near the surface of the earth, at different places, differs
 in density ; the pressure or weight of the incumbent at
 mosphere being the same.                The atmosphere is presumed
 to extend highest a,t the equator, and to be lowest at the
 poles ; in consequence of a greater degree of centrifugal
force and heat at the equator.
     The barometer, cceteris paribus, stands higher in winter
 than in summer, in consequence of the greater condensa
 tion of the air, from cold, at that season.
    * The atmosphere, it is computed, would extend only to about
                                                                    5J miles
in height, if it were so compressed, that its density throughout should
 equal its degree of density near the surface of the earth.
                                                                       The

                          On the Barometer.                               143
   The barometer unquestionably has been observed, in Eng
land, to rise above 31, and to sink below 28; viz. to ex
ceed those limits, each wav, by the tenth of an inch.
   The lowest point at which I have observed the barome
ter is 28| inches, viz. on November 9th. 1810; which
was accompanied by a remarkably high wind, and torrent
of rain.
   The ordinary range, or variation, in the barometer, differs
according to the latitude of the place :  thus, at the equator
 (except  during the hurricane season) it is scarcely any
         
thing; and at the poles, it is probably not less than tour
inches; varying in an increasing ratio, from the equator,
to each pole *.
   The column of mercury in the tube of a barometer, as
most persons know, is sustained by the counter-pressure
of a column of air, of the same base, extending to the top
of the atmosphere; which, when at its mean state of gra
vity, that        is,
               when the barometer          at 29| inches, presses
                                                 is
on the base of the mercury, with           weight which
                                                 a           equal   is
to, or after the rate of, fifteen pounds upon each square inch
of surface.

     It         confidently asserted
          has been                                    by
                                          respectable authors,
that the barometer     affected by the atmospherical tides
                         is                                                ;
it does not appear, however, that any observations have
actually proved the fact.
   With respect to the periodical rise and fall of the baro
meter noticed at Calcutta;      the first place, the variation
                                    in
appears to have been very small     and secondly,

correspond in point of time with the attractive influence
either of the sun or moon.
   That the atmosphere influenced by the attractive power
                               is
of the sun and moon, there can be no question but        seems
                                                           ;        it

extent of three inches.

  contrary to reason, that the barometer should be affected
  by it ; since, in proportion as the atmosphere is rarefied,
  from this cause ; in the same proportion, from the same
  cause, likewise, is the atmosphere accumulated there ; and
  hence the gravity, or pressure of the atmosphere upon the
  surface of the earth, remains the same in each instance.
       I might add, that if an alteration in the barometer
  actually took place from such a cause, it could scarcely
  have escaped my notice.
      P.S. I have noticed with considerable sensations of sur
  prise and satisfaction, the progress of Professor Leslie, in his
  experiments on the production of cold by means of the air-
 pump, in which it is stated that that gentleman has already
  reached a cold of 70° below O.              .At the time I was pur
  suing my experiments on artificial cold by frigorific mix
  tures, the means of producing artificial cold by means of
 the air-pump naturally presented itself, and to which I was
 more particularly stimulated by an experiment related by
 Mr. Nairrie, in which it is said, by the evaporation of ether,
 under the air-pump, a cold of 4S3 below 0 was produced,
 the temperature of the air in the room being 55°.                     Philo
 sophical Transactions 1777.
     I made several attempts at producing an extraordinary
 degree of cold by this means, but without success ;
                                                                       owing
 chiefly, as I presumed, to the imperfection of the best air-
 pump I was able to procure. Conceivintr, that the Torricellian
 vacuum, as it is called, might be the best method of effect
 ing the most sudden and complete evaporation of ether,
 upon which the success of the experiment depends, I had
 projected in my mind to put this method to the test; but
 the difficulty of obtaining a fit apparatus for the
                                                                    purpose
                    '
prevented     me.
     Perceiving that Professor Leslie's experiments, in which
he has succeeded to a most extraordinary decree, have been
conducted upon the principle alone of rarefying the air,
 without any auxiliary means excepting his ingenious me
thod of absorbing the vapour, the existence of which ne
cessarily diminishes the success of the experiment ; I have
been induced to take this opportunity of mentioning these
circumstances, fully trusting that, should these observations
furnish no hint to the learned and ingenious Professor,
                                                                         they

Great       as was the expectation of this work, its importance
will  defeat disappointment.     It abounds in luminous views,
original conceptions, comprehensive principles, and familiar
yet sublime, grand yet simple, developments of the laws
and oeconomy of the inanimate world.            The impressive
simplicity of the general principles can only be equalled by
the endless variety of curious and important facts brought
forward to elucidate or familiarize every position.      But an
abstract of the author's plan of arrangement, and some
extracts from his original principles, will best convey an.
idea of the nature of these " Elements of Chemical Philo
sophy."
     Sir Humphry,     adverse to all significant arrangements
 which    may induce erroneous inferences, or obstruct the
progress    of free inquiry, separates the parts of this
volume into divisions, of which he makes seven.         An In
troduction, embracing an " historical view of the progress
of chemistry," although brief, manifests research and the
hand of a master.      Here, however, we find the philosophy
of chemistry accurately defined, and more particularly the
application of chemical philosophy happily elucidated with
the characteristic animation of the author. The foundations
of chemical philosophy being observation, experiment, and
analogy, they are respectively illustrated by example, and
from their application to some particular substance a ge
neral scientific truth is established.     Till modern times,
these principles of research and combination of methods
were never applied ; and in the early ages, all that deserves
the appellation of chemical consists in observation, with
very little analogy and no experiment.        The dyeing and
works in metals practised by the ancients were merely me
chanical ; were rather habits occasioned by necessity, than
arts aided by reason.      Sir H. searches the writings of the
Greeks and Romans for chemical knowledge, but finds

 14(5            Notices respecting New Books.            ,
none ; neither Hippocrates, Galen, nor Dioscorides, wertf
acquainted even with distillation.     The origin of chemistry,
as a science of experiment, cannot be dated further back
than the 7th or 8th century of the Christian sera, and is
perhaps owing to the Arabians.        From that period till the
present age, when
                      " it would be indelicate in a cotemporary
writer to assume the right of arbitrator on the particular
merits of chemical philosophers,"      we have a brief but in
teresting sketch of the progress of chemical researches and
discoveries. The conclusion of the Introduction unfolds
 some of the Professor's general views.
    " Whether matter consists of indivisible corpuscles or
physical points endowed with attraction and repulsion, still
the same conclusions may be formed concerning the powers
by which they act, and the quantities in which they com
bine ; and the powers seem capable of being measured by
their electrical relations, and the quantities on which they
act of being expressed by numbers.        In combination, cer
tain bodies form regular solids ; and all the varieties of
crystalline aggregates have been resolved by the genius of
Haiiy into a few primary forms. The laws of crystalliza
tion, of definite proportions, and of the electrical polarities
of bodies, seem to be intimately related, and the complete
illustration of their connection, probably, will constitute
the mature age of chemistry.
    " Complexity    almost always belongs to the early epochs
of  every  science ; and   the grandest results are usually ob
tained by the most simple means.           A great part of the
phenomena       of chemistry may   be already submitted to cal
culation ; its most important truths are capable of extremely
simple numerical expressions, which may be acquired with
facility by students ; and there is great reason to believe, that
at no very distant period the whole science      will be capable
of elucidation by mathematical principles. The relations
of the common metals to the bases of the alkalies and
earths, and the gradations of resemblance between the
bases   of the earths and acids, point out as probable a simi
larity  in  the constitution of all inflammable bodies ; and
there are not wanting experiments, which render their
possible decomposition far from a chimerical idea.            It is
contrary to the usual order of things, that events so har
monious as those of the system of the earth should de
pend on such diversified agents as are supposed to exist in
our artificial arrangements; and there is reason to antici-
       a great reduction in the number of the undecomposed
  odies, and to expect that the analogies of nature will be

found conformable to the refined operations of art. The
more the phaenomena of the universe are studied, the more
distinct their connection appears, the more simple their
causes, the more magnificent their design, and the more
wonderful the wisdom and power of their Author."
    Part I. of these Elements is "on the laws of chemical
changes, on undecompounded bodies and their primary
combinations."      Division I. " on the powers and properties
of matter, and the general laws of chemical rhanges," in
which " the forms of matter, gravitation, cohesion, heat or
calorific repulsion (a new term), chemical attraction, laws
of combination and decomposition, electrical attraction
and repulsion, with their relations to chemical changes,"
are investigated in a manner equally original and perspi
cuous. Division JI. treats of " radiant or ethereal matter,
its effects in producing the phenomena of vision, of heat,
chemical changes, and its motions or affections."        Divi
sion III. of ''empyreal undecompounded substances, or
undecompounded substances that support combustion, and
their combination with each other;" in which oxygen gas,
and chlorine or oxymuriatic gas are considered.       Division
IV. of " undecompounded inflammable or acidiferous sub
stances not metallic, and their binary combinations with
oxygen and chlorine, or with each other."         Here the na
ture and properties of hydrogen, azote, sulphur, phosphorus,
carbon and diamond, and boron or the boracic basis, are
explained.     Division V. is of " metals, their primary com
binations with other undecomposed bodies, and with each
other."     Division VI. cf " some substances, the nature of
which is not yet certainly known;" these are the fluoric
principle, and the amalgam from ammoniacal compounds.
TheVIlth and last division is devoted to " the analogies
between the undecompounded substances, speculations re
specting their nature, on the modes of separating them,
and on the relations of their compounds."
    These divisions are perfectly arbitrary, and may be aug
mented at pleasure, although each seems to be founded on
some general principle, or received association of principles.
So far is Sir Humphry hostile to all systems in the present
state of our chemical knowledge, except that of Baconian
induction.     He begins with the " forms of matter," (a
term much too limited and definite for his other views,)
divides them into four classes, as solids, fluids [liquids],
elastic fluids or gases, and ethereal substances.   The latter
term he prefers to imponderable substances for those " forms
 [perhaps kinds] of matter, which are known to us only in
                                K2                        their

their states of motion when acting on our organs of sense,
or upon other matter, and which are not susceptible of
being confined.       It cannot be doubled that there is matter
in motion in space, between the sun and the stars and our
globe, though it is a subject of discussion whether suc
cessions of particles be emitted from these heavenly bodies,
or motions communicated by them, to particles in their
vicinity, and transmitted by successive impulses to other
particles. Ethereal matter differs either in its nature or in its
affections by motion ; lor it produces different effects ; for
instance, as radiant heat, and as different kinds of light."
    After briefly stating the laws of gravitation and cohesion,
the Professor rebuts the notion entertained last century,
respecting an instrument of attraction or some unknown
 matter which serves to impel bodies to each other. He
adds,    " there is no ground for supposing that matter can
not act at a distance [that is, in a vacuum] , and it is absolutely
 necessary for the explanation of the planetary motions, to
 suppose space in the universe void of matter."           This de
 finition of attraction gives to matter an occult quality,
 more difficult to conceive, more incredible, than all the
 speculations about spirit which have hitherto appeared.
 To suppose that two inanimate and naturally inert bodies
 can act on each other at a distance and in a vacuum, does
 not convey any satisfactory knowledge to the mind, and
 gives to such matter something like intelligence or intel
 lect ; but if wc suppose the attraction of bodies to be ef
 fected by some conducting or connecting medium, by a.
 very attenuated atmosphere, for instance, we at least adhere
 to experience and the mechanical laws of nutter, without
 any extravagant or incredible suppositions.
    Among the qualities of matter, the Professor introduces
 heat, or what he calls " calorific repulsion."      He illustrates
 the common effects of caloric on matter by reference             to
 numerous experiments, and thus proceeds to state his no
 vel doctrine respecting the non-existence of caloric or mat
 ter of heal.
    "   Heat, or the power of repulsion, may be considered as
 the antagonist power to the attraction of cohesion, the one
 tending to separate, the other to unite the parts of bodies;
 and the forms of bodies depend upon their respective
 agencies.      In solids, the attractive force predominates over
 the repulsive; in fluids and in elastic fluids they may be
 regarded as in different states of equilibrium ; and in ethereal
 substances     the repulsive must be considered as predomi
 nating over and destroying the attractive force.
                                                              "All

     " All
         the different substances in nature, under certain
circumstances, are probably capable of assuming all these
forms : thus solids, by a certain increase of temperature,
become fluids, and fluids gases ; and vice versa, by a di
minution of temperature gases become fluids, and fluids
solids."
     "
     As   attempts have been made to account for attraction,
by the supposition of the existence of a. peculiar matter, so
calorific repulsion has been accounted for bv supposing a
subtile fluid, capable of combining with bodies, and of se
parating their parts from each other, which has been named
the matter of heat, or caloric.
   " Many of the phaenomena admit of a happy explana
tion on this idea, such as the cold produced during the
conversion of solids into fluids or gases, and the increase
of temperature connected with the condensation of gases
and fluids; but there are other facts which are not so easily
reconciled to the opinion : such are the production of heat
by friction and percussion ; and some of the chemical
changes which have been just referred to. When the tem
perature of bodies is raised by friction, there seems to be
no diminution of their capacities, using the word in its
common sense : and in many chemical changes connected
with an increase of temperature, there appears to be like
wise an increase of capacity.         A piece of iron made red
hot by hammering cannot be strongly heated a second time
by the same means, unless it has been previously intro
duced into a fire.      This fact has been explained by sup
posing that the fluid of heat has been pressed out of            by     it,
the percussion, which        recovered in the fire
                                    is                but this

pear from Rumford's experiments, the same piece of me'al
may be kept hot for any length of time; so that,               heat if
be pressed out, the quantity musfbe inexhaustible.          When
any body       cooled

         is  evident, therefore,   that   its parts must have ap
proached    towards   each  other:   when    the body    expanded

by  heat,    it equally
                  is     evident  that   its  parts must have se
parated from each other.         The immediate cause of the
phaenomena     of  heat, then,      motion, and the laws of its
                                         is

communication of motion.

tion of temperature, during the conversion of solids into
fluids or gases, may be explained on the idea of the loss of
vibratory motion, in consequence of the revolution of
particles round their axes, at the moment when the body
becomes fluid or aeriform, or from the loss of rapidity of
vibration in consequence of the motion of the particles
through greater space.

common matter are assumed to possess, to account for the
phaenomena; such as losing its motion when combining
with bodies, producing motion when transmitted from one

passing into free space     so that many hypotheses must be

     " Some arguments have been raised in favour of the
 existence of a specific fluid of heat, from the circumstances
 of the communication of heat to bodies in exhausted re
 ceivers, and from the manner in which they are affected by
 this heat : but there are no means known in experimental
 science of producing a perfect vacuum ; even the best Tor
 ricellian vacuum must contain elastic matter. The great
 capacity of such highly rarefied matter is an obstacle to the
 indication of temperature ; but supposing a communication
 of heat, the laws must be analogous to those of heat com
 municated to common air.                 If a long cylinder of me
 tal, placed perpendicularly, be healed in the middle, the
 warmest part will be above, from the ascent of heated
 particles of the elastic medium ; but if a sphere be heated
 in the middle, the hottest portion will be below, as the
 heated elastic matter must remain longer in contact with
 the inferior than with the superior portion.
    " The laws of the communication of heat, and the phi
losophy of its effects, are independent of this speculative
question, which will again be considered, under new rela
tions, in the part of this work relating to the properties of
ethereal or radiant matter."

Chisholm      was read, detailing a case of nervous affection and

were also given with the view of relieving a supposed liver
complaint.
    June 4. A paper by Mr. F. Baily, on a, new method of
calculating the value of Life Annuities, was laid before the
Society by Sir Humphry Daw. The author took occasion
to notice the labours of Mr. Barrett, of Petworth, who had
devoted the greatest part of his life in calculating a very
voluminous set of Tables upon the principles above alluded,
to.

      A   long and important mathematical paper, by Senor
  Rodriguez, a philosopher in the suite of the late Spanish
  Ambassador, on the French and English admeasurements
  of an arc of the meridian, was laid before the Society by
  Mr. Mendoza Rios. This Spanish mathematician has dis
  covered some minute errors in both French and English
  surveys, and points out with great modesty their probable
  source.     He thinks that one of the greaiest deviations has
  originated in the manner of taking the astronomical obser
  vations by the different trigonometrical surveyors.
      June 11.  Papers bv Dr. Wollaston, on periscopic
  glasses ; by Mr. John Davy, on fluoric acid ; and Jan. 18,
  a paper by Sir H. Davy, on phosphoric and sulphuric acid,
  were read ; for a short account of which see our former
  numbers.
      A paper, by Mr. Brodie, on animal heat, was also read,
  June 18, tending to confirm some of the author's remarks
  on this subject in his former communications.          He ani
  madverted on the inadequacy of Black's theory, and the
  inaccuracy of Crawford's experiments ; showed that by ar
  tificial respiration animal bodies deprived of the brain cool
  faster than when left alone, although an equal portion of
'
  oxygen is absorbed, and carbon disengaged in the process,
  as if the animal were living; and hence interred that the
  action of the brain and nerves is necessary to the prnduc*
  tion of animal heat.      He took notice of the temperature or
  state of tortoises, which are said to live after the brain has
  been completely amputated.
      Mr. Home drew up some observations on the stomachs
  of fowls, made by Sir Joseph Banks at the Cape of Good
  Hope. The right hon. President, having noticed eagles
  to pass stones and other substances, was induced to consider
  that there must be something peculiar in the organization
  of their stomachs ; in consequence of which he engaged
  Mr. Home to investigate such subjects as might fall under
  his observation.
      After this paper was read, the Society adjourned during
  the long vacation till November next.
                LONDON PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY.
      Last month     the attention of the Society was called to a
  Lecture on the Stage, by Mr. Reid, which embraced its
  history from the earliest formation to the present time.
  He began by tracing it to the mystic dramas of the an
  cients, of which the Egyptian, acted in the rites of Isis
  rod Osiris, were the first model.       The Bacchanalian my
                                                          steries,

                  London Philosophical Society.                 1 53
steries, which succeeded      them    in Greece, were the source
of the Greek     Stage.   At first   a single mime sung hymns
to the praise of Bacchus ; then a second was added, till at
last a chorus was formed, composed of many individuals,
but uninterrupted by dialogue or pantomime ; and this for
many years was the only dramatic entertainment known in
Greece.      At length, Thespis introduced a new personage,
who relieved the chorus by reciting a part of some history
or fable ; and this was called an Episode.          From this time
the chorus, which at first composed the principal, became
insensibly and progressively the most inconsiderable part
of the drama. The renowned iEschylus, whose sword and
pen have been equally entwined with laurels, and who has
been justly called the father of the Greek Tragedy, added a
 second actor to the first of Thespis, and thus introduced
 dialogue, which perpetually incroaching on the ancient
 chorus, has at last driven it from the Stage. Jt is to this
 great man that the Athenians            were indebted, said the
 Lecturer, for the first dawn of that refinement which au
 gured and produced so brilliant a day for Greece.          He took
 upon    himself the whole  management      of  the  drama, brought
 his actors into a regular theatre, raised his heroes on the
 cothurnus, and by the introduction of splendid habits im
 parted an air of greater dignity to his performance. Sopho
 cles and Euripides carefully studied the plan laid down by
 ^Eschylus ; and, refining upon it with the enthusiasm of ge
 nius chastised by judgement, they brought the Stage to its
 highest stale of perfection.      After discriminating very ably
 between the opposite characteristics of Sophocles and
 iEschylus', the Lecturer proceeded to observe, that comedy
 owed its birth to the same fortuitous circumstances as tra
 gedy  but in one case the chorus was burlesque, and in
 the other serious.     The old comedy was distinguished into
 three aeras, denominated the old, the middle, and the new.
 The old retained strong marks of its original rudeness, and
  of the low abuse and scurrilous jokes vented on the by
 standers from the court of Thespis.           It was a representa
  tion of real actions, and exhibiting the dress, manners,
  and age of living characters, not even concealing their
  names ; and these were the features of the muse of Aristo
  phanes. The interference of the magistracy to prevent this
  abuse of the Stage produced the middle comedy, which
  differed in nothing from the first than by making an attack
  upon real characters under fictitious names : at length this
  comedy, yielding     to the   influence of increasing politeness
  and refinement,    was  supplanted by the new, which con

  summated the purification of the Stage, fostering iroagina*
 tion without offending nature, and displaying character
 without polluting it by personality.          It was in the midst of
 this gradual refinement of the Athenian Stage that Me-
 nander rose to form a purer model of chaste and delicate
 comedy.       A few fragments of his works, saved from the
 tooth of time, are the only specimens of his style that have
 reached our age; but these are sufficient to confirm the loss
  which morality and taste have suffered by the annihilation
 of  the rest.

                                 OPTICS.
           New Inquiries     of Messrs. Malus and Arago.
    A direct ray of light, as is well known, possesses the pro
 perty of dividing itself into two distinct bundles in its pas
 sage through a rhomboid of Iceland spar, whatever in other
 respects may be its position in relation to the principal sec-       <
 tioii of the rhomboid.
    If we subject the light of which one of these bundles
 is composed to the action of a second rhomboid, we find
 that it differs essentially from the direct light, since, in cer
 tain positions of the principal section of the second cry
 stal, it no longer undergoes double refraction : for the dis
covery of this beautiful property we are indebted to Huy-
ghens.
    When endeavouring to account for this experiment,
Newton remarks, in one of the questions which he has
 placed at the end of his treatise on Optics, that it is neces
sary to admit that the molecules of which the luminous rays
are composed must have sides endowed with different pro
perties : these sides, which some authors have designated by
the appellation of poles, are diametrically opposite to each
other, and in two directions respectively rectangular.
    This being granted, in a ray of ordinary light, the poles
of the molecules will not affect any particular position, and
will be uniformly directed towards all the points of the
space ; whereas a polarized ray will be composed of mole
cules, the similar poles of which will have the same situa
tion : this last ray will be distinguished from a ray of direct
light, in so far as the latter is always divided into two fas
ciculi in its passage through a rhomboid of carbonate of
lime; while the polarized ray experiences only a single re
                                                             fraction

fraction in some particular positions of the principal section
of the crystal   to which we present it.
   The polarized rays differ from ihe rays of direct light by
several other properties which were unknown to Huyghens
and to Newton, and the discovery of which is owing to
M. Malus. If we suppose in fact, that alter having dis-
        vertically the principal section of a rhomboid or car-
  onate of lime, we receive the two fasciculi which proceed
Eosed
from them on the surface of smooth water, and under an
angle of 52° 45', we shall remark that the common fasci
culus acts like the direct ray ; since it abandons to the
partial reflection a part of its molecules : as to the extra
ordinary fasciculus, it penetrates the liquid quite through.
If we suppose, on the contrary, that the principal section
of the rhomboid is perpendicular to the plane of incidence,
the extraordinary ray undergoes the partial reflection, and
the ordinary ray penetrates the liquid entirely.
   When we examine, by the help of a rhomboid of cal
careous spar, the light which is reflected on the surface of
the water, and under an angle <>f 42* 45', we see that it has
all the characters of one of the fasciculi produced by the
double refraction of a crystal, for it no longer constantly
separates into two fasciculi:       in this experiment, which
is in some measure the converse of that which we have
first referred to, the plane of reflection performs the office
of the principal section of the first rhomboid.         We have
only explained      these  results (which  are detailed  at great
length   in  the   elegant   work  by  M.  Malus,  to   which  the
Class decreed the prize of Mathematics for 1810) in order
to indicate the point from which the members of the Class
set out, who were occupied with this object in 181 1.
    We have hitherto only alluded to the modifications
which the luminous rays undergo in their reflection. Is th*
light transmitted by diaphanous bodies, even modified in
certain circumstances which we are about to mention ?
    If we place two object glasses, one above the other,
there are formed, as we all know, some coloured rings,
of which the point of contact is the common centre :
these rings are perceived either by the aid of reflected
or of transmitted light. When the angle of the rays trans
mitted with the surface of the object-glass is about 32°,
they are polarized, since in certain positions of the principal
section of a crystal of Icelandic spar, we see only a single
image of rings. Now, it is a very remarkable circum
stance in this experiment, that the modification which the
rays forming the rings undergo in passing through the
                                                           object

  136"                  Imperial Institute of France.        1
 object-glasses, is entirely identical with that which the re
 flection communicates to them ; so that, for instance, if in
 a determinate position of the object-glasses and of a crystal,
 when we look at the reflected rings, we only perceive the
image of the rings which proceed from the extraordinary
 refraction, it will still be the extraordinary image which we
 shall perceive, when in similar circumstances we shall
 examine the rings transmitted.                 This result, which M.
Arago communicated            to  the  Class  in  the month of February,
 seems   to  prove   that  the   coloured    rings are formed solely at
 the expense      of  the   light,   which    in the presence of the se
 cond lens     will  be   partially   reflected,    and thus establishes
an intimate       connection       between     these  two most extraor
dinary    classes   of the   phaenomena       of  optics.
    On the 1 Uh of March, M. Malus announced to the
 Class, that on subjecting, at various times, the light which
the glasses transmit under an angle of 35° 25 , he had
 ascertained that this light is composed of a certain quantity
of rays polarized in a direction contrary to the reflected
rays, and of another portion of rays not mod lied, which
preserve the properties of the direct light : this last portion
diminishes at each new transmission of the fasciculus ; so ~
that, if we pass through a pile of parallel glasses, the por-
tion of light transmitted is entirely polarized in one direc
tion, while the rays successively reflected are polarized in a
contrary direction.           M. Malus concludes from this, that
at all times, when by any contrivance we produce a ray
polarized in one direction, we necessarily obtain a ray
polarized in a direction diametrically opposite, and that
these rays follow different routes.              The observation of M.
Arago, which we have recently mentioned, forms the only
exception to this general rule, since the rings reflected and
transmitted are polarized in the same manner.
    M. Arago had long ago ascertained that diaphanous and ¦
opake bodies modify the light which they reflect : the me
tallic bodies alone seemed to him to impress no new pro
perty.      It is true that opticians were well aware that there
was a slight difference between the intensity of the two
images formed by a rhomboid, by the help of rays reflected
by a metallic plane : but this isolated fact could teach us
nothing relative to the particular mode of action of the
metallic bodies and of light.            But in a memoir read to the
Institute on the 27th of May 1811, M. Malus has shown,
by experiments made on rays already polarized, and by the
help of a method of which it would be difficult to give a
clear idea in an extract, that the light reflected by the me-

tals contains at once rays polarized in two directions, so
that, in its decomposition by a crystal of carbonate of lime,
it acts like the ordinary light. Hence it results, that all the
bodies in nature polarize the light under determinate an
gles, and I hat here and there among these angles the ravs
receive this modification in a very incomplete manner.

                            To   Mr. Tilloch.
Sir,    H A VINO been applied to           several persons in dif
                                                  by
ferent parts of the kingdom, for instructions respecting                   a
mode of ascertaining the quantity of acid in diluted sul
phuric acid,      Iinvariably referrea them to Dr. Kirwan's
Table, which was published in the year 1793 in the fourth
volume of the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy.
This however always proved unsatisfactory, inasmuch as
few manufacturers understood how to accommodate that
table to the common oil of vitriol, or make             applicable to
                                                           it
any practical purpose.         This  has  arisen   from   the circum
stance of Dr. Kirwan having taken sulphuric acid, as                       it
exists in sulphate of potass, instead of the strongest oil of
vitriol, for his standard of real acid. Having, in my own
 business, found the inconvenience of this,            I several years
ago   formed   aTable   for  my private use,     from   the  sulphuric
 acid of commerce,          by
                            diluting that acid with several suc
 cessive portions of water          table which

                                                       I
 employed with great advantage.             But as this table was
 formed at    atemperature above the mean temperature of the
 atmosphere, and its range was too confined to be of use in
 every instance,   I resolved to undertake the formation of                a
 new one that would be more generally useful, and that
 should descend         regular gradations down to the lowest
                       by
 point of dilution that any consumer of sulphuric acid
 would be likely to require *. Having now, at no small ex
 pense of time and labour, completed this Table,               shall be
                                                                  I

                                                  I             will be
 acceptable    and useful to many individuals               in various
 branches of trade and manufacture.
    In making this table, might have taken purified sulphuric
                             I
 acid, i.e. such as had undergone          second distillation; but

                                      is

1 62         A New     Tahle   of the Quantities of Acid
common acid, and to         take as good a sample of that kind   as
I  could possibly procure.       I have therefore chosen some
of my own manufacture, made in the usual way, and con
centrated, as is common in large manufactories, by steaming
it in a boiler of lead, and finishing it in a retort of glass.
When I began the experiment, the atmosphere of the room
was at 60°*, and the acid was of the specific gravity Of
 1,S4«4, which, at this temperature, is as strong as it is ever
sold.
   In order to form the annexed Table, I proceeded as fol
lows :
    I first accurately weighed ten thousand grs. of this acid
into a stoppered bottle of glass, and then added to it 100
grains of pure water f. When the mixture was become
cool, after having been sufficiently agitated, the specific
gravity of it was taken, and the result forms the first linfc
of the Table. In this way I continued to dilute the acid
with successive portions of water, taking care to let it rest
a sufficient time between each addition of the water, that a
complete union between the acid and the water might take
place j having found by experiment that a mixture of sul
phuric acid and water, even after it has become cold, re
quires several hours for it to arrive at the maximum of
condensation.       I took also the precaution of keeping it               ill
stoppered bottles, that       might not imbibe water from the
                             it
atmosphere, and frequently agitated         during each interval.
                                                      it
And, in order to attain as great accuracy as possible,       pro    I
cured   a   gravity bottle larger than usual, one that holds
nearly ten ounces of water, and with           stem so small that
                                                           a
at the part to which the fluid rises when properly filled,                 a
single drop of the liquor will occasion        rise of nearly one

sixteenth of an inch.
   The balance which       Imade use of        these experimentSj

f     In diluting sulphuric acid, it usual, Mid safer, to add the acid by de
                                       is
grees to the water, and not the water to the acid but with this very small

quantity of water, such caution was not necessary.
                                                                        Since

                in Sulphuric     Acid of different   Densities^           1 03
     Since    I  concluded these experiments it occurred to me,
that it might be useful to some manufacturers to know the
quantity of acid per cent, in diluted acid of any given
Strength; I have therefore calculated the quantity in each,
and annexed it.             The column of ounces and drachms is
added for the use        of those who are accustomed to trfls mode
of reckoning,        and also for those who are not conversant
with     the usual method of stating specific gravities ; and is
calculated on the supposition of the wine pint holding ex
actly sixteen ounces avoirdupois of pure water*.
    The sulphuric acid which is consumed in these kingdoms
amounts I believe to upwards of three thousand tons an
nually ; the greater part of which is used in a state of di
lution. For the purposes of dissolving iron or zinc, it
should be diluted with at least five or six times its weight
of water. Sulphuric acid is consumed in large quantities
by bleachers, for making the oxymuriate of lime, and these
people always use it in a state of dilution. The calico
printers also expend large sums in the purchase of this acid,
which they use in various states of dilution, for making
what they call sours.
    To these, and other manufacturers, this Table will be of
use, not only in assisting them in the formation of acid of
any given strength, but it will enable them at any time to
ascertain whether their servants have observed due care in
making the different preparations ; which is a matter of
great moment  for it often happens, that for want of this
the printer and manufacturer suffer great loss, and the
goods sustain an irreparable injury.
     J need scarcely add that the oil of vitriol-makers them
selves, may also derive great benefit from attending to this
Table.

     It is a convenient
                          way of measuring, to have a glass bottle with a nar
 row neck, bolJing rather more than a pint of water, with a mark on the
 stem exactly at the place to which the water ascends when it contains ex
actly 1C ounces avoirdupois of that fluid.       It was formerly understood
that the standard wine pint was the exact measure of 16 ounces of pure
water; but some experiments mi<de in the year 1688, before the Lord Mayor
and the Board of Excise, decided, that the scaled wine gallon of Guildhall
contains only 224 cubic inches, though by the fifth of Queen Ann, chap. vii.
$ 7, it i< called 231 inches.      This decWon makes the wine pint to hold
only 970 of an .ivoirdupois pound of water ; but as it is generally thought
right, for all common purposes still to consider it of the capacity of IS
ounce* avoirdupois, I nave taken it at that in this instance.

XXX I. An Account of some Experiments                 on the Combinations
    of different Metals        and Chlorine, &c.         By  John Davy,
    Esq.        Communicated by Sir Humphry                   Davy, Knt.
    LL.D.       Sec. R. S.
                            [Concluded from p. 91.]
5. On the Relation between t/ie Proportion of Oxygen and
            Chlorine in Combination with several Metals.
Errors          being very common in chemical analyses, even
in  those conducted most skilfully and caref ully, all possible
means should be taken to discover them ; and no means,
T think, promise to be more effectual for this purpose, than
the general analogy of definite proportions.                 From a great
variety     of  facts,  it  appears    that  oxygen   and   chlorine   com
bine with bodies in the ratio of 7'5 to 33-6. With one
                                                                         part

     Comllnations    of different Metals and Chlorine, &c. \69
part by weight of hydrogen, for example, 7*5 of oxygen
unite to form water, and 33*6 of chlorine unite with the
same     proportion to produce muriatic acid gas.     To judge
therefore of the accuracy of the analyses of the preceding
combinations of the metals and chlorine, it is only neces
sary to compare them with the analyses of the oxides of
the same metals. If the two agree, there will be reason to
consider them both correct ; but should they disagree, there
is equal reason for supposing one or both of them to be
wrong.
    Thus, as the orange oxide of copper is analogous to cu-
prane and the brown oxide to cupranea, the oxygen and
chlorine should be to each other in these compounds as
7-5 to 33*6.       And from comparison of my analysis, with
those of Mr.      Chenevix    and M. Proust, it appears, that in
the    two  first, copper being as 60, the oxygen is to the
chlorine as 7*79, instead of 7*5 to 33*77, instead of 33-6 ;
and in the two last as 7*5 to 33*6, or as 15 to 67*2.       Co
incidences as near as might be reasonably expected.
    There is not the same agreement between M. Proust's
analyses of the oxides of tin and the preceding ones of the
combinations of this metal and chlorine.       This discordance
induced me to repeat my analyses ; and obtaining the same
result as at first, I directed my attention to the oxides of
tin, and made the following experiments to ascertain the
proportion of their constituent parts.
    42-5 grains of tin, which had been precipitated from the
muriat of this metal by zinc, were heated with nitric acid
in a platina crucible, and slowly converted into peroxide ;
the acid and water were driven off by gentle evaporation at
 first, and afterwards by a strong red heat continued for a
quarter of an hour.       The peroxide thus produced was of a
light yellow colour; and being -very gradually dried, it was
semi-transparent, and hard enough to scratch glass; it
 weighed 54*25 grains.         Hence, as 42-5 grains of tin ac
 quire, on conversion into peroxide, 1 1*75 grains of oxygen,
 this oxide appears to contain 21*66 per cent, of oxygen,
just the quantity found in the native oxide by Klaproth,
 instead of 28, the proportion stated by Proust.
     M. Berthollet, jitn. has shown that M. Proust's estimate
 of 20 per cent, of oxygen in the protoxide is incorrect.
 To ascertain the true proportion, 20 grains of tin were dis
 solved in strong muriatic acid in a retort connected with a
 pneumatic apparatus, and without the assistance of heat ;

IfO         An Account of some Experiments          on the
hydrogea indicates an absorption of oxygen by the tift
equivalent to eight cubic inches, or (as 100 cubic inches
weigh 34* 2 graina) to 2*736 grains, the protoxide of tin
appears to contain 11*99 per
                                 cent, of oxygen.
   These analyses .of tbe oxides, compared with those of the
combinations of tin and chlorine, are found very nearly to
ftgree.   7 he ratio of oxygen to chlorine in the two first
similar compounds, tbe tin being as 5S, is as 7*5 to 33*4;
and in the two last, viz. the peroxide and the liquor of
Libavius, as 7*6 to 33*5, or as 15*2 to 67.
    As the black oxide of iron is formed by the decomposi
tion of ferrane by a solution of potash, and the red oxide
by that of ferranea, it is evident that these oxides and com
binations of iron and chlorine should coincide in the pro
portions of their constituent parte.      This appears from the
analyses* of Dr. Thomson to be nearly the. case; for iron
being as 29*5, the oxygen is to the chlorine in the black
oxide and ferrane as 8 instead of 7*5 to 33 6 ; and in the
two others as 8 to 33*6, or as 13-2 to 55*5. Here the agree
ment is less than in other instances; but this is not sur*
 prising considering the different estimates of the propor
tions of oxygen in the oxides of iron, and the difficulty of
 ascertaining them correctly.
    The yellow oxide of lead and the white oxides of anti
 mony, bismuth, zinc, and arsenic are formed, when the
 combinations of these metals and cblorine are decomposed
 by a solution of potash. But on comparison with the best
 analyses of the oxides, there is not, excepting in the case
 of zinc and arsenic, that coincidence of proportions which
 might be expected.     Zinc being as 34*.5, the oxygen in the
 oxide, from the analysis of Proust, is to the chlorine as
 7*5 to 34-4; and the arsenic being as 21*9, the oxygen,
 from the analysis of the same chemist, is to the chlorine as
 7*3 to 33*6.   The analyses of the oxides of the other metals
 being at variance with ihose of the chlorine combinations,
 I was induced to make the following experiments, with the
 hope of discovering the cause of the difference.
     100 grains of lead, which had been precipitated from th<l
 nitrat of lead by zinc, were dissolved in nitric acid and
 thrown down by carbonat of potash. This precipitate of
  carbonat of lead was well washed, and dried and heated to
  dull redness for a quarter of an hour in a platina crucible ;
  by this treatment all the carbonic acid was expelled ; the
  remaining yellow oxide weighed 107*7 grains, and it dis-

solved in muriatic acid without effervescing, and without
affording any residue of brown oxide.        Hence the yellow
oxide ot lead appears to contain 7*15 per cent, of oxygen.
And this proportion of oxygen in the oxide compared with
that of chlorine in plumbane, lead being as 97*2, appears
to be in the ratio of 7*5 to 33*8, instead of that of !5*fl
the estimate of Klaproth, or of 11-2 the estimate of Dr.
Thomson, to 33-8. Klaproth might have been misled by
considering the hydrated oxide as a true white oxide free
from water.                                   »
   According to M. Proust the peroxide of antimony con
tains 23 per cent, of oxygen, and the protoxide 18*.                           I
have repeated this chemist's experiments ; my results, in
which the peroxide is concerned, agree with his; but there
is not the same concordance in those relating to the pro
toxide. The protoxide I used was either prepared by the
decomposition of the butter of antimony, or of the sulphat,
by a boiling solution of carbonat of potash. This oxide,
in its purest state, I have always found, as M. Proust de
scribes it,  of light fawn colour before fusion, and after
               a
wards in mass of gray colour, and of radiated crystalline
                   a                                  a

in the state of powder with strong test nitric acid in                        a
platina crucible; when nitrous gas ceased to be produced,
the excess of nitric acid was expelled                by
                                                gentle heat, and

the oxide was heated to dull redness, the increase of weight
after this was equal to 10*4 grains nitric acid was again
                                                ;
added atul the process repeated, but without any alteration
of weight being produced. Hence, as the peroxide contains
53 per cent, the protoxide seems to contain 15 per eent.                      5
which proportion of oxygen very nearly agrees with that of
chlorine in the butter of antimony       for antimony being as
                                               ;
42-5, the former   is to the latter as 7*5 to 34-6 instead of
33*6. I    put some confidence in this estimate of the pro
portion of oxygen in the protoxide, not only on account of
its agreement with trie analysis of the butter of antimony,
but because   it was confirmed on the repetition of the ex
periment.
    Klaproth concludes from his experiments, that the oxide
of bismuth, prepared        means of nitric acid, contains 17*7
                            by
 per cent, of oxygen, and in consequence this oxide has been
considered distinct from that which        formedis   direct cal    by
cination of the metal, and which contains         much smaller  a
 proportion.    But there       reason to believe that this dif-

ference does not really exist, and that there is only one
known oxide of bismuth, and that Klaproth's oxide wat
an hydrated oxide; for I have found that 100 grains of
bismuth, converted by nitric acid into oxide, precisely id
the same manner as the protoxide of antimony was more
highly oxidated, gained only 11*1 grains. Klaproth did
not heat his oxide to redness, and hence apparently the
discordance.   From the above result, which I have con
firmed by repetition of the experiment, oxide of bismuth
seems to contain 10 per cent, of oxygen, and bismuth being
as 67*5, the oxygen in the oxide is to the chlorine in the
butter of bismuth as 7*5 to 34*8.
0. On the Relation         between the Proportion of Sulphur in
     the     Sulphurets, and the Proportion of Chlorine in some
     of    the Combinations of Chlorine and the Metals.
     The                              of the useful application
                last section afforded proofs
of   the general analogy of definite proportions in correcting
the results of chemical analyses. In the present section,
it is my intention to pursue a little further, the plan that I
have adopted in the preceding, and to apply another test to
the analyses of the combinations of the metals and chlorine,
by comparing some of them with the combinations of the
same metals and sulphur.
   I was first led to examine the sulphurets of tin on a dif
ferent account.     Aurum musivum, it has been observed, is
formed when stannane is heated with sulphur.        According
to M. Proust, this substance is a sulphuretted oxide of tin.
Were this opinion correct, an argument might evidently
be deduced from        in favour of the existence of oxygen in
                           it,
chlorine.    To satisfy myself respecting this, endeavoured
                                                     I
to ascertain whether any sulphureous acid gas                is
                                                      produced
by  the decomposition of aurum musivum
                                                     in by
                                                  heat, as            it   is
commonly asserted.          heated to redness
                                 I                   bent luted
                                                             a

the decomposition of stannane with sulphur        no more gas

phur sublimed, and          gray sulphuret of tin remained.
                                 a
These results have several times obtained, and not only
                     I
with aurum musivum prepared as the preceding, but with
some also made according to Woulfe's process.            As no
sulphureous acid gas was produced, and as sulphur sub
limed,      may be concluded that aurum musivum differs
            it
merely from the gray sulphuret in containing              larger  a
quantity of sulphur.      My next object was to ascertain the
            i                                                         exact

  Comlinations   of different Metals and Chlorine, &c.      1 73
exact proportion of sulphur in both these sulphurets, for
the sake of comparison with the combinations of tin and
chlorine.
    100 grains of tin in a finely divided state, as precipitated
from the muriat of this metal by zinc, were heated in a
glass tube intimately mixed with sulphur; the combination
of the two was accompanied with vivid ignition, the sul-
phuret formed weighed 127*3 grains, and broken, it ap
peared perfectly homogeneous ; it was pounded, and again
fieated with sulphur; but the excess of sulphur being ex
pelled, the fused sulphuret had not increased in weight.
                  I
The second time made this experiment,          I  obtained the
same result.
    Fifty grains of aurum musivum, purified from mixed sul
phur by exposure in a close vessel to a dull red heat, were
decomposed by a bright red heat in a small green glass tube
nicely weighed, and having only a very small orifice; the
Joss of sulphur, by conversion into the gray sulphuret, was
equal to 9-3 grains.      Hence, as 40*7 grains of gray sul
phuret contain 8*72 grains of sulphur, 50 grains of aurum
musivum appear to contain 18*02 grains.
    The ratio in which sulphur combines with bodies is to
that in which oxygen and in which chlorine combine, as
 15 to 7*5 and 33*6.     This appears from the proportions of
the constituent parts of sulphuretted hydrogen and sul
phureous acid gas, for I have found 100 cubic inches of the
former to weigh 36*64 grains, and 100 of the latter 68*44
grains,    In the comparison, therefore, between the sul
phuret* of tin and the combinations of this metal and
chlorine, 15 by weight of sulphur are equivalent to 33*6 of
chlorine.    And the tin being as 55, it appears from the
 analysis of the gray sulphuret and stannane, that the sul
 phur is to the chlorine as 15 exactly to 33*4; and from the
 analysis of the other two compounds, aurum musivum and
 the liquor of Libavius, as 15*5 to 33*5, or as 31 to 67-
    The proportions of sulphur in the two sulphurets of iron
 do not accord with the proportions of oxvgen in the oxides,
 or of chlorine in the chlorine combinations ; but I am yet
 ignorant of the cause of this difference.
     100 grains of lead, heated with sulphur in a glass tube,
 afforded, in two trials, 115*5 grains of fused sulphuret.
  Hence lead being as 97*2, the sulphur is to the chlorine in
 the respective combinations as 15*09 to 33*8.
    Sulphuret of antimony contains 25*9 per cent, of sulphur.
 Hence antimony being as 42*5, the sulphur in the sulphuret
 is (o the chlorine in the butter of antimony, as, 14*86 to
34*   fi;                                                   100

7.  On the Action   of muriatic Acid   on some Combinations        of
                     Chlorine and Metals.
   Sir Humphry Davy has pointed out in a great variety of
instances, the existence of an analogy between chlorine and
oxygen.    He has shown that the former, united with cer
tain inflammables, constitutes, like the latter, acid com
pounds ; and combined with metals, as it has already been
observed, substances     similar in many respects to metallic
Oxides.
   I have kept this analogy     in view in my inquiries,         and
                                                           di fee ted

     Combinations  of different Metals and Chlorine, iffc.  175
directed by it in my experiments, I have obtained some rtr
suits which appear to me to coincide with it.
   Thus having been led to try the action of muriatic acid
on different combinations of the metals and chlorine, I have
found ftiany of them capable of uniting with this acid, and
of forming compounds not dissimilar to some of those con
sisting of acids and metallic oxides.
   Corrosive sublimate, stannane, cuprane, and the com
binations of chlorine with antimony, zinc, lead, and silvef
are all soluble in different degrees in muriatic acid.
   Corrosive sublimate, which is but sparingly soluble in
water, and still more sparingly in the sulphuric and nitric
acids, is, I have ascertained, very readily soluble in muri
atic acid.    One cubic inch of the pommon strong acid
takes up about 150 grains of this substance, and when
gently heated, a quantity far more considerable, about 1000
grains.    The compound thus formed solidifies on cooling
into a crystalline fibrous mass of a pearly and brilliant
lustre.   It is decomposed by heat, the acid being first ex
pelled, and when exposed to the atmosphere, it effloresces
and appears to lose its acid, for afterwards analysed, it is
found to be pure corrosive sublimate.
   When I first tried the action of muriatic acid on the
different combinations of chlorine already mentioned, 1 was
not aware that Klaproth had before observed the solubility
of horn silver in this acid, and Mr. Chenevix that of cu
prane.    Horn silver, cuprane, and horn lead are precipi
tated from muriatic acid, unaltered by water.        Both the
hot saturated solutions of the two last compounds deposit
crystals on cooling ; those from the solution of the former
are of an olive green colour and of a prismatic form, and
consist of cuprane and muriatic acid ; those from the latter,
are small white brilliant plates.
    Finding the combinations of the metals and chlorine so
generally soluble in liquid muriatic acid, I expected -that
                                 muriatic acid gas; but none
that I have tried have possessed this property, not even the
liquor of Libavius.     Indeed this is not singular; for water
is necessarv to the composition of many saline bodies,
neutral carbonat of ammonia and nitrat of ammonia, for
instance, cannot be formed without the presence of water.
Neither is the precipitation of cuprane, horn silver, and
horfi lead from muriatic acid by waier extraordinary; there
Ire Several salts containing metallic oxides which are liable
to the same change, the oxides having less affinity for the
acid, than water has.

    The action of muriatic acid on the combinations of the
different metals and chlorine will, I have little doubt, afford,
when more minutely investigated, explanations of many
phenomena which are not yet well accounted for.                  Before
I  conclude, I shall mention only one instance to which it
already appears to be applicable.            M. Proust has observed
the decomposition of calomel by boiling muriatic acid, and
its conversion into corrosive sublimate and running mer
cury.     Now calomel being insoluble in muriatic acid, these
changes evidently appear to be owing to the strong attrac
tion of the acid for corrosive sublimate, which has been
already shown to exist.

    in the  Animal Fluids.

Sir,   The      attention which        I  have for some time paid to
the subject of animal chemistry, caused me to read with
much interest the controversy, which was carried on
through the medium of your Journal, between Dr. Pearson
and Dr. Marcet, respecting .the nature of the uncombined'
alkali in the serum of the blood.            I was induced to make
a considerable number of experiments upon the subject, the
result of which had led me to decide in favour of Dr. Pear
son's opinion ; but having communicated my doubts to
Dr. Marcet, he repeated and extended his former experi
ments in such a manner as, I think, firmly to establish the
fact, that the alkali is soda.            The detail of these experi
ments,     as contained     in  the  following letter of Dr. Marcet
to me, I have his consent to transmit to you for publica
tion, and I believe you will agree with mc in the opinion
that they must entirely set the question at rest.

    " My    dear Friend,  I feel much indebted to you
                                                               19. 1812.
for the remarks you have made, and the doubts you have
expressed in some of your last letters to me, respecting the
nature of the uncombined alkali in the incinerated salts of
                                                                serum ;

                      Alkali in       the   Animal Fluidsi              iH
scrum; they have induced me to reconsider the question,
and to add to my former inquiry on that head, a few new
results, which, I flatter myself, will remove every shadow
of doubt which         may remain on your mind in that respect.
     "   In my reply    to Dr. Pearson, in March last, 1 abstained
purposely from bringing forward any new data, because the
chief object of that letter was to vindicate former state
ments and inferences, and to show that there had not been,
as was argued by my opponent, any blunder in the mode
of reasoning by which I arrived at my conclusions.         In
deed it appeared to me hardly necessary to push the inquiry
any further; and I must own that from the manner in
which Dr. Pearson had thought proper- to carry on the
controversy, in his two letters on the subject *, I should
have felt great reluctance to resume the discussion, had it
not been for your interference.
   " Your objection, or rather your scepticism, arose from
your having found in a mass of salts from serum (by the
successive agency of acetic acid, alcohol, and tartaric acid,)
such quantities of potash as appeared to you to show that
the uncombined alkali was potash, and not soda ; and you
were further confirmed in this belief by observing that the
alkaline residue obtained by heating the acetat to redness
was deliquescent.      You will see, however, by the following
statements, that you were mistaken in your inference, and
yoa will, I make no doubt, admit that the potash which
you found in the alcoholic solution must have been in the
state of muriat; and that the deliquescent quality of the
alkaline residue must have arisen from your acetat having
been but imperfectly decomposed, on account of the too
low degree of ignition to which you had exposed            and    it,
perhaps    also  (a* you  have  yourself observed)   in conse
quence of the presence of muriatic salts.        But your ex
periments appear to show that the proportion which the
muriat of potash in the blood bears to the murrat of soda,
is greater than      had at first imagined
                     I                        and that we had
                                                       ;
both underrated the poweivof alcohol to dissolve muriat of
potash.
   " As to the point at issue, however; namely, the nature
of the uncombined alkali in the incinerated salts of blood,
the experiments upon which           think myself warranted to
                                            I
repeat, with increased confidence, my former opinion, that
the alkali    issoda, and not potash, were conducted in the
following    manner.

    " After    evaporating some human serum to siccity, in
cinerating the residue, dissolving in water the soluble sa
line substances contained in the incinerated mass, filtering
this solution and evaporating it again, the alkaline mass of
salts thus obtained was treated with acetic acid, and after
wards digested with five or six times its weight of alcohol
of the specific gravity of 815. The highly deliquescent re
sidue deposited by the evaporation of the filtered alcoholic
solution was then made red hot in a platina crucible, and
kept for a few minutes in a state of igneous fusion.           A
carbonaceous alkaline mass remained in the crucible, which,
after being exposed to the air 48 hours, in a room without
fire, and in damp though warm weather, did not exhibit
the least vestige of deliquescence. This mass, the quan
 tity of which amounted to four or five grains, being dis
solved in a little water, was divided into four portions, a,
b, c, d.
     " The portion a, being examined by re-ageilts, exhibited
 the following properties :
    "1. It contained abundance of muriatic acid.
     "  2. When suffered to evaporate spontaneously in a glass
           capsule, it left at the end of twelve hours a dry
           efflorescent crystalline substance which consisted
           principally of feathery crystals, amongst which
           were discovered groups of rectangular plates and a
           few minute cubes.
     " 3. The presence -of potash in this crystalline mass was
           made obvious both by the tartaric acid, and by oxy-
           murial of platina, though not so much so by the
           latter of these tests.
     "The portion b was saturated with sulphuric acid, and
 submitted to spontaneous evaporation.         The result was a
 rim of confused crystals, surrounding a group of regular
 efflorescent prisms of Glauber, being (at least some of
 them) terminated by distinct dihedral summits, and having
 sufficient magnitude to be identified by the naked eye, even
 at the distance of a few yards ; they were made to crystal
 lize over and over again, always with the same result ; but
 in some of these crystallizations a few crystals of sulphat
 of potash also appeared, the form of which was not equi
 vocal.
     "  The portion c, being treated with nitric acid, yielded
 by evaporation great numbers of rhomboidal crystals, per
 fectly distinct to the naked eye, and amongst which no
  form at all resembling that of nitre could be detected.

   *' My conclusion, therefore,
                                       (which I hope will now also
be yours,) is precisely as before; namely, that the potash
which exists in the animal fluids is in the state of muriat,
and that the whole of the uncombined alkali is soda; and
as it is a known fact that muriat of potash is in some de
gree soluble in alcohol^ the circumstance which led you
into error is easily explained.
   "  I have only further to add, that the fact which I have
endeavoured      to establish by a specific inquiry, ought to
have been inferred from principle ; for it is well known
that potash has a stronger attraction for the muriatic acid
than soda ; and indeed I understand that it is a common
process in some manufactures, to obtain soda by the action
f potash-ley on muriat of soda.

quence    of your suggestion, '    that the blood of graminivorous
animals might perhaps yield potash instead of soda, on
account of their living exclusively upon vegetable food,'
examined bullock's blood with a view to ascertain this cir
cumstance ; and as there was no difficulty in procuring any
 quantity of that blood, I had some gallons evaporated, from
which I procured some ounces of salts, in order to satisfy
those who think that nothing certain can be inferred from
experiments upon a small scale,               tjowever, the results
 were precisely similar, except that the crystals of sulphat
and nitrat of soda obtained by the processes above detailed,
were of much larger dimensions than in any of my former
experiments."

                           for Arsenic.
                          To  Mr. Tilloch.
Sir,   In   the last number of your Magazine, Mr. Hume
has thotight proper to repeat a complaint which he had
made in the Medical and Physical Journal for August last,
of my not having paid sufficient attention, in the paper to
which he alludes*, to a method which he had proposed
   " A Case of Recovery from the Effects of Arsenic,*' published in the
second volume of the Medico- Chirurgical Transactions.
                                  M   2                           some

180   Dr. Roget in Reply     to  Mr.  Hume on his Test for Arsenic*
Some years ago,       for the detection of minute quantities of
arsenic.     Lest any of your readers should be misled by the
assertions or' Mr. Hume, I beg leave to refer them to my
answer to his letter, which has appeared in the last number
of that Journal. It will there be seen, that so far is the
charge of plagiarism from being well founded, that, in the
Statement of which he complains, I have not only quoted
Mr. Hume's name, but have specifically pointed out his
claims to originality, and referred distinctly, not only to the
document on which they rest, but also to a work in which
a fulj account of all the modifications of his process, which
he afterwards published, is contained.         To those who will
take the trouble of reading what Mr. Hume had written on
the subject previous to the appearance of my own paper,
it will be sufficiently evident that the mode proposed by
Dr. Marcet is essentially different from any of those men
tioned by Mr. Hume, who, in recommending the employ
ment of nitrate of silver, has not even hinted at the possi
bility of substituting ammonia for the fixed alkalies. In
my answer to his letter I stated several reasons which led
me to prefer the former.             This would now be a super
fluous task, since Mr. Hume has himself become its pane
gyrist; for in speaking of a test similar lo Dr. Marcel's,
and which he calls the amnumiaco-nitrate of silver, he pro
nounces that " it must now supersede all other tests for
arsenic, and become the standard to future operators."
    When a test similar to the one on which Mr. Hume has
bestowed this high eulogium first occurred to Dr. Marcet,
and when we ascertained together all the collateral circum
stances mentioned in my paper respecting the limits of its
power, and the agencies of other metallic bodies on the
same test, we had not the smallest knowledge or recollec
tion of Mr. Hume's ever having turned his attention to the
subject of arsenic ; nor did any of the chemical friends, to
whom our experiments were shown, appear to have noticed
what he had written on the subject.             It was only at the
moment of sending our remarks to the press, that Dr.
Marcet met with a quotation in Dr. Henry's Elements of
Chemistry, which led me to read the letters of Mr. Hume,
to whose claims I was anxious to do, as I trust I have
done, every possible justice in the notice that I inserted in
my paper.
                                I am, sir,

XXXIV.       Chemical Researches on the Blood, and some other
    Animal Fluids.       By  William       Thomas Brands, Esq.
    F.R.S.     Communicated to the Society for the Improve
    ment of   Animal Chemistry, and by them to the Royal
    Society.
                       [Concluded  from p. 117.]
                           SECTION VI.
        Researches on the colouring     Matter of the Blood.
I.   To    procure this substance for experiments, I generally
employed venous blood which had been stirred during its
coagulation ; the fibrina is thus removed, and the colouring
matter diffused through the serum, from which it gradually
subsides, being difficultly soluble in that fluid j on decanting
off the supernatant serum, the colouring matter remains in,
a very concentrated form.           When other modes of procur
ing   it were  employed they      will be particularly mentioned;
but as I have not found the serum which is retained inter-
fere much with the effects of various agents upon the co
louring principle, the method just noticed was commonly
adopted.
    2. When the colouring matter thus collected is micro
scopically examined, it seems, as Lewenhoeck first ob
served*, to consist of minute globules.             These are usually
described as soluble in water, a circumstance which my
own observations led me to doubt, and which the more ac
curate experiments of Dr. Young, an account of which,
intended for publication, he has kindly permitted me to
 peruse, have completely disproved.
    3. The effect of water upon the red globules, is to dissolve
 their colouring matter, the globule itself remaining colour
less, and, according to Dr. Young, floating upon the surface.
    This aqueous solution is of a bright red colour, and not
 very prone to putrefaction.         When heated, it remains un
 altered at temperatures below loo0 or 200° Fahrenheit;            at
 higher temperaluresit becomes turbid, and deposits a pale
 brown sediment : if in this state it be poured upon a filter,
 the water passes through without colour, so that exposure
 to heal not only destroys the red tint, but renders the co
 louring matter insoluble in water.
     Alcohol and sulphuric ether added to this solution also
 render it turfiid, and when these mixtures were filtrated, a
 colourless and transparent liquor was obtained.

182             Chemical Researches on the Blood,
   4. The matter remaining upon the filter was insoluble in
water, in alcohol, and in sulphuric ether ; but when digested
in dilute muriatic or sulphuric acid, a portion was taken up
forming a brown solution.           T regard this soluble portion
as a modification     of the colouring matter produced by the
operation of heat : the insoluble residuum had the properties
pf albumen.
          5. Effects  of Acids  on the colouring   Matter.
   A. Muriatic acid poured upon the colouring matter of
the blood, renders one portion of it nearly insoluble and of
a bright brown colour : another portion is taken up by the
acid forming a dark crimson solution when viewed by re
flected   light; but when examined        by transmitted   light, it
has   a greenish hue.
   This solution remains transparent,       and its colour   is un
impaired by lone exposure to light, either in contact with
the air, or when kept in close vessels.       At its boiling tem
            the colour is also permanent.
perature
   Infusion of galls produces no change in this muriatic
solution, nor is its colour affected by carbonated alkalies,
even when added in considerable excess.
    It is rendered brown red by supersaturation with caustic
potash, but not with soda, nor ammonia: these, and espe
cially the latter, rather heighten its colour.
   When considerably diluted with w ater its original colour
is much impaired, and the green hue, which it always ex
hibits by transmitted light, becomes more evident.
   In preparing this solution, I 'frequently employed the
coagulum of blood cut into pieces, and digested in equal
parts of muriatic acid and water, at a temperature between
150° and 200".       In three or four hours the acid was poured
off, and filtrated. The clear solution was in all respects
similar to that above described, although before filtration it
appears of a dirty brown colour.
   I evaporated a portion of this muriatic solution in a wa
ter-bath, to dryness; it retained its colour to the last, and
left a transparent pellicle upon the evaporating bason, of a
dirty red colour : this when rcchssolved in muriatic acid
acquired its former tint, but the colour of its aqueous solu-
iion was nearer brown than red.
   B. Sulphuric acid, diluted with eight or ten parts of
water, forms an excellent solvent of the colouring principle
of the blood.
                                                                 It

                  and some other Animal Fluids.            185
    It may be employed in a more concentrated state ; but
the bright colour or the solution is in that case apt to be
impaired, and when more largely diluted with water, its
action is slow and uncertain.      Either the sediment of the
colouring matter from the serum, or the crassamentum of
the blood, may be indifferently employed in forming these
solutions.
   When dilute sulphuric acid is added to the colouring
matter, it renders it slightly purple; and if no heat be ap
plied, the acid when poured off and filtered, is colourless ;
so that dilute sulphuric acid when cold, does not dissolve
this colouring principle.
    One part of the crassamentum of blood cut into pieces,
was put into a matrass placed in a sand heat, with about
three parts of dilute sulphuric acid.   It was kept for twelve
hours in a temperature never exceeding 212°, nor beljw
 100°.    After twenty-four hours the acid was filtered off,
and it exhibited a beautiful bright lilac colour, not very
intense, and Hinted with green when viewed by trans
mitted light.
   This solution is nearly as permanent as that in the mu
riatic acid. Some of it which has been kept for a month
in an open vessel, often exposed to the direct rays of the
sun, is very little altered.
   When diluted with two or three times its bulk of water,
the lilac tint disappears,   and the mixture is only slightly
green.
    When exposed to heat, the colour gradoally changes as
the acid becomes more concentrated by evaporation, and
when reduced to about half its bulk the lilac hue is de
stroyed.
   The solutions of pure and carbonated alkalies when added
in excess, convert the colour of this sulphuric solution to
brownish red; but in smaller quantities, they merely impair
it by  dilution.
   C. Nitric acid,   even much diluted, is inimical to the co
louring matter of   the blood.
    A few drops added to the muriatic or sulphuric solution,
gradually convert their colour to a bright hrown, and large,
quantities produce the same change immediately.
   The action which this acid exerts upon the colouring
matter under other circumstances is nearly similar, and al
ways attended with its decomposition, so that my attempts
to procure a red solution in this menstruum uniformly
failed of success,
   P. Acetic acid dissolves a considerable quantity of the
                                M4                  colouring

184            Chemical Researches on the Blood,
colouring matter of the blood ; the solution is of a deep
cherry red colour.     When somewhat diluted, or when ob
served in tubes of about a quarter of an inch bore, this so
lution appears perfectly green by transmitted light.       In its
other habitudes it nearly resembles the muriatic solution.
   £. The solution of the colouring matter in oxalic acid is
of a brighter red than those hitherto noticed ; that in citric
acid is very similar to the acetic solution, and with tartaric
acid the compound somewhat inclines to scarlet. AH these
solutions exhibit the green hue, to which I have so often
alluded, in a remarkable degree.
   6. Effects   of Alkalies  on the colouring Principle of the
                              Blood.
   The caustic and the carbonated alkalies form deep red
solutions of this substance, which are extremely perma
nent.
    1. Solutions of pure potash, and of the subcarbonate, take
up a large proportion of the colouring matter of the blood.
The intensity of the colour of ibis solution, when concen
trated, is such, that it appears opake, unless viewed in small
masses, or in a diluted state, when it is of a bright red co
lour.
    2.  In soda and its subcarbonate, the solution     has more
of   a crimson hue, which colour is extremely bright in its
concentrated statu.
   3. The solution in liquid ammonia approaches nearer to
scarlet than that in which the fixed alkalies are employed.
   4. When these alkaline solutions are supersaturated with
muriatie acid, or with dilute sulphuric acid, they acquire a
colour nearly similar to the original solutions in those acids
which have been above described.
   5. Nitric acid added in small quantities, or even to sa
turation of the alkaline menstruum, heightens the colour of
the three compounds; but when there is a slight excess, a
tint of orange is produced, which soon passes into bright
yellow.
   6. The alkaline solutions may be evaporated nearly to
dryness without losing their red colours ; during the eva
poration of the ammoniacal solution, the alkali flies off, and,
a brown-red solution of the colouring matter in water re
 mains.
   Having ascertained      the above facts respecting the co
louring principle of the blood, I next proceeded to examine
how far it was susceptible of entering into those combina
                                                            tions

                  and some other Animal Fluids.             18S
tions which are peculiar to other varieties of colouring
matter.
    These experiments I shall detail in the order in which
they were made.
    1. Some pure alumine was added to a concentrated
aqueous solution of the colouring matter of the blood, and
alter twenty-four hours the mixture, which had been fre-
           agitated during that period, was poured upon a
Suently
  Iter, and the residuum washed with hot distilled water.
    The filtrated liquor had lost much of its original colour;
the alumine had acquired a red tinge; it was dried at a
temperature between 70° and 80s, during which it became
brown.
    2. Two hundred grains of alum were dissolved in four
fluid ounces of a solution of the colouring matter, similar to
that employed in the last experiment.        The colour of the
compound was bright red.         Liquid ammonia was added,
and the precipitate collected, and carefully dried.      It was
of a dirty red, and after some days exposure to light be
came nearly brown.
    From these, and other experiments which I have not
thought it necessary to detail, it appears that alumine will
not form a permanent red compound with the colouring
principle of the blood ; I was therefore next induced to
employ oxide of tin.
    3. Fifty grains of crystallized muriate of tin (prepared
by boiling tin filings in muriatic acid, and evaporating the
solution,) were dissolved in four ounces of the solution of
colouring matter, which immediately assumed a purple
tint, and became afterwards brown.         It was diluted with
twice its bulk of water, and put aside in a stopped phial.
 On examining it three days afterwards, a small quantity of
a bright red powder was observed at the bottom of the
phial, which proved to consist of the colouring principle
 combined with the metallic oxide.      A portion or this com
 pound which has been kept in water for sortie weeks has
 undergone no change of colour; but when dried by ex
 posure to air, it loses its brilliant tint, and becomes of a
 dull red hue.
    To a compound solution of muriate of tin and colouring
 matter, similar to that employed in the last experiment,      I
 added a sufficient quantity of solution of potash to decom
 pose the salt of tin.    The precipitate thus obtained was
 collected, and dried by exposure to the air of a warm room.
 It was of a dull red colour, and has undergone no apparent
                                                        change

  three weeks.
     4. Finding that supertartrate of potash exalted the colour
 of the blood, I endeavoured to form a compound of it with
  that substance and oxide of tin, and thus, in some measure,
 to imitate the process in which cochineal is employed for
 the production of scarlet dye; but although a bright red
 compound is produced, when it is dried at a very moderate
 temperature its colour becomes similar to that of the other
 combinations which 1 have described.
     These experiments I repeated in various way», occa
 sionally applying the salt of tin as a mordant to woollen
 cloth, linen, &c. ; but the brilliancy of the colour was
 never permanent.
     5. Having observed that infusion of galls and decoction
 of oak bark no not impair the colour of the blood, I con
 ceived that solution of tannin might answer the purpose of
 a mordant, as it is effectually employed by dyers in giving
 permanence to some of their red colours.
     I accordingly impregnated a piece of calico with decoc
 tion of oak Dark, and afterwards passed it through an
 aqueous solution of the colouring matter of blood.        When
 dry, it was of a dirty red colour, nearly similar to that which
 would have been obtained had no mordant been applied :
 when however an alkaline solution of the colouring matter
 was employed, the colour was equal to that of a common
madder red, and as far as I have been able to ascertain, it is
 permanent.
    6. A solution of superacetite of lead was impregnated
with the colouring matter of the Mood. The compound
was bright red : no spontaneous change took place in        it,
and on the addition of an alkali      a  white precipitate was
formed, the fluid retaining its former tint.
    From this and other experiments, in which          itwas at
tempted to combine oxide of lead with the colouring of the
blood,    itwould appear that there    isno attraction between
those two substances.
    7. The most effectual- mordants, which  I   have discovered
for this colouring matter, are some of the solutions of mer
cury, especially the nitrate, and corrosive sublimate.
    Ten grains of nitrate of mercury (prepared with heat and
containing the red oxide) were dissolved in two fluid
ounces of solution of the colouring of the blood.
               a                                           After
some hours     adeep red compound was deposited, consisting
chiefly of the metallic oxide combined with the colouring
                                                         matter,

                  and some other Animal Fluids.            187
matter, and a small portion of coagulated albumen. The
remaining fluid had nearly lost its red colour.
     The nitrate of mercury containing the black oxide, pro
duces nearly similar effects, excepting that the colour of
the compound is of a lighter red.
     When corrosive sublimate is added to the solution of the
colouring matter, its tint is instantaneously brightened,
and it becomes slightly turbid from the deposition of al
bumen.       If this be immediately separated by a filter, the
liquor which passes through gradually deposits a deep red
or purplish insoluble precipitate, and if it now be again
filtrated the liquid is colourless, the whole of the colouring
principle being retained in the compound which remains
upon the filter.
     By impregnating some pieces of woollen cloth with so
 lution of nitrate of mercury, or of corrosive sublimate, and
 afterwards steeping them in an aqueous solution of the co
 louring matter of the blood, I succeeded in giving them a
 permanent red tinge, unalterable by washing with soap ;
 and by employing the ammoniacal solution of the colour
 ing matter, calico and linen may be dyed with the same
 mordant.
      In these experiments I was much satisfied by the com
  plete separation of the colouring matter from its solutions,
  which after the process were perfectly colourless.
                          SECTION VII.
       Some Remarks on the preceding experimental Details.
      From the experiments related in the second section of
  this paper, it appears that sulphuric aeid effects changes
  upon the coagulum of chyle, similar to those which Mr.
  Hatchett has observed to result from the action of dilute
  nitric acid upon the coagulated white of egg. This last
  substance, however, is not convertible into gelatine by
  means of sulphuric acid, whereas in these respects the curd
  of milk resembles that of chyle :( this circumstance, as
  well as the more ready solubility of the coacjnlnm of chyle
  in dilute than in concentrated acids, points out a strong
   analogy between those two bodies
       The sweet taste of chyle naturally suggested the idea of
   its containing sugar*; but lam not aware of any direct
   experiments which have demonstrated its existence, and
   have therefore detailed minutely such researches as I have
   been enabled to make upon the subject, hoping at some
   future period to render them more complete.

 188              Chemical Researches on the Blood,
    The experiments to prove              the non-existence of gelatine
in the serum of blood, will,            I  trust, be deemed sufficiently
decisive : they show that that abundant proximate principle
pf animals is not merely separated from the blood, in which
it has been supposed to exist ready formed, but that it is aa
actual product of secretion.
    The proportion of iron afforded by the incineration of
several varieties of animal coal, is much less considerable
than we have been led to expect ; and the experiments no
ticed in the fifth section show that it is not more abundant
in the colouring matter of the blood than in the other sub-
stances which were submitted to examination ; and that
traces of it may be discovered in the chyle which is white,
in the serum, and in the washed crassamentum or pure
fibrin*.
   The inferences to which I have alluded, in the first sec
tion of this paper, are strongly sanctioned by these facts,
and coincide with the opinion which has been laid before
the Royal Society, by Dr. Wells*, respecting the peculiar
nature of the colouring principle of the blood, and support
the arguments which are there adduced.
    That the colouring matter of the blood is perfectly inde
pendent of iron, is, I conceive, sufficiently evident from its
general chemical habitudes, and it appears probable that it
may prove more useful in the art of dyeing than has hitherto
been imagined, since neither the alkalies nor the acids
(with the exception of the nitric) have much tendency to
alter its hue. The readiness, too, with which its stains are
removed from substances to which no mordant has been
applied, seem to render it peculiarly fit for the purposes of
the calico-printer.         I have not extended these experiments,
nor have I had them repeated on a sufficient scale to enable
me to draw more general conclusions respecting the possi
bility of applying them with advantage in the arts : this
would have led me into too wide a field, and one not im
mediately connected with the objects of this Society : the
subject, however, appears important.                .
    It is not a little remarkable that blood is used by the
Armenian dyers, together with madder, in the preparations
of their finest and most durable redsf, and that it has even
been found a necessary addition to insure the permanency
of the colour %. This fact alone may be regarded as de-

principle of the blood, for the compounds of that metal

    VVhilse engaged in examining the colouring matter of
the blood, I received from Mr. William Money, house sur
geon to the general hospital at Northampton, some men-
struous discharge, collected from a woman with prolapsus
uteri, and consequently perfectly free from admixture of
other secretions.    It had the properties of a very concen
trated solution of the colouring matter of the blood in a
diluted serum, and afforded an excellent opportunity of
corroborating the facts respecting this principle, which,
have been detailed in the preceding pages.         Although                I
could detect no traces of iron, by the usual modes of
analysis, minute portions of that metal may and probably
do exist in   it,
                as well as    the other animal fluids which
                              in
I  have examined    ;but the abundance of colouring matter
in this secretion should have afforded     proportional quan
                                               a
tity of iron, did any connection exist between them.                     It
has been observed that the artificial solutions of the co
louring matter of the blood invariably exhibit        green tint

                                                 the above ex
periments may prove useful to the physiological inquirer:
they account for the rapid reproduction of perfect blood
after very copious bleedings, which    quite inexplicable upon
                                          is
that hypothesis which regards iron as the colouring matter,
and may perhaps lead to the solution of some hitherto un
explained phsenomena connected with the function of re»
spiration.   There can,     Ithink, be little doubt that the
formation of the colouring matter of the blood       connected
                                                          is

                        a

such modifications of animal matter, and not, as some have

    some Observations in Reply to an Article in the Philoso
    phical Magazine for June.                 By James Ogjxby, M. D.
                                To   Mr.     Ttlloch.
 Sir,    I    have noticed in your valuable publication for last
 June,    some   observations upon a communication which               I
   had the honour of laying before the Kirwanian Society, re
   lative to a proposal which Sir H. Davy suggested for the
   improvement of the process of bleaching linen and cotton
   cloth in Ireland, in the course of a, lecture delivered by
  him at the Dublin Society, upon the subject of oxymuriatic
  acid and its combinations.      The person who has signed his
  name to those observations has thought proper to apply
  some very strong expressions to my communication ; he
  terms it an " incorrect statement," accuses me of " ig
  norance of the facts," brings forward a letter from his bro
  ther, a Dublin apothecary, in further confirmation of the
"     inaccuracy of my statements," and seems to feel a de
  gree of satisfaction, upon the dreadful fate they will meet
  with in the scientific world, according to his expectation.
      Should I succeed,(in the following pages, in satisfying all
  those of your readers who are interested in and competent
 judges of this subject, that those observations upon my
 paper contain an erroneous, partial and mutilated state
 ment of the facts, that those persons who have thought
 proper to stand forward as the advocates for Sir Humphry's
 proposal are totally destitute of all knowledge of the sub
ject, and have throughout the discussion betrayed the
 grossest ignorance upon every topic connected with            it,
                                                             and
 that my original statement stands perfectly correct       ;hope
                                                            I
 that any expressions      Imay use will not be ascribed to          a
 desire on my part to imitate the example of my assailant,
but to the difficulty which naturally presents itself to the
rebutting of misrepresentations, without employing terms
which to some may appear harsh.            As to the irrelevant
epithets    employed       by
                           the person  alluded to, who   under

     It has been suggested to me, that as my observations
                                                                were

were levelled at the proposal. of Sir H.Davy, and the ani
madversions upon them have issued from the laboratory of
the Royal Institution, a department over which he has the
entire control, I should be justified, under such circum
stances, in considering him as the author, and the person
who signs his name as no more than a mere instrument,
and that I should consequently leave the latter altogether
unnoticed in the controversy.        It would, however, be un
fair to hold Sir Humphry accountable for the indiscreet
zeal of his admirers.      It is perfectly obvious that the arti
cle inserted in your number for June could not have been
written by that gentleman, and it is possible that the ani
madversions alluded to were published even without his
knowledge : but as they must since have met his eye, as
they were intended to serve him, and as they may be con
sidered as flowing from his own proposition, it is impossi
ble I should keep him out of view in the observations            I
have now to offer.       It would however perhaps be expect
ing   too  much  to  look  for an answer from himself, consi
dering    how  many important objects must occupy his at
tention.
    I shall now proceed to put your readers in possession of
as clear and succinct an account of the facts and circum
stances connected with Sir Humphry's proposal, as full
and accurate notes of his lectures, and considerable atten
tion to the subject enable me to do; and shall add, as I go
along, the substance of my former remarks, as well as some
observations in reply to the article in your publication for
June, already adverted to.
    In the years 1810 and 1811, Professor Davy, at the re
quest of the Dublin Society, delivered two very short courses
of lectures, which he termed Electro-chemical, in the la
boratory attached to that Institution.         In the course of
 those lectures, when treating of oxymuriatic acid and its
alkaline and earthy combinations, he necessarily alluded to
the subject of bleaching, and stated how happy he felt
 himself, that upon a subject of such national importance
he had it in his power, in return for the great politeness and
attention with which he had been received and heard in
 Ireland, to offer a proposal which he conceived would ma
 terially benefit that art. He then observed, in speaking of
 the oxymuriate of lime, now generally used in the process,
 that this salt he conceived could not, with safety to the
cloth, be used in bfeaching ; for he observed, he said, that
 bits of linen cloth steeped in a strong solution of muriate
 of lime were much injured in their texture, or actually
                                                          rotted.

  192 On Improvements      in bleaching Linen and Cotton Clot Hi
  rotted.    These experiments were however not detailed, or
  any satisfactory account given of them, nor were they ever
  committed to printi " Now," said he, in proceeding, '« if
  a strong solution of muriate of lime destroys the vegetable
  fibre, a weak one must have a similar, though a diminished
  effect ; and therefore the oxymuriate of lime cannot be used
  with safety in bleaching."       This was the only reason ad
  vanced by the learned Professor in urging the propriety of
  adopting his important proposal, ana rejecting an article-
 which has been for years in general use for whitening even
 the most delicate fabrics of flax and cotton in every part
 of the empire, not to say of Europe. In support of this
 reasoning, the Professor related a story of a respectable
 apothecary in Dublin, who in the way of business was
 preparing some muriate of lime for a customer, and that
 in drying the crystals upon a cotton cloth, it was found
 quite rotten after the operation.      Many doubts as to this
 supposed fact immediately arose in the minds of some of
 the hearers ; some             ted that the cloth might have
 been previously purged by active preparations, or caustic
 alkalis ; others, that the liquor of the crystals might have
 contained free muriatic acid ; or, what is not very impro
 bable, that the cloth might have come rotten from the
bands of the manufacturer.
      It would be needless to multiply arguments, to show the
 impropriety which there would be in admitting such an
 observation as this in support of a proposal to introduce a
 material alteration or improvement in an art of such vital
 consequence to Ireland, and so intimately connected with
her staple manufacture.
     rThis advocate of Professor Davy takes upon him to
deny his ever having made use of the incorrect mode of
reasoning which I have attributed to him, and which            I
have quoted from notes taken at his lectures, and attempts
to obviate the force of my observations by substituting a
sentence, which I can prove was used, not in treating of the
subject in question, but upon an occasion altogether dif
ferent.
     In taking notes of Sir Humphry's lectures, I never at
tempted, nor perhaps was it possible, to take down the lan
guage verbatim ; but that the expressions I have attributed
to him contain the substance of what he said, and what
he meant to convey, and nothing else ; and that the sen-
fence could not be altered in its meaning by any mere
change of diction, I must positively maintain, and will
continue to do so, as      I have the strongest confirmation of
                                                              it

strongly upon the memories of those concerned; and           may I
mention an incidental circumstance confirming fully the
accuracy of my statement, and which occurred during                      a
conversation that took place upon this subject at the last
meeting of the Kirwanian Society.            gentleman remark

Humphry's last course of lectures in Dublin, and who was
particularly attentive in collecting the general principles of
the science laid down                by
                                the lecturer, no sooner heard
what the point in dispute was, than he had         perfect recol

lection of       it,
                 and accounted for the strong impression                 it
had made upon his mind,               by
                                 remarking, that for some years
before he had been in the habit of using,                   by

it immediately struck him, upon hearing the new doctrine,
that this practice must have been extremely imprudent,
since      it undeniable that undiluted sulphuric acid will

instantly'uestroy that important organ, and life itself.
     It  now said that the argument which the Professor

 words, so familiar to every student in the science but          ;       it

 he used them, nor can they have any thing to do with                    it,

who was busily and usefully employed during the lecture*
in attending the experimenter, scouring the Voltaic wires,
dipping the plates, charging retorts, blowing the fire, or
working the air-pump, can be brought forward with the
smallest effect against many of Sir Humphry's audience, of
long standing in the science, and whose attention was not
diverted from the immediate object of the lecture by similar
duties?     It is rather fortunate for me however, in this con
troversy, that could I even grant that I was in error upon
this point, and relinquish my ground, my objections to the
proposed new process would still remain in lull force, and
the more so, since the ground has been shifted upon which
it originally rested.
   It can now be no longer maintained by any one, that this
proposal should be adopted by the bleacher, because a strong
solution of muriate of lime rots linen cluth (supposing it an
established fact), the conclusion drawn from this being
now given up, that a weak solution should do so likewise.
    But let us examine if the chemical law already quoted
 (" that bodies in their nascent state act with more energy
than when they have been formed") can possibly be brought
forward in support of this project, or if it has the smallest
bearing upon the subject.         Oxymuriate of lime                is,
                                                                  pre     I

oxygen from the water, (which the oxymuriatic acid                said    is
to decompose,) acts upon the colouring matter of the cloth,
and of course bleaches it. Now, supposing for                 moment

conjecture any other than this untenable speculation, which
can he brought forward to prop up this favourite proposal,
of such " national consequence to Ireland."
   But will a set of changes rung upon technical terms con
vince the practical bleacher, that he ought to discard a sub
stance which he has used for years in whitening the most
delicate fabrics, with perfect" and proved safety, and to sub
stitute another compound, one of the ingredients of which
he has no known means of procuring at less than one hun
dred times the expense of the other?         The best magnesia
in Ireland cannot be purchased for less than 2s. 9a. per
lb.; the worst, 1*. 8d. Lime is not one farthing per
pound.
   It is not possible that Sir Humphry can be ignorant
that it is a primary object with the bleacher, not only to
send his goods to market perfectly sound, but to use such
an (Economical process as shall enable him to meet his
tompetitors in the market upon equal terms, and adjust his
prices to the demand.              v
     No matter then how apparently eligible any new in
gredient proposed may be, or how applicable to his art ; he
js necessitated to decline its use if very expensive, unless
he finds it indispensable to his process.
    In treating of the oxymuriate of potash, an article which
is yet used in bleaching, and to some extent in this coun
try, the only objection which Sir Humphry stated (for oxy-
muriate of potash has no action on the vegetable fibre)
against its use in the general business of bleaching, was its
greater expense than oxymuriate of lime.         This objection
applies with four-fold force against the use of oxymuriate
of magnesia, which would cost four times the price of
oxymuriate of potash, and at least six times the expense of
oxymuriate of lime!        A manufacturer of bleaching salts
in this city assures me that the salt of magnesia could not
be supplied to the bleacher for less than 45. per lb.      The
 salt of lime is only 8d. ! And it is a fact worth mentioning,
for the information of Sir Humphry, that many bleachers
 in Ireland are restrained from even the use of the oxymu
riate of lime, for no other reason than its high price; so
that, w hen the weather is favourable for whitening, they
depend entirely upon the old process.
    It is not mere processes (for we abound .with them) that
we want, to accomplish almost every desideratum in the
arts, but it is ceconomical processes, which shall be con
sistent with and applicable to practice.      If Sir Humphry,
or any one else, will furnish the Irish bleachers with

 was not only unnecessary, but absurd and ruinous for him
 to attend to it.        understand that the Professor bad an in

 use of the oxymuriate of lime.
 I    am accused of having erroneously stated as an assertion
 of Sir Humphry's, that the salt of magnesia had entirely
 superseded the salt of lime among the bleachers in Ireland.
    have to remark that this defender of Sir Humphry has
                                              " entirely," on his own

                                it   is
 what   is the answer to this.                         is,
                                              that Mr. Davy has only

 asserted that an enlightened individual has yet acted upon
 his proposal. Thus, then,              brought forward as
                                          it   is                  matter       a

 practice    a proposal the professed object of which was to
benefit the staple manufacture of Ireland.

attacked ; and he assured me, and gave me authority to
state, that in the process of what is properly called bleaching,
he had never given his approbation of the employment of
the oxymuriate of magnesia ; it was only in a particular
operation in calico-printing, called clearing, that he could
see any reason for using this substance; and it was not
because muriate of lime destroyed the vegetable fibre that
he was led to the use of            it,
                                     but upon different principles,
no* one of which the Professor even hinted at in any of
his lectures before Mr. Duffy had sent               communication to
                                                        a

                                     it is
of Mr. Duffy, that      I   state      as his opinion, that the oxy
muriate of' lime can be employed in bleaching with perfect
safety;    and the fact       is, that in his preparatory process of
whitening the cottons he still uses this salt. He says, indeed,
that  if   anyone will give him magnesia at one penny per
pound, he will then prefer the magnesian salt; but not at all
in consequence of Sir Humphry's opinion that the salt of
lime  is  injurious to the texture of the cloth, but for other
reasons, and principally because magnesia has much less
action upon the dyed colours than lime has;  subject                  a
upon which the Professor did not give the slightest hint at
 the time he made his proposal.                Mr. Duffy, in polite

letter to Sir Humphry, gave him credit as the suggester of
such an improvement,            it  can only be inferred that Mr.
Duffy    has  been  extremely liberal, and has acted with much
 self-denial ;  for I   am fully convinced that he himself has
 the whole credit of the improvement; for nnless mentioning
 the mere name of       a  substance pan be construed into          hint    a
 to the calico-printer to apply           to it particular process, Sir

  Mr. Duffy indeed, in a postscript to his letter, mentions his
  having heard a report that the bleachers of fine linens had
  discontinued the use of the lime or potash liquors, fearing
  their influence on the texture.    I can positively state, how
  ever,  from  actual experience, that such a report is quite un
  founded.     In the neighbourhood of Belfast (the fine linen
  county) there are few bleach greens in which those liquors
  are not at present employed to a greater or less extent, as
 may be consistent with the comparative expenses of «he
  old and new methods.       Having been myself familiarized
 for the greater part of ten years with the bleaching opera
 tions as carried on in the north of Ireland, in some of the
 principal greens, having first attended to chemistry with a
 view to this art, and been called as evidence upon more
 than one occasion before the Linen Board, during their in
 vestigations respecting the new mode of bleaching, I can
 safely state it as the legitimate conclusion from these in
 quiries and my own experience, that there are no grounds
 whatever for rejecting the oxymuriatic salts in bleaching,
 except those arising from the gross ignorance of most of
 the foremen bleachers, who being altogether unacquainted
 with the most simple principles of chemistry, cannot possi
 bly have skill sufficient to apply any new agent possessed
 of much efficacy to their art, without almost the certainty
 of doing some damage to the goods. The accidents which
 happened at the first introduction of oxymuriatic acid
 arose principally from this cause, in conjunction with the
 blunders of ignorant and designing foreigners who pre
 tended to teach the bleachers.
     It strengthens my own opinion materially upon this sub
ject, to find that I coincide in opinion exactly with a gen
 tleman of much knowledge and experience upon the sub
ject, and who has been for a series of years employed by
 the Trustees of the Linen Manufacture to inspect and di
 rect all the chemical operations of the bleachers.           Mr.
 Higgins also informs me, that not less than sixteen years ago
he tried the bleaching powers of the oxymuriate of mag
nesia, found them interior to the salt of lime, and at once
saw the absurdity of proposing a substance so much beyond
 the reach of the bleacher.
    Nothing can be more harmless than to say, that          if Sir
 Humphry gives us magnesia for a penny per pound, we
 will make atrial of his proposal. We may also say, that ifht
gives us silner or potassium or sodium at the same price, wo
 will apply them to many valuable purposes in the arts;

    Professor Davy having stated that bits of linen cloth
steeped even for a few hours in strong solutions of muriate
of lime were rotted, and having upon this supposed fact
grounded his proposal of rejecting the oxymuriate of lime
from bleaching,  1 shall conclude this letter by stating the
result of two experiments out of a great number which            I
made in consequence, all of which gave similar results.
    Experiment 1.  Dec. 16, 1811.          Steeped a cutting of
full bleached anil perfectly sound linen, previously macerated
in hot water to remove any dressing, in a solution of
neutral muriate of lime made in the proportion of two
ounces of the salt to eight ounces of water.
    Note.  The yellowish brown insoluble matter which
rose to the surface was removed by filtration, before the
immersion of the linen.
    17th. Linen taken out of the solution, washed, com
pared with an unsteeped piece of the same cloth, found
perfectly sound, and not perceptibly reduced in its texture.
Repeated the steeping in a fresh solution somewhat in
creased in strength.
    Note  After twelve hours immersion of the lime, tested
the solution with litmus, and did not discover any disen
gaged acid.
    18th.  Linen examined as before, no change, washed,
dried, and repeated the steep in a fresh solution of the same
6trength.
    19th  Linen perfectly sound, repeated the steeping.
    20th.  No perceptible change ; the linen resisted equal
efforts to tear  it, as the unsteeped piece.
    Experiment    2.   Dec. 2S.  Steep«d another cutting of
full bleached sound linen      in   a solution composed of two
ounces of muriate of lime to four ounces of water.
   29th.  Linen taken out of the solution, washed, examined,
and found unaltered.         Repeated   the steeping in  a   fresh
solution similar to the last.
    30th.  No change     in the texture of the linen, steeped as
before.
    3l6t.  Linen not perceptibly reduced, or %veakened, in
 comparing  it  with some which had 1101 been    in  the solution.
    The solutions used in these experiments were at least
 500 limes the strength that thev ever occur     in  the common
 process of steeping in the oxymuriate of lime, and the
jiuen used had undergone the full process of bleaching;         by

 which it was to a certain degree already reduced, and its
 colouring matter so completely separated as not to impede
 the action of any corrosive agent upon its fibres. Is it not
 then more than probable, if in any instance sound cloth
 is tendered in the usual process with the salt of lime, that
it must either be owing to an error in using too strong a
 solution of the salt, to the presence of free muriatic acid,
 or to negligence in the after treatment of washing, sour
ing, &c?
    Need I ask, after such experiments and results, what de
gree of credit should be given to the unqualified assertion,
that even a single steeping of sound linen in muriate of
lime was sufficient to rot it ! !
    Could I see the smallest relation there is between this
question and the bleaching art, I would certainly think it
my duty to bring the subject before the Linen Board, and
request the honour of performing the experiments in their
presence, being satisfied what would be the result. My
former results were submitted to and examined by several
members of the Kirwanian Society.                 Since that time the
subject has been taken up by several persons in this place.
A very intelligent gentleman, Mr. S. Witter, of Chester,
assures me, that he has steeped both linen and cotton for
five days in very strong solutions of muriate of lime, and
found their texture perfectly unimpaired.               This gentleman
informs me at the same time, that upon making several
trials of different specimens of the oxymuriale of lime of
commerce, he finds only 87 grs. of the real salt in 240 grs.
From this it is easy to calculate, that in the bleacher's
steeping liquor there never can exist one part of muriate
of lime to 2000 of water; such a state of dilution, that, if
possessed of all the energy of caustic potash in its state of
concentration, it could not affect the most delicate sub
stance. Mr. Donovan* has also at my request repeated
the experiment with every possible precaution, and found
a result similar to mine.         Here then is assertion opposed
to assertion, fact to fact : who then is to decide? to which
side does the suspicion of inaccuracy and unfairness in
cline?       This must be left to those who arc judges of such
subjects, and who will think for themselves.
                      I am, sir, with much respect,

XXXVI. An           Attempt     to analyse   Silica.      By Professor
                             Berzelius*.
JL he attempts hitherto         made to decompose silica by means
of  the electric pile having left the problem undetermined,
whether it can be reduced to a metalline body like other
earths, I attempted to gain an analogous result by mixing
it with powdered charcoal and filings of iron, and exposing
the mixture, in a luted crucible, to a degree of heat suffi
cient for the fusion of the iron ; hoping that the iron might
in this case act somewhat similarly to quicksilver with the
electric pile.
    a. Three grammes of iron filings mixed with 1} gramme
silica, and 0'66 of a gramme powdered charcoal, were put into
a small crucible covered ana luted in the ordinary way, and
exposed to the heat of a blast furnace for one hour.                   The
mass when cold was taken out, the small reguli of iron
were extracted by the magnet, and rubbed with the palm of
the hand against paper, until, by continued rubbing on new
and clean paper, they ceased to soil the paper. They had a
silver colour; some of them admitted of being flattened;
others were brittle, according as they had taken up more or
less carbon. 1 '5 gr. of these polished metallic globules were
then put into sulphuric acid diluted with six times as much
 water. They remained undissolved till heat was applied,
 when they dissolved slowly.           When all action had ceased,
 the forms of the globules still remained, but changed in
 colour. Some were white as snow ; others black, and much
 like plumbago.         When these were afterwards burned in an
 open fire, there remained siliceous earth of the form of the
metallic globules.         Those that had been white were still
 white, and those that had been black were now pale red.
 This earth amounted to 3{ per cent, of the weight of the
ferruginous globules.
    I. Having perceived the probability that these white
 skeleton globules of silica were derived from the soft reguli,
 and the black from those most charged with carbon ; I de
 termined to try whether a silicated iron, tolerably free from
 carbon, might not be obtained by using less charcoal.                      I
  therefore mixed equal parts of fine powder of flint and
 iron-filings with ^th of their weight of pulverized char
  coal, using a little mucilage of gum dragon to form a paste,
  powder of flints were exposed to the blast in the same man-

tier as the first experiment*       When cold the silica wai
found unaltered, pale, and almost white.           The reguli were
not so fully fused as in the former experiment, hut had
caked together here and there, in the form of lumps.           The
most globular reguli were selected and polished, and of
these   r 1 5 grammes were dissolved in aqua          regia.   The
dissolution proceeded with great violence, and left silica of
the form of the balls, of which some few we»e brown.
Aqua regia and the nitric acids are such sensible reagent*
for carbon in silicated iron, that from the same iron where
muriatic and sulphuric acids leave a white earth, they pro
duce it brown, and sometimes, when the nitric acid ii
used, black.     The silica after ignition was snow white, and
retained the form of the iron.           It weighed 0'285 of 3
gramme, or about 19 per cent.
    c. Part of the reguli obtained in the foregoing experi
ments were stretched out to thin laminae, and then dissolved
in aqua regia. The dissolution was vehement, and the acid
left a white mass of silica in the form of the laminte, which
{welled by a continued digestion, and, when the acid wai
concentrated by evaporation, became semi-gelatinised. This
experiment proves that the malleable iron mass was more
free from carbon than the unmalleable, and that it never
theless contained the base of the silica, which therefore had
had no influence on its softness, which seemed entirely to
depend on the more or less complete deprivation of the
carbon.
    From these data, I formed the conclusion that silica is
by means of carbon reduced to a body, which enters into
union with iron, and which, not injuring the malleability
of the iron, must be of a metalline nature.
    In opposition to my conclusion, some affirm that the
silica is only mechanically mixed with the melted iron.
As this opinion directly contradicts every notion that I can
form of the usual habitudes of melted metals with those
pulverulent bodies on which they exercise no chemical
affinity, I tried to cement the filings of iron with silica and
powder of charcoal, at a temperature which could not fuse
the iron.     The iron filings remained unaltered in point of
form, but, on dissolution in muriatic acid, left as much as
6 per cent, of siliceous earth;            - -'
    d. In order to determine in some degree what quantity
of combustible siliceous base had been appropriated by the
iron in hese experiments, 1 dissolved 3-5 grammes of sili
cated iron in concentrated muriatic acid, and secured the
gas in an apparatus suitable for its combustion.            The gas
                                                               was

                An Attempt    to analyse Silica.            S03
was collected over water previously made use of in several
similar experiments with malleable iron and cast iron, in
hope that it would take tip less of the evolved gas, being
previously saturated.     Burnt in pure oxygen gas, free of
carbonic acid, over lime water, it produced 0*7 of a gramme
of carbonate of lime which contained 0-305 gr. of carbonic
acid, which according to Allen and Pepys's experiments
correspond to 0 0&7 of carbon. The solution with muriatic
acid left a gray siliceous powder, which was collected on a
weighed filter, and when dried (in a vessel secured from
access of air) in a dark red heat weighed 0*355 of a gramme.
Heated to w hite in an open crucible, it lost 0*02 of a gramme
more, and became white.        When these are added to what
was before obtained, the whole quantity of carbon proves
to be 0*107 of a gramme, or 3 per cent, of the weight of the
iron. I oxygenated the solution of iron by boiling it with
nitric acid, and precipitated with caustic ammonia. The
strongly ignited precipitate weighed 4-71 grammes, cor
responding to 3*266 grammes of iron. When the iron
and the carbon (3*266 -|- 0* 107) are added together, we
have 3*3 73.     The siliceous base will therefore be 0*127
gr. These 0*127 had produced 0*335 of a gramme of silica,
and of course had taken up 0 208 oxygen.             The silica
therefore appears to be composed of 38 parts base and 62
parts oxygen. This quantity of oxygen in the silica, although
agreeing well with its insolubility in acids, on applying the
rule that the metallic oxides, in proportion to their charge
of oxygen, are less soluble in acids, was unexpectedly great,
and led me to suspect that, in thef treatment of the gas,
something might have escaped my notice, and rendered
the charge of carbon too high.
   e. Ten grammes of silicated iron of a mixed nature,
partly malleable and partly like cast iron, produced, during
a dissolution    in concentrated muriatic acid, 163 cubic
inches of gas, including the air contained in the vessel.
The last portion of gas was expelled by boiling. The water
had a disagreeable smell, from adherent new formed oil,
showing a loss of carbon which could not be calculated.
The gas burned in oxygen gas over lime water yielded 0*782
carbonate of lime, corresponding to 0*341 carbonic acid,
and 0*097 carbon.      The solution left a white, light, and
porous siliceous earth, which after a strong drying weighed
0*665 gr.    By ignition it at first blackened, but on con
tinuing the heat became white, and lost 0*02. I consider
two-thirds of the loss to be carbon, since the earth before
the ignition was without smell and colour, and since the
                                                     oleaginous

   804               An Attempt         to analyse     Silica.
   oleaginous mass had been for the most part dissipated
   by boiling. The quantity of carbon is therefore 0 0985.
   The solution of iron oxygenated with nitric acid yielded
   13"745 grammes of red oxide of iron*, answering to 9*53
   grammes of iron. The water employed in washing had a
   faint blueish colour, owing to some copper which, notwith
   standing a careful separation with the magnet, had adhered
   to the iron filings. When evaporated to dryness and ignited,
  the saline mass left a gray brown substance weighing 0-03
  of a gramme, from which muriatic acid extracted 001 oxide
  of copper, corresponding to 0*003 of copper. The re
  mainder was silica 0*02 gr., which with that before obtained
  gives 0*665 of silica.          If now we add the iron to the car
  bon and the copper, the sum will be 9*53 + 0*0985 + 0*008
   = 9 6365. The deficiency 0*3635 of a gramme must be base
  of silica, which had afforded 0'665 of a gramme of silica.
  Silica according to this experiment consists of 54*66 base,
  and 45*34 oxygen.          But, as we have here a manifest loss
  of carbon, the result cannot be decisive; and if we assume
  that the iron on an average contained 0*012 of its weight
 of carbon, (reckoned according to the proportions between
  the quantity of carbon obtained when the gas from dis
 solved cast-iron is burnt, and that which the iron by ex
 periments is found to contain, and which hereafter will be
 described,) then the quantity of base will be 51*5, and of
 oxygen 49*5. ,
     J\  I tried to bruise a part of this silicatcd iron in a cast-
 iron mortar, in order that I might afterwards burn it in
 fusing nitre, as in the analysis of cast-iron, to find out the
 whole charge of carbon; but it was too ductile to be pul
verized.       Nevertheless, mixed with nitre, I heated it in an
 apparatus like that described for the analysis of the cast-
 iron, but no carbonic acid was disengaged ; and when,
after an ignition of three hours, only a small quantity of
oxygen gas was obtained, f discontinued the experiment.                          I
dissolved the mass in water, which produced with lime water
no sign of precipitation.              The iron had blackened on the
surface, but was in        other    respects unaltered.          Since in this
manner it was impossible to acquire certainty respecting
the quantity of carbon, I now endeavoured                         to obtain a
carburet      of  cast-iron,    by   means      of  iron   filings free from
copper, mixed with double its weight of silica and powder
of charcoal. This was expected to contain no malleable
iron j but I found that this also would not admit of being

pulverized sufficiently fine, owing probably to the slow cool
ing of the crucible.     I therefore mixed it with clean pow
der of flints, and attempted by means of a new fusion lo get
it malleable with an increased charge of silica, when the
carbon of the cast iron should have reduced the earth. The
silicated iron obtained was soft, but intermixed with more
or less malleable iron, as in the preceding experiments.
    g. 4*5 grammes of silicated iron from that so prepared,
being well cleansed, were dissolved in diluted muriatic acid
by means of such apparatus as was used in the preceding
experiments.      The solution was boiled towards the con-
elusion, for the purpose of expelling all gas out the vessel,
which, together with the atmospheric air out of the appa
ratus, made 77 decimal cubic inches. This amounted to
near three cubic inches more than what an equal weight of
bar-iron had produced, when dissolved in muriatic acid in
 the same apparatus. This indicates that the silicated iron
 did contain a body which absorbed more oxygen than pure
 iron, and so much the more, as the great charge of carbon
 would have presupposed a less quantity of disengaged gas.
The gas on burning over lime water left 0 3075 gr. car
 bonate of lime, answering to 0*134 of carbonic acid, or
 0*0381 of carbon (0*846 per cent, of the weight of the iron,
 nearly as much as in the preceding experiment).        The acid
 left undissolved a dark siliceous earth, which after drying
 was of a light gray colour, and weighed 0*578 gr.       During
 ignition in a closed vessel, it disengaged a gas of an em-
 pyreumatic smell, which in combustion burnt with a blue
 flame.    By this ignition the earth lost 0*013 of a gramme,
 but did not become white. Carbon was found in that which
 was expelled, and I think I cannot be much mistaken if I
 set it down at 0-005 gr.     The grayish siliceous earth, when
 ignited  for  half an  hour in  a half covered platina crucible,
 suffered no diminution of weight, but did not acquire a full
 whiteness.     The solution of iron, oxidated with nitric acid,
 was precipitated with caustic ammonia, and yielded C o
  grammes of red oxide.      Dissolved in muriatic acid, it left
  0*015 of a gramme of silica ; and from the water employed
  in washing was obtained, after evaporation and the ignition
  of the salt, 0 0075 of a gramme more of the same earth ; so
  that the whole quantity of silex became 0*5875 of a gramme.
  If from 6 grammes of red oxide of iron 0*01 5 of a gramme of
 siliceous earth be deducted, there will remain 5*985 grammes,
 corresponding to 4*15 giammes of pure iron, wh.cu being
 added to 0 0431 oi carbon, make 4* ) U3i grammes.         These
  deducted from 4*5 grammes, there remain w306y for base

  of silica. It had produced 0-5875 of a gramme of silica, and
  had therefore taken up 0*2806 of a gramme of oxygen. This
  experiment differs by about 2 percent, from the foregoing j
  but both have this fault, that a portion of carbon is lost, as
  a component part of the foetid oil wherewith the water was
  impregnated.
      5. Having seen the impossibility of obtaining a rigid re
  sult by means of solutions of iron,! undertook to incor
  porate the base of silica with copper, by means of a similar
  process of reduction with powder of charcoal.                     The sili-
 cated copper was dissolved in nitric acid, during                      which
 there existed evident marks of the presence of carbon, which
 at first separated in the form of a brown powder; but
 vanished, whilst the departing gas, conducted through lime
 water, deposited a portion of carbonate of lime.                         Tbe
 copper dissolved to a clear fluid, which                      on cooling
 thickened to a blue jelly, and left after drying and wash
 ing a gray siliceous earth, amounting to 5 per cent, of
 the weight of the copper. Attempting to separate tbe
 copper with so much nicety as to produce a more exact re-
 suit than the preceding, circumstances occurred which
 rendered a loss inevitable, and thereby made this experi
ment still more uncertain.
     I have not tried to unite the base of silica with silver by
fusion with carbon, but I have no doubt of its success.
It will probably present a more accurate result, although
 the silver will also yield a sensible quantity of carbon,
from its solutions in nitric acid*. As to the determination
of the precise quantities of oxygen and base forming silica,
I consider this as only of secondary importance.* it is at pre*
sent sufficient, that these experiments determine with a to
lerable certainty that silica, mixed with powder of charcoal,
can be reduced in fusion with a metal, and that its base,
when the metal is dissolved in acids, is, by the absorption
of about an equal weight of oxygen, again converted into
silica.

any thing like the phenomena staled below has been ob
served.
    Believing then the fact to be new, I venture to request
you will give it a place in your Magazine; and I indulge
the hope that it may lead to a further and profitable dis
cussion of the subject.
    On the 8th of August last, in the evening, being at
Blackpool on the western coast, and observing the sea to
be at times very luminous,  I went to the beach, in order
to view it more clearlv. And accidentally stamping on a
flat part where the tide had flowed, but from which it had
receded a few feet, it being about half an hour after high
water, I was surprised with the appearance of some hun
dreds of sparks of light, which surrounded my foot in every
direction, to the distance of about 15 inches, the largest
being nearest.          The light, however, was only instantaneous.
    Struck     with    the novelty of the appearance, I stamped a
Second time on the same spot, and produced a very few
sparks ; 1 afterwards stamped repeatedly on the same spot,
but without producing any. I then sought for a similar
flat spot on the beach ; and, stamping upon it, I produced
the same appearances as in the first case.           I then tried to
elicit sparks by stamping on the sloping part of the beach
 which inclines to the sea, but without success : on trying
 again, however, on the flat parts, the same appearances in
 variably occurred.
    Unwilling that so singular a fact should rest on the
 dictum of an individual, I requested L. Starkie, esq. of
 Huntroyd, in that neighbourhood, to accompany me to the
 beach ; where we repeated the experiment several times
 with    the same success.
     It seems therefore that the tide at high water had depo
 sited something in these flat places; and that the friction
 of the shingles against each other, produced by the stamp
 ing,   was     the cause of this matter emitting the luminous
 appearances : the tide had effectually left the beach, and
 there was not the least appearance of puddles of water in
 the places acted upon.

    XXXVIII.         Defence     of Professor Leslie against          the
                             Edinburgh Review.
                               To  Mr. Tilloch.
 Sir,     It   appears from the last Edinburgh Review, No. 39,
 pp. 89, 90, 91,) that Mr. Leslie has impugned a certain
 mode of reasoning used by Legendre, which on the other
 hand the reviewer strenuously defends ; and those who
 admire the most what they understand the least (a nume
 rous class certainly) may perhaps think him in the right.
        He who denies that a line can be a function of an
 angle (because, according to him, an angle is of the nature
 of number, and of no dimension,) must surely be ignorant
 of a curve called the spiral of Archimedes, of which it is
 the very nature that the polar ordinate is directly as an
 angle.       Perhaps, however, this curve must be classed with
 impossible quantities.
      I confess, sir, the postulate of' the reviewer appears to
 me to be mere verbiage, and gratuitous silliness.
      "  The quantities A, B, C, are angles ; they are of the
 same nature with numbers, or mere expressions of ratio,
 and, according to the language of algebra, are of no di
 mension."
      The strange     and unsupported assertion that angles are of
 the same       nature with numbers, can only be accounted for
from his confounding* (in an inquiry in which, more than
in any other, such things must not be confounded) an
angle, with the cosine divided by the radius.
      That an angle is of no dimension, if it simply mean that
 an angle is not a line, nor a plane, will hardly be disputed;
but then, on the other hand, a line is not an angle, nor
 angular space of any kind; so that the argument applies as
much on one side as the other.
      If the assertion mean more than this, it is not easy to
perceive its truth ; for, as a line is considered of one di
mension, when compared with a plane ; so may an angle
be considered of one dimension, when compared with
"    the angular space subtended by a surface," this having
two dimensions.           If, therefore, there are different dimen
sions of space, angular space has also its different dimen
sions; and the heterogeneity is reciprocal. Nor can an
angle be of the nature of number any more than a line;
there must be an arbitrary choice of an unit in both cases.

    Leaving this Platonist*, let us                     turn to Mr. Leslie's
                                                                rea
 soning,   and  consider how   far he is  right, and  where  he  de
 viates from the true line of argument.
    This author justly observes, that the same reasoning
 Which proves that there can be no equation between c ana
 A, B, C, would equally prove that there can be no equation
 between Cand a,v,c. Mr. Leslie might have gone further;
 for we may without hesitation admit, that the reasoning is
just in both cases (provided that we keep to the strict
 meaning of the word equation), and yet proves nothing in
 either.                      t
    For the argument drawn from the heterogeneity of the
 quantities no longer applies, when transferred from the
 angle itself to such functions as the sine, cosine, or arc to
 a given radius t; these are lines, and of course capable of a
 comparison with lines; whilst they can not be compared
 with the angles themselves of which they are called the
 functions.     Hence appears the utter uselessness of Le-
 gendrc's reasoning.     It is true, sir, you have shown that
 there can be no equation between c and A, B, C; but if

development of its combinations.               Hence its chemical
 hi3tory is perhaps less known and more limited than that
 of any other metal. In the Philosophical Magazine for
July, I have described some combinations of platina with
sulphur and phosphorus; in the present communication,
 I shall enter into some details relative to some other com
 pounds of this metal. I shall also venture, on the authority
 of experiments, to controvert some statements respecting the
 oxides and salts of platina.        I have to regret that other
 engagements     will not  allow  me   leisure to complete the pre
 sent, together with other investigations I had begun ; but
 I shall rather choose to bring them occasionally forward in
 an imperfect state, than to withhold them entirely, in the
 anticipation of a period which perhaps may never arrive.
             I. Of Ike    Hydrosulphuret      of Platina.
    The compounds obtained by the           agency of sulphuretted
 hydrogen gas on acid solutions of the metals are but im
perfectly known, they have not yet been examined with
precision j hence, as might be expected, there exists among
Chemists a diversity of opinion concerning their constitu
tion. A minute investigation of this class of bodies would
serve to elucidate many chemical phsenomena relating to the
metals, and, there is every reason to believe, would furnish
Hovel and interesting results.         It is not my intention to
enter into any details relative      to  the nature of these bodies
in general, but simply    to  confine   myself to the consideration
 of  the hydrosulphuret     of platina.
    This substance may be obtained, by treating a solution
of platina with water impregnated with sulphuretted hy
drogen gas ; or by passing a current of gas through the
solution.    After the gas has been passed for a short time
through    the  solution, the surface is covered with a thin
coating   of  a  dark iron-gray colour, having the metallk
lustre j a quantity of it is also deposited at the bottom of
the vessel.     As it readily undergoes chemical change irt
the atmosphere ; when it is wanted for accurate experi
ments, the best mode of procuring it seems to be that I
adopted, which will presently be mentioned.
    The hydrosulphuret of platina has been partially known
for some time 5 but it has not I believe been described, ner
its composition determined. -I do not think it has been at
all examined in a state of purity. It has been considered
by some chemists as metallic platina ; and Dr. Thomson in
hts System of Chemistry states it as a distinguishing cha
racter of platina, that it is precipitated by sulphuretted hy
                                                            drogen

                 On some Combinations        of Platina.            $li
drogen in the metallic state.          M. Proust considered it as a
sulphuret, and first noticed a singular property it has of
forming sulphuric acid whilst drying in the atmosphere*.
This fact has since been observed by Professor Beraelius of
Stockholm, as he lately informed me. In operating on
this substance, I soon had occasion to verify the preceding
observation of those able chemists ; for in cases when it
was dried on paper, at the moderate heat of a sand-bath,
the paper was burnt by the acid and entirely destroyed.
When it was dried at the common temperature of the at
mosphere, a quantity of acid was also formed.               It may not
be improper briefly to describe this substance after it has
been dried at a gentle heat in the air, and when of course
it has undergone partial decomposition.
     Its colour is black ; it is in small pieces, the particles of
which are loosely coherent.          It is destitute of lustre. It
marks the fingers or paper, but the lustre is much inferior
 to that of plumbago.        It has a strong acid taste. It is de
 stitute of smell.     When heated just below redness on s
 thin slip of platina, it deflagrates, emitting red sparks, and
 is partially decomposed ; by exposing it to a red heat for
 some minutes, sulphureous fumes are copiously emitted,
 and the platina remains in a state of purity.            It appears to
 be unaffected by boiling muriatic or sulphuric acid.              It is
 soluble with some little difficulty in boiling nitro-muriatic
 acid.     It is rapidly decomposed, with vivid ignition, when
 heated with oxymuriate of potash.               When it is heated in
 close vessels over mercury, the products are water, sul
 phureous acid gas, a minute quantity of sulphur, and a
 substance analogous in its physical and chemical properties
  to the subsulphuret of platina which I have already de
  scribed.     I shall state one experiment which seems to
  prove this fact.       Some hydro- sulphuret which had been
  drying for some days on a sand-bath in a platina crucible*
  was heated to redness in a retort over mercury : during the
  process it became partially ignited : the products were si
  milar to those above mentioned : ten grains of the residual
  substance were decomposed at a red heat in a platina cru
  cible, and furnished 8*5 grains of pure platina.            This gives
  its compsition       85 platina,

  expelled at the moment of ignition, it almost precisely
  agrees with the subsulphuret.
     As the hydrosulphuret absorbed oxygen, became acid,
  and attracted waterN when dried in the atmosphere ; it is
  evident that in such a state it could only furnish variable
  results, depending entirely on the circumstances to which
  it had been previously exposed.            To obviate these diffi
  culties, it was necessary to have recourse to some mode of
 obtaining     it,   which the agency of the atmosphere would
                     by
  be excluded.      As    Iknew no practicable method of sepa
  rating the acid from the hydrosulphuret and edulcorating
it   with distilled water, out of the contact of the air,         it be
 came necessary to determine with some degree of precision
 the agency of air and water on it. With these views,                   I
 exposed  a   surface of recently made hydrosulphuret of pia-
 tina (which had been well washed with distilled water,
 and hastily dried with bibulous paper,) on              platina cover,
                                                         a
 to  a   known quantity of oxygen gas            ; after 20 hours the
 gas was scarcely diminished, and after about todays only
 1-f^-ths ofa   cubical inch were absorbed.
     Some of the above hydrosulphuret was also put into                 a
 bottle filled with distilled water    ; the water was occasionally
 examined, but after some days no sensible quantity of sul
 phuric acid had been formed.
     These experiments seemed to prove that this substance
 might be washed in contact with the atmosphere, without
 undergoing any perceptible change in its constitution.
I   shall now state the mode       I adopted to procure it.        Into
a    retort of about the capacity of 40 cubical inches, an
 aqueous solution of muriate of platina was introduced;                 it
was exhausted of air, and filled with sulphuretted hydrogen
gas
     ;
     a     considerable absorption instantly took place, which
was much increased            by
                               agitation   ; fresh portions of gas
were occasionally admitted, and the process was continued
until the fluid became nearly colourless.               By this means
all the platina may after some time be separated from the
solution. The hydrosulphuret precipitated was of              a   uni
form black or very dark brown colour, and exhibited in
tome places, especially the film on the surface, the metallic
lustre.   It   was now put on      a  filter, and washed with          di
stilled water till this fluid was tasteless, and did not affect
litmus paper    ;  care being taken to keep          during this time
                                                    it
always covered with water. Whilst               was yet quite moist
                                               it
and the water still oozing through in drops,             itwas hastily
put   intoa   tubulated   retort, to which      astop-cock    had been
                                                            previously

                 On some Combinations    of Platina.            818
previously attached ; the retort was exhausted twice, and
filled with hydrogen or carbonic acid gas.          It was exposed
to the heat of a sand-hath, and the stop-cock opened under
water.      After some time the vapour of the water expelled
the gas in the retort; when this was effected, the stop-cock
was closed, and the neck of the retort kept cold by wet
cloths.     When the hydrosulphuret had been thus heated
in a partial vacuum for about 10 hours, it appeared to be
quite dry, and no indications of moisture could be per
ceived in the bulb of the retort.       When cold it was slowly
opened over hydrogen gas.          In one  experiment in which
the retort had been previously filled with hydrogen gas,
nearly a half of a cubical inch of water was obtained, which
had the smell of sulphuretted hydrogen gas, and produced a
dark-coloured precipitate with nitrate of lead.          I intended
to have examined this water more minutely, but was pre
vented- by an accident.         It seems probable that it was
 merely impregnated with a little sulphuretted hydrogen
 gas, expelled by the agency of heat.        In another instance
 when the hydrosulphuret was procured, the retort being
 previously filled with carbonic acid gas, the water that came
 over did not contain any sulphuretted hydrogen gas.               I
 cannot with certainty state the greatest temperature to
 which the hydrosulphuret had been exposed in these ex
 periments; it was necessarily variable : but from some trials
 I made with the thermometer, T have reason to think it
 could scarcely at anv time have exceeded the boiling point
 <>f water.    A well stoppered bottle was filled with the dry
 hydrosulphuret, and it was immediately examined.
                 Physical and Chemical Properties.
     Its colour was dark brown.       It was in small flat lumps,    .
 which were readily reduced to powder.            Its external sur
 face exhibited a feeble lustre, which was no longer apparent
 when pulverized.      Its lustre was scarcely inferior to plum
 bago when it was rubbed on the fingers or paper.             It had
¦no smell.      It was insipid when first brought in contact
 with the tongue ; but as it became divided in the mouth, a
 tolerably strong saline taste was perceived.           It scarcely
 affected litmus paper.       When it was put into water, a
 slight crackling noise was produced, and small bubbles of
 gas were disengaged. 3 2 grains of hydrosulphuret afforded
 in this wav tVt oi a cubical inch of gas, which diminished
 considerably with nitrous gas, and did not burn or explode
 with a taper.     I expected to have found this gas hydrogen,

and the effect lo be connected with the production of »uU
phuric acid.        I was surprised to find that it exhibited the
properties    of   oxygen.         I cannot account for this pheno
menon ;     it   can    scarcely be owing to the absorption of
common air, the volume of gas being about eight times
greater than that of the hydrosulphuret.                           When small
lumps    of it  are   introduced         into  nitric acid,   a  slight detonat
ing  noise    is  produced,        and     the   substance    instantly    falls to
pieces.    These     effects    are   connected     with   the   decomposition
of the nitric acid and the formation of sulphuric acid, and
are much increased, wiih the rapid disengagement of nitrous
gas, on the application of a gentle heat.                     When a little of
the hydrosulphuret           is  put    into   concentrated      sulphuric acid,
gas  is disengaged       from     it  :   on  heating  it,   a hissing   noise               is
produced,      and    gas   copiously         evolved;    but    it  seems   to be
quite   insoluble      in   this    acid.       Muriatic,    phosphoric,       and
acetic acids occasion        a    disengagement of gas from the hy
drosulphuret       ; but the action of these acids on                         very

limited, and attended             by no other effect worthy of notice.                      I
have not examined the gas evolved                     by the agencv of these
acids on the hydrosulphuret. The quantities on which                          have

is heated     in nitrous gas,          it becomes an ignited mass; when
oxygen gas and moisture are present,                   a    white crystallized
substance appears to be formed, which furnishes nitrous
gas and sulphuric acid             by   the agency of water.            have not

minutely examined these results.                       Nitrous acid vapour
acts spontaneously on the hydrosulphuret, occasions                          hiss  a

the hydrosulphuret           is    heated lo redness in close vessels
over mercury, the products are sulphuretted hydrogen gas,
with little sulphureous acid gas, water, sulphur, and sul

little undecompounded hydrosulphuret.
     All  these experiments were performed on minute por
tions    of  the hydrosulphuret : it would be very desirable to
repeat them on larger quantities.
     From the foregoing statements, it is evident that the
substance obtained by the agency of sulphuretted hydro
gen gas on a solution of platina is not a true sulphuret of
 this metal.      On a comparison of their chemical properties,
 it will appear that they are decidedly different. Nor can
 it be, it would seem, a compound of sulphuretted hydro
 gen gas with oxide of platina, for in this case no sule
 phuretted hydrogen gas would be furnished by its decom
 position in close vessels ; water and sulphureous acid gas
 would be the only results. Now in the actual products
 water and sulphureous acid gas are found, but in such
 6mall quantities, especially the latter, that oxygen and wa
 ter can only be considered as accidental, and not at all
 essential to the constitution of the hydrosulphuret.      They
  may fairly be presumed to originate from other sources.
 The hydrosulphuret was dried at a temperature scarcely
  exceeding that of boiling water, and there can be no diffi
  culty in admitting that it still contained water.     As it ab
  sorbed oxygen by exposure to air, and as in the course of
  the experiments it must necessarily have been exposed for a
  short time to this agency, the production of a small quan
  tity of sulphureous acid gas is easily accounted for.
     The actual results seem to prove that this substance is
  composed of sulphuret of platina and sulphuretted hvdro-
  gen, or of platina, sulphur, and hydrogen ; and the facts
  seem to admit of an easy solution on this idea.        The sul
  phuretted hydrogen may be presumed to be in a loose state
  of combination with the sulphuret. Hence, by exposure
  to the atmosphere, oxygen is absorbed, sulphuric acid and
  water are formed, and a sulphuret of platina remains which
  is not affected by the air. The sulphuric acid formed by ex
   posing the hv<lrosulphuret to the heat of a sand-bath for
  several days is quite colourless with water; the effect seems
  to be wholly unconnected with the solution of any of the
  platina.     I have not yet ascertained the precise limits of,
   the decomposition of the hydrosulphuret by the agency of
   the air ; but it seems highly probable that it will be found
   to be only in proportion to the quantity of sulphuretted
  hydrogen it contains.      The sulphurets of platina undergo
   no apparent changes by being exposed to the atmosphere,
   at least, for several days.

     The method I employed to ascertain the component part*
 of this substance wag of the simplest kind, but I know of
 no mode which offers more correct results.               It is founded
 on a property, which, in the class of metallic hydrosul-
 phurets, 1 believe, almost exclusively belongs to those of
            and gold; namely, that of being decompounded by
  he agency of heat and air, the metal alone remaining in a
 {ilatina
 state of purity.        I made many experiments on the hydrosul-
 phuret of platina before I obtained any satisfactory results.
Those which nearly agree, and w hich seem to afford evi
 dences of its constitution, 1 shall immediately relate.
                                           '
    Experiment 1. Ten grains ot hydrosulphuret of platina
 were heated in a small retort over mercury, gas was soon
 disengaged, and a little limpid fluid condensed in the neck
of the retort; the heat was continued for several minutes,
and when the retort had acquired a dull red, the substance
became partially ignited*, a copious evolution of gas im
mediately ensued, and a little yellow sublimate was depo
sited.      When the gas ceased to come over, and no further
change could be produced by the utmost heat of a spirit-
lamp, the retort was suffered to cool, and the results were
carefully examined. The gas obtained, allowance being
made for the common air, and corrections for temperature
and pressure, amounted to 1-25 of a cubical inch, and was
almost entirely sulphuretted hydrogen gas, with a minute
quantity of sulphureous acid gas.              On agitation it was ab
sorbed by water, and instantly produced a dark-coloured
precipitate with a solution of the nitrates of lead and silver.
It had the precise odour of sulphuretted hydrogen gas, and
inflamed with a lighted taper in contact with the atmo
sphere, depositing sulphur on the sides of the tube.                 The
limpid fluid was water impregnated with sulphuretted hy
drogen, and produced similar effects on metallic solutions as
those above stated.           The yellow sublimate was a slight
film   of  sulphur,    and   weighed about -rVns or" a grain. This
estimate      of   the  sulphur must be considered merely as an
approximation,         as  it was in a moist state.         The precis*
quantity     of   water   and   sulphur   thus   obtained  could  not be
determined with precision; but they could scarcely together
have exceeded a grain in weight.                The fixed substance at
the bottom of the retort weighed 8 3 grains, and in its phy-

 eficiency must be  referred to the increased temperature,               by
which the gas was expelled and found in the water, as has
been before   noticed.      The proportion of sulphureous acid
gas   was  small,     but  the  odour of it   was more perceptible       ;
there was also less water and nlore sulphur than in the ex
periments detailed. The quantity of sulphuret of platina
obtained amounted to 9-85 grains, which, on being decom
pounded at red heat in
                   a          a   platina crucible, afforded results
varying   but   little  from   those  previously procured.
   From these experiments we shall probably gain near ap
proximations to the true composition of the hydrosulphuret
of platina. They all closely agree as to the quantity of
sulphur and platina, but differ as to the proportion of gas
obtained which has been accounted for.
            ;                                          Of the three ex
periments    above     detailed,  the  first two   appear  to me to be
most worthy of confidence. As the hydrosulphuret had in
the first experiment been least exposed to the agency of
the atmosphere, and consequently would furnish more cor
rect results,      shall venture to make its data the basis for
                   1
determining the proportions of its constituent parts. From
this experiment the following results are derived            :

Sir H. Davy's statements, who says that 100 cubical inches
weigh between 36 and 37 grains.
   The sulphuret of platina contained 22 per cent, of sul
phur; consequently the above 83 grains consisted of 64*74
                                                                 platina

at 60°, absorbed three cubical inches of sulphuretted hy

of a grain; which added to the 4-56 grains =4-9 grains.
Hence, 100 grains of hydrosulphuret of platina afforded

    The most probable          idea of its constitution is perhaps
that it is compounded of the supersulphuret of platina and
sulphuretted hydrogen*, and the results appear to agree rery
nearly with this supposition.              According to my experi
ments in the Philosophical Magazine for July, the super
sulphuret of platina contains 28 percent, of sulphur. Now
100 grains of the hydrosulphuret appear to contain 64-74
grains of metallic platina, which would require 23*24 grains
of sulphur to be converted into the super-sulphuret. Th»j
actual quantity obtained, amounts to about 22*26 grains.
These coincidences were rather unexpected, and are much
greater than could have been anticipated in experiments of
this kind.                    ,
     In the course of my experiments on the hydrosulphuret
of platina, I had occasion several times to observe a brown
                produced in a solution of platina by sulphuretted
Erecipitate
   ydrogen in particular circumstances, especially when it
was made over mercury, by letting up a solution of pla
tina into a jar of the gas.               I made some unsuccessful
attempts to examine this substance, thinking its consti
tution might be different from the hydrosulpliuret I have
described.       I found it rapidly changed colour in con
tact with air, and became black : probably its composition
may be determined by comparative experiments on the
quantity of gas necessary to produce it. Should the results
I have obtained be confirmed by future experiments, we
shall probably become acquainted with a new class of com
pounds of which nothing is at present known, consisting
    * Since my paper went to presi, I made the following experiment, which,
if it does not confirm the above idea, give9 it a still higher degree of probacy
bility. A cubical inch of an aqueous solution of platiua, exposed for about
two days in a receiver of sulphuretted hydrogen gas over mercury, absorbed
more than ten cubical inches of the gas. I found that a cubical inch of the
same solution of platina required about eight cubical inches of hydrogen to
reduce the platina to the metallic state.
                                                                              Of

drogen.     This novel  field  of inquiry   has hitherto been neg-
lected ; but it cannot be unworthy the attention of chemists,
and it promises to lead to the explanation of many difficult
or obscure problems in chemistry.
    Since the publication of my paper       "On   the Combinations
of Sulphur and Phosphorus with Platina," I                have ob
served a slight inadvertency I had committed, in the use of
the words super and sub.         In conformity with the language
of chemistry, those compounds should have been called sul-
phuret and super-sulphuret ; and phosphoret and super-
 phosphorct.     In prefixing the words super and sub to the
 common names, sulphuret, phosphoret, &c. in any in
 stance, it seems evidently to be implied that there are
 three distinct combinations of the kind ; and in a relative
sense, one is said to contain a deficiency, the other an ex
 cess, and the third, an intermediate proportion of the in
flammable principle.       What however, was at first used by
 accident and erroneously, must now be adopted from de
 sign, in the case of the compounds of platina with sulphur,
 jf the experiments detailed in the preceding pages are correct.
     I have already stated that the substance obtained by
 heating the hydrosulphuret of platina to redness in close
 vessels, is analogous in its physical and chemical properties
 to the super-sulphuret of platina.          Thus its particles are
 Joosely coherent, it is tasteless, it gives lustre to the fingers
 or paper like black-lead.      It is unaffected by air and water,
 is insoluble in the mineral acids, and is decompounded by
 the agency of heat and air, with similar phaenomena to
 fhe super-sulphuret.     It differs however in some respects
 from this substance. Thus its colour is blueish black, and
 the proportion of sulphur it contains, does not exceed 22
 per cent.
    In two experiments in which five grains of this substance
 were decomposed at a red heat in a platina crucible, 3*9
 grains of platina were obtained.

 XL.     Description         of a Machine for pumping Water                 used
     in the     East.      By    M. Chastellan, Author of"              Travels

 The        art of irrigation ought to be better understood in
 countries which are subject to drought, than in those where
 abundant and periodical rains seem to render irrigation less
 necessary: there are circumstances nevertheless                          under
 which it is desirable, even in European countries, to procure
 an abundant and judicious distribution of water : and the
 expense of a machine with the necessary reservoir for this
 purpose will be speedily recompensed.
     Watering by hand-engines is frequently disadvantageous,
 and always tedious.              If the gardener has a large piece of
 ground to manage,             he   must necessarily water it during the
 heat of the day, for he cannot have sufficient time before
 sunrise or after sunset. Besides, the water which he
 employs for this purpose                   being newly drawn from a
well,     or     having      been     contained    in deep reservoirs, it
cannot get rid of its too great coolness, or of that crudiiy,
which are so injurious to plants ; whereas the same water
contained in large reservoirs and in uncovered canals for
irrigation, soon acquires the temperature of the atmosphere,
and the properties of rain water.                   The way in which the
   * I am aware that the nomenclature here adopted is defective, and founded
on an erroneous principle; that there is an excess, a deficiency, a neutral point
in these combinations.       It gives no information concerning the proportions
of the constituents of the compounds. Professor Berzclius, I believe, intends
shortly to publish some Observations on the Chemical Nomenclature, in
which these deficiencies, I have no doubt, will be happily supplied.

water is distributed in the kitchen gardens of Constanti
nople, completely secures these objects.
    The weH is generally dug in the highest pari of the
ground ; and the reservoir being still higher, it is capable of
furnishing the water necessary for feeding the canals which
are to distribute it through the garden.      From this reser
voir a canal is made, which is afterwards subdivided into
gutters cut on the edges of the principal walks: these
gutters are again intersected at right angles by others which
run between the beds where the varioas plants grow.
    In working these beds, care is taken to throw up a little
earth on the edges, so as to form a dyke several inches in
height, and solid enough to resist the entrance of the water
which is above the beds in point of level : when the reservoirs,
the canals, and the gutters are filled with water, the gar
dener with his spade makes' an opening in this dyke, or
rather removes a small piece of stone or wood which forms
a kind of sluice-gate : the water is then precipitated with
rapidity from the canal into the bed, and flows over the
whole surface. If one watering is sufficient, he shuts up
the sluice and passes on to the next bed, and so on, until
he waters the whole garden, varying the irrigation accord
ing to the nature of the plants. The same process is ap
plicable to fruit-trees also.
    It will not be foreign to my purpose, if I here explain
the method of forming the large reservoirs just mentioned.
Their construction is simple and ceconomical.       It consists
of planks dove-tailed together, and fastened at the angles
by iron bands. This caisson, which may be compared to the
tubs used for orange trees, is like them insulated from the
ground by four, six, or eight feet, to prevent the wood from
rotting by being in contact with the earth. The deals of
which it is composed are tarred on each side, and some
times it is lined with tarpaulin.
    As to the machine which raises the water to the height
of the reservoir, the mechanism is scarcely more compli
cated than that of a common draw-well, and indeed it
does not differ in an essential degree except in the form
and composition of the buckets, which are in the form of
funnels or conical bags made of leather, and which empty
and fill themselves by turns, thus furnishing abundance of
water.
    We use in general wooden buckets, which discharge the
water into the reservoir by means of a handle attached to
them, which gives them a see-saw motion.             This me
chanism, so simple in other respects, is attended with the
 disadvantage of being soon worn out ; the continual friction
                                                            and

 822     Description of a  Machine for  pumping Water
and agitation shake the buckets and even the reservoir, ana1
speedily destroying both.       The wooden buckets in com
mon use, being armed with iron hoops, have the sarrie dis
advantage : they are apt to lock against each other id
ascending and descending ; and by striking continually
against the sides of the well, they derange them in the
long run.    By using leather buckets all apprehensions of
this kind will be removed ; for the emptying and filling of
their contents is performed in a regular manner, almost
without friction, and without any kind of shaking; and al
though leather may appear less durable than wood, it is irt
fact more so when it is continually soaked in water : it
then beeomes extremely elastic, accommodates itself to every
kind of motion, and receives a blow from any other body
without being injured.
   It is probable that the ancients made use of leathern
buckets for pumping up water. At any rate, the origin of
the employment of leathern vessels, applied to the mechanism
of wells, must have been derived from the primitive use of
that kind of funnel which served formerly, as it now serves,
to carry liquids.
   In the suite of the Turkish armies there are gene
rally a great number of led horses, mules, or camels,
which have no other business than that of carrying water
from the rivers to the field. The buckets in which it is
conveyed are of a conical form, the base being closed by a
flat piece of wood, They are buckled on each side of the
pummel of a saddle, and the other extremity, tied by a cord
to prevent the water from escaping, is folded up, and also
attached to the saddle, along the flanks of the horse, which
are guarded from moisture by a leather covering.          ThU
form of the buckets, while it holds abundance of water, is
not troublesome to the horse, which may be ridden at the
same time with ease.        It is only necessary to unbuckle
them from the saddle when they are to be filled ; for, in
order to distribute the water afterwards, all that is re
quisite is to untie and lower the small extremity.
   In order to use these conical buckets to draw water from
a well, a cistern, or even from a river, the two extremities
are to be kept open by means of iron hoops to which cords
are attached.
   In order to pour water into a reservoir from them, an
extremely simple mechanism of the following form is em
ployed.
              Explanation of Plates   IV. and  V.
   A kind of triangle  is formed oyer the well, the beams tied
                                                      together

                         used  in the  East.
together at top, and sunk into the earth at proper distances
below.
     Fig. 1. presents the elevation, and fig. 2. the section of
the machine.
    At the summit of the triangle is fixed a pulley a; lower
down, and nearly as high as the reservoir b, there is a pulley
or wheel c which turns upon pivots.          The cord d, which is
attached to the large aperture of the bucket e, passes into
the pulley a; another cord       J\ fixed to the extremity of this
funnel e, passes over the wheel c, and both are fastened
to a windlass.
     If we suppose the bucket e at the bottom of the well,
it will be filled with water ; and when the windlass is turned
and the cords are stretched, it begins to ascend ; the small
end of the bucket e is folded up ; in this position the water
which it contains cannot escape, this extremity being as
high as the large aperture.       By always drawing at once the
two cords d and       f,  the bucket e will preserve the same
 position, until it rises to the edge of the well ; but when it
arrives to the height of the reservoir, the small extremity
 passes above the wheel c, the other ascends to the pulley a,
 the bucket e is unfolded, assumes the real form of a funnel,
 the office of which it performs, and the water finally escapes
 by the lower aperture, and falls into the reservoir b. The
 windlass immediately goes round ; the bucket e, resuming
 its first position, redescends by its proper weight to the
 bottom of the well, where it is again filled: the windlass
 turns round again, and makes the bucket ascend a second
 time, and so on.      It will be seen from this, that in a little
 time the reservoir b is filled, and afterwards pours the water
 by a gutter into a lower basin, from which it may be dis
 tributed over the whole garden.
      It ought to be nevertheless remarked, that there is some
 time lost in the return of the windlass ; but this return may
  be made useful, by placing the windlass across the middle
 of the well, but so that the handle g may come to one
  side, between two machines : then we shall have two
  reservoirs bb; each of the cords ff? attached to the
  small end of each bucket ee, after having passed over the
  pulley cc, will traverse the reservoir bb, pass under another
  parallel pulley ii, and will return to unite with each of the
  cords in the pulley a a : the four cords will be fixed by
  their extremity to the windlass, so that, by being unrolled
  and developed successively, one of the buckets will be
  filled at the bottom of the well, while the other will empty
  itself into the reservoir.

  4t4       description    of a  Machine   for   pumping Water
     To convey a clearer idea of the working of the bucket*/
  the two pulleys a a have been separated, and the aperture
 of the well widened; but they may be joined in a parallel
 manner on one and the same pin or pivot.
     To conclude : This mechanism may be modified accord
 ing to circumstances. If the well be situated in low- ground,
 the reservoir must be raised to a height sufficient to com
 mand the whole garden.
     On the banks of a river, it will be sufficient to drive two
 piles into the current : they will support the extremity of
 two horizontal beams, the other extremity of which will
 rest on the bank. The whole mechanism will be established
on these two powers, and the reservoir situated on the banks
will be raised to the height desired, in order that the water
may be carried to a distance by means of wooden troughs
or gutters.
     The mechanism exhibited in fig. 2. seems best calculated
 to lessen manual labour in procuring a supply of water by
the machine in question.           The windlass is a common car
riage wheel,     furnished     with  a handle.       But in order to ob
 tain a still more certain and powerful result, we might fur
nish the extremity of the roller i with a wheel and pinion
 (fig. 3) : this very simple mechanism would enable a child
to work the machine.
     As to the disposition of the cords, pulleys, and rollers, an
inspection of the plates will suffice. We would recom
mend, however, to place the pulley at such a height, that
the bucket may be perfectly developed                    on rising to the
height    of the  reservoir  ;  we  ought   to attach     the cords to the
two extremities of the roller which serves for the windlass,
and, if it is possible, proportion the length of this roller to
that of the cords which it ought to receive j for it would be
desirable that they should not make several revolutions
upon themselves ; which nevertheless can scarcely be avoid
ed when the well is very deep.
     As to the proportion of each bucket, and its capacity, it
must vary according to the quantity of water wanted ; but
in order to avoid the trouble of calculation to our readers,
we shall give an approximate table.
     Every bucket represents a truncated cone.
     A cone five feet in height, on a base twenty inches in
diameter, will contain 3,58 cubic feet of water, or nine pail-
fuls and nine tenths*.
    * We have here valued the dimensions of a pail at nine inches in diameter
by six inches in height, and consequently its capacity at 0,S6 of a cubic
foot.
                                                                    A   cone

                        used in the  East.                  225
   A cone four feet by sixteen inches will contain 1,84 of
a cubic foot, or three pailfuls three-tenths.
   We ought to make an abstraction of the loss of water oc»
casioned by the fold which the cone contracts in ascending
from the bottom of the well, since it is suspended by the
two extremities ; this loss may extend to half a pailful, and
we have also neglected the capacity of the truncated portion
of this cone.
   The largest of these buckets cannot be easily managed
but by means of a windlass furnished with a hopper wheel ;
but the smallest may be managed by a simple windlass with
a handle.
   The bucket is the most important part of this machine,
and it is even in this that the innovation consists ; for the
rest of the mechanism may be varied ad infinitum, and we
may apply the same kind of bucket to all the machines in
use for drawing water.       It will procure in the same space
of time, and with the same force, a volume of water much
more considerable ; and it combines another great advan
tage, that of conveying the water to any given height by
means of one or more machines of this kind.            For this
purpose, it is only necessary to raise the reservoir parallel to
the level of the greatest height of a sloping piece of ground,
and to cause the water to flow from the reservoir into chan
nels formed by hollow trees, or simply by two planks
nailed at right angles, and tarred at the joinings.
   Supposing that we only wish to reach a perpendicular
height of twelve feet, we shall elevate the first reservoir on
four posts to this height.     We may conceive that by carry
ing  the  pulley  some  feet  above  the reservoir, the bucket
will ascend, and will thus be equally well emptied at this
height as at the level of the ground, although the mecha
nism necessary is placed below this same reservoir. We shall
even find an advantage in this; for the gardener will be pro
tected from the sun, and the four posts may be concealed
by trellis work, to which we may apply vines or other creep
ing plants or flowers, which will give the scaffolding the
appearance of a harbour.
   Finally, the mechanism just described may be applied to
the external wall of a house ; and if we form a reservoir on
the roof, the water may be conveyed throughout the whole
of the apartments, and serve several useful purposes.

XLI.       On the Substitution of the Oxymuriate of Magnesia
     for  tliat of Lime, in the Process of Bleaching, &c. By
      M. Donovan.
                          To   Mr. Tilloch.
Sir,      Thereaders of your Magazine are already in pos
session    of the
                facts stated by Dr. Ogilby to the Kirwanian
Society, relating to the effects of oxymuriate of lime in
bleaching.      I
               was present at the reading of the paper, and
with many others examined        the specimens of linen which
 had suffered immersion in the solutions of muriate of lime.
 These specimens, as far as I could judge, appeared to be
 perfectly sound : the rest of the members also declared
 themselves satisfied that the linen had not been perceptibly
 injured.
     Sir H. Davy, in his lectures delivered in Dublin 1810,
observed that he had sufficient reason to believe that mu
riate of lime does a material injury to the linen fabric.     In
the   "  Elements of Chemical Philosophy," Sir H. states that
linen boiled in a strong solution of muriate of lime is "   con
siderably weakened."      Lately, also, it has been positively
asserted that the injury done by muriate of lime amounts
to absolute rottenness. On the other hand, Dr. Ogilby and
some gentlemen who have repeated these experiments still
maintain that the linen in this operation suffers nothing.
    Somewhat amazed at such extraordinary and unqualified
contradictions, I was resolved, merely for my own satisfac
tion, to attempt an experiment on the subject. My results
I    communicated to Dr. Ogilby j and at his instance, as
there had been some difference in our methods, I ventured
to make public whatever I had ascertained.
    I first prepared a perfectly neutral muriate of lime : the
solution was of such a strength, that it remained fluid du
ring the day-time only, but as the coolness of evening ad
vanced it deposited a few crystals.     In this saturated solu
tion I immersed a piece of sound linen, and suffered it to
remain for 48 hours j at the end of which period I washed
and dried it; but found        it,
                                as well as     could judge, as
                                               I
found as before.
 I     then took another piece of the same linen, and boiled
it  for an hour in  a new portion of the same concentrated
solution of muriate of lime.      At the end of this period  it
was allowed to cool   ; the muriate had become     a solid white
mass, of considerable hardness. As much water was poured
                                                            oa

Substitution   of Oxymuriateof Magnesia for that of Lime.               22   7
on   as seemed   sufficient to obtain           a   solution as saturated as
at first; and in this state the whole was left for 24 hours.
The specimen after washing and drying was not perceptibly
 injured.
    Sensible, however, that I could not possibly be a compe
tent judge of the strength or soundness of linens, I resolved
to submit the matter to persons who, from constant expe
rience, should be supposed adequate to the task of deciding
the question.        I accordingly handed the specimens to some
persons     of  great respectability who are engaged in the linen
trade,    and   whose   names if necessary shall be made public.
These gentlemen permit me to state, that in their opinions
the linens were perfectly sound and merchantable.
    In the preceding experiments, it is to be observed, that
the solutions of muriate of lime were considerably more
concentrated than any that are used by the bleacher; and I
thought it probable that if the muriate ever exerted any de
leterious influence on the linen, it would be the more con
siderable in proportion as the power of the deleterious fluid
was increased.        If this be fact, and we can scarcely doubt
th;it it is,   the second trial was particularly calculated to
effect the destruction of the cloth        ;for the muriate was in        a
state of fusion, and consequently was brought to the utmost
state of concentration that could be employed in expe
riment.
    The foregoing    is   a   simple statement of facts as found   I
them.   I    am much at       a  loss to account for the difference
between my results and those of others.              will not say that
                                                         I
Sir H. Davy has been deceived          ;   it   just as likely that
                                                    is                   I
have been deceived    :     yet
                              it   will be allowed, should the latter
prove    to be  the  truth,  that  there must be something in the
matter with which we are as yet unacquainted, and which
consequently requires elucidation.
    As well as   I   can recollect, Sir H. Davy, in his lectures
1810, proposed the oxymuriateof magnesia as                 substitute
                                                               a
for the oxymuriate of lime in all the processes of bleaching.
I  am the more satisfied in this opinion                 by
                                                      the coincident
testimony of others indeed the matter appears to be de
                       :
monstrable from certain passages in Sir H.Davy's Elements,
and from his observations on the destructive influence of
muriate of lime on linen.
    The impracticability of this proposal is, in another part
of this Magazine, adverted to               Dr. Ogilby, on account
                                           by
of the enormous comparative expense of magnesia. What
compensating advantages are to be derived from the substi-
                                   P   2                      tution      ?

    228         Substitution        of Oxymuriate of Magnesia
    tution  ?  None are even offered, except the harmless nature
    of' the resulting muriate of magnesia.    Muriate of lime is
    declared to be injurious, on the evidence of experiments
    which do not succeed in the hands of others : and the
    bleachers deny the fact altogether.       It is certain that many
    pieces are found to be damaged by bleaching with the oxy
    muriate of lime; but this is universally known to be pro-
'
    duced by negligence or ignorance, and not by the causticity
    of the resulting muriate.
        But although, in Sir H. Davy's experiment, the " very
    strong solution of muriate of lime" did
                                                        " considerably
    weaken" the linen, how is the fact connected with the pro
    cess of the bleacher, who never makes use of any other
    than weak solutions ?  Certainly not at all, unless a
    mode of reasoning be introduced which has been attributed
    to Sir H. Davy, namely, that " if a strong solution act
    energetically, a weak one must act proportionately so ;"
    but as this kind of argument has been disclaimed, I am far
    from insisting on the matter : hence the above question re
    mains to be answered.
        Now although Sir H. Davy does not appear to have been
    aware of    it,there certainly       an advantage in oxymuriate
                                          is
    of magnesia,      ifthat substance could be obtained at even          a
    reasonable price   ; namely, in bleaching calico destined for
    printing,   before      comes into the hands of the printer.
                           it
    After the immersion of the calico, according to the usual
    process,    inoxymuriate of lime, the workmen are some
    times so negligent as not perfectly to wash out the muriate;
    so that, during the souring,        sulphate of lime
                                          a                    precipi
                                                                is
    tated into the substance of the cloth, which cannot be re
    moved without more washing and trouble, than usually is,
    or can well be, bestowed on it. This sulphate acts as                 a
    mordant to certain colours used in the subsequent               pro
    cess of printing, and occasions           dulness of those parts
                                               a
    which should be of        clear white
                                a            and perhaps makes the
                                               ;
    delicate  shades  of colour   somewhat   different from what was
    intended.
      It   isno wonder that negligence        this, as well as in every
                                               in
    other case, should be productive of inconvenience             when
                                                                     :
    the workmen do their duty, nothing disagreeable can result
    from the abovementioned causes.
        With view of guarding against negligence, the oxymu
                a
     riate of magnesia certainly possesses advantages       ;  for even
     should the resulting muriate be not perfectly washed out,
     the sulphate formed during immersion           in
                                                    the sours    so so
                                                                     is
                                                                   luble

   luble a salt that it will readily give way to a few washings ;
   and were a portion to remain, it would not act as a mordant.
   The substitution on this account were rational, and I be
   lieve the merit of it belongs exclusively to Mr. Duffy of
  Dublin ; for it will be allowed tliat the views' of Sir H. Davy
   were completely of a different nature.
      From these advantages, however, the bleachers are un
  happily excluded, on account of the enormous price of
  magnesia. Sir H. Davy observes in his Elements, that this
  earth may be " easily procured from sea-water, or from the
  residua!   liquor of salt works." The fact is indisputably
  true, and so well known, that the manufacturers obtain it
  in this, and, I believe, no other way.      Hence, I fear, the
  obstacle of its price is not the more surmountable from the
  information conveyed in the above passage; at the same
  time., not doubling that had Sir H. Davy turned his atten
  tion more minutely to the subject, his usual ingenuity
  would not forsake him.
      In the Elements of Chemical Philosophy, we read, that
 at the suggestion of Sir H. Davy, the oxymuriate of mag
 nesia had been used by Mr. Duffy         " within the last few
 months" for whitening printed calicos.       It is with great he
 sitation I sav, that there must have been some misunder
 standing between these gentlemen ; either party must cer
 tainly have misconceived the other's meaning : and this is
 not asserted without some foundation in proof.         Mr. Duffy
 informs me that he had used the substance in question, for
 experiment, as early as December 1810, and largely in the
 beginning of 1811 ; a period much more distant than
                                                             " the
 last few months."
      Mr. Duffy, far from taking any merit to himself, for the
 application of oxymuriate of magnesia to clearing, will
 not even allow any to be attributed to him ; he is anxious
 that the credit of the matter should lie with the person who
first conceived the probable success of the process, without
 taking upon him to decide who the person may be. I shall
 therefore further the views of Mr. Duffy, and state all I
 know on the subject.
      When that part of Dr. Brewster's Edinburgh Encyclo
 paedia appeared, which contained the article
                                                    " Bleaching,"
 I was much amazed and displeased at finding that the wri
 ter of that article had assumed to himself the merit of ap
 plying the oxymuriate of magnesia, without once having
 mentioned the name of Sir H. Davy..; Anxious to ascer
 tain who had the real title, I made an inquiry in Scotland ;
                                   P 3                         the

230 SulstiiutlonofOxymuriaieofMagneslafor         that of Lime.
 the result of which was, that the idea was originally con
 ceived by Mr. William Ramsay of Glasgow, that it is about
 four years since he applied it to the clearing of printed ca
 lico, in the way of experiment; but that it is three years
 since he made known the manner of preparing the salt to a
 calico printer, Mr. T. Arthur at Levenbank, in the county
 of Dumbarton, who employed it very extensively ; and that
Mr. Ramsay also communicated it to a bleacher at Lennox
Miln printfield. Some time after this, the house in which
Mr. Ramsay is concerned received a letter from Belfast, offer
ing for sale the very process which he himself had originally
communicated.       It was fortunate enough for Mr. Ramsay
that he had not kept his secret entirely to himself, as other
wise he might now perhaps be unable to lay such irresisti
ble claims to originality.
    I also wished to know from the bleachers of Scotland,
what was their general opinion concerning the supposed de
leterious influence of muriate of lime. I was not displeased
at finding, that in the use of this substance    there was not
one disagreeable circumstance that could lessen the merit,
or subtract from the importance, of Mr. Tennant's most
valuable discovery.
    It now only remains to notice the precise situation in
which the matter rests : Sir H. Davy at first proposed
the substance in question, as a general agent in bleaching.
The substitution appears to have been grounded on an
assertion at present denied upon all sides ; and the pro
posal itself is said to be impracticable from its expense.
Sir H. Davy, by his own account, proposed his process for
whitening only within the last few months ; but Mr. Ram
say had put it to practice almost four years before.
    Such are the results of my few inquiries on the subject.
Should any be inclined to dispute the claims of Mr. Ram
say, I have little doubt that all the parties concerned, with
perhaps several others, will, if called upon, give their united
testimony in favour of the above statement.

 IVIr.   Reid then proceeded to a review of the Roman stage,
 deriving its origin from a similar source to the Greek, the
 Saturnalian games.        But though Livy and others bear
 witness, he said, to the extravagant love which that peo
 ple   had to scenic exhibitions,        the works of the two
 Senecas are the onlv considerable specimens of their tragic
 Muse that now exist. Livius Andronicus, the next an
 cient and least elegant of all their dramatic writers, was for
 some time the only star visible in the dramatic horizon,
 till Najvius rose to rival, or rather eclipse him.
    Ennius followed, who was a well-known favourite of the
 immortal Cicero, and of whom Lucretius says, that he was
 the first of their poets deserving of a lasting crown from
 the Muse3.     The Romans were the first to throw off the
 shackles of the chorus, and Plautus had the merit of the
 innovation.    The comedies of this writer abound with hu
mour, but il is a humour of a coarse and barbarous kind.
 In the midst however of low buffoonery, his characters have
 the merit of
the footmarks of Menander, achieved the perfection of the
Roman drama ; but a tiresome want of variety exists in his
characters; which may be traced, however, more to the
secluded and insipid loves of the Roman females, than to
the deficiency of the dramatists, whose polished and elegant
style, adorned with a charming and delicate simplicity, am
ply atones for the defect.
    The peculiarities which distinguished the ancient stage
from the modern next claimed the attention of the lecturer;
and after justly observing, that the modern introduction of
acts superseded the necessity of that strict observance of
the unities for which some critics have been such sticklers,
he remarked >that ^Eschylus was the first who introduced
masks upon the stage ; previous to which time the actors
merely concealed their faces from the spectators.        The dif
ferent age, sex, and character were strongly depicted on
these masks j and it is a remarkable fact, strongly illustra
tive of ancient devotion to physiognomy, that it was thought
essential for every character to be marked by a particular
quiescent cast of countenance; and that whenever a play was
delivered to the actors, the author gave drawings of the
                                P4                         masks

232              London Philosophical     Society.
masks adapted for it ; and if a variety of passions were in
cluded in the same character, the actor had either different
masks, or a different passion painted on each side, which
was displayed alternately in profile to the spectators.           The
delicate representations of the mind expressed in the phy
siognomy were therefore entirely forsaken by the ancients ;
but it was a loss which they could not appreciate, as the
extent of their theatres would have rendered such represen
tations impalpable to the sight.
   After remarking on the acoustic properties of the an
cient masks, and the violent gesticulations of the Roman
actors, Mr. R. asserted, that a taste for gesture began, and
at last a total contempt of every thing but show completed,
the degradation of the Roman stage, the decline of which
may be dated, as well as of every species of literature, from
the establishment of legal tyranny by Augustus.              The de
cline of that empire led the        lecturer,  by easy transition, to
the state of the drama during the dark ages, to its subse
quent revival in Italy, Germany, France, and England, and
its latter purification.      The improvisator'! of Italy were the
first revivers   of   the stage.      These performances, which
were characterized by little but buffoonery, were succeeded
by religious representations; and the new birtft as well as
ihejirst birth of the drama was marked not only by the
same features, but by the same name,  that of mysteries.
It is curious to remark, that the English stage resembled for
some time the Eleusinian representations; for it personified
the virtues, the vices, and the moral propensities, as well
as the sainted demigods of the new religion.             Nor, much
as we may doubt the amusement resulting from             it,  -can we
suffer severity to conquer our feelings of indulgence, when
we recollect that      it produced the Paradise Lost of Milton
(originally a  dramatic     mystery), and most probably suggested
the Fairy Q«ieen of Spenser.           Metastasio in Italy was the
great champion       of    the  ancient   stage, and the mysteries
yielded to the purer taste of his tragedies.        Operas, said the
learned lecturer, are the peculiar invention of the Italians,
and they owe their birth and their success to the harmony
and music of their language. Disagreeing with Addison,
therefore, in his general severity against the opera, he yet
was of opinion that in this country     it    was an exotic, fostered
and kept alive    bya    ridiculous fashion, where the taste, the
language, and the manners of the people were in every
respect unpropitious.
    From Italy Mr. R. passed to Germany         j     and after re
marking    the  singular    fact, that  the  drama  of that country
                                                                was.

                         London Philosophical     Society?                233
was but a century ago little advanced from the rude buf
foonery of the dark ages,' and the superstitious mummery
of the mysteries, an accidental circumstance, he said, re
formed it. A company of French actors introduced the
works of Corneille ; and the productions of Schiller and
Kotzebue were the almost immediate consequence of the
emulation they inspired.       In appreciating the characters of
these writers, he inclined to think that the plays of the
former were not only much less unexceptionable than the
latter, but were calculated, by exciting a generous sympathy,
to refine and moralize mankind : but, with regard to Kotze
bue, he stigmatized his dramas as in the last degree im
moral, and pernicious to the well-being of society*.
     The French stage, said Mr. R. famed as it is for chaste-
 ness and morality, was unworthy of notice till the time of
 Moliere and Corneille ; and after drawing a just comparison
between the characteristics of these two dramatists and those
 of Racine and Voltaire, he proceeded to point out the disad
 vantages under which the French stage laboured, from the
 necessity of adapting rhyme instead of blank verse to its
 loftier dialogue ; observing, however, that the regularity of
 conduct, the regard of unity, and the chastity which cha
 racterize is  compensate in       great degree for what to Eng
              it,
                                          a
 lish ears a     very great defect.
     Minstrels introduced the stage into England a3 well as into
 Italy. About thirty-six years after the Conquest,        man of  a
 the name of Rahere amassed       considerable property
                                          a                 inter   by
 ludes; and this first suggested to the clergy the performance
 of mysteries so that the new priesthood made use of the
                 ;
 same instruments for effecting the same purposes as the
 old, that     is,
                to acquire   total influence over the minds and
                                 a
 morals of the people,               by
                                 speaking to the eyes and to the
 senses.    The love of these performances became so great
in    time, that     was found necessary to suppress them in
                         it
  1258,   by an injunction from the Barons.        From this time
 to Henry the Eighth,        stupor seemed to have invaded the
                                a
 dramatic muse, when Heywood, the king's jester, intro
 duced little dramas in which the characters and manners of
  people in low life were represented  an effort which ex
                                                  ;
  cited such emulation, that the whole country abounded
  with players in consequence of which another suppression

  look place at the time of Elizabeth.
     The lecturer, proceeding to consideration of the genius
                                              a
 of Shakspeare, agreed with Dryden             the remark that he

found not, but created the English stage. Massinger, Ben
Jonson, Ford, Webster, Beaumont, and Fletcher, came
 alternately under his investigation ; and after a successful
 analvsis of their different styles, he reviewed the licentious
ness of taste which disgraced the reign of Charles the Second,
 and, comparing it with the cast of modern plays, drew a
very just conclusion as to the general increase of public
morality.     During the time of Charles there were no less
than seventeen play-houses in London, all of which were
 put down by the Puritans.
    The appetite for theatrical amusements, which succeeded
the overthrow of fanaticism, may be accounted for by the
long fast which the people had sustained. The theatre,
 however, arose under considerable advantages.           Patents
were granted to Killegrew and Davenant, incorporating a
body of actors for the amusement of the public ; and the
introduction of women on the stage, whose parts had till
then been personated by boys, was a change of great im
provement to the drama.
    After some just remarks, deduced from the display of
character by females, on the illiberality of inferring an infe
riority of faculty from defect of cultivation, the charac
teristics of Otway, Cibber,Vanbrugh,and Congreve produced
from the lecturer an instructive analysis of their peculiar
qualifications.    The libertinism of the two latter drew upon
the theatre the well-directed attack of Jeremy Collyer, who
succeeded for a time in mastering the witty arguments of his
opponents supported by Dryden.; and the stage had scarcely
recovered from the shock, when the ingenious and cele
brated Henry Fielding, by the personality and sarcasm of
his dramatic innovation, produced a severer enemy in the
person of ministers; the consequence of which was, that the
power of licensing more theatres as well as all plays was
vested in the Crown.        Foote a short time after followed
the same plan ; but, having secured a strong party in his fa
vour, overruled the opposition the revival excited. Mr. R.
however, drew a very proper distinction between the per
sonalities of Aristophanes and those of Foote and Fielding,
who have been compared to him, observing, that virtue
was an object of attack to the first, but immorality and
folly alone provoked the satire of the latter. After a just
and appropriate compliment to the talents of Garrick, the
author passed to the consideration of the new species of
sentimental comedy introduced of late years on the stage.
Diderot, who invented      it,   merely called
                                         it,     la drame; but
the enemies of his project nicknamed     in it   ridicule of its
                                                      sentiment,

                London Philosophical    Society .          235
sentiment, la comedie larmoyante.         The mention of the
innovation introduced a critique on the English pupils of
this style, and Colman, Cumberland, Morton, and Tobin,
received the tribute of praise which they deserved.
   Mr. R. after discoursing on the extensive influence and
moral effects of the drama, and arguing that latter years
had refined it in every point of view, deduced, that all
the arguments of any weight against the drama are really
arguments merely applicable to the ceconomy of the
theatres ; and he pursued the subject by suggesting hints for
the improvement of this ceconomy, proposing in the first
place an increase of theatres, which, by reducing their size,
would strike at the root of unmeaning spectacles and shows ;
and secondly, in the exclusion of all company that offend
the eyes and ears of respectable females.
   Some accurate observations on the pleasures resulting
from illusion in the drama, and on the Godwinian theory,
that plays will in time be nugatory and useless, as man in
vigorated himself in intellect and purified himself in morals,
concluded the excellent discourse.
   The same month, Mr. T. Pettigrew delivered a lecture on
Zoology, which embraced the order Primates of the class
Mammalia, having before, in an introductory lecture to a
course intended by him to be given to the Society, taken
a general view of the different systems of classification of
the animal kingdom, and of the immensity of nature ob
servable in that grand division of it.
   The lecture was rendered exceedingly interesting by a
well chosen selection of anecdotes, illustrative first of their
wild, and secondly of their domesticated state, and an
exhibition of very excellent specimens of most of the species
which came under the lecturer's consideration.
   We forbear entering into a description of the animals
given, as a detail of specific character would be tedious, and
without the specimens uninteresting : but we cannot but
highly approve of the Society's endeavouring to diffuse a
         spirit of inquiry in the various branches of science,
  he manner likewise of treating it by anecdote, relieves the
feneral
study from that dryness and fatigue which have been said
particul-rly to characterize natural history.

     Sir,  Allow       me to request from you, or from some of
 the scientific readers of the Philosophical Magazine, an
 answer to the following query.
     Every one knows that'muriat of silver, on exposure to
 the sun's light, becomes in a short time of a dark hue.
 Is there any material, solid or fluid, simple or compound,
 which being of a dark hue will, on exposure to the sun's
light, become in a short time lighter in its tint, if not wholly
 colourless ?
                             I am, sir, vours, &c.

        SIR HUMPHRY         DAVY AND PROFESSOR LESLIE.
                            To Mr. Tilloch.
    Sir,  In   glancing over Davy's Elements of Chemical
Philosophy, I was surprised to find it alleged, that Van
Helmont had given a sketch of a " curious instrument,
very similar to the differential thermometer;" and a few
pages further on, to meet with this bottom note  Plate I.
                                                           "
fig. 2. represents Mr. Leslie's          differential thermometer."
[See Plate V. fig. 5.]
                                " Fig. 3. is copied from Van Hel-
monl."      [Plate V. fig. 6.]
                                      " This instrument appears to
have been    the  first in  which    the expansive power of heated
air was exhibited by      its  action upon cold air."    On turning
                                                                  to

                   Differential Thermometer.                           237
to this plate, I observed a very clumsy and distorted repre
sentation of my differential thermometer, placed by the side
of another figure, bearing a general resemblance to              it,
                                                                and
 purporting   to be    acopy of Van    Helmont's   sketch.   Anti
cipations, such as are here insinuated, have no doubt oc
curred  in  the history of scientific discovery     but there has
                                                    ;
been so strong  a   propensity of late to bring forward allega
tions of this nature on the slightest grounds, that            was
                                                                 I
tempted, for the first time, to examine the original work.
I  soon perceived, however, that Van Helmont's description
and figure were essentially different from the representation
which Sir Humphry has taken the trouble to give.                 In
fact, the " curious instrument" described          by
                                                  the alchemist         is
no other than the common air-thermometer of Sanctorioor
Drebbel, invented more than forty years before his death                ;
only, for the sake of easier carriage, shaped like syphon,   a
the lower end being bent upwards, and terminating in                    a
spherical cup, with       small orifice one of the forms which
                           a
it had from its earliest introduction.        A learned person of
the name of Heer imagining,          it seems, as Sir Humphry
has since done, that the instrument was absolutely closed,
had proceeded to admire the perpetual motion of the con
tained liquid, and next to wonder at its gradual disappear
ance, which he sagely regarded as an irrefragable proof of
the conversion of water into air.          To this Van Helmont
replied, that the action of the machine no more produced
perpetual motion than the changing of weather-cock; and
                                              a
urged that,  if   both the balls were shut, the liquor must,
under all the changes of external heat, remain stationary,
being pressed     by the equal and opposite elasticities of the
secluded masses of air  statement which incidentally in
                                a
volved the principle of the differential thermometer, but
which the author never once dreamed of reducing to use.
                                                                             x
On the contrary, he calls his rival,          in
                                               the uncourtly lan-
guage of those times,
                                "
                             an idiot," and charges him with
"stupidity," for not perceiving that the instrument had an
aperture, only slightly shut with         astopper, and not her- -
radically sealed, as       it  most incorrectly figured in the
                                is
" Elements of Chemical Philosophy."
 I   will not suppose that Sir Humphry intentionally mis
represented the meaning of Van Helmont; but then               fol
                                                                 it
lows, that either he had not read the passage to which he
refers, or must have satisfied himself with        very superficial
                                                   a
and careless inspection.      This precipitancy       the more to

    The tessellated pavement discovered last year at Bignor
 in Sussex, was covered with earth to preserve it during the
 winter. It has been lately opened again, and the surround
 ing land dug up, for the purpose of further discovery.
 A series of apartments are now exposed, all paved with
beautiful mosaic, the most of it in the highest state of pre
 servation, and exhibiting perhaps the best specimen of the
 kind in this country.         The various figures are well defined
 and delineated, some of them very beautiful, particularly an
eagle with GanymeSe, a pheasant, adolphin and 9ome others.
Walls are erecting on the ancient foundations, the ruins
furnishing materials, so that the plan of the building may
be tolerably traced.       It no doubt has been the villa of some
of the Roman generals, the chief city of the Regni, Chi
chester, where Vespasian fixed his head quarters, being
within a few miles, and the ancient Roman road thence to
London crossing the South Dow ns directly in front of the
edifice.    The surrounding scenery is very romantic, and
must have been always interesting.           We conceive the de
struction may be dated, with that of many othermonuments
of the power and splendour of the Romans at one time in
thi9 county, from the barbarous invasion of the Saxons
under the ferocious Ella, who, irritated with the formidable
opposition he met at Chichester, ravaged it and the sur
rounding country with fire and sword with the most unre
lenting fury.     So completely had time effaced all appearance
of former habitation, that the same family have ploughed
the field every year for thirty years past, without the re
motest suspicion of the treasure it contained, till last
autumn the ploughshare came in contact with one of
the large stones     of the building.
         EXTRAORDINARY           POWER OF IMAGINATION.
    " During    our stay at the Dardanelles, we lived in the
house of the Neapolitan Consul. This respectable                 old
man put in force a stratagem which may serve to show the

extraordinary power of imagination over diseases of the
body.     Being troubled with an intermitting fever, brought
on during our excursion in Troas, I had been observed by
him to go frequently to a clock in the anti-chamber of
our apartment, watching for the hour when the paroxysm
began. This used to occur exactly at noon.         One morning
he put back the clock a full hour.       At twelve, therefore, I
had no fear of my fever, for the index pointed to eleven ;
and at one, although the hour seemed to be present, the
paroxysm did not take place. Unfortunately, pleased by
the success of his experiment, he told me what had hap
pened ; and after the usual interval the fever again re
turned.     By the same manner, all the charms used among
the lower order of people in this country operate in the
cure of agues.      The Tomb of Protesilaus, as related by
Philostratus    [in Heroicis.  See also Chandler's Ilium,
p. 142],   was anciently resorted to in healing a quartan fever."

  XLIV.     Observations intended to show that the progressive
      Motion of    Snakes is partly performed by Means of the
      Ribs.    By  Everard Home, Esq. F.R.S.*
  On     a former occasion I laid before the Society a descrip
  tion of the mechanism of the hood of the cobra de capello
  snake of the East Indies, the coluber naja of Linnaeus, in
  which the ribs of the neck are shown to be formed in a par
  ticular manner; so that, when they are raised, the skin be
  comes stretched out, and puts on the appearance of a hood.
      The ribs so employed have several peculiarities, which             I
  took for granted were confined to those of the neck, for               I
  was not in possession of the bodies of the snakes, and there
  fore could not examine the others ; but have since found
  that many of these peculiarities are not only common to all
  the ribs of this snake, but to those of the whole tribe.
      This fact, as it escaped my observation at that time,
  would have still done so, had it not been for the following
    ircumstances.
      A coluber of unusual size, lately brought to London to
  be exhibited, was shown to Sir Joseph Banks; the animal
  was lively, and moved along the carpet briskly : while it
  was doing so, Sir Joseph thought he saw the ribs come
  forward in succession like the feet of a caterpillar.               This
  remark he immediately communicated to me, and gave me
  an opportunity of seeing the snake and making my own
  observations.
      The fact was readily established, and I could feel the
  ribs with my fingers as they were brought forward : when
  a hand was laid flat under the snake, the ends of the ribs
  were distinctly felt upon the palm, as the animal passed
  over it.
      This becomes a more interesting discovery, as it consti
  tutes a new species of progressive motion, and one widely
  different from. those already known.
      In the draco volans the ribs form the skeleton of the
  wings, by means of which the animal flies, the five posterior
  ribs being bent backwards and elongated for that purpose,
   so that in that instance the progressive motion is performed
   by the ribs; but those particular ribs are superadded for this
   purpose, and make no part of the organs of respiration ;
   whereas, in the snake, the ribs are so constructed as to per
  form their office with respect to the lungs as well as pro*
   gressive motion.
                                                                           ¦
             * From the Philosophical  Transactions for 1812, part i.
  Vol. 40. No.     1 74. Oct. 1812.                  Q                That
I

                       Olservalions to show
    That ribs are not essential to the breathing of all animal*
whose lungs are situated in the same manner as in snakes,
is proved by the syren having no ribs ; but as this animal
has also gills, and can breathe in water as well as in air,
the lungs are not so constantly employed, and probably a
less perfect supply of air to them may suffice.
     In animals in general, the ribs are articulated to the back
bone by means of a convex surface, which moves upon a
slightly concave one formed upon two of the vertebrae,
partly on the one and partly on the other, so that there ii
a rib situated between every two vertebrae of the back ; but
in the snake tribe, the head of the rib has two slightly con
cave surfaces which move upon a convex protuberance be
longing to each vertebra, so that there is a rib to each of
the vertebra?.
   -One advantage of this peculiarity is, that it prevents the
ribs from interfering with the motion of the vertebrae on
one another.       The vertebrae are articulated together by ball
and socket joints (the ball being formed upon the lower
end, and the socket on the upper one), and have therefore
much more extensive motion than in other animals.
     The muscles, which bring the ribs forward, consist of
five sets, one from the transverse process of each vertebra
to the rib immediately behind        it,which rib        attached to
                                                           is
the next vertebra. The next set goes from the rib                little
                                                                     a
way from the spine just beyond where the former ternn-
nates        passes over two ribs, sending       slip to each, and
                                                                         it is
          ;   it                                       a
inserted into the third    :  there   is
                                      a    slip also connecting
with the next muscle      insuccession. Under this           the third
                                                                is
Set, which arises from the posterior side of each rib, passes
Over two ribs, sending     a lateral slip to the next muscle, and
is   inserted into the third rib behind it.
     The fourth set passes from one rib over the next, and               is
inserted into the second rib.
     The fifth set goes from rib to rib.
     On the inside of the chest there         strong set of muscles
                                             is    a
attached to the anterior surface of the vertebrae, and passing
 obliquely forwards over four ribs to be inserted into the
 fifth rib, nearly at the middle part between the two ex
 tremities.
     From this part of each rib     a  strong flat muscle comes
forward on each side over the viscera, forming the abdo
minal muscles, and uniting in         a beautiful middle tendon,
 so that the lower half of each rib, which               beyond toe
                                                           is
origin of this muscle, and which
                                           is is
                                          only laterally connected
 to  it    loose cellular membrane,
          by                               external to the belly of

                  the progressive Motion  of Snakes.         943
the animal for the purpose of progressive motion ; and that
half of each rib next the spine, as far as the lungs extend^
is employed in respiration.
     At the termination of each rib is a small cartilage in
shape corresponding to the rib, only tapering to the point.
Those of the opposite ribs have no connection, and, when
the ribs are drawn outwards by the muscles, are separated
to some distance, and rest through their whole lengih on
the inner surface of the abdominal scuta, to which they are
connected by a set of short muscles : they have also a con
nection with those of the neighbouring ribs by a set of
short straight muscles.
     These observations apply to snakes in general j but they
have been particularly examined in a boa constrictor, three
feet nine inches long, preserved in the Hunterian Museum.
In all snakes, the ribs are continued to the anus, while the
 lungs seldom occupy more than one-half of the extent of
 the cavity covered by the ribs.       These lower ribs can only
 be employed for the purpose of progressive motion, and
 therefore correspond in that respect with the ribs in the
 draco volans superadded to form the wings.                   *
     The parts of which a description has been attempted,
 will be better understood by an inspection of Plates VJ. and
 VI I . than bv any explanation that words can convey.
     In Plate VII. the joints between the vertebrae and ribs are
 represented of the natural size, from the skeleton of a large
 boa sent from the East Indies by the late Sir William
 Jones, and deposited in the Hunterian Museum. On the
 under surface of the vertebra is a protuberance for the at
 tachment or muscles peculiar to this genus ; it varies in size
 in the different species, and explains the power attributed
 to the boa const rictor.
     When the snake is going to put itself in motion, the ribs
 of the opposite sides are drawn apart from each other, and
 the stmli cartilages at the ends ot them are bent upon the
 upper surfaces of the abdominal scuta, upon which the ends
 of the ribs rest; and as the ribs move in pairs, the scutum
 under each pair is carried along with it. This scutum, by
 its posterior edge, lays hold of the ground, and becomes a
  fixed point from whence to set out anew.        This motion is
  beautifully seen when a     snake is climbing  over an angle to
 get upon    a flat surtace.
      When the animal is moving, it alters its shape from a
 circular or oval form to something approaching to a tri-
          of which the surface on the ground forms the base,
          coluber and boa having large abdominal scuta, which

may be considered as hoot's or shoes, are the best fitted for
this kind of progressive motion ; there is, however, a si
milar structure or' ribs and muscles in the anguis and am-
phisbsena.
   In the anguis the ribs are proportionally weaker; and as
these have nothing to correspond with the scuta, it is pro
bable this mode or progressive motion is less necessary to

    XLV. An          Attempt to analyse Cast Iron.           By Professor
                                Berzelius*.
  It    has for a long time been supposed that the principal
  difference between          cast iron and         steel consisted in a
  6inall quantity of oxygen being present in the former;
  so that cast iron would be a kind of carburetted oxide of
  iron, whilst steel, on the other hand, would be a carburetted
  metallic iron. This pretty generally adopted conjecture re
  specting the presence of oxygen in cast iron, probably de
  rived from a comparison of the difference in malleability
  of the cast iron and the steel, will on a closer examination
  be found to contradict our experience respecting the affinity
  of iron and carbon for oxygen; for at the temperature at
  which cast iron is formed the carbon and oxygen ought to
  be changed into gaseous carbonic acid.                    That cast iron
  should be an oxiaule, is also contrary to analogy drawn
  from other metallic protoxides, among which, as far as I
  know, the lowest degree of oxidation is always that which
; best will dissolve in acids, and which with the greatest
  affinity will maintain this union ; but the cast iron exhibits
  all the properties of a fully reduced metal. This question
  respecting the composition of cast iron is of importance
  to theory ; and its elucidation may prove useful when ap-
          to the manufacturing of cast iron ; but what particu-
   arly deserves attention is the different states in which cast
  F)lied
  iron can occur, together with the influence that these dif
  ferent states may have on the quality of the wrought iron.
  The greater part of those differences in cast iron originate
  indisputably from the different quantities of carbon dis
  solved by the iron in the smelting, by which an infinite,
  variety can be produced from the greatest to the least car
  buretted.         A quicker or slower cooling contributes also
  considerably to alter the colour and hardness of the cast
  iron, though otherwise of identical composition.                           But

these variations   seldom essentially affect the good proper* 1
ties of manufactured bar iron.       The cast iron often ac
quires other differences, derived from foreign combustible
substances in the ore, or in the fluxes, which may greatly
alter the properties of the bar iron made from it. To dis
cover these, and means for their separation, is a nice and
interes'ing object for the iron works.        The quantity of
these combustible matters which aremetallized       along with
the iron in the heat of the furnace, and deteriorate its
quality, is in most instances so very trifling, that in
analysis it easily escapes notice; and being diffused in a
mass of iron proportionally infinitely greater, it maintains
its hold through all the processes to which the iron is after
wards subjected to render it malleable.
    The surest way for a chemist to discover these substances
Js, first, to examine the ore and the fluxes employed in
making the cast iron, and then In the iron itself to endea*
vour to detect such substances as were known to be pre
sent in the ore, and likely to affect the quality of the bar
iron made therefrom.
    This mode it is probable would also be the safest for the
miner to pursue, in searching for means to separate on the
large scale unfriendly substances from the ore, when he
wishes to gain good iron from inferior ore.
    But before we proceed to investigate the composition of
cast iron of a bad quality, it is plain that we ought to
know the constituent parts of cast iron in general, and the
causes which operate to produce iron of different qualities
from the same ore ; namely, the different phenomena in
the furnace, the duration of the smelting, the different
qualities of the coal or ore made use of, Etc. 1 will begin
with reciting an analysis of a specimen of good cast iron,
containing manganese       furnished by Mr. Svedensljtrna
from a hlast-furnace in Lekebergslag.
    One of the greatest obstacles we meet with in the ana
lysis of cast iron, is to ascertain the quantity of carbon
 which it contains.    The difficulty of obtaining an accurate
 result, is no doubt the rtas n why our knowledge of the
 true composition of cast iron has hitherto remained SO de
 fective,   When we dissolve the cast iron in an acid, the
 carbon in the moment of parting with the iron enters intp
 new combinations, partly with the component parts of the,
 cast iron, partly with hvdrogen j nay, even with the com
 ponent parts of the acid ; and therefore the products vary
 according to the acid employed.
    «. On the dissolution pf cast iron by sulphuric acid,

               An Attempt    to analyse Cast    Iron.          847
there is disengaged, as every one knows, an ill-scented in
flammable gas, consisting of carburettcd           hydrogen gas
containing   a portion of a fetid volatile oil.  This oil, formed
from the carbon of the iron with oxygen and hydrogeu
from the water, deposits in the conducting glass-tubes in the
form of a fat grayish coating, which at la3t swims on the
water in the pneumatic trough as a thin iridescent pellicle.
The solution itself posseses the smell of this oil ; and the
black substance remaining after the dissolution of the iron
contains a great quantity of oil, which can be extracted by
alcohol.    Vauquelin has found that a phosphuretted iron
produces a still more fetid oil, and that phosphorus also
remains in this oleaginous black residuum.          If this black
fetid substance be burnt, there finally remains a grayish
siliceous earth.
    I. When cast iron is dissolved in muriatic acid, then
more gas and less oil arc obtained ; the portion that remains
insoluble in the acid is now brownish, less in weight and
volume, and assumes a light gray colour on drying.               It
blackens when burned, and leaves at last siliceous earth. (I
know not whether the difference in the quantity of the pro
ducts resulting from the dissolution of the carbon in these
acids, ought to be ascribed to the greater tendency of sul
phuric acid to form oil and ether, than muriatic acid pos
sesses, judging from their effect upon alcohol.)        We thus
 find that neither the sulphuric nor the muriatic acids can be
 employed for ascertaining the carbon contained in iron ;
 and it will likewise be seen from what follows, that no
 direct determination can be obtained from a dissolution in
any of the other acids.
    c. Having perceived in the experiments with the sul
 phuric and muriatic acids, that the affinity of carbon for
 the disengaged hydrogen gave origin to the different sub
 stances which were formed, I dissolved cast iron in nitro-
 muriatic acid.      When I conducted the disengaged gas
 through lime-water, there occurred a considerable deposit
 of carbonate of lime  a proof that the carbon was acidified
 by the acid. During the dissolution small bright metallic
 particles separated from the pieces of cast iron, which
 pieces afterwards required a more concentrated acid and a
 higher temperature for dissolution.       These particles were
 found to be graphit, which must have been deposited by
 the consolidation of the cast iron, and therefore now only
 mechanically separated, since the surrounding iron is sooner
 dissolved by the acid than the graphit.          When all that
 was metallic had become dissolved ; then, both from a solu-

tion with nitric acid alone, and from that with nitre-mu
riatic acid, there ultimately remained a black-brown, soft,
carbonaceous mass, which in its appearance was perfectly
alike from different experiments; but varied much in che
mical habitudes, according to the quantity and concentra
tion of the acid, the temperature at the dissolution, and
other circumstances.      It amounted on an average to more
than 4 per cent, of the weight of the iron employed.           It
was always in a small degree soluble in water, and in its
chemical character lesembled the extractive substance met
with in mould earth  ihe last staye of vegetable putrefac
tion. Fn some experiments, I found it so soluble in boiling
water, that on cooling a great quantity was again precipi
tated ; caustic ammonia dissolved it more copiously than
water.     In other experiments, it was less soluble in water,
but then proporiionablv more so in caustic alkali, with
which it formed a dark, opake, and nearly black fluid,
which, like the alkaline solution of the extractive substance
before mentioned, w as again precipitated by acids.        If an
aqueous    solution of this  brown  substance be  evaporaied, it
then precipitates, and the liquor gradually loses its colour.
On heating this substance, it smelt like heated peat turf,
and when inflamed it spontaneously continued in a state
of ignitinn, giving a smell of prat ; alter which there re
mained grayish- red ashes.       In short, the action of the
nitric acid on the. carbon of the cast iron generates here a
substance, w hich in cluracter is identical with the extractive
substance from mould earth and peat turf.       1 do not intro
duce this as an essential circumstance relative to the com
position of cast iron, but as a remarkable phasnomenon of
the action of nitric acid on carbon, which perhaps might be
classed along with Halcheti's discovery or artificial tannin,
from the mutual action of charcoal and nitric acid.            A
part of this extractive substance dissolves in the last water
of tdulcoration, and therefore it has passed into the so
lution of iron undissolved.       If this be precipitated with
caustic ammonia, then the renaming solution is sometimes
yellow; this substance dots, however, for the most part
precipitate with oxide of iron.        When this is digested
with caustic potash the ley will be of a dark-brown colour,
though none of the oxide of iron is dissolved. These cir
cumstances are sufficient to show the impossibility of de
termining the quantity of carbon by the solution of iron in
nitric acid.
    I noticed a constant peculiarity of this extractive sub
stance, that though digested with diluted muriatic acid, so

that all substances soluble by an acid ought to have been
taken up ; yet I found, after ignition ot the undissolved
mass, a portion of magnesia, which frequently amounted to
the whole of what was contained in the iron, and which
is never left undissolved when sulphuric or muriatic acids
are employed without anv addition of nitric acid.                The
magnesia, or its base, must therefore have entered into the
composition of this substance, as is the case in vegetables,
from which the various earths met with in the ashts never
can be separated by acids before comhustion.
      1. A piece of cast iron (part of the same mass that was
 employed for all the analyses hereafter described) weighing
 1 9- 1 grammes, was dissolved in a mixture of sulphuric acid,
nitric acid, and water. The dark-brown solution produced
 was strained through a weighed filter, and the black-brown
 mass left on the filter was first washed with water and
 nitric acid, to remove all the iron, and then with boiling
 water. That which passed through during the washing
 with boiling water deposited a brown substance on cooling.
 The dried filler had gained 0-225 of a gramme of adherent
 brown extractive substance, of which 015 could be taken              .
 from the filter without injuring the paper: this when burnt
 led 0*08 of a gramme of grav-red ashes corresponding to
 0 045 for the 0-225 of extractive substance.            These ashes
 when boiled with muriatic acid li ft 0-025 of silica, equal
 to 0 037 for the whole mass.             Out of the solution sa
 turated with caustic ammonia was precipitated a vestige of
 iron by benzoate of potash, after which carbonate of
 potash separated, on boiling, a small quantity of magnesia,
 but too diminutive to be weighed.              (Here it might be
 asked, how the nature of a substance can be ascertained
 when in so small a quantity as not to be weighed ?             1 had
 had an opportunity of discovering this by an assay on a
 larger scale.    From 107 grammes of the very same kind of
  cast iron, dissolved in a similar mixture of acids, I obtained
 magnesia in such quantity, that its proportion to sulphuric
  acid evidently distinguished it from lime and other kinds
  of earths. But as, in my experiments with the brown ex
  tractive mass, an indeterminable portion of its weight had
  been destroyed, I could not, even from this experiment on
  a larger scale, determine the quantity of magnesia therein,
  which at all events is extremely small.)           That portion of
  the extractive substance which was found partly dissolved
  and partly precipitated in the water employed to wash the
  filter, weighed, after drying, 0* 1 7 of a gramme, and produced
  0*017 of ashes in character like the former.          These ashes.

  substance (0-225 -"-OM^O-sO-SOS) consisted chiefly of silica
  about 0*05. The remainder is oxide of iron, magnesia,
  and a loss which is inevitable in such small experiments.
      2. The red-brown acid solution of iron was carefully
  neutralized with caustic ammonia : a pale yellow precipi
  tate was slowly deposited, which I took to be a mixture of
  silica and phosphate of iron.    The precipitate on the filter
  was well washed, dried, and ignited.            On burning it
  emitted vapours of sulphureous acid, and left at last 3*375
  grammes of a beautiful red oxide of iron.           It dissolved
  completely   in  muriatic acid, and  therefore  did  not contain
  silica : nor did it show any signs of precipitation with a
  solution of muriate of lead, even after several days. The
 yellow mass which deposited on the neutralization of the
  solution was therefore nothing but a sub-sulphate of oxide
 of iron.
      3. The water employed to wash this precipitated sul
  phate of iron had deposited, after 48 hours, a salt in large
 crystals, colourless, and resembling alum.          They had a
 sweetish astringent taste, and therefore from their external
 character I supposed them to be alum.          I dissolved them
 in a caustic ley of potash. A great deal of ammonia was
 disengaged, and red oxide of iron was deposited in great
 quantity, which did not get darker by boiling,  a proof that
 the salt did not contain any oxide of manganese. The
 ley of potash super-saturated with muriatic acid, and car
 bonate of ammonia added in excess, gave no sign of tur-
 bidness.    This salt therefore contained no alumina, and
was a triple salt of sulphuric acid, ammonia, and oxide of
iron.
     4. The solution of iron which had been neutralized was
mixed with caustic ammonia in excess.            The precipitate
taken on the filter was well edulcorated and mixed with
that before obtained (in No. 3), and thereafter ignited in a
platina crucible.      The burnt oxide was dark-red, and
weighed 22«S8 grammes.
     5. Three grammes of this oxide dissolved in muriatic
acid left on the filter a little of gelatinated silica, which
after burning weighed O'OI, answering to 89'28 oxide of
iron, equal O-075.
     6. The muriatic solution was neutralized as correctly as
possible with ammonia, then precipitated with benzoate of
potash, and filtered.     The percolated solution was precipi
tated with caustic potash in excess.        The precipitate be
came     black  in  drying,  and  weighed after burning 0*2.

                 An At tempt  to analyse Cast  Iron.          SSI
When dissolved again in muriatic acid, and precipitated
with prussiate of potash, it produced a white precipitate,
which by degrees assumed a purple tint in the air, and by
the blow-pipe       proved to be manganese.       Caustic  potash
separated from ihe remaining solution a vestige or magnesia.
    7. The alkaline solution remaining after the precipita
tion of the oxide of manganese produced no alumina when
super-saturated with muriatic acid, and thereafter mixed
with carbonate of ammonia. This cast iron, therefore, had
not contained any sensible quantity of alumina.
    8. The liquor of the solution which had been precipi
tated with caustic ammonia (see No. 4.) was             now eva
porated to two-thirds in a well covered porcelain vessel,
after which it was mixed with oxalic acid : in 24 hours it
deposited a most inconsiderable            quantity of a white
powder, which changed to red in drying, but after burning
blackened, and had (he properties of manganese.               The
remaining fluid mixed with sub carbonate of potash, and
boiled till all ammonia was expelled, did not deposit any
thing, and had therefore not retained any magnesia.
    But before 1 proceed to sum up the results from this
 analyttis, I must give an account of some remarkable cir
 cumstances attending the separation of the substances met
 with in the cast iron. The first relates to the iron and the
 manganese.        We know the certaintv derived from the old
 method of using the neutral succinates, but this acid is
 unfortunately too expensive to be applied where the greater
 portion is oxide of iron.        The action of benzoic acid up
 on the oxides of iron and manganese perfectly resembles
 that of the succinic acid; and Mr. Hisinger has already
 proved that it also may be considered as possessing certain
 advantages over the latter.       But one circumstance deserves
 notice, which might lead to an incorrect result; namely,
 that the benzoic arid during the evaporation of its salts is
 partially volatilized, and leaves a basic salt in the dried
 mass. The benzoat of ammonia is however an exception
 from this, for it always becomes acid. These basic salts
       ipitaie so much of manganese as the surplus of their
        can afford, and thus produce a diminished result. But
 if the solution is acid, no manganese will precipitate, and
 iron alone is deposited, along with the difficultly soluble
 acid.     It is plain that the free acid of the mixture must be
 no other than benzoic acid, in order that decomposition
 and precipitation mav take place.        The latter refers to the
 oxide of manganese and to the magnesia, tor the separa
 tion of which 1 do not yet know any infallible method.

ibto           An Attempt    to analyse Cast   Iron.
Vauquelin's proposal for precipitating the oxide of man
ganese with hydro-sulphuret         of alkali may not at all suc
ceed, and    so much   the less, as Berthollet states that the
oxide of    manganese   with the sulphuretted hydrogen pro
duces soluble combinations.         The same is the case with
alkaline sulphurets.     What first is added, precipitates no
thing; afterwards, with greater quantities of alkaline sul
phates, there will precipitate a mixture of sulphur, oxide of
manganese, and magnesia.         I had long before experienced
that sal-ammoniac when boiled with magnesia is decom
posed to a triple salt; therefore, in the hope of turning to
account this disposition of the magnesia for separating
it from the oxide of manganese, I boiled a mixture of
magnesia and oxide of manganese (precipitated together by
caustic potash and edulcorated) with sal-ammoniac in
greater quantity than would have been required for forming
a triple salt with the whole mass.         When on a continued
digestion   no  more  ammonia      was  disengaged, the mixture
was filtered, and precipitated with caustic potash.          The
precipitate contained so much oxide of manganese that it
blackened in drying.       I therefore varied the experiment,
so that a mixed solution of muriate of manganese, muriate
of magnesia and sal-ammoniac were treated with caustic
ammonia in great excess, and placed under a bell with
oxygen gas ; the mixture was taken out after 72 hours.
It had deposited a great deal of black oxide of manganese.
After filtration it was precipitated with caustic p'ltash ; the
precipitate was found black after drying, and had therefore
contained oxide of manganese.           Thereafter I endeavoured
to separate them, partly with neutral tartrat of ammonia,
and partly with super-tartrat of ammonia; but neither of
them precipitated thereby.        Mallate of ammonia did not
precipitate   the magnesia,    but   yielded a small precipitate
with manganese salts.      It did not however precipitate fully,
and therefore could not be employed.          A solution of borax
does not precipitate magnesia, but it precipitates solutions
of manganese.       If we mix a solution of magnesia and
manganese with borax, there will be no precipitation ; and
should we have precipitated the manganese by itself with
borax, and then add a solution of sulphat of magnesia,
the precipitate redissolves.      In short, the only method of
tolerable satisfaction that I have found for separating them
was this:  after having sufficiently burnt the mixture of
magnesia and manganese,        for the purpose of expelling the
carbonic acid out of the magnesia, they were weighed, dis
solved in diluted sulphuric acid, which left a great portion

of oxide of manganese undissolved, and then the dissolved
oxide of manganese precipitated with prussic alkali ; after
which the magnesia was separated with caustic potash*.
     This analysis gives the following products from the cast
iron     :
     Red oxide of iron                                               25-660

     If    100 parts of red oxide of iron consist of 30-60 parts
of oxygen, and 69*34 parts of ironf, then these 2566 of
oxide of iron correspond to 1 7*85 of pure iron in the 19-1
 grammes of the analysed cast iron.
     If    100 parts of burnt oxide of manganese consist of 29               J
 oxygen and 70$ metallic manganese, then 1-485 gramme
 of oxide indicates 1-043 metal of manganese. By adding
 the manganese to the quantum of iron, then, what is defi
 cient in 19- 1=0* II of a gramme will be loss, and carbon.

     The loss exhibited by         the foregoing analysis is too small.
      I    therefore thought it probable that a great portion of
 sulphuric acid, notwithstanding the strong ignition, might
 have remained in the oxide of the iron; which determined
 me to repeat the analysis in a different manner.
      1 . To ascertain in a positive manner the quantity of car
 bon present in the cast iron, I pulverized a part of the
 bruised crystals in a cast-iron mortar, and sifted the powder
 through a fine linen cloth. I did not collect what first went
 through, and which might possibly be defiled by dust from

 grammes of pure and recently crystallized nitre, which held
 no mechanical intermixture of combustible substances.
 The mixture was put in a retort of glass luted to a tubu
 lated receiver, from whence the disengaged gas was con
 ducted through lime-water in several bottles. The retort
 was heated in a sand cupel. A little before the commence
 ment of the ignition, gas was disengaged, which made the
 lime-water turbid ; an effect which lasted as long as any
 disengagement of gas took place, and which continued
 slowly during the ignition for four hours ; after which it
 ceased, and the apparatus was left to cool       Carbonate of
 lime had deposited only in the first and second bottle. The
 lime-water, which in both was still caustic, was decanted,
 and the lime was repeatedly washed with water.         It was
 then separated from the bottles with muriatic acid, from
 which it was precipitated with carbonate of ammonia. The
 mass which remained in the retort was alkaline, and con
 tained at the bottom a black, somewhat brownish oxide of
iron. It was dissolved in water freed from oxide of iron
 by filtration, and precipitated with a much diluted solution
 of muriate of lime. The precipitated muriate of lime
 mixed with that obtained from the lime-water, weighed
 after washing and drying 1 *6 gramme, which (when 100
 parts carbonate of lime contain 43*6 of carbonic acid) cor
respond to 0-697 parts of carbonic acid. These (since car
bonic acid contains 28*46 per cent, of carbon) correspond
to 0*1983 of carbon ; which divided among five grammes
of cast iron, produces 0*0396 of carbon per gramme, or 3*96
per cent.     The dark oxide of iron obtained was difficultly
soluble in muriatic acid, and gave no signs of the disen
gagement of hydrogen gas.
    2. 7 9 grammes of the same cast iron were dissolved in

nitric acid in a weighed glass phial ; the solution was of a
thick consistency, black-brown and opake. It was evapo
rated to dryness, and burnt in the phial. The cast iron had
gained 2*65 grammes in weight, and left 10*55 grammes of
impure oxide of iron.      On taking out the oxide, there was
yet found a rcgulus piece of iron which weighed 0 7575,
and after the solution in nitric acid, and after the ignition
of the nitrate of iron, weighed 1*057 gramme; so that the
total oxide of iron obtained was 10*837 grammes, of which-
all could not be considered red oxide, since the stratum
nearest the regulus must have been black oxide, and the
exterior crust of the regulus must also have contained some.
If we now assume that all were oxide of iron in this assay,

 or, what amounts      to the same, that the oxide of manganese
 and the silica had not contained oxygen in such a propor
 tion to the oxide of iron as to have much influenced the
 result, then 10*837 grammes oxide correspond to 7*542
 grammes of metallic mass ; after which there remain 0*357 of
 a gramme of loss, which in this experiment can be nothing
 else than carbon, and being divided among 7*9 grammes of
 cast iron, gives 4*5 per cent, of carbon.         This must evi
 dently be too much, when we see that the oxide obtained
 could not possibly be oxidated to maximum in the whole
 of its mass.
       3. Since the result of the preceding experiment was at
  all events very indecisive, I repeated it with five grammes of
  coarsely bruised cast iron, which was dissolved completely
  in so much nitric acid, that the solution, when viewed
  against the flame of a candle, was found clear at bottom,
  without any iron being left undissolved.           Evaporated in
  the same vessel to dryness, and burnt, there were left 6*995
  grammes of oxide of iron.         But before T undertake to de
  termine the quantity of carbon in this experiment, I must
  first mention an attempt made to discover more exactly the
   quantity of manganese.
        4. Five grammes of the same cast iron were dissolved in
   an apparatus for disengaging gas, with the assistance of
  very gentle heat.       The gas was received over rain-water,
   and amounted to 65 Swedish decimal cubic inches ; or,
   minus 1 cubic inch as much as from 4 grammes of mal
   leable iron dissolved in the same apparatus, and conse-
               diluted with an equal volume of atmospheric air
   ?|uently
      rom the vessel.    The gas was burnt in oxygen gas, and
   yielded 1*03 gramme of carbonate of lime, the carbonic
   acid being detained by lime-water.       But in this experiment
   the whole apparaius was become coated with a fetid oil,
 which also collected on the water in the
                                                  apparatus in the
   form of . iridescent pellicles, and which admitted be
    ing washed off" with alcohol,        after the solution     was
    poured out from the phial in which the solution was per
    formed.      We thus find it impossible that the whole quan
    tity of carbon in the iron could be contained in the gas ;
    besides that, on the combustion of the gas, the last portions
    were certainly prevented from complete deflagration by the
    copiously formed carbonic acid, which also the altered co
    lour of the flame appeared to indicate.      The 103 of car
    bonate of lime obtained, answers precisely to 2| per cent, of
     carbon.     The muriatic solution was filtered, and left on
     the filter a gray, bulky, pulverulent mass, which after

washing and burning weighed 0-0125, and was silica,
which as near as ran be corresponds to the silica left un
dissolved in ihe before described experiment on a larger
scale.   The filtered solution was mixed with nitric acid,
and boiled to the hill oxidation of the iron y after which it
was saturated as perfectly as possible with carbonate of
potash, and then prtcipitaied with benzoate of potash : the
precipitate was separated on the filter, and the filtered so
lution, mixed with the inspissated water of edulcoration,
was precipitated with caustic potash. The deposit soon
blackened.     It weighed after washing and burning 0 335
of a gramme." Dissolved in muriatic acid, and precipitated
with prussiate of potash, there subsided prussiate of man
ganese, which was collected on the filter.      From the per
colated fluid, caustic potash precipitated a small quantity
of magnesia, which when burnt weighed 0*01 of a gramme.
    In the 6*925 grammes of oxide remaining after the
oxidation of five grammes of cast iron (No. 3.) there was
therefore 0*325 of oxide of manganese, 0 01 of a gramme of
magnesia, and (according to th<; before described larger
scale of assay, from which I could be tolerably sure of its
charge of silex) 0-0325 of silica.       As to the quantity of
oxygen in both these earths, it could very well be totally
excluded, since the whole quantity of both of them toge
ther does not fully amount to I per cent. But I know
from experiments of my own (though not yet in a slate for
publication) that the silica contains more oxygen than the
red oxide of iron; and that the magnesia contains less.
In the calculation I will let the one make up for the other,
since the error will be but an insignificant fraction.
   The case of the oxide of manganese is not so indifferent.
Fourcroy states that 100 parts of manganese take up 68
parts of oxygen for forming 168 pans ol black oxide of
manganese.      I do not know whether he in this place
means the crystallized black oxide produced by nature,
                                              but which also I
do not know that any chemist hitherto has produced arti
ficially without the aid of electricity.   Bergman estimates
the quantity of oxygen in the brown oxide at 26, and the
metal at 74 per cent.     I reduced a small portion of car
bonate of manganese free from iron, and obtained a rcgulut
which after a careful cleansing of its surface weighed
0*5075 of a gramme. It was not in the least attracted by the
magnet.      Dissolved in pure nitric acid in a weighed glass
phial, it yielded, after the evaporation of the salt and its
calcination iu the phial,0*7225 of a gramme of black oxideof
                                                    manganese.

                 An Attempt     to analyse Cast   Iron.          257
      manganese.      This makes an addition in the weight of
     0 215 oxygen.       Thus 100 parts of oxide of manganese
     after exposure to a red heal consist of 70*25 of manganese
     and 29 75 of oxygen, and 100 pari,s of metallic manganese
     take up 42* 16 parts of oxygen in forming this oxide.        This
     so nearly agrees with the red oxide of iron, that, without
     any remarkable error, we may calculate the quantity of
     metal by omitting the trifling         portions of manganese
     oxide, and counting the whole for oxide of iron, as 1 have
     done in the first and less successful attempt to oxidize the
     cast iron' with nitric acid.    A want of the metal of man
     ganese prevented me from repeating this experiment on a
     greater quantity, to attain greater precision.   But the result
     as stated is sufficiently accurate for the calculation we here
    require.    I also must observe, that the oxide of manganese
    obtained in the analysis of the iron was afterwards treated
    with nitric acid in a crucible of gold, on which its weight
    was found not to have altered in the least ; so that the
    manganese     in both instances was in an equal degree of
    oxidation ; which is a circumstance of great moment in the
    calculation.
        When from 6*925 of oxide from the cast iron we de
    duct 0 325 oxide of manganese, there remain 6*6 grammes
    for oxide of iron (contaminated with a most minute por
    tion of earths), which correspond to 4*5764 of pure metallic
   iron ; and as 0*325 of a gramme of oxide of manganese indi
   cate 0*2283 of metallic manganese, they make together
   4*805 grammes of metal.          If these be deducted from the
   five grammes of cast iron employed, there remain 0*195
   of a gramme for carbon, which during the experiment had
   escaped in the form of carbonic acid ; and this divided into
   five gives 3*9 per cent, which is 0*06 per cent, less than in
   the experiment for oxidizng the cast iron with nitre. These
'
   experiments may therefore be considered as perfectly cor
   roborating each other. They also prove that the carbon
   in cast iron is not present in the state of diamond, but in
   the state of graphit, or such carbon as is contained in car
  bonic acid to the amount of 28 per cent. ; otherwise the
  loss in the last calculated experiment ought to have been
  much less than the quantity of carbon in that with nitre.
  That it turned out greater in this experiment       is,  becausea
  loss could not take place in     it  but from erroneous data for
  calculating the quantity of metal.
       In order to prove decidedly that this cast iron contained
  neither sulphur nor phosphorus,       I   dissolved five grammes
  thereof in pure nitric acid  ;    the solution was correctly sa«

                      III. Benzoate   of Iron.
   a. One gramme of pure brown-red oxide of iron, previously
heated to redness,     was dissolved in muriatic acid with the
assistance of a gentle heat.     The solution was diluted with
water, and was neutralized as accurately as possible with
caustic ammonia; and benzoate of ammonia was added as
long as any deposit could be produced.          The precipitate,
which was bulky, was, whde wet, of a pale reddish yellow
 colour.    It was gathered on a clean, well dried, and nicely
weighed filter. The precipitate was carefully edulcorated
with water, and dried by standing for several days on a
heated stove, until it had ceased to diminish in weight.
The colour remained the same as in its wet state, only
somewhat paler.        After having assumed the temperature
of the apartment (+17° of the centigrade thermometer), it
weighed 4-00 grammes. Thus 100 parts of an-dricd ben
zoate of iron contain 25 parts of red oxide of iron, aud 75
parts of benzoic acid and water.
                                                                 ;

           Benzoaies with the earthy and metallic Salts.         259
 solutions ; and this subject being of great moment for
  analytical chemistry, I undertook to examine more closely
  the changes which bcnzoates occasion in solutions of the
 arths and metals.
      I must first remark, that the solutions of all the earths
 and metals employed were to the utmost saturated and
 neutralized with pure ammonia, and diluted with water.
 That the benzoate had been prepared from pure, sublimated
 and white acid, is superfluous to mention, as also that all
  the earths      and metals   made use   of  possessed  the highest
 degree    of purity.
            I.   Benzoate of Ammonia with earthy Salts.
      1.  In  a  solution of nitrate of baryta no precipitation took
  place, when some drops of benzoate of ammonia were added.
      2. In a muriatic solution of strontia, no precipitation.
,     3.  In muriate of magnesia, no precipitation.
      4. With nitrate of yttria, a white precipitate is pro
 duced, but which soon redissolves on diluting and shaking
 the fluid.
      5. With muriate of lime, there is produced a white pre
 cipitation which is somewhat difficultly soluble, but which
on diluting and shaking disappears.
      6. In a solution of alum saturated with ammonia there
 will be found a white precipitate, which dissolves slowly
 when greatly diluted.          In a diluted and neutralized solu
  tion of sulphate of alumina, the benzoate of alumine dis
 solves with facility in the cold, by agitation with beryl
 and zirkonia. I have not been enabled to learn its action,
 owing to the want of these earths.
                II.  Benzoate   of Ammonia with Metals.
      1.  With a solution of gold, no precipitation.
      2.  With a solution of platina, no precipitation.
      3. With nitrate of pure nickel, no precipitation.
      4. With sulphate of zinc, no precipitation.
      5. With nitrate of cobalt, no precipitation.
      6. In tunstat of ammonia, no precipitation.
      If a little   nitric acid be added, there will be a copious
 white precipitate, which in water is nearly insoluble.
      7. With molybdat of ammonia, no precipitation.
      8. With muriate of manganese, no precipitation.
      9. With nitrate of silver, a white precipitate which
easily dissolved by agitation.

   I. The fluid after the precipitation with benzoate of
ammonia was colourless.
   1 . With a few drops of sulphuret of ammonia there oc
curred only a pale yellowish gray, and after 24 hours there
was deposited a little dark yellow sulphur.
   2. With caustic ammonia in excess, there was no tur
bidity or dullness.
   3. With tincture of galls made with alcohol,  at first no
alteration, but after several hours a weak grayish colour
appeared.
   4. With succinate of ammonia, no alteration.
   5. With prussiate of ammonia,  did not become blue,
but only somewhat muddy, and after a long time deposited
a pellicle of Prussian blue.
   c. One gramme of dry benzoate of iron was heated for half
an hour, whereby it at first swelled, smoked, burned and
charred.    A dark-red oxide remained, which dissolved com
pletely in muriatic acid; it weighed full 0*24 of a gramme,
agreeing, except a centigramme, with the proportion in the
former experiment (a). The difference was owing to a
smaller charge of oxygen in the oxide heated to redness
along with the acid.
   d. Ten parts (about five grammes) benzoate of iron were
mixed with six ounces of water, and placed in a heat of
 + 17 to 18° for 24 hours; during which the phial was
often shaken.      Gathered on a clean, dried, and accurately
weighed filter, it showed afte.r drying a loss of nearly
of a gramme. On the evaporation of the water, there re
mained faint traces of red oxide of iron that could not be
weighed, besides a small portion of benzoic acid.
   e. Fifty parts of benzoate of iron were boiled one hour
with four ounces of water. The salt was partly unaltered,
partly decomposed      to oxide, and also in part dissolved.
Boiling water produces therefore a more speedy and more
general effect on this benzoate than cold water.
  J".  Benzoate of iron dissolves in moderately strong mu
riatic acid, when agitated.    A surplus of acid should there
fore be carefully avoided in all precipitations with ben-
zoates.
   g. 25 grammes of benzoate of iron were mixed and
agitated in  a closed phial with about one ounce of caustic
ammonia.      After resting 12 hours on     a   warm »jove, the
clear benzoate of ammonia was         by
                                       filtering separated from
the oxide of iron, which, after being collected and washed
on a    nicely weighed filter and well dried, weiohed      6  50
grammes, which (minus       0 95 grammes) coincides with ih*

  and baked together in hard pieces.
    IV.   Attempt to separate Iron with Benzoate        of Ammonia.
      a. 0*20 of'a gramme of red oxide of iron was dissolved in
  muriatic acid, and mixed with a solution ot pure alumina
  in sulphuric acid, where the weight of the alumina was
  several times greater than that of the oxide of iron.          The
 mixed solution was neutralized with caustic ammonia, di
 luted with water, and benzoate of ammonia added until a
  portion taken therelrom did not with tincture of galls dis
  cover any iron therein.        The fluid was agitated now and
 then, and after the space of some hours was filtered.              It
 did not contain any sensible traces of iron.          The benzoate
of iron was well washed with cold water, dried, and aher a
 Strong calcination left the 0-20 of a gramme of oxide of iron
 employed.
     b. 0*35 gram, of red oxide of iron was mixed with 0- 10
 of a gramme of oxide of nickel, previously purified, free from
 iron and dark gray, and the mixture was dissolved in mu
riatic acid. The solution was diluted with water, accurately
neutralized with ammonia, and precipitated with benzoate
 of ammonia. The precipitate was well washed, and left
 after a strong calcination precisely 0'35 of a gramme of red
oxide of iron.      The iron was consequently to the utmost
nicety precipitated, and separated from the nickel.
     c. A similar experiment with pure cobalt and oxide of
iron had the like result.
     d. 0*40 of a gramme of red oxide of iron and 0- ' 5 gram, of
calcined pure oxide of manganese were dissolved in di
luted muriatic acid.        The surplus of acid was saturated
with caustic     ammonia.      Benzoate of ammonia was added
nntil all precipiiation    ceased ; this was taken     on the filter,
which was correctly weighed,          was washed    well   with cold
water,    dried, and calcined strongly.   The   residue   was a pure
dark    red  oxide of iron weighing  0'3a  of a gramme.     The   de
ficient 0-01 of a gramme was contained in what had stuck to
the filter and the crucible.      The oxide did not indicate any
contamination      of manganese.
    e. 080 of a gramme black oxide of manganese and 0* 10
of a gramme of oxide of iron were dissolved in muriatic acid.
The solution, diluted with water, was neutralized until a
commencement of turbidity, with caustic ammonia and the
                                                               oxide

  ©xideof iron, then precipitated with benzoate of ammonia.
  This precipitate, washed and calcined, left within a trifleO- 10
  of a gramme red oxide of iron. The solution was evaporated
  to dryness.     On the redissolulion of the remaining 6alt in
  water, there appeared some traces of oxide of iron, derived
  from benzoate of iron, which during the washing could
  have been dissolved, and there was besides a multitude of
  black and light traces of coal, from the destruction of the
  benzoate acid during the drying of the salt. After these
  had been separated, the solution was precipitated with car
  bonate of potash by digestion, which produced white car
  bonate of manganese ; this became black after a strong
  and long calcination; joined to wh tl had stopt on the filter,
¦
  it weighed 0 795 of a gramme. Dissolved in muriatic acid,
  it showed no remarkable traces of iron by re-agents.
     It appears   from these experiments, that the method pro
   posed bv Professor Berzelius, to separate iron and man
  ganese by means of benzoates, not only answers perfectly
  the purpose, but also presents to us a hitherto unknown
  agent for the most accurate purification of nickel, cobalt,
  and most of the metals and earths from iron, on the sole
  condition that the solutions arc precisely neutralized and
  diluted, while at the same time the iron is oxidated to
  maximum.        The influence of this discovery, on all analy
  tical experiments, where iron so frequently occurs and re
  mains so stubbornlv, must be evident to all who are in the
  practice of such labours.            It should however be noticed,
  that after having precipitated the iron from a solution con
  taining several kinds of earth and oxides of metals together,
  then the benzoate added in excess ought to be destroyed
  by boiling the solution with some acid, to obviate any con
  fusion caused by the benzoic acid on the continuation of
  the analysis.

  In my    former experiments on the combinations of pla'ina
  with phosphorus*, I did not ascertain the agency of phos-

 phoretted hydrogen gas on solutions of this metal.                  I have
 since made an experiment of this kind ; and though it
 offers but little noveltv of result, it may not be improper
 briefly to describe the effects produced.
    When phosphorelted hydrogen gas is passed through an
 aqueous solution of muriate of platina, the gas appears to
 be partially decompounded at the surface, it loses the pro
 perty of spontaneous inflammation.             The globules are de
 tained at the surface of the fluid, and arrange themselves
 somewhat in the form of a honeycomb; and a yellowish-
 brown substance is at length deposited, uhi.h shortly after
 acquires a gray colour. If the gas is rapid iy passed through
 the solution, it inflames as in other cases ; but the moment
 this effect is produced, a grayish metallic-like substance
 partially covers the surface, which appears to be a phos-
 phoret of platina.
    The mode I adopted to procure this substance was similar
 to that used in the case of the hydrosulphuret of platina.
 It is necessary to use some precautions, in operating on this
 gas in considerable quantities, and therefore the retort
 should be previously exhausted twice from hydrogen gas.
A short time after the retort had been filled with phos-
 pboretted hydrogen gas, a gradual absorption of the gas
took place, and a yellowish-brown coloured substance
partially lined the sides of the retort, and the surface of the
fluid, which slowly increased in quantity, and after some
time acquired a gray colour.            Whether this yellow sub
stance is a distinct compound, or for the most part phos
phorus, I have not ascertained : the latter idea appears the
more probable. Whilst the hydrogen is employed in re
ducing the metallic oxide, the phosphorus seems to be de
posited in a minute state of division, and to combine slowly
with the revived metal. After the gray-coloured substance
had been well washed with distilled water, and dried in hy
drogen gas at a temperature about 212°, I examined it so
far as to satisfy myself respecting its constitution.                It was
in  the   form  of sinall  curved  laminae.      It  had    a slightly acid
taste, evidently owing      to the presence    of  a  little  uncombined
phosphorus, which had absorbed oxygen during its exposure
to the atmosphere.         It was for the most part -insoluble in
the mineral acids. When heated to redness in close vessels,
it furnished a gray semifused porous mass having the me
tallic lustre, water, and a little hydrogen gas.              The hydro
gen,   it  would  seem,   must  have  resulted   from     the  decomposi
tion of a little water. The gray-coloured substance in its

                 On some Combinations        of Plalina.        965
general    characters resembled      precisely the sub-phosphoret
of platina formerly described.
    Being desirous of ascertaining,       the effect of carburetted
hydrogen gas on solutions of platina, a tetort containing an
aqueous solution of platina was filled with carburetted hy
drogen gas obtained from acetate of potash. After some
time, the fluid acquired a purple tint, a slight film of a
blueish gray colour covered the surface, and there was an
absorption of the gas.         In an experiment of this kind, the
results were examined. The substance deposited, appeared
to be merely a mixture of carbonaceous matter and metallic
platina.
    The precipitates obtained by       the agency of phosphoretted
and     carburetted     hydrogen    gases on solutions of platina
were not deemed         worthy of a more minute examination.
I   must not forget to notice, that in these experiments I was
kindly assisted by my friend Mr. William Moore.
        3.  Of the   Combinations    of Plalina with Oxygen.
    The methods which are employed with success to pro
cure the oxides of the common metals, wholly fail in the
case of platina.        The difficulty of obtaining pure oxides of
 this metal arises from the property it has of forming triple
compounds with alkalies or earths, and chlorine or muriatic
 acid.      A want of due attention to this circumstance has
 occasioned several erroneous statements in the writings of
 some distinguished chemists.           Thus Bergman, in his early
Treatise on Platina, states that a calx of this metal may be

 platina*.     He sa\s also, that it may be procured by the use
 of the volatile alkali in particular circumstances.            The
 various trials that I have made with these bodies in different
 states, lead me to conclude that they are not oxides, but
 peculiar triple compounds.

     M. Proust says, that a pure oxide of platina may be
 obtained by treating the potash muriate of platina with
 potash, and neutralizing with sulphuric acid; but I have not
 seen the details of the experiment.           When drv potash mu
 riate of platina is boiled with a strong solution of caustic
  potash, it is dissolved ; and when neutralized bv sulphuric
 acid, it affords a substance of a dull yellow colour, which,

  to redness, and is partially decomposed : another compound,

   is a soluble triple compound, which crystallizes, and only
  differs, I presume, from the former in the proportions of its
   constituent parte.
      Mr. Cbenevix states the existence of two oxides of pla
  tina*, one of a yellow colour containing 13 per cent., the
   other of a green colour containing 7 per cent, of oxygeo.
  The yellow oxide is said to have been procured by treating
  a solution of nitro- muriate of platina with lime-water, re-
  dissolving the precipitate in nitric acid, evaporating to dry
  ness, and decomposing the sub-nitrate by heat.             The green
   oxide, by exposing the yellow oxide to a high temperature,
  so as to expel a part of its oxygen.
      These experiments I carefully repeated ; but the results
  I obtained, do not at all correspond with the statements of
  Mr. Chenevix.       For this reason it will be proper to give
  some of them in detail.
      Experiment 1.  80 grains of pure platina were dissolved
  in boiling test nitro-muriatic acid, composed of three parts
  of muriatic and one part nitric acid: the excess of acid
  was expelled by heat, and the muriate began to crystallize.
  It was now dissolved in distilled water. To a quantity of
 this solution, lime-water was added until the fluid rendered
 turmeric paper brown ; but no precipitate look place.               It
 was digested for some time at a moderate heat on a sand-
 bath, but there was no change produced.
     Experiment 2.  A quantity of pure platina was dissolved
 in nitro-muriatic acid, and the metal was occasionally
 added until the acid was completely saturated, and metallic
 platina remained at the bottom of the vessel : to the clear
 filtered solution, lime-water was added until the colour of
 turmeric paper was changed by the fiu.d, but no precipitate
 whatever appeared.       The only instance in which I obtained
 any precipitate by   lime-water,      was in the following experi
ment.
     Experiment 3.  A saturated solution of nitro-muriate of
platina was boiled to dryness, redissolved in water, and the
 aqueous solution evaporated until a yellow precipitate he-
 gan to be deposited.       It was then passed through a filter,
and was gradually treated with 41 times its volume of lime-
water ; after which, it rendered turmeric paper brown.
After some minutes a very minute quantity of a yellowish
flocculent substance remained suspended in the fluid, which
in about three hours precipitated. Several hours afterwards
the solid precipitate was collected on a filter, and after being

washed     with distilled water and dried, it weighed 2-fVtbs
Crams'.     It was of a brown colour. It was exposed to a red
heat" in a small retort over mercury, but no gas came over.
Ii was now of a blackish colour, and in the form of small
gtains.     It had a strong saline taste resembling muriate of
lime, and deliquesced by exposure to the air for a very short
time.     It seemed to be a compound of muriate of lime and
niuriate of platina, but I did not examine it minutely.
    I varied    these experiments, and occasionally repeated
them at different times with similar results. 1 also made
many other experiments to procure the pure oxides of pla
tina ; but as ihey aere unsuccessful, I shall merely relate
such of them as furnish some novelty ot result.
    I heated potassium with platina, in a finely divided state,
in a small platina tray ; the potassium entered into vivid
ignition, and a yellow insoluble substance was formed,
which furnished oxygen gas when heated: but though it
had been v*.ei I washed with distilled water, it still exhibited
distinct traces of the presence of alkali after being heated.
The quantity I procured of this substance was too minute
to determine its component parts; it seems to be a com-
pound of oxide of platina with potash.            It appears very
likelv that the pure oxide of platina might be procured
from this substance by particular treatment.
   The potash muriate of platina, when heated with finely
powdered caustic lime, furnishes o*ygen gas, muriate of lime,
and a black powder which vields ox\ gen gas by heat, and ap
pears to be a black oxide with probably a lit tie metal lie platina.
    The insoluble compound of chlorine and platina, when
boiled lor some time with h strong solution of caustic soda,
affords a b(ack powder, which, when well washed and dried,
furnishes oxygen gas and chlorine bv heat, and seems to be
a mixture of black oxide of platina with that insoluble
 compound.
    At the suegestion of Professor Berzelius, I digested some
 of the insoluble compound of chlorine and platina, in a
 Strong solution of caustic potash, for a considerable time,
 at a moderate heat.        A black powder was obtained ana
logous to that from soda, but it was not a pure oxide ; it
furnished both oxygen and chlorine by heat.           This distin
 guished chemist has recently made some interesting ex
 periments on the oxides of platina, which I presume will
 soon be published : he has determined from calculations the
 proportions of oxygen they contain ; but I believe he hag
 pot obtained these oxides in a stale ot purity.
     Whilst    I   was  engaged in  these  inquiries,  my friend
                                                                Mr.

  268              On some Combinations   of Platina.
 Mr. J. Sowerby junior put into my hands a compound
 he had obtained, in attempting to destroy some diamond
 powder by the agency of nitre in a platina crucible.            A
 quantity of nitre was mixed with diamond powder, and ex
 posed to a low red heat for some time in a common fire;
 on examining the results, it was found that the crucible
 had lost several grains in weight.        After the separation of
 the residual diamond powder, the substance in question
 remained.       It was washed with distilled water, and on ex
 amination      exhibited the following properties.     Its colour
 was black.       It was in small grains. It had a shining lustre
 resembling blende. It was tasteless, and insoluble in water.
 When a little of it was heated to redness on a slip of
 platina, oxygen gas was disengaged, and the platina reduced
 to the metallic state.      It did not appear to be affected by
 strong   nitric   or  sulphuric acid at a boiling heat.     There
 was scarcely any action produced on it by boiling nitro-
 muriatic acid.
    It was dissolved with some little difficulty in boiling
 muriatic acid ; and when the excess of acid was expelled,
 the insoluble compound of platina and chlorine remained,
and muriate of potash. Three grains of the black powder
were heated to redness in a small glass retort ; more than
half a cubical inch of oxygen gas was obtained, some water,
and 2*4 grains of a gray substance having the metallic
lustre. This substance readily rendered turmeric paper
brown. After the alkali had been separated from it by a
 considerable portion of distilled water, the platina weighed
 1*3 grain.
    From these experiments it seems that this substance is
compounded of oxide of platina, potash, and water. I shall
not attempt to give the proportions of its constituent parts,
the quantity in my possession was too minute to determine
this point with precision.          This substance can only be
formed at comparatively low temperatures. A more inti
mate acquaintance with it may probahlv lead to the know
ledge of some interesting combinations of platina.
    From the preceding statements it would seem, that' at
present we have no distinct knowledge of the oxides of
platina in a pure or separate state ; and that those sub-
Stances which have been considered as oxides, are in fact
compounds of this metal with metallic bases, and oxygen
or chlorine.
    As hydrogen is known to reduce certain metallic oxides in
particular circumstances, it occurred to ine, that it might
probably be employed with advantage to determine the pro

          of oxygen in     the   oxide of platina. With this view
fortion
   made   the  following experiments.
    Exfjeriment 1.  Into a retort of the capacity of about
40 cubical inches, one cubical inch of an aqueous solution
of muriate of platina was introduced ; the retort was ex
hausted of air, and filled with hydrogen gas.             It was im
mediately     removed   to  a  vessel  of water,   and the  stop-cock
taken off ; the absorption of the hydrogen, and the conse
quent reduction of the metallic oxide were very gradual,
and it was not till after three days that the platina was all
obtained in the metallic state : when carefully collected,
and previously heated to redness, it weighed 7*8 grains.
The hydrogen actually absorbed, amounted to 8*8 cubical
inches ; the barometer being at 30°, and the thermometer
60°. Now, as two volumes of hydrogen combine with one
 of oxygen to form water ; the one half of the volume of
 hydrogen absorbed, will indicate the quantity of oxygen
 previously combined with the metal obtained.              In this ex
 periment the oxygen in union with 7*8 grains of platina,
 absorbed 8'S cubical inches of hydrogen.              Hence that in
 100 grains would require 112*82 cubical inches of hy
drogen.
    For   7-8 : 8 8 : : 100 : 112-82.
    And    1 12-82 cub. inch, of hydrogen = 56'41 cub. inch,
 of  oxygen.     According to Sir H. Davy 100 cub. inch, of
 oxygen gas weigh about 34 grains.             Hence, 100 grains    of
 platina will combine with 1917 grains of oxygen.
    For 100 : 34 : : 56 41 : 1917.
    And 100 grains of oxide of platina existing in the
 aqueous solution of muriate of platina, will consist of
                               84 platina.
                               16   oxygen.
                              100
    Experiment <2.  This experiment was conducted in a
 manner precisely similar to the above.           The only difference
 was, that the solution of platina in -this case, contained a
 much larger quantiiy of metal. 21 "5 grains of metallic
 platina were obtained, and 25* 13 cubical inches of hydro
 gen wen- absorbed.            Barometer 30°; thermometer 60°.
 By   calculation   it will   be  found that, in this experiment,
  100 grains of oxide of platina appear to consist of
                         Plaiina           83*5

  §70          On some Combinations     of Plalina.
     In a third experiment 8-9 cubical inches of hydrogeir
 were absorbed, and 7 '58 grains of platina obtained : the
 barometer being at 30°, and thermometer 60J Fahrenheit.
 This result agrees very nearly with the preceding one. The
 difference between these experiments is not very great. No
allowance has been made, in the calculations, for a small
 quantity of hydrogen gas which would have been absorbed
by the water. There is some difficulty in making correct
 experiments in this way, as there is often a slight film of
 the revived metal deposited on the sides of the retort,
which adheres to it with great obstinacy, and must of
course materially affect the results.    It seems probable that
the oxygen is rather overrated in the two last experiments ;
 but I am inclined to think, from a comparison of all the
experiments, and making every allowance, that it can
scarcely be less than 16 per cent.      From calculations de
rived from the experiments of Professor Berzelius, it ap
pears that the peroxide of platina (which may be presumed
to exist in the above solutions) contains only 14*1 grain*
per cent, of oxygen.
    During the first of the preceding experiments,        I wit
nessed some phaenomena         which seem to illustrate in &
beautiful manner the attraction of cohesion.          After the
retort had been filled with hydrogen gas, and suffered to
remain for some hours in water, a number of minute me
tallic particles scarcely visible to the naked eye made their
appearance.     By degrees they increased in size, and were
perceived to be in motion.        They appeared to be flowing
from all parts of the circumference to the centre, where
they ultimately found their place of rest, and attached them
selves to a small mass of platina.     As they approached the
centre, they moved with greater velocity.         This pheno
menon continued for some time, until a considerable part
of the surface was covered with the metal. It appears to
succeed best when the aqueous solution of platina contains
but a small quantity of metal. The most perfect instance
I  have witnessed was when a cubical inch of the solution
contained only 7*8 grains of platina.        In other cases, it
may be presumed that the force of cohesion will be coun
teracted by the gravity which the reduced particles of metal
will soon acquire.
    1 shall not attempt to set limits     to the application of
hydrogen gas, as a means of determining the quantity of
oxygen in metallic oxides ; or to say, whether it may not
in certain circumstances revive all this cl.iss of bodies.
This however seems probable, that it will offer a simple

and accurate mode of determining the composition of cer
tain metallic oxides, and of thus reconciling the difference*
which exist in the estimates of chemists.
       4.  Of the  Comlinations      of Platina with Chlorine.
    My cousin, Sir H. Davy,           appears to have proved, that
in the present    state  of  our   knowledge, chlorine or oxymu-
riatic gas  is  a simple body,     and  like oxygen it forms pecu
liar compounds         with metallic      substances*.      The com
binations of platina with chlorine           have not hitherto been
examined ; they are not known in a separate state. Platina
 appears to form two distinct compounds with chlorine, one
 soluble, the other insoluble in water.           I have not examined
 the former, which appears to be produced in an impure
 state, when a solution of muriate of platina is evaporated
to dryness, and to be precipitated in union with horn silver
 by nitrate of silver.     This substance is very soluble in wa
 ter, and deliquescent.        My experiments have been wholly
 confined to the insoluble compound, which, as it is unaf
 fected by chlorine, may be presumed             to contain the larger
 proportion    of this principle.   In  making the details connected
 with the examination of this substance, I shall beg leave to
  adopt the nomenclature suggested by Sir Humphry Davy.
  Supposing the soluble compound to contain one proportion
  of chlorine, and the insoluble compound two proportions;
  the former will be called Platinane, and the Utter Platinana.
                             Of Platinana.
     This substance has been imperfectly known for some
  time, as the insoluble muriate of platina.             In the state in
  which it has been examined, it appears In have been a
  mixture of platinana with platinane, and has been supposed
  to he a compound of muriatic acid, oxide of platina, and
   water.
      When platina in a finely divided state is introduced into
   a reiort filled with chlorine gas, no apparent action is pro
   duced ; on the application of heat, they slowly combine,
   and a substance is formed, which passes from intermediate
   shades of brown to an olive colour, and there is a consider
   able absorption of the gas.         This substance appears to be
   precisely similar in external characters to that obtained by
   a mode which will presently be described, but it differs
   from it materially as to the proportion of chlorine.
   The combination in this instance is very partial, and
   merely superficial.     In the trials that I have made in this
                            Phil. Tram.

   iji            On some Comlinations        of Platind.
  way, I have not been able to combine platina with more
  than about 6 per cent, of chlorine, though the metal was
  in a very minute state of division, and successively heated
  in the gas. The circumstances unfavourable to perfect
  combination in the experiment, are the extreme density of
  the particles of the metal, the small surface exposed, and
  the facility with which the partial compound is again de
  composed by the agency of heat *.                  Probably the true
  compound might be formed in this way, by employing ex
  tremely fine platina leaf.
     The best mode I have found of procuring platinana, i»
  to boil pure platina in test muriatic acid, and to add occa
 sionally a little nitric acid; the solution, after being evapo
 rated to dryness, is treated with a small quantity of muriatic
 acid, which is again expelled. The. dry mass is then cau
 tiously heated nearly to redness, and afterwards boiled with
 a considerable quantity of distilled water, to separate any
 platitiane that may be present : after being washed and dried
 it is the substance in question, and exhibits the following
 properties.
                   Phybical and Chemical Properties.
     Its colour is dull olive brown or green.              It is obtained
 in small lumps, which are easily reduced               to fine powder.
 It has rather a harsh feel. It has no smell or taste. It is
 infusible.      It is not apparently affected by the atmosphere;
 at least no difference could be perceived in its weight or
 other sensible properties, when 10 grains had been thu3
 exposed for about four days. It is nearly insoluble in water.
 When it is kept in contact with this fluid, a minute portion
 appears to be dissolved or decomposed, and nitrate of silver
 occasions a slight precipitate : the effect is increased when it
is boiled in water. When a little of it is kept for several
days in water, a slight pellicle forms on the surface, having
the metallic lustre : it is probably the platina revived.             This
effect seems to be connected with the agency of light, for
I   found that it did not take place under similar circum
stances      in darkness. The direct solar rays effected no
change      on  platinana rubbed on paper, after an exposure of
several hours.         When heated on a thin slip of platina it
assumes a dark-brown colour ; at a red heat the chlorine is
    * It is perhaps worthy of notice, that several of the combinations of
platina in their relations to temperature, seem to exhibit remarkable pecu
liarities.  Thus the compound of potash and oxide of platina platinana, &c.
are only formed at certain temperatures i at lower degrees of heat the com
pounds are not formed, and at higher they are decomposed.
                                                                   expelle

                 On some Combinations     of Phtina.             273
expelled, and the platina remains in a pure state.         When it
is exposed to a red heat in close vessels, chlorine gas is ob
tained and metallic platina.       It is scarcely affected by test
muriatic acid at the common temperature, but when boiled
in this acid, a portion of it is dissolved ; the solution is of a
yellowish-brown       colour, and when evaporated to dryness
affords a dark-brown substance. This variation of colour
is probably unconnected with any chemical change, and
depends merely on its state of aggregation.           It is slightly
soluble in diluted muriatic acid at a boiling heat.          Strong
nitro-muriatic    acid appears to dissolve only a small quantity
        '
of. it.    It seems to be insoluble in nitric, sulphuric, phos
phoric, and acetic acids at all temperatures. Nor is the
agency of these acids on it attended by any thing worthy
of notice. When it is boiled in a strong solution of pure
potash or soda, a black powder is obtained, which, as I have
already stated, furnishes oxygen gas and chlorine by heat.
When it is digested in pure ammonia, it is partially dis
solved ; the clear solution, when evaporated to dryness on
glass, leaves a very delicate and pretty coating of platina,         -
which on being heated to redness becomes permanent.
When platinana is heated with sulphur or phosphorus, sul-
phurane and phosphorane, together with sulphuret and
phosphoret of platina are formed.         It is unaffected when
heated in chlorine gas.       It appears to be nearly insoluble
in alcohol and ether. When it is heated with red precipi
tate, calomel, oxygen, mercury, and platina are the results.
     The preceding statements seem to furnish distinct evi
dences of the constitution        of this substance; that it it
compounded of chlorine and platina.          Its direct formation
in chlorine gas, the results of its decomposition in close
vessels,     the products it affords with sulphur and phos-
  horus, are decisive as to this point.      Platinana appears to
  e the only combination       of chlorine and a metal yet ex
amined, which affords its elements in their simplest known
 forms by the mere agency of heat out of the contact of air:
the combination of gold and chlorine is analogous in this
 respect.
                              Analysis.
    The composition of platinana could not be accurately
determined by synthesis.         Its decomposition in the at
mosphere, in close vessels, and by sulphur, affords ample
 means of determining the proportions of its constituent
parts ; and from a comparison of experiments made in each
 of these ways, I shall venture to state its composition.         In
my    first experiments on a compound        of  this kind,   which
    Vol. 40. No. 174. Oct. 1818.                  -S            were

   were made at the request     of Sir H. Davy, and which he ha»
   noticed in his " Elements of Chemical Philosophy," p. 45 1 ,
   I obtained only 18"5 percent, of chlorine. I have since
  found that the substance then examined, was not platinana
  in a pure state. 1ml a mixed compound, which of course
   could not furnish correct results.
      Experiment 1.  15 grains of platinana were healed to
   redness in a small luted glass retort : when no more gas
  could be expelled, the retort was suffered to cool, and the
   results examined.      The gas obtained amounted to three
  cubical inches, and was chlorine: the remainder was absorbed
  by the water during the process : it had a yellowish-green
  colour, was absorbed on being agitated in water, and had
  the precise odour of chlorine.       The platina was in its me
  tallic state, and weighed 10*7 grains : there was also a very
  minute quantity of a brown substance in the neck of the
  retort, which appeared to be a little of the compound ex
  pelled during the disengagement of the gas.
      From this experiment, 100 grains of platinana appeart*
  be composed of about        71*33 platina
                              28*67 chlorine
                               1000
      For 15 : 10*7 : : 100 : 71*33.
      But in this calculation no allowance is made for the small
  quantity of the compound found in the neck of the retort.
  Hence, there is reason to conclude that the quantity of
  platina is here under-rated, which evidently appears to be
  the case from the following experiments.
      Experiment 2.  10 grains of platinana mixed with
  flowers of sulphur and heated to redness in a small retort,
  afforded sulphurane, and sulphuret of platina, which, when
  reduced at a red heat in a platina crucible, furnished T'ib
  grains of platina.
      From this experiment it would appear that 100 grains of
  platinana contain         72*5 platina
                            27*5 chlorine
                            100
      For  10  : 7*25 : : 100 : 72-5.
      Experiment 3.  10 grains of platinana exposed to a red
  heat in a platina crucible were entirely decompounded, and
  7-25 grains <if platina were obtained.
      This experiment precisely agrees with the preceding one.
r     Experiment 4.  10 grains of platinana which had been
  exposed to the atmosphere for about 10 days were decom
                                                         pounded

  pounded at a red heat in a platina crucible, and afforded
   7"2 grains of platina; probably, a little moisturemight have
  occasioned the slight difference in this experiment.
      All these experiments very nearly agree : as the second
  and third afford the same results by different methods,
 they appear to merit most confidence.                  Hence, 100 grains
  of platinana consist of 72*5 platina
                                  *27-5 chlorine

                   5.  Of the    simple Salts    of Platina.
     Scanty as our information is concerning the salts of pla
  tina, it will nevertheless be confined within still narrower
  limits, when what is erroneous in the statements of che
  mists is corrected.         An acquaintance with the oxides of
            ought surely to precede a knowledge of their com-
    inations with acids. If what has been stated in the pre
 Elatina
 ceding pages is correct, we have as yet no accurate infor
 mation relative to the oxides of platina in a pure or sepa
 rate state.
     What is supposed to be known concerning the simple
 salts   of platina, is principally derived from the experiments
 of Mr. Chenevix on the subject. He states the composi
 tion of a sub-nitrate, an insoluble sulphate, and an insolu
 ble muriate of platina.           The sub-nitrate of Mr. Chenevix
 is said to have been obtained, by precipitating platina from
 its acid solution by lime, redissolving the precipitate in
 nitric acid, and evaporating to dryness. This experiment
 I carefully repeated two or three times, but without wit
 nessing similar results.          I only procured a minute quantity
 of a triple compound, as I have already stated. When a
 solution of platina in nitro-muriatic acid is evaporated to
 dryness, and afterwards exposed to a pretty elevated tem
 perature, the greater part of the nitric acid is expelled : by
 raising the heat still higher, it is entirely driven off, and a
 compound of chlorine and platina remains, which cannot
 be decompounded by nitric acid.                 No nitrate of platina
 can be produced by the direct agency of nitric acid on this
metal; the nitro-muriate or muriate of platina, cannot be
decomposed by nitric acid, nor the muriatic acid separated
 by nitrate of silver, or by any other method that I am ac-
    * I have since operated on a much larger quantity, and obtained almost
precisely the same results: 71 grains of platinana, which had been drying
on a sand-bath for more than a fortnight, were decomposed at a red neat
in a platina crucible, and furnished 51 5 grains of platma.

 quainted with : and it does not appear that any pure oxide
 of platina has yel been dissolved in nitric acid, so as to
 furnish this salt.
    The insoluble sulphate of platina, according to Mr.
 Chenevix, was procured by expelling the muriatic acid from
 the dry muriate of platina, by means of sulphuric acid, and
 evaporating to dryness. The results I have obtained from
 a careful repetition of his experiments, are very different.
 It will be proper to relate some of them.
     Experiment 1.  15 grains of a compound of chlorine
 and platina (obtained by evaporating an acid solution of
 platina to dryness, and exposing the dry mass to an elevated
 temperature,) were boiled with some concentrated test sul
 phuric acid in a platina crucible. The process was con
 tinued until all the sulphuric acid appeared to be expelled.
 A substance analogous to the compound of platina and
 chlorine remained. A fresh quantity of sulphuric acid
 being added, heat was applied till no more sulphuric fumes
'could be perceived. The residual substance was then de
 compounded at a red heat, and during the process the
 smell of chlorine was distinctly perceived.
     Experiment 2.  Several grains of a similar compound to
 that employed in the preceding experiment, were treated
 precisely in the same way with sulphuric acid.                    Acid was
 added three successive times with a little water.                  After the
 expulsion of the acid by heat, the remaining substance
 had the precise characters of the original compound.                        It
 was now boiled to dryness with a concentrated solution of
 pure soda.        It became black. It was digested in distilled
 water. The clear solution gave not the slightest precipitate
 with muriate of barytes, but a very copious one with nitrate
 of silver. Hence, it contained no sulphuric acid.
    These experiments seem clearly to prove that sulphuric
 acid does not decompose the compound of platina and
 chlorine, or the substance which has been considered as an
 insoluble muriate.           The following experiment appears to
 prove, that strong sulphuric acid docs not expel the muriatic
 acid from a solution of platina, so as to destroy the com
 bination of chlorine and this metal.
     Experiment 3.  Some platina was dissolved in concen
 trated nitro-muriatic         acid ; the solution was treated with
 strong sulphuric acid ; a yellow substance precipitated *,
 and muriatic acid was expelled.              After the whole had been
 boiled for some time, fresh sulphuric acid was added, and
    I am Inclined to believe that this yellow substance is platinane.  I could
 ¦ot obtain it in this instance so as to examine it.
                                                                            the

 the boiling continued to dryness. The mass was now
  healed just below redness in a platina crucible.      It acquired
 an olive colour, and resembled platinana.          It was heated
 with flowers of sulphur in a small retort over distilled water,
 and afforded snlphuret of platina and sulphurane, which
 last flowed in drops into the water : it was partially decom
 pounded, and occasioned no precipitate with muriate of
 barytes, but a copious one with nitrate of silveY.
    From these experiments I must conclude, that no sub-
 nitrate, or insoluble sulphate of platina, can be obtained by
 the preceding methods ; nor are any such compounds at
 present known to exist.       The insoluble muriat of Mr.
 Chenevix was, I presume, a mixed compound of platinane
 and platinana with water.      I feel a reluctance in making
 these and the preceding statements, because they are op
 posed to those of Mr. Chenevix.      It would have been much
 more agreeable to me, to have confirmed his general results.
 I am convinced this ingenious chemist must have been
 misled by some circumstances connected with his experi
 ments.
    M. Tromsdorf * states that oxide of platina combines
 with benzoic acid, and forms a yellow-coloured salt. I have
not seen the details of his experiments ; but as the oxides of
platina appear to be unknown in a separate state, and it is
extremely difficult to detach chlorine or the alkalies from
platina, I must regard the existence of this salt as extremely
doubtful.     Bergman speaks of a combination of the calx
of platina with the acid of sugarf. The calx he employed
was obtained from a solution of platina by soda.         This sub
stance is not an oxide of platina, as has been supposed. After
being dried, it furnishes a little oxygen by heat, and a sub
stance analogous to platinana with muriate of soda. Hence,
there can be little doubt but that this oxalate of platina is
in fact a triple compound of this kind, with a little of the acid.
    Dr. Thomson speaks of a soluble prussiate of platina J.
t have not been able to gain any evidence of the existence
of this salt. Scheele found that prussic acid had no effect
on platina, or on those substances which were then con
sidered as calxes of this metal.          Bergman states that
prussiate of potash occasions                         solutions of
platina, and Mr. Chenevix and Dr. Thomson assert that
platina is not precipitated by the prussiates.     As a concen
trated solution of muriate     of platina appears to be a very

  of potash and ammonia I could procure, to ascertain whe
  ther there were any exceptions to such decompositions.
     The aqueous solution of muriate of platina, I found, pro
 duced a yellow precipitate in the acetate, phosphate, suc
  cinate, prussi3te, sulphate, nitrate, &c. of these alkalies,
 which appeared to be in all cases precisely similar in its
 sensible properties. I therefore presume, it may be stated
 as a general fact, that the muriate of platina occasions a
 precipitate in all the salts of potash and ammonia; and that
,the exceptions are merely apparent, arising from the use of
 diluted solutions, and founded on the solubility of the triple
 salts formed.

 XLVIII.      Further Experiments and Observations on the
     Action of Poisons on tlie Animal System. By B. C.
     Brodie, Esq. F.R.S. Communicated to the Society for
     the Improvement of Animal Chemistry, and by them to
     the Royal Society*.
 Since I      had the honour of communicating to the Royal
 Society some observations on the action of certain poisons
 on the animal system, I have been engaged in the further
 prosecution of this inquiry.          Besides some additional ex
 periments on vegetable poisons, I have instituted several
 v.ith a view to explain the effects of some of the more
 powerful poisons of the mineral kingdom.                    The former
 correspond in their results so nearly with those which are
 already before the public, that, in the present communica-              ,
 tion, I shall confine myself to those which appear to be of
 some importance, as they more particularly confirm my
 former conclusions respecting the recovery of animals ap
 parently dead, where the cause of death operates exclusively
 on the nervous system. In my experiments on mineral
 poisons, I have found some circumstances wherein their
 effects differ from those of vegetable poisons, and of these
 1 shall give a more particular account.            Whatever may be
 the value of the observations themselves, the subject must
 be allowed to be one that is deserving of investigation, as it
 does not appear unreasonable to expect that su£h investi
 gation may hereafter lead to some improvements in the

                                                                 healing

    healing art.                       I should hope, will be
                          This consideration,
    regarded   as sufficient apology for my pursuing a mode
                      a
 of inquiry by means pf experiments on brute animals, of
  which we might well question the propriety, if no other
 purpose were to be answered by it than the gratification of
 curiosity.
    In my former communication on this subject, I entered
 into a detailed account of the majority of my experiments.
 This I conceived necessary, because in the outset of the
 inquiry I had been led to expect that even the same poison
 might not always operate precisely in the same manner ;
 but I have since had abundant proof, that in essential cir
 cumstances there is but little variety in the effects pro
 duced by poisons of any description, when employed on
 animals of the same, or even of different species, beyond
 what may be referred to the difference in the quantity or
 mode of application of the poison, or of the age and power
of the animal. This will explain the reason of my not
 detailing, in the present communication, so many of the
individual experiments from which my conclusions are
drawn, as in the former; at the same time I have not been
less careful to avoid drawing general conclusions from only
a limited number of facts.     Should these conclusions prove
fewer, and of less importance than might be expected, such
defects will, I trust, be regarded with indulgence, at least
by those who are aware of the difficulty of conducting a
series of physiological experiments ; of the time which
they necessarily occupy ; of the numerous sources of fallacy
and failure which exist ; and of the laborious attention to
the minutest circumstances, which is in consequence ne
cessary in order to avoid being led into error.
                II.       Experiments      with   the Woorara.
     In a former experiment, I succeeded in recovering an
 animal, which was apparently dead from the influence of
 the essential oil of bitter almonds, by continuing respira
 tion artificially until the impression of the poison upon the
brain had ceased ; but a similar experiment on an animal
under the influence of the woorara was not attended with
the same success.       Some circumstances led me to believe,
that the result of the experiment with the woorara might
have been different, if it had been made with certain pre
cautions ; but I was unable at that time to repeat           in      it,
consequence of my stock of the poison being exhausted.
I  have since, however, been able to procure      fresh supply,
                                                          a
a.ndI   shall relate two experiments which     have made with
                                                      I
                                        Si                                 it.

t80              Experiments   and Observations  on
it.    In one of these, an animal apparently dead from the
woorara, was made to recover, notwithstanding the func
tions of the brain appeared to be wholly suspended for a
very long period of time : in the other, though ultimate
recovery did not take place, the circulation was maintained
for several hours after the brain had ceased to perform its
office.
     Experiment      1 .  Some   woorara wag inserted into a,
wound     in  a  young   cat.  She became affected by it in a few
 minutes, and lay in a drowsy and half sensible state, in
which she continued at the end of an hour and fifteen mi
 nutes, when the application of the poison was repeated.
 In four minutes after the second application, respiration
 entirely ceased, and the animal appeared to be dead ; but
 the heart was still felt acting about one hundred and forty
 times in a minute.         She was placed in a temperature of
 85 of Fahrenheit's thermometer, and the lungs were arti
 ficially inflated about forty times in a minute.
     The heart continued acting regularly.
     When the artificial respiration had been kept up for
 forty minutes, the pupils of the eyes were observed to con
 tract and dilate on the increase or diminution of light ;
 saliva had flowed from the mouth, and a small quantity of
 tears was collected between the eye and eye-lids ; but the
 animal continued perfectly motionless and insensible.
     At the end of an hour and forty minutes, from the same
 period, there were slight involuntary contractions of the
 muscles, and every now and then there was an effort to
 breathe.       The involuntary motions continued, and the
 efforts to breathe became more frequent.         At the end of
 another hour, the animal, for the first time, gave some signs
 of sensibility when roused, and made spontaneous efforts
 to breathe twenty-two times in a minute.           The artificial
 respiration was discontinued.       She lay, as if in a stale of
 profound sleep, for forty minutes, when she suddenly
 awoke, and walked away. On the following day she ap^
 peared slightly indisposed; but she gradually recovered,
 and is at this time still alive and in health.
     Experiment 2.  Some woorara was applied to a wound
 in a rabbit. The animal was apparently dead in four mi
 nutes after the application of the poison ; but the heart
 continued acting.        He was placed in a temperature of oo0,
 and the lungs were artificially inflated. The heart con
  tinued to act about one hundred and fifty times in a minute.
  For more than three hours the pulse was strong and re
  gular; after this, it became feeble and irregular, and at the

            the Action     of Poisons    on the   Animal System.           281
end of anbther hour the circulation had entirely ceased.
During this time there was no appearance of returning
sensibility.
    The circulation of the blood may be maintained in an
animal from whom the brain has been removed for a con
siderable, but not for an unlimited time. We may con
clude, that in the last of these experiments the animal did
not recover, because the influence of the poison continued
beyond the time during which the circulation may be main
tained without the brain.
                      III.   On the Effects     of Arsenic.
    When        an animal is killed by arsenic taken internally, the
stomach is found bearing marks of inflammation ; and it
is a very general opinion, 1 . that this inflammation is the
cause of death : 2. that it is the consequence of the actual
contact of the arsenic with the internal coat of the stomach.
But in several cases I have found the inflammation of the
stomach so slight, that on a superficial examination it
might have been easily overlooked j and in most of my ex
periments with this poison, death has taken place in too
short a time for it to be considered as the result of inflam
mation : and hence we may conclude, that the first of these
opinions is incorrect ; at least as a general proposition.
    Many circumstances conspire to show that the second of
these opinions also is unfounded.
     In whatever way the poison is administered, the in
flammation is confined to the stomach and intestines ;                         I
have never seen any appearance                   of it in the pharynx or
oesophagus.
     Mr. Home informed me, that in an experiment made by
Mr. Hunter and himself, in which arsenic was applied to a
wound in a dog, the animal died in twenty-four hours, and
the stomach was found to be considerably inflamed.
     I  repeated this experiment several times, taking the pre
caution always of applying a bandage to prevent the animal
licking      the wound.         The result was, that the inflammation
 of   the stomach was commonly more violent and more im
mediate, than when the poison was administered internally,
 and that it preceded          any appearance of inflammation of the
 wound*.           Some experiments are already before the public,
     Since the
                   greater part of my experiments on this subject were made, I
 kave seen an account of an inaugural Dissertation on the Effects of Arsenic,
 by Dr. Jaeger, of Stuttgard.      Dr. Jaeger has come to conclusions similar to
 those above stated, that in an animal killed by arsenic, the inflammation of
 the stomach is not the cause of death, and that the poison does not produce
 iti fatal effects until it has entered the circulation. 1 have to regret that I
 kave had no opportunity of seeing the original of this Dissertation.
                                                                        which

   282               Experiments and Observations               on
   which led me to conclude that vegetable poisons, when ap
   plied to wounded surfaces, affect the system by passing into
   the circulation through the divided veins.                  From this ana
   logy, and from all the circumstances just mentioned, it
   may be inferred that arsenic, in whatever way it is admi
   nistered, does not produce its effects even on the stomach
  until it is carried into the blood.
      But the blood is not necessary to life, except so far as a
   constant supply of it is necessary for the maintenance of the
  functions of the vital organs. The next object of inquiry
  therefore is, when arsenic has entered the circulation, on
   what organs does it operate, so as to occasion death ?
      When arsenic is applied to an ulcerated surface, it pro
  duces a slough, not by acting chemically, like caustics in
  general, but Dy destroying the vitality of the part to which
  it is applied, independently of chemical action. This led
  me at first to suppose, that when arsenic has passed into
  the circulation, death is the consequence, not so much of
  the poison disturbing the functions of any particular organ,
  as of its destroying at once the vitality of every part of the
  system. The following circumstances, however, seem to
  show that this opinion is erroneous.                  In an animal under
 the full influence of arsenic, even to the instant of death,
 some of the secretions, as those of the kidneys, stomach,
 and intestines, continue to take place in large quantity ;
 and the muscles are capable of being excited, after death,
 to distinct and powerful contractions ty means of the Vol
 taic battery.
      Experiments.  Seven grains of the white oxide of
 arsenic were applied to a wound in the back of a rabbit.
     In a few minutes he was languid, and the respirations
 were small and frequent.              The pulse was feeble, and after
 a little time could        not  be  felt.   The hind legs became pa
 ralysed*.        He   grew     insensible,    and lay motionless, but
with     occasional       convulsions.        At    the end of fifiy-three
minutes      from    the   time   of  the  arsenic   being applied, he was
apparently       dead   ;  but  on   opening    the  thorax, the heart was
found still acting, though very slowly and feebly.                      A tube
was introduced into the trachea, and the lungs were artifi-
     I have observed, that where the functions of the brain are disturbed,
paralysis first takes place in the muscles of the hind legs i afterwards in those
of the trunk and fore legs ; and last of all in the muscles of the cars and
face.   These facts seem to show that the influence of the brain, like that of
the heart, is not propagated with the same facility to the distant as to the
near organs; and this is further confirmed by cases of disease which occa
sionally occur, in which, although the paralysis is confined to the lower half

confined to the brain.

 brane of the stomach was found slightly inflamed.
      Experiment 4.  Two drams or arsenic acid dissolved
in six ounces of water were injected into the stomach of a
dog, by means of a tube of elastic gum, passed down the
 oesophagus.          In three minutes he vomited a small quantity
 of mucus, and this occurred again several times. The
 pulse became less frequent, and occasionally intermitted.
 At the end of thirty-rive minutes the hind legs were para-
 1) sed, and
                   he lay in a half sensible state.           At the end of
 forty-five minutes he was less sensible; the pupils of the
 eyes wtre dilated ; the pulse had fallen from 140 to 70 in
 a minute, and the intermissions were frequent.                   After this,
 he became quite insensible ; convulsions took place, and at
 the end ot fifty minutes, from the beginning of the experi
 ment, he died. On opening the thorax, immediately after
 death, tremulous contractions of the heart were observed ;
 but not sufficient to maintain the circulation.               The stomach
 and intestines contained a large quantity of mucous fluid,
  and their internal membrane was highly inflamed.
       These experiments were repeated, and the results, in all
  essential circumstances, were the same.                   The symptoms
  produced were, 1. paralysis of the hind legs, and afterwards
  of the other parts of the body; convulsions; dilatation of
  the pupils of the eyes ; insensibility ; all of which indicate
  disturbance of the functions of the brain : 2. a feeble,
  slow, intermitting pulse, indicating disturbance of the
  functions of the heart. Where the heart has continued to
  act after apparent death, I have never, in any one instance,
  been able to prolong its action by means of artificial re
  spiration.        3. Pain in the region of the abdomen ; preter
  natural secretion of mucus from the alimentary canal ; sick
  ness and vomiting in those animals which are capable of
  vomiting ; symptoms which arise from the action of the
   poison on the stomach and intestines. There is no dif
   ference in the effects of arsenic, whether it is employed in
   the form of white oxide, or of arsenic acid, except that the
   latter is a more active preparation.               When arsenic is ap
   plied   to   a  wound,    the    symptoms    take    place sooner than
   when it is given internally         j  but their nature is the same.
        The symptoms produced by arsenic may be referred to
   the influence of the poison on the nervous system, the
   heart*, and the alimentary canal. As of these the two
                                                                        former
       * When I lay that a poison acts on the heart, I do not mean to imply that
    it necessarily must act directly on the muscular fibres of that organ.    It is
                                                                           highly

  284               Experiments and Observations              on
  former only are concerned in those functions which are
  directly necessary to life, and as the alimentary canal ia
 often affected only in a slight degree, we must consider the
 affection of the heart and nervous system as being the im
 mediate cause of death.
     In every experiment which I have made with arsenic,
 there were evident marks of the influence of the poison
 on all the organs which have been mentioned ; but they
 were not in all cases affected in the same relative degree.
 In the dog, the affection of the heart appeared to predomi
 nate over that of the brain ; and on examining the thorax,
 immediately after death, this organ was found to have ceased
 acting, and in a distended state.               In the rabbit, the affec
 tion of the brain appeared to predominate over that of the
 heart, and the latter was usually found acting slowly and
 feebly, after the functions of the brain had entirely ceased.
 In the rabbit, the effects of the arsenic on the stomach and
 intestines were usually less than in carnivorous animals.
     The action of arsenic on the system is less simple than
 that of the majority of vegetable poisons.                    As it acts on
 different organs, it occasions different orders of symptoms ;
 and as the affection of one or another organ predominates,
 so there is some variety in the symptoms produced even in
individual animals of the same species.
     In animals killed by arsenic, the blood is usually found
fluid in the heart and vessels after death ; but otherwise all
the morbid appearances met with on dissection are _eon-
fined to the stomach and intestines.                    As this is the case,
and as the affection of these organs occasions remarkable
symptoms, it may be right to mention the result of my ob
servations on this subject.
    In many cases where death takes place, there is only a
very slight degree of inflammation of the alimentary canal :
in other cases the inflammation is considerable.                       It ge
nerally begins        very   soon     after  the   poison   is administered,
and appears greater or less according to the time which
elapses before the animal dies.                 Under the same circurn-
highly probable, that the heart is affected only through the medium of its
nerves ; but the affection of the heart ia so far independent of the affection
of the nervous system generally, that the circulation may cease although
the functions of the brain are not suspended, and the functions of the brain
may be wholly suspended without the circulation being at all disturbed.      In
proof of the first of these propositions, I may refer to my former experiments
on the upas antiar.in which the sensibility of the animal continued to the very
instant of death ; and respiration, which is under the influence of the brain,
continued even after the heart had censed to act. In proof of the second, I
may refer, among many others, to the experiments detailed in the Croonian
Lecture for 1810.
                                                                     stances,

          the Action  of Poisons on the Animal System.     285
stances, it is less in graminivorous than in carnivorous
animals.      The inflammation is greatest in the stomach and
intestines ; but it usually extends also over the whole in
testine.    I have never observed inflammation of the oeso
phagus.      The inflammation is greater in degree, and more
speedy in taking place, when arsenic is applied to a wound,
than when it is taken into the stomach.          The inflamed
parts are m general universally red, at other times they are
red only in spots.       The principal vessels leading to the
stomach and intestines are turgid with blood ; but the in
flammation is usually confined to the mucous membrane of
these viscera, which assumes a florid red colour, becomes
soft and pulpy, and is separable without much difficulty
from the cellular coat, which has its natural appearance.
In some instances there are small spots of extravasated
blood on the inner surface of the mucous membrane, or be
tween it and the cellular coat, and this occurs independently
of vomiting.      I have never, in any of my experiments,
found ulceration or sloughing of the stomach or intestine j
but if the animal survives for a certain length of time, after
the inflammation has begun, it is reasonable to conclude
that it may terminate in one or other of the3e ways.
    T am disposed to believe that sloughing is very seldom, if
ever, the direct consequence of the application of arsenic
to the stomach or intestines.       Arsenic applied to an ulcer
will occasion a slough : but its action in doing this is very
slow.     When I have applied the white oxide of arsenic to
a wound, though the animal has sometimes lived three or
four hours afterwards, and though violent inflammation bas
taken place in the stomach and intestines, I have never
 seen any preternatural appearance in the part to which it
was applied, except a slight effusion of serum into the cel
 lular membrane.       Arsenic speedily produces a very copious
 secretion of mucus and watery fluid from the stomach and
intestines, which separates it from actual contact with the
 inner surface of these organs, even though taken in large
quantity and in substance ; and in animals which are ca
 pable of vomiting, by much the greater part is rejected
 from the stomach very soon after it has been taken in.
 Hence, though a few particles of arsenic are sometimes
found entangled in the mucus, or in the coagulum of ex
 travasated blood, and adhering to the inner surface of the
 stomach, I have never seen it in such a quantity as might
 be supposed capable of producing a slough.         In one in
 stance, where a dog had swallowed a large quantity of
 arsenic in substance, a brown spot, about an inch in dia
                                                         meter,

 2Sf3            Experiments    and Observations  on
 meter, was observed after death on the inner surface of the
 cardiac extremity of the stomach, having so much of the
 appearance of a slough, that at first I had no doubt of it
 being so j but on examination this proved to be only a thin
 layer of dark-coloured coagulum of blood, adhering very
 firmly to the surface of the mucous membrane, and having
 a few particles of arsenic entangled in it.        On removing
 this, the mucous membrane still appeared of a dark colour ;
 but this was also found to arise from a thin layer of coa
 gulum of blood between it and the cellular coat.             The
 mucous membrane itself was inflamed ; but otherwise in a
 natural state.     I have observed a similar appearance, but
 occupying a less extent of surface, several times.         In the
 Hunterian Museum there is a human stomach, which was
 preserved to show what was considered as a slough pro
 duced by the action of arsenic.        On examining this pre
 paration,   I found  that  the   dark-coloured  spot, which had
 been supposed to be a slough, was precisely of .the same
 nature with that just described.
    Although the affection of the stomach and intestines
 from arsenic is not the cause of death, under ordinary cir
 cumstances, it is reasonable to conclude that it may be so
 in some instances, if the animal survives the effects pro
 duced on the organs more immediately necessary to life.
 Mr. Henry Earle informed me of an instance in which this
 appeared to be the case.        A woman in St. Bartholomew's
 hospital, who had taken arsenic, recovered of the immediate
 symptoms, but died at the end of four or five days. On
 examination after death, extensive ulcerations were found
 of the mucous membrane of the stomach and intestines,
which we can hardly doubt to have been the cause of
 death.
    It is an important   matter of inquiry, as connected with
judicial medicine,      how far may the examina.ion of the
body, after death, enable us to decide, whether an animal
 has died of the effects of arsenic ?       On this subject, how
 ever, I have only a few remarks to make.
    The inflammation from arsenic, occupying in general the
 whole of the stomach and intestine, is more extensive than
 that from any other poison with which I am acquainted.
 It does not affect the pharynx or oesophagus, and this cir
 cumstance distinguishes it from the inflammation which is
 occasioned by the actual contact of irritating applications.
    But little in general is to be learnt from the examination
 of the contents of the stomach after death. When arsenic
has been taken in substance, small panicles of it arc
                                                       frequently

         the Action of Poisons on the Animal  System.     287
Frequently found entangled in the mucus, or in the extra-
vasated blood ; but where this was not the case, I have
never known, in an animal that was capable of vomiting,
that arsenic could be detected in the contents of the sto
mach after death, though examined by the most accurate
chemical tests.    As some substances when taken internally
are separated from the blood very soon afterwards with the
urine, I thought it probable that arsenic might be separated
with    the urine also; but Mr. Brande (to whom I am
indebted for assistance on this, as well as on many other
occasions,) could never detect the smallest trace of arsernc
in it.
        IV. Experiments with the Muriate of Baryles.
    When barytes is taken into the stomach, or applied to a
wound, it is capable of destroying life ; but when in its
uncombined state its action is very slow.      The muriate of
barytes, which is much more soluble than the pure earth,
is (probably on this account) a much more active poison.
    Experiment 5.  Ten grains of muriate of barytes rubbed
very fine, and moistened wi.th two drops of water, were
applied to two wounds in the thigh and side of a rabbit.
In four minutes he was evidently under the influence of
the poison.     In a short time he became giddy: then his
hind legs were paralysed ; and he gradually fell into a state
of insensibility, with dilated pupils, and lay, in general
motionless, but with occasional convulsions.        The pulse
beat 150 in a minute, but feeble, and it occasionally inter
mitted.     He was apparently dead in twenty minutes from
the application of the poison ; but on opening the chest
 the heart was found still acting, and nearly three minutes
elapsed before its action had entirely ceased.
    Experiment 6.  An ounce and an half of saturated solu
 tion of muriate of barvtes was injected into the stomach of
a full grown cat, by means of an elastic gum tube.        In a
 few minutes it operated as an emetic. The animal became
 giddy, afterwards insensible, and lay with dilated pupils, in
 general motionless, but with occasional convulsions.       At
 the end of sixty-five minutes, from the beginning of the
 experiment, he was apparently dead ; but the heart was still
 felt through the ribs acting one hundred times m a minute.
 A tube was introduced into the trachea, and the lungs were
 inflated about thirty-six limes in a minute ; but the pulse
 sunk notwithstanding, and at the end of seven minutes the
 circulation had entirely ceased.
    From these experiments I was led to conclude that the
 principal action of the muriate of barytes is on the brain ;
                                                           but

288           Experiments    and Observations  on   
but in the first the pulse was feeble and intermitting; in
the second, although the artificial respiration was made
with the greatest care, the circulation could not be main
 tained more than a few minutes.      These circumstances led
me to suspect, that although this poison operates principally
on the brain, it operates in some degree on the heart also.
Further experiments confirmed this suspicion.        In some of
them the pulse soon became so feeble, that it could be
scarcely felt ; and its intermissions were more frequent ;
but in all cases the heart continued to act after respiration
had ceased ; and the cessation of the functions of the brain
was therefore always the immediate cause of death.        When
I employed artificial respiration, after death had apparently
taken place, I seldom was able to prolong the heart's action
beyond a few minutes.      In one case only it was maintained
for three quarters of an hour.       I never by these means
lucceeded in restoring the animal to life, although the ex
periments were made with the greatest care and in a warm
temperature. In some instances, after the artificial respi
ration had been kept up for some time, there were signs of
the functions of the brain being in some degree restored ;
but the pulse notwithstanding continued to diminish in
strength and frequency, and ultimately ceased.           I shall
detail one of these experiments, as it serves to illustrate the
double action of this poison on the nervous and vascular
systems.
    Experiment 7.  Some muriate of barytes was applied to
a wound in the side of a rabbit.         The usual symptoms
took place, and at the end of an hour the animal was ap
parently dead ; but the heart still continued to contract.
He was placed in a temperature of 80°, and a tube being
introduced into the nostril, the lungs were artificially in
flated about thirty-six times in a minute.
    When the artificial respiration had been maintained for
four minutes he appeared to be recovering ; he breathed
voluntarily one hundred times in a minute, and showed
signs of sensibility.   The artificial respiration was discon
tinued.    The voluntary respiration continued about nine
minutes, when it had ceased, and the animal was again ap
parently dead ; but the pulse continued strong and frequent.
The lungs were again artificially inflated. At the end of
four minutes the animal once more breathed voluntarily
one hundred times in a minute, and repeatedly moved hi*
limbs and eye-lids.    The pulse became slower and more
feeble.
    In a few minutes the voluntary respiration again ceased,
                                                            and

           the   Action of Poisvns          on the    Animal System.          28J)
and the artificial respiration was resumed.  The pulse had
fallen to one hundred, and was feeble     The animal again
breathed voluntarily ; but he ceased to do so at the end of
five minutes.   The lungs were inflated as before ; but he
did not give any sign of life, por was the pulse felt after
wards. On opening the thorax, the heart was found to
have entirely ceased acting.
     A probe having been introduced into the spinal marrow,
it   was found that by means of the Voltaic battery powerful
contractions might be excited, not only of the voluntary
muscles, but also of the heart and intestines; from which
it may be inferred, that the muriate of barytes, like arsenic,
affects the circulaiion  by rendering the heart insensible to
the stimulus of the blood, and not by destroying altogether1
the power of muscular contraction.
   The muriate of barytes affects the stomach, but in a less
degree than arsenic.    It operates as an emetic in animals
that are capable of vomiting ; but sooner when taken inter
nally, than when applied to a wound.      In general, but not
constantly, there are marks of inflammation of the inner
membrane of the stomach, but not of the intestine.          Ia
many instances there is a thin layer of dark-coloured coa-
gulum of blood lining the whole inner surface of the sto
mach and adhering very closely to        so as to haveit,good             a

has passed into the same circulation, leads to the same con

              V. On           the Effects   ofthe Emetic     Tartar.
     The   effects    of the emetic tartar so much resemble those
of arsenic       and    of muriate of barytes in essential circum
stances, that   would be needless to enter into

19©          Experiments and Observations     on
nutes : so that it appears that this poison acts on the heart
as well as on the brain; but that its principal action is on
the latter.    Both the voluntary and involuntary muscles
may be made to contract after death, by means of Voltaic
electricity.   The stomach sometimes bears the marks of
inflammation ; but at other times it has its natural appear
ance.     I have never seen any appearance of inflammation
of the intestines. The length of time which elapses from
the application of the poison to the death of the animal,
varies. In some instances it is not more than three quarters
of an hour; but in others it is two or three hours, or even
longer.
    When a solution of emetic tartar was injected into the
stomach of a rabbit, the same symptoms took place as
when it was applied to a wound.
      VI.    On the Effects of the Corrosive Sublimate.
   When this poison is taken internally in very small and
repeated doses, it is absorbed into the circulation, and pro
duces on the system those peculiar effects which are pro
duced by other preparations of mercury.        If it passes into
the circulation in larger quantity, it excites inflammation
of some part of the alimentary canal, the termination of
which may vary accordingly as it exists in a greater or less
degree.   When taken in a larger quantity still, it occasions
death in a very short space of time.      1 had found, that if
applied to a wounded surface, it produced a slough of the
part to which it was applied, without occasioning any af
fection of the general system. This led me to conclude
that the effects of  it,taken internally and in    a large quanT
tity, depended on its local action on the stomach, and were
not connected with the absorption of into the circulation.
                                       it
The following experiments appear to confirm this opinion.
   Experiment 8.  Six grains of corrosive sublimate, dis
solved in  six drams of distilled water, were injected into the
stomach of rabbit,
            a              means of an elastic gum tube.
                           by                                 No
immediate symptoms followed the injection; the animal
made no expression of pain      ; but in three minutes he be
came insensible ;   was convulsed, and in four minutes and
an half, from the lime of the injection being made, he died.
Tremulous contractions of the voluntary muscles continued
for some time afterwards. On opening the thorax, the
heart was found to have entirely ceased acting, and the
blood in the cavities of the left side was of a  scarlet colour.
 The stomach was much distended. The pyloric and cardiac

that the solution, which had been injected, appeared to be
confined to the cardiac portion of the stomach, and to be
                                                                 :
prevented entering the pyloric portion by the muscular con*
traction in the centre.
    In the pyloric portion of the stomach the mucous mem
brane had its natural appearance ; but in the cardiac por
tion it was of a dark-gray colour, was readily torn and
peeled off ; and in some parts its texture was completely
destroyed, so that it appeared like a pulp, on removing
which the muscular ana peritoneal coats were exposed.
   The repetition of the experiment was attended with si
milar results. The alteration of the texture of the internal '
membrane appears to have been occasioned by its being
chemically acted on by the corrosive sublimate injected
into it. When the injection is made into the stomach of
a dead rabbit, precisely the same effects are produced, ex
cept that, as the middle contraction is here wanting, the
appearances are not confined in the same degree to the car
diac portion.
   Experiment 9.  A scruple of corrosive sublimate, dis
solved in six drams of distilled water, was injected into the
stomach of a full-grown cat.       For the first five minutes no
symptoms were produced          After this, the poison operated
twice as an emetic. The animal appeared restless, and
made expression of pain in the abdomen.             He gradually
became insensible, and lay on one side motionless, with
the pupils of the eyes dilated.      The respiration was labo
rious, and the pulse could not be felt.         Twenty-five mi
nutes after the poison was injected there was a convulsive
action of the voluntary muscles, and death ensued.           On
opening    the  thorax immediately   afterwards,   the heart was
seen still contracting, but very feebly.
   The stomach was found perfectly empty and contracted.
The mucous membrane was every where of a dark-gray
colour.     It had lost its natural texture, and was readily
torn and separated from the muscular coat. The internal
membrane of the duodenum had a similar appearance, but
in a less degree, for nearly three inches from the pylorus.
In the situation of the pylorus, the effects of the poison
were less apparent than in any other part.
   The particular state of the internal membrane of the sto
mach, in this experiment as well as in the last, appears to

have been occasioned by the chemical action of the poison
on it. When I injected a solution of corrosive sublimate
into the stomach of a dead cat, and retained it there for a
few minutes, a similar alteration of the tdxture of the in
ternal membrane took place ; but it assumed a lighter gray
colour.    The difference of colour may be explained by the
Vessels in the one case being empty, and in the other case
being distended with blood at the time of the injection be
ing made.
    The destruction of the substance of the internal mem
brane of the stomach, precludes the idea of the poison
having been absorbed into the circulation.      We must con
clude that death was the consequence of the chemical ac
tion of the poison on the stomach.        This organ, however,
is not directly necessary to life, since its functions, under
certain circumstances, are suspended for hours, or even for
days, without death being produced.         Although the sto
mach was the part primarily affected, the immediate cause
of death must be looked for in the cessation of the functions
of one or more of those organs whose constant action i*
necessary to life.   From the scarlet colour of the blood in
tbe left side of the heart, in the experiment on the rabbit,
we may conclude that the functions of the lungs were not
affected j but the affection of the heart and brain is proved
by the convulsions, the insensibility, the affection of the
pulse in both experiments, and the sudden cessation of the
heart's action in the first ; and we may therefore be justified
in concluding, that the immediate cause of death was'in
both of these organs.       As the effects produced appear to
have been independent of absorption, we may presume
that the heart, as well as the brain, was acted on through
tbe medium of the nerves.
   That a sudden and violent injury of the stomach should
be capable of thus speedily proving fatal is not surprising,
when we consider the powerful sympathy between it and
the organs on which life more immediately depends, and
the existence of which many circumstances in disease daily
demonstrate to us.
   VII.
   The facts which have been stated, appear to lead to the
following conclusions respecting the action of the mineral
poisons   which   were  employed in     the foregoing  experi
ments.
    1. Arsenic, the emetic tartar, and the muriate of baryteg
do not    produce their deleterious effects until they have
passed into the circulation.
                                                    .   9, All

        On Variations in the Vibrations   of Pendulums.    «93
    2. All of these poisons occasion disorder of the functions
of  the heart, brain,  and alimentary canal ; but they do not
all affect these organs in the same relative degree.
   3. Arsenic operates on the alimentary canal in a greater
degree than either the emetic tartar, or the muriate of
barytes. The heart is affected more by arsenic than by the
emetic tartar, and more by this last than by the muriate of
barytes.
   4. The corrosive sublimate, when taken internally in-
large quantity, occasions death by acting chemically on the
mucous membrane of the stomach, so as to destroy its
texture; the organs more immediately necessary to life
bting affected in consequence of their sympathy with the
stomach.
   In making the comparison between them, we observe
that the effects of mineral are less simple than those of the
generality of vegetable poisons ; and when once an animal
is affected by the former, there is much less chance of his
recovery than when he is affected by the latter.
XLIX.      On Variations in the Vibrations  of Pendulums. By
                      Ez. Walker, Esq.
                        To  Mr. Tillocfi.
Sir,   A    letter from Mr. Thomas Reid, of Edinburgh,
published in the Philosophical Journai, No. 152, gives an
account of his observations on the effect of the attraction
between the weight and the pendulum on the going of
clocks.
   Mr. Reid observes, that " it will perhaps be thought
strange to say, that attraction comes in for a share in those
obstacles which stand in the way of good time-keeping.
This is what has never been even hinted at before; if it
has, I confess it is new to me."
   Mr. R. fitted up a clock to go a month or six weeks,
which he expected to keep the arc of vibration of
the pendulum as nearly constant as possible ; but after
keeping this arc perfectly for above two weeks, it surprised
him to find that it began to diminish its arc, and after a
time to increase again. This variation in the arc of vibra
tion he was convinced     " must arise from the attraction of
the weight for the pendulum."
   This variation in the arc of vibration, in clocks which.
    a month or more, is not a new discovery, for it has
Soeen known to me more than thirty years. My clock goes
                              T 3                     a month

a month or five weeks with once winding up ; but, to pre
vent the weight's having any effect upon the pendulum, it
is wound up every fortnight.
   This effect, however, is not produced by the cause that
has been supposed ; for the attraction between two bodies
of axfew pounds weight is too minute to produce any sensi
ble effect upon each other, when one of them is in motion.
But the true cause will be easily understood if we reflect,
that when the weight has descended as low as the bob, the
space in which the pendulum then vibrates is very narrow,
and consequently it meets with greater resistance from the
air, than when the weight is either above or below that
place.
   The truth of this hypothesis may be easily proved thus :
When the weight has descended as low as the centre of
oscillation of the pendulum, let the clock-case door stand
open, and in less than half an hour the pendulum will vi
brate in its usual arc, if not in a greater.
   The cause of this increase of the arc is evident ; for, the
air being less confined, the pendulum meets with less re
sistance.

           L. Mr.   Hume      on the Detection   of Arsenic.
                        To    Mr. Tilloch.
Sir,   In the three papers, which I quoted in my last letter to
you, I gave no specific process for detecting arsenic by meant
of the less soluble alkalies, the earths, at least by those
generally known by the term, alkaline earths; I shall there
fore beg you will indulge me by inserting the following
short experiments, in the first number of your excellent
Miscellany.
   Experiment I.  One grain of white oxide of arsenic
was boiled in ten ounces by measure of distilled water, to
gether with a few grains of carbonate of magnesia. This
mixture, being filtered and allowed to cool, proved to be a
solution of arsenile      magnesia; and was obedient to the
                        of'
silver-test, either when applied   the form of simple nitrate
                                    in
or of ammoniaco-nitrate of silver.
   Experiment 2. The same plan was practised with car
bonate of lime in lieu of that of magnesia, and the result
was pure arsenile
       a              oflime.
                                                 Experiment

             Mr.   Hume on the Detection    of Arsenic.       205
     Experiment 3.  In this case I substituted the carbonate
of barytes, and the product was a true neutral arsenite of
laryles.
     As neither of  these carbonates is soluble in water alone,
there    can be no error from an excess ; I have, therefore,
prescribed a few grains, meaning that there should, in all
cases, be rather more than the arsenic can take up ; and
 hence, these modifications of my test may be considered of
some value, and, in particular circumstances, may posses!
some advantages over the more soluble alkalies.
     From these and some other experiments on this plan,
 which I have not now leisure to describe, I am inclined to
believe, that white oxide of arsenic would decompose all the
earthy carbonates, forming with their respective bases so
 luble and, perhaps, crystallizable salts.
     The arsenite of barytes, on being properly reduced by
evaporation, afforded regular crystals, the precise figure of
 which 1 did not notice; and the small quantity I had pre
pared is not now in my possession, having given it to a
 scientific friend for examination.
     Lest the carbonate of magnesia might contain any por
tion of the precipitant or sulphate of potash, I took especial
 care, bv repeated washings with boiling distilled water, to
 render it unexceptionable on this score.      To the carbonates
 of lime and barytes, however, there could be no such ob
jection, as both were natural productions,  the first being
 pure marble finely levigated; and the last was the common,
 native carbonate of barytes, containing oxide of iron to be
 sure, but in all respects sufficiently pure for the purpose, ai
  the iron could have no material effect.
     I have not had time to try the carbonate of strontites,
 although I can scarcely doubt of the same successful issue,
  whenever this earth shall be subjected to the same process.
     With common pipe-clay I also effected an union, but         I
 did not persevere further than merely to assure myself
  that arsenic did not exist alone in the solution; and I was
  unwilling to prepare for my purpose an artificial carbonate
  of alumine, which, notwithstanding the utmost attention,
  cannot be readily divested of foreign matters.
      The magnesia in the solution hy the first experiment
  was readily detected by lime-water, and also by a solution
  of caustic potash, in the second experiment I found the
  oxalate of ammonia fully to answer my purpose, by proving
  the existence of time. As to the third experiment, any of
  the soluble sulphates, or sulphuric acid alone, will render
   the barytes distinct, and form, I believe, a precipitate rather

more copious than in the other examples ; and, should this
 be the case, one would be inclined to prefer carbonate of
 barytes to the other earthy carbonates, when we adopt this
 mode of detecting arsenic, namely, by native earthy car
 bonates.
    Jn respect to arsenite of lime, the oxalate of ammonia
 alone might, I should think, serve as a sufficient test, and
 prove the existence of arsenic by first showing that of the
lime: else, how could native carbonate of lime or marble be
 decomposed under such circumstances? It will serve, how
ever, as a corroborating evidence of the presence of arsenic,
and in no small degree add to our knowledge upon this
important subject.
    The same observations are applicable to the arsenite of
barytes.    Here, by means of sulphate of soda, for instance,
we can separate the earthy base, which must stand as one
proof; and by the nitrate, or the ammoniaco-nitrate, of
silver, for either will succeed, we can discover the arsenic
 as another, and thus complete the demonstration.
    Having anticipated " Dr. Roget's Reply," which is in
serted in your last number, by my letter to the Editors of the
Medical and Physical Journal*, I shall, for the present,
 abstain from farther animadversions upon that gentleman's
    Case of Recovery from Arsenic," and upon his two " Re
plies," published in consequence of my observations.            I
shall trust, therefore, that your readers will do equal justice,
by permitting me also to refer them to this letter, before
they subscribe their assent to what I still consider as an in
fringement upon my humble pretensions.
    My three letters are before the public ; they were pub
lished three and two years before the presumed discovery
of Dr. Marcet ; they contained the words potass, lime, soda,
or any other alkali ; and if these do not comprehend am
monia, and, by a fair induction, the alkaline earths also,     I
must confess there is an imperfection in our language
which even our best writers do not regard.
    Although it is confessed, that my discovery of the nitrate
of silver as the most effectual test for arsenic, did not occur
to Drs. Marcet and Roget, or to their friends, till their paper
was in the press, it is evident that many of my own obser
vations were inserted, with some trifling change indeed in th»
phraseology, before the
                            " Case of Recovery " was quite
finished and delivered from the hands of the printer.       Dr.
Roget's friends are, it is well known, both numerous and of
the highest respectability ; they are men of the first class

 for science    and for genius ; I am, therefore, astonished they
 never had even heard of any one of my three letters ; while
 Dr. Henry, a gentleman of no small fame as a philosopher,
 and of whom and of whose works they cannot be ignorant,
 writes thus, in his " Elements of Experimental Chemistry,"
 vol. ii. p. 391  " A new process         for detecting arsenic has
 been proposed by Mr. Hume, of London, in the Philoso
 phical Magazine for May, 1809, vol. xxxiii.                The test
 which he has suggested, is the fused nitrate of silver or
 lunar caustic."
    In my letter to the Editors of the Medical and Phyical
Journal, I have said  ** in a future edition of this meri
 torious work (Dr. Henry's Elements), its eminent author
 will, no doubt, prefer the silver-iesi to all others, and place
 it at the top of his list, where it will probably always re
 main."       I have spoken nearly to the same effect in my
 last letter to you ;  that this test, under whatever modifica
 tion or by whatever alkali we operate, ** must now super
 sede every other test for arsenic, and become the standard
to all future operators."          I then gave you what I called
 * another prescription " for my test,  another modification
 of the same silver-test. This prescription, however, was laid
before you with no other intention than to rescue my test,
when ammonia is chosen for the medium, from the very
inelegant and crude method projected by Drs. Roget and
Marcet;  that of employing two glass rods, one of which
only is required to be clean; and likewise to correct a pal
pable error,  that of using the nitrate of silver and the
ammonia separately and without limitation.

In     the section on " chemical attraction and the laws of
combination and decomposition,"               the Professor has ad
mitted the only deductions which are of a nature entirely
theoretical.       As these deductions are likely to perform in
fiiture as important a part in chemistry as Bergman's table*
of attractions have done, it is necessary (although they
are not entirely new) to lay before the reader a more detailed

  *9$               Notices respecting New Books*
 account of them, and          as  far  as  possible in the very word*
 of the author.       After stating      the nature of combination as-
 exemplified in combining oil and water by means of a so
 lution of potash, the latter having an attraction or affinity
 for the former, it is observed that a new substance is formed
 which differs from both the oil and alkali in taste, smell,
 colour, and in all its sensible qualities.               It is a general
 character of chemical combination, that it changes the sen
 sible qualities of bodies.          " The forms of bodies, or their
 densities, likewise usually alter ; solids become fluids, and
 solids and fluids gases, and gases are often converted into
 fluids or solids." Salts, gums, 8cc. dissolve in water; the
 consumption of charcoal in our fires depends upon its unit
 ing with a part of the air, with which it forms an invisible
elastic fluid : mercury is rendered solid by being heated
 with half its weight of tin, and a substance of this kind it
 used for silvering mirrors.             "  The gas produced by the
 combustion      of  charcoal     is  condensed     by another gas pro
 cured from quicklime and sal ammoniac, when they are
mixed over mercury ; and the two invisible elastic fluids
form a white saline solid," (carbonat of ammonia used for
smelling salts.)        Many substances may be made to unite
by   chemical     affinity or attraction : fossil alkali, sand and
glass  of   lead   melted together form flint glass ; porcelain is
formed by heating together mixtures of different earths.
"That chemical attraction maybe exerted between bodies, it
is necessary that they should be brought into apparent con
tact. Thus, no body will act chemically upon another at
any sensible distance. A freedom of motion in the parts
of bodies, or a want of cohesion, greatly assists combina
tion ; and this circumstance is so marked, that it was for
merly considered as a chemical axiom, which is still re
tained in some elementary books, that bodies cannot act
chemically on each other, unless one of them be fluid
or aeriform.       Such an extensive generalization is, however,
incorrect    : thus,   crystalline muriate of lime and snow, both
cooled to 0° Fahrenheit, act upon each other and liquefy ;
and crystals of oxalic acid and dry lime, treated in the
same manner, readily combine. The hardest and the densest
bodies, however, undergo chemical changes with the
greatest difficulty.       Thus the sapphire in its crystallized
state is not affected by boiling sulphuric acid ; but when
in a fine powder, as alumine, it is easily dissolved.                Mi
nute   division,   or   solution,    or fusion,  is  necessary  in almost
all chemical processes." These general and well known
facts premised, relative to attraction and combination, the
                                                                 author's

author's theory of definite proportion in the combination
or decomposition of bodies becomes easily comprehended.
* All bodies that differ in their nature, combine with dif
ferent degrees of force." This is exemplified in the tanning
substance being attracted from water by skins ; in indigo
and other dyes being attracted by vegetable and animal fibres,
and new combinations of them effected.         In consequence
of this principle, one body is capable of separating others
from certain of their combinations : from the same circum
stances, mutual decompositions of different compounds take
place. Hence double affinity, or complex chemical attrac
tion.   This leads us to the author's principles of definite
proportions.

And the difference   may be easily explained by supposing
that in experiments on the peroxide, it is scarcely possible to
convert the whole of the metal into potassium.
   " To give another instance in which the datum is taken
from  the peroxide : The peroxide of lead contains from
3 to 3*5 per cent more oxygen than minium ; and the first
oxide known, massicot, consists of about 100 of lead to
7'52 of oxygen; minium of 100 to between 10 and 12;
and the puce-coloured oxide of 100 of metal to about 15 ;

ing lead; and massicot is supposed to contain twice this
quantity of oxygen. 398 : 30 : : lOO is to 7-53.
   *' It would be easy to bring forward a great collection of
evidences to show, that in all compound gaseous bodies,
the quantities of the elements are uniform for each species*,
and that, when two gaseous elements combine in more than
one proportion, the second or third proportion is always
a multiple or a divisor of the first; and the case seems to
be analogous with respect to all true chemical compounds,

                 sulphuric  acid be poured into any solution of
 baryta, the solid precipitate of sulphate of baryta which falls
 down, is uniform in its nature, and always contains about
 34 of acid, and 66 of baryta ; and the case is the same
 with other similar compounds, and with neutral salts in
 general.
    " And if two neutral salts mutually decompose each other,
 in the interchange of principles, there is never an excess of
 acid or of basis *, and the resulting compounds are likewise
 perfectly neutral. Thus, if 100 parts of nitrate of baryta,
 which contain 41 nitric acid, and 59 baryta, be mixed with
 67 of sulphat of potash, which consist of 30 of sulphuric
 acid, and 37 potash, there will be found b9 of sulphat of
 baryta, and 78 of nitrate of potash ; so that 41 of nitric
 acid will combine with the 37 of potash, and 30 of sul
 phuric acid with the so of baryta.
    "  It is evident from these circumstances, that when one
 body has the power of detaching another from its combi
 nations, it will always detach the same proportion.         Thus,
 from whatever basis baryta attracts sulphuric acid, it will
 always detach the same quantity ; and the same quantity
 of potash, from whatever acid it precipitates magnesia, will
 always throw down the same proportion.
    " 8. In cases when an alkaline substance combines with
 more than one proportion of acid, the same circumstances
seem to occur as in the combinations of gaseous bodies. The
 proportion is either a multiple or a divisor of the first ; this is
shown by a very simple experiment, first made by Dr. Wol-
Jaston : let a given weight of the salt, called carbonate of
potash, be thrown into a tube over mercury, and diluted
sulphuric acid, sufficient to cover           it,
                                           be introduced into the
tube,   a  certain volume of carbonic acid gas will be disen
gaged   ;  let an equal weight of the sail be heated to redness,
when    it becomes    asubcarbonate, and let this subcarbonate
be treated in the same way,         will be found to give off ex
                                     it
actly  half   as much  carbonic  acid gas.

and perhaps minute investigation may show that they arc not anomalous.

and in all mutual decompositions between bodies of this
class, similar circumstances appear to occur : thus there
are two combinations of mercury with oxygen, the black
and the red ; and one appears to contain twice as much
oxygen as the other.        There are two known combinations
of iron with oxygen, the black and the red oxide of iron ;
and the oxygen in the first being considered as 2, that in
the second must be considered as 3; that                is,

iron take 29 parts of oxygen to become the black oxide,
and 43-5* to become the red.
     "The decompositions of compounds containing oxymu-
riatic gas, or chlorine gas               by
                                     water, afford the best and
most intelligible instances of double decomposition.             If
equal volumes of light inflammable air or hydrogen, and
chlorine be mixed together, and exposed to day-light, they
 ¦lowly act upon each other, no condensation takes place,
and they form an equal volume of muriatic acid gas; so
 that muriatic acid gas consists of hydrogen and chlorine in
 equal volumes; and water, as has been before stated, consists
 of two parts       volume of hydrogen, and one part in volume
                       in
 of oxygen. Now phosphorus and sulphur, and most of
 the metals, combine with chlorine, and form peculiar com
 pounds, many of which are decomposed                  by
                                                    water, and the
 results are phosphorus, sulphur, or the metals combined
 with oxygen, and muriatic acid; and the oxidated com
 pounds formed, are the same as those produced in other
 ways and;             evident, that the quantity of hydrogen
                      it   is
 given   to the  chlorine  to form the acid, must be exactly in
 the ratio of the oxygen added to the inflammable substance

     " Hydrogen gas, or inflammable air, is the substance of

 and it appears to exist in no definite compound in less propor

 of oxygen as 15 to I j and as 2 volumes of hydrogen to I of
 oxygen enter into the composition of water, the ratio of the
 hydrogen in water will be to the oxygen as 2 to 15 ; and it

 represented   bv 26; and uitrous oxide will consist of two
 proportions of azote equal to 26, and one proportion of
 oxygen equal to 15. Nitrous gas will consist of 1 of azote

 and 4 of oxygen, 26 and 60.

volumes of hydrogen and 1 volume of azote, will consist of
 6 proportions of hydrogen and 1 proportion of azote, or 6

    "  The weight of chlorine or oxymuriatic gas, is to that of
hydrogen nearly as 33'5 to 1 ; and muriatic acid gas con
sists of equal volumes of these gases, and therefore is com
posed of 33*5 of chlorine, and 1 of hydrogen ;  but 2 of
chlorine may be made to combine with one of oxygen in
volume; and double proportions of this gas combine to
form compounds, which, when decomposed by water,
afford compounds containing single proportions of oxygen j
so that the ratio of chlorine to oxygen is that of 67 to 15,
                                                                 '
and the number representing chlorine is correctly stated 67.
    " In like manner it is easy to deduce the number repre*
senting the other undecompnunded bodies; and they will be
found to correspond as nearly as can be expected, in what
ever way they are obtained.        Thus, whether the number
representing the proportion in which potassium, the basil
of potash, combines, be gained from its combination with
oxygen or with chlorine, the result will scarcely differ j for
8 grains of potassium, converted into the compound of
chlorine and potassium, 1 have found gain about 7*1 grains,

 and as 7*1 : 8 : : 67 : 75-4 ; and as 1*6 : 8 : : 15 : 75, giv
 ing the number representing potassium as about 75.
     "  It is easy to form a series of proportional numbers, by
 taking    J of these numbers, on the supposition that water is
 composed of one proportion of hydrogen and one of oxygen :
 but in this case the number representing       the proportion in
 which oxygen combines must contain a           fraction ; and the
 calculations are much expedited, and the       formula rendered
 more simple, by considering the smallest       proportion an in
 teger.
     " Mr. Higgins has supposed that water is composed of
 one particle of oxvgen and one of hydrogen, and Mr.* Dal ton,
 of an atom of each ; but in the doctrine of proportions de
 rived from facts, it is not necessary to consider the combi
 ning bodies, either as composed of indivisible particles, or
 even as always united, one and one, or one and two, or one
  and three proportions.     Cases will hereafter be pointed out,
  in which the ratios are very different ; and at present, as we
  have no means whatever of judging either of the relative
 numbers, figures, or weights, of those particles of bodies
 which are not in contact, our numerical expressions ought
  to relate only to the results of experiments.
     " If it should hereafter be discovered, that any of those
  substances now considered as undecompounded, consist of
  other elements, these elements must be represented by some
  division of their numbers ; and should even hvdrogen be
 found a compounded body, it would merely be necessary to
  multiply all the numbers representing the other elements,
  by some common number which would admit of a division
  into proportions, representing the elements of hydrogen ;
  so that no discovery concerning the composition of bodies
  can interfere with the general law of the definite nature of
  their combinations."
     Such is the Professor's illustration of his theory of de
  finite proportions in the chemical composition of bodies.
  Its simplicity and comprehensiveness must render it a great
  relief to the memory, enable the mind to methodize the
  vast multitude of facts which modern experiments have
  developed, and contribute to furnish a collateral test of the
  accuracy of analytical results in general. Facts seem to
.prove " that two or more proportions of one body attract a
  single proportion of another body with more energy than
  one "proportion, and that two proportions or more adhere
  to a single proportion with less energy than one proportion ;
  or, at least, that a second or a third proportion adheies with

 less energy than the   first." But   before this theory can be suf
 ficiently established,     it is necessary to rebut or refute the
  opinions   of Berthollet,   who  was the first to apply the law of
 astronomical or physical to chemical attraction. He has en
 deavoured to prove that the relations of the force of attraction
 to quantity are universal, and that consequently no such
 thing as elective affinities, properly so called, can exist.
 The powers of bodies to combine, he maintains, always de
 pend on their relative attractions and their acting masses,
 whatever these may be ; and he supposes that in all cases of
 decomposition, where two bodies act on a third, this third
 is divided between them in proportion to their relative
 affinities, and their quantities" of matter.       If this position
 were correct, there could be no simple law of definite pro
 portions. According to this opinion, a salt crystallizing in
 a strong alkaline solution must be strongly alkaline, in a
 weak one less alkaline, and in an acid solution it must be
 acid; which is not the fact. Sir Humphry investigates this
important question at considerable length, with his usual
 acuteness and perspicuity.          He denies ihe existence of a
general law, that the attractions of bodies for each other are
inversely as the quantities that saturate.         This proposition
of Berthollet he reduces to an absurdity. Thus: "mag
nesia and ammonia take up more sulphuric acid than equal
quantities of potash ; therefore Berthollet concludes that
magnesia and ammonia have a stronger attraction for acids
than potash : yet, potash instantly separates magnesia and
ammonia from acids ; and though the facility with which
ammonia is expelled from a compound may be hypotheti-
cally accounted for, by assuming that the ease with which
it takes the gaseous state assists its escape ; yet magnesia
is in an opposite case; and to account for chemical changes
by supposing the effects of forms of matter w hich are about
to appear, or powers not in actual existence, such as elasti
city or cohesion, is merely the solution of one difficulty by
the creation of another.          Ammonia, when solid or fluid,
should require a new force to render it elastic, and the co
hesion, in a compound, can only be regarded as the exertion
of the chemical attractions of its elements. The action
between the constituents of a compound must be mutual ;
sulphuric acid, there is every reason to believe, has as much
attraction for baryta, as baryta for sulphuric acid ; and
baryta is the alkaline substance, of which the largest quan
tity is required to saturate sulphuric acid: therefore, in
Berthollet's view, it has the weakest affinity for that acid :
but less sulphuric acid saturates this substance than any
                                                               other

other earthy or alkaline body ; therefore,, according to Ber-
thollet, sulphuric acid has a stronger affinity for baryta than
for any other substance; which is contradictory."
    The subject of " electrical attraction and repulsion, and
their relations to chemical changes," is discussed very am
ply by the Professor, and many new facts are brought in
contrast with each other ; but it is candidly acknowledged
that we have as yet no definite ideas of many phaenomena
in electricity.    No theory that has hitherto been devised is
at all compatible with the well-known facts : and although
the theoretical error of the present age may be that of at
tempting to simplify every thing too far, and to refer nu
merous phaenomena to one general principle ; yet it would
appear that some simple law, to which all others are subor
dinate or subservient, is still a desideratum in the science (if
a mass of conflicting observations may be so called) of
electricity.

                        [Continued  from p. 235.]
During       last month,    the Rev. J. Nightingale, one of the
curators,   delivered   before   the Society a lecture on Steno
graphy.     He    began by remarking, that to those who are
wholly ignorant of the art, he feared his best efforts would
prove duJl and uninteresting; but that if he should fail to
amuse and instruct, he begged the Society would not attri
bute that failure to any real want of interest in the subject
itself; adding, that it would be his endeavour to excite in
the members, a desire for an art which the lecturer knew
they would derive when its merits should be duly appre
ciated.
   "  Nor," said the lecturer, " is this method of recom
mending the art of short-hand writing chargeable with
novelty. The well-known Mr. Byrom gave lectures on this
subject before some of the most eminent and celebrated
men of his day. The Rt. Hon. the Earl of Morton, P.R.S ;
the Lord Chancellor Pratt ; the well-known Earl of Chester
field; His Grace the Duke of Oueensberry; Dr. John Taylor,
chancellor of Lincoln ; and numerous members of parlia
ment, were among his auditors and pupils."
   After this prefatory apology, the lecturer proceeded to
trace the origin and history of the art ; commencing with
a view of the Rabbinical abbreviations, of which the learned
Buxtorf has written an interesting history.                It was the
opinion of Nicolai that this art was introduced among the
Greeks by Xenophon ; and this opinion is confirmed by
Laertius, who particularly notices two modes of short-
writing, by contracted words, and arbitrary characters or
symbols.
   The Romans practised the art of short-writing at a very
early period ; and Etinius the poet is mentioned as the
person who first invented a system of writing by which the
scribes, or notarii, were enabled to follow the most rapid
speakers.     This method was improved upon by Tyro, Ci-
cera's freed-man; and still more by Seneca.                  Suetonius,
                                                               speaking

                       London Philosophical   Society.            309
speaking of Caligula, expresses his surprise that an em
peror in many other respects so expert, should be ig
norant of short-hand ; and Titus Vespasian is mentioned
as being remarkably attached to the art.      The lecturer then
remarked, that the various    modes  of short-writing formerly
used were composed for the most part of a set of arbitrary
marks and characters known only to the persons who in
vented and used them.       The art was consequently much
neglected. This neglect is apparent from the book of
short-hand mentioned by Trithemius.           It was a steno-
graphical dictionary belonging      to  an  abbot,   who gladly
sold it for a few pence, as the monks of his fraternity had
ordered the characters to be erased for the sake of the
parchment on which they were written. Some other books
of short-hand are mentioned as meeting with a similar
fate.   There         is,
                   however, said the lecturer,        short-hand

liqs, and others. One of the most ancient methods of
short-writing still extant,         Latin MS. entitled " Ars

now practised. The state of stenography in France, both
before and since the revolution, the lecturer described prin

              reference to the Researches upon Printing,
                  a                                                by
M. Lamhinet. He then described the attempt of the late
Bishop Wilkins to establish an universal language, and
also alluded to the curious writing of the ancient Welch,
as given     the ingenious Mr. Owen.
              by
   The history of the art in this country commences with
the treatise of Dr. Timothy Bright, who published his
" Characterie" in 15S8. From this period the lecturer
proceeded to trace the art in      regular chronological order
                                          a
to the invention of the late Mr., or, as he               comis
monly called, Dr. Byrom, who introduced         new taste and
                                                     a
method in short-writing, which, as the present Dr. Mavor
observes,   must form the basis of every future rational
system   .
   Having descanted on the various methods in use prior to
Byrom's invention, as also on some later schemes, Mr. N.
proceeded to describe,          by
                         appropriate diagrams, figures, and
                                     U   3          letters,

letters, the peculiar merits and character 6f Byrom's plan;
observing as he pas-ed along, that being himself neither an
inventor, a publisher, nor a teacher, otherwise than con
amore, of short-hand, he could have no partial or local in
terests to serve in the recommendation of this method as
superior to every other plan hitherto invented.
     On a large sheet the lecturer had delineated the various
powers and simple combinations of the straight line and
the circle; showing that from these two figures every need
ful character might easily be derived ; and that, in most
 cases, by simply changing the position of the same figure.
     Another sheet, No. 2, contained an easy and apt de
 lineation of the use of the vowels ; and this was further
 illustrated by sheet No. 3.
      From several curious mathematical diagrams, the lecturer
 demonstrated on geometrical principles the true proportion
 and curvature of the short-hand characters, from the size
 of the loop, chiefly as they are separately made ; and also
 fixed the proper angle of inclination                 of certain oblique
 characteis, both curved and rectilinear.
      Having described, as distinctly as the nature of the sub
 ject and the character of a popular lecture would admit,
 the elementary principles of Byrom's method, the lecturer
  next proceeded to recommend the system and the art in
  general, by the exhibition, round the So6ietv's Hall, of a
  great variety of short-hand specimens, exhibiting perhaps
  some of the most curious and interesting examples of the
  beauty, legibility, and practical brevity of the art ever pro
  duced.      Am°ng these^ specimens*, there is one marked
  C, which may fairly be consideied as one of the most cu
  rious specimens of short-writing ex'ant.                   It is a correct
  fac simile of Dr. Byrom's own hand-writing,                   from an ori
  ginal MS. in the possession of the Doctor's niece, a lady of
  distinguished merit and excellence, at Baceley in Cheshire.
  This specimen is rendered more -curious by an ornamental
  head-piece, containing an exact sketch of Byrom himself,
  taken from an original painting; being the only likeness
  of the Doctor in existence. Tht words of the specimen are
  St. Pachomius's soliloquy to the various members of his
  body, exhorting them respectively to perform their various
  duties with cheerfulness, obedience, and promptitude.
      This interesting lecture was concluded by a recommen
  dation of Byrom's method to the study of the learned pro-
       These
               specimens, and the various diagrams, Sec. tfc. are given by the
  lecturer to the Society ; and they are highly deserving of being preserved at
   rurious and valuable exemplification* of this useful art.
                                                                    fessions j.

particularly to the numerous and respectable members of
the London Philosophical Society.           At the same time the
lecturer guarded his auditory against the common delusions
or" many short-hand teachers, who pretend to convey a per
fect knowledge of the art to their pupils in a few lessons, a
few hours, or days.      There is not any system hitherto in
vented by which a learner may make himself practically
acquainted with the art in so short a time; but if any
system yet published could do this, Byrom's is certainly
that system  especially when that method is practised with
the latest improvements by Mr. Molineux, of Macclesfield.
    This analysis of Mr. N.'s lecture on stenography will
convey but a very imperfect idea of his various illustrations
and reasonings concerning this pleasing and valuable art.
 It is a subject certainly but ill-calculated to call forth the
    wers of the orator, or the attractive graces of eloquence :
    t the Society will be benefited by the attempt; and as the
various documents and specimens are deposited in the
 archives of the Society, they may be referred to on any
future occasion, as requisite auxiliaries in the study of
Mr. Byrom's Universal English Stenography.

    On   the llth of August 1811, M. Arago communicated
to   the  class a memoir, the principal object of which was
to show that the luminous ravs received, in their passage
through several diaphanous bodies, new and peculiar modi
fications.
    It will be recollected that, according to the experiments
of M. Malus, the character which distinguishes the direct
ray from that which has been polarized in its reflection upon
a diaphanous body, is owing to the former dividing itself
constantly into two fasciculi in its passage through a rhom
boid of calcareous spar ; whereas the latter undergoes, in
certain circumstances, but a single refraction.                  If, before
submitting      the   polarized ray     to the  analysis   of  a   prism of
calcareous spar, we make it traverse either a plate of mica
or of sulphate of lime, or certain plates of rock crystal,
we find that the emergent ray no longer resembles either a
direct ray of light or a polarized rav.               This new ray will
be distinguished from the polarized light, by its always
giving two images ; and from the direct light, by the property
which it has of always dividing itself into two fasciculi, the
colours of which are different and complementary.
, If a direct ray falls on a glass mirror, under an angle of
35 \, and if without changing this inclination we turn the
mirror round the rav, the quantity of light which is re
flected, and that which is refracted, will be constantly the
same. It results on the contrary, from the experiments of
M. Malus, that when the mirror receives under the same

inclination rays previously polarized, we find two position«
diametrically opposite, in which not a single luminous
molecule is reflected.    Lastly, if we suppose that, the cir
cumstances being the same, the glass mirror is lighted by rays
already modified, by a convenient plate of rock crystal, for
example, we shall see it successively tinged at each demi-
revnlution with the whole series of prismatic colours, as
well by transmission as by reflection  with this particularity,
that at the same instant these two classes of colours will
be different.
   A ray of light which traverses two crystals, the princi
pal sections of which are parallel or perpendicular, furnishes
only two emergent rays. If a third crystal is interposed
between the two first, we see at least four images, except
in the case where the principal section of this new crystal
is perpendicular or parallel to the principal section of one
of the two others : hence results a very simple method of
ascertaining when a substance, whatever may be its ex
ternal form in other respects, has the double refraction :
for this purpose, we have only to make it turn between two
rhomboids properly placed, and to observe if in certain
positions we see four images : now this is what happens,
for instance, with plates of mica, as M. Arago ascertained;
so that this substance ought to be added to the list of those
in which mineralogists have recognised the property of
doubling images. M. Arago thinks however, that we can
not rely entirely on the method in question, in order to as
certain when a body has the double refraction ; for, among
other consequences, it will result from his experiments,
that flint glass ought to be admitted into the class of cry.
stallized bodies which double images, since certain plates
of this glass, interposed between the two rhomboids, act as
if they had an extraordinary plan of refraction, but of
which the direction is different in different parts of the
plate.    It is perhaps right to remark, that M. Arago has
ascertained this property in pieces of flint glass more than
half an inch thick, and through which no double image
was seen, although the prismatic form was given to them j
nay, he has sometimes, although rarely, met with fragments
of the same glass, which as well as mica, sulphate of lime,
&c. act variously upon rays of different colours ; but these
properties seem to arise from some peculiar circumstances
in the fusion of flint glass, for the fragments which possess
them are not numerous.
   When we interpose a plate of mica of a certain thick
ness, between two rhomboids the principal sections of
                                                         which

 which are parallel or perpendicular, we see, at every fourth
 part of the revolution of the mica, the secondary images to
 which this movement gives rise, acquire an intensity equal to
 those preserved by the first images : if the plate interposed
 becomes thinner, the number of rays which it depolarizes
 also becomes smaller; so that, when a certain term is passed,
it acts like a common glass mirror: the singular conse
 quence to which this experiment seems to lead, is, that
 while the very thin plates of mica have not the double re
fraction, the plate which results from their superposition
 enjoys this property in a very marked manner.
    Taking advantage of the properties which he had dis
 covered in reflected light, M. Malus contrived a very sim
 ple apparatus, which is now used in the workshops where
 prismatic micrometers are constructed, and by the help of
which we may determine the axis of refraction and of cry
 stallization of bodies, and, whatever they may be in other re
 spects, the alterations which they have undergone in their
external forms. In communicating the description of his in
strument to the Class on the 19th of last August, M. Malus
announced that he had applied it to the examination of
diaphanous mineral substances, and of various chemical
products susceptible of crystallization, and had ascertained
that all these substances are endowed with double refrac
tion, except those which crystallize in the form of a cube,
or regular octahedron, by placing in similar circumstances
the fibrous and transparent parts of leaves and flowers, silk,
wool, or white hairs, fish scales, horn, ivory, quills, whale
bone, &c. M. Malus further ascertained that all these
substances modify the lights in the same way as crystallized
bodies, so that all of them have an axis of refraction, ot of
crystallization,   as if they were formed of molecules of a
determinate form arranged symmetrically with respect to
each other.
    In detailing these experiments, which are as new as they
are interesting, we have endeavoured to give them with
the greatest fidelity, and in the precise terms used by the
authors.     We shall add to them no observations of our
own : they are undoubtedly worthy, however, of the notice
of experimental philosophers, who by repeating them will
probably discover new phaenomena, or new applications of
those already known, and thus throw light on some intri
cate questions with which astronomers are perplexed.

     FALL OF AEROLITES NEAR TOULOUSE, IN FRANCE.
    The following relation was lately laid before the Imperial
Institute by Senator Chaptal :  " On the 1 Ot h April, 1818,
 at six minutes past eight in the evening, the night being
very dark, the atmosphere was on a sudden illuminated by
 a whi'ish light, sufficient tn see to read by, which lasted
 about 15 seconds, and disappeared gradually. Two minutes
 and a balf afterwards a considerable detonation was heard,
 resembling the explosion of a mine, and followed by a com
 motion so strong that several persons thought it was an
 earthquake.      At Gailloe and at Alby it was supposed that
 the powder magazine at Toulouse had blown up. Some
 minutes after this explosion, the sky cleared up, and the
 star* appeared.     Two days afterwards it w as known at Tou
 louse that meteoric stones had fallen six leagues from that
 city, in the commune of Burgau, in the department of the
 Upper Garonne, and in that of Savenens. department of
 Tarn and Garonne. According to the account of M.Filhol,
 a distinguished physician at Grenade, near Burgau. and that
 of the curate of Savenens, it appears that a great brightness
 was seen, like that of a rocket, and a number of explo
 sions heard like & rolling fire of musquetry, which lasted

several minutes, gradually died away, and was followed b,
a confused noise from the north-west.     Soon after was
heard a whistling of bodies passing through the air, like
stones thrown from a sling; the detonation and rolling
noise was from the south-west to the north-east. Several of
these aerolites fell at Pechmeja, at a farm on the side of a
wood ; one of them upon the house, breaking through the
tiles, and bending the laths that supported them. Another
fell on the threshing floor, and was picked up by the farmer.
Another fell by the side of Gourdas, and several on the side
of Seucourien, and one at La Praderes, near Savenens. The
utmost distance between the places where they were ob
served to fall was 4000 toises (about four and a half Eng
lish miles).  The different specimens brought to Toulouse
weighed from six to eight ounces.        They are not whole,
and have all of them a part of their surface of a blackish
colour, and, as it were, carbonaceous.    In the interior they
are gray, and resemble the stones that fell at Aigle, but ap
pear to contain a much greater quantity of metallic sub
stance. Their specific gravity is 3813.      The number of
these stones seems to have been very considerable ; but the
darkness of the night, and the alarm of the spectators, pro
bably prevented many of them from being found."
    M.  Caron, an eminent French surgeon, and author of
several  valuable treatises on Croup, has offered a prize of
1000 franks for the best answer to the following question :
*' Is it probable that tracheotomy can cure the croup ?" or,
"  What are the symptoms which require this operation in

Rue Hyacinthe, a Paris, where communications may be ad

   Two chemists of Paris have recently made two curious
specimens of prepared writing paper, of which the following
are the processes :
   1. Take gall nuts and sulphate of iron (copperas) well
pulverized ; rub them dry on paper which is not smooth or
hotpressed. The paper will assume a grayish tinge, owing
to the powder which is attached to     it,and which will adhere
sufficiently to bear folding, &c. In order to trace characters
on this paper,   it   isonly necessary to use  a   pen dipped  in
water, or in the mouth, or even       a  pointed slick, and the
characters will become black and legible.
   The second process       described as differing from the first,
                           is
                                                               in

ink is made, and then dried.        It is of a yellowish colour
and the characters are written on it in the same way. Paper
books, or albums, of this description, are now manufac
tured in great abundance at Paris, and ibey are in consider

    A Mr. Robertson, whose name has been already before
the public as an aerial traveller in Denmark, has invented
a speaking automaton, which he is now exhibiting in Paris.
It already articulates distinctly, in French, the words  Papa,'
 ' Mamma,' and * Long live the emperor Napoleon ! ' and its
powers of language are described as daily increasing.        Our
 readers will probably recollect the flute-player invented by
Vaucanson, and the chess-player of Kemper ; but we believe
 the above is the first instance upon record of a speaking
 figure, if we except the famous head invented by Albertus
Magnus, according to the French tradition (but Roger Bacon,
 according to the English), and which is said to have beea
 broken to pieces by St. Thomas Aquinas.
    The members of the Institution lately formed in the
 Ionian Islands, for the promotion and encouragement of
 literature, under the title of The Ionian Academy, desirous
 of information as to the state of civilization in Greece
 since the downfall of the empire of the East to the present
 time, have proposed the following questions to the learned
 throughout Europe.       [The memoirs are to be addressed to
 the Secretary of the Ionian Academy under cover to the
 English or French Charge" d' Affaires at Constantinople.]
     1. What schools, libraries, and other institutions for the
 encouragement of learning were founded in the different
 provinces of Greece, between the period of the downfall of
 the Empireof the East (1453) and the present time ?
     2. What were the establishments for public education
 founded by the Greeks out of Greece, for the education of
 their countrymen ?
     3. Were the printing-houses      at Moscopolis, Jassi, and
 Bucharest, the only establishments of the kind in Greece ?
 Is it true that there was a printing establishment in the
 Fanal of Constantinople ? How long did that continue in
 existence, which was begun in the Patriarchat at Constan
 tinople during the war between France and Turkey ?
     4. A biographical notice of the life and works of the
 learned Greeks who have flourished since the fall of the
 Empire of the East to the present time.

 310               Mr. Sadler's Aerial Voyage*
                mr. sadler's    aerial voyage.
    Mr. Sadler ascended from Belvidere-house, near Dublin,
 October \, at 1 P. M. with the wind at south-west, and in
 35 minutes had sight of the mountains in Wales : he con
 tinued in the same direction till three o'clock, when being;
nearly over the Isle of Man, the wind blowing fresh, he
found himself fast approaching the Welch coast, and at
four o'clock he had a distinct view of the Skerry Light
house, and the prospect of consummating his ardent hopes
of a speedy arrival in Liverpool. The wind now shifting,
he was again taken off, and lost sight of land ; when, after
hovering about for a long time, he discovered five vessels
beating down Channel; and in hopes of their assistance,
he determined on descending with all possible expedition,
and precipitated himself into the sea.    In this most critical-
situation, he had the mortification to find the vessels took
no notide of him: obliged, therefore, to re-ascend, he now
threw nut a quantity of ballast, and quickly regained his
situation in the air, to look out for more friendly aid.      It
was a length of time before he had the satisfaction of dis
covering any, and then observed a vessel, which gave him
to understand, by signal, that she intended to assist him,
but could not reach him. Two others also now appeared in
sight, and one of them tacking about, hoisted the Manx
colours.    Night now coming on, he was determined to
avail himself of their friendly aid, and once more descended
into the sea ; but here the wind acting upon the balloon as it
lay upon the water, drew the car with so much velocity that
the vessel could not overtake it ; and notwithstanding he
used his utmost efforts, and latterly tied his clothes to the
grappling iron, and sunk them to keep him steady, still the
balloon was carried away so fast, that he was under the
necessity of expelling the gas : upon that escaping, the car
actually sunk, and he had now nothing but the netting to
cfing to. His perilous situation, and the fear of getting
entangled, deterred the men from coming near himj until,
being in danger of drowning, Mr. Sadler begged they would
run their bowsprit through the balloon, and expel the re
maining gas.       Having done this, they threw out a line,
which he wound round his arm, and was then dragged a
considerable way before they could get him on board, quite
exhausted.
    The ship was a herring fisher, from Douglas, in the Isle
of Man, called the Victory, commanded by John Lee.
    In this situation he was conveyed to Liverpool, where
                                                       finding

finding the crowd of spectators immense, his clothes being
also wet, and in great disorder, he paid a visit on board the
Princessa frigate, where he was most politely received, and
obligingly accommodated with clothes, by Lieut. Roche.
   Saturday, October 3, Mr. Sadler arrived at Holyhead, at
three o'clock in the afternoon, on his way to Dublin ; and
requested Mr. Fellowes (the Agent of His Majesty's packets)
would transmit this hasty sketch of his proceedings to his
friends in London :
                                               " Holyhead, Oct. 4.
   *'Sir,  Mr.   Sadler arrived here yesterday evening, and
shortly after embarked on board the packet for Dublin.
I  am happy to say, that notwithstanding        the great fatigue
and anxiety he has undergone, he was in good health and
spirits, and intends once more making an attempt to cross
from Dublin, when the moon is sufficiently old to enable
him to see his way. The approach of night, and fearing
he might be involved in darkness on his nearing the coast,
induced him to descend at sea. The extraordinary circum
stance of not receiving assistance from the first vessels he
discovered, when he first descended, is only to be accounted
for by the terror his appearance must have occasioned to
people not used, or, perhaps, not expecting such a sight :
one can hardly conceive it could have been from any other
cause, or the want of humanity in their crews.
    " Mr. Sadler will furnish you with a more detailed ac
count when he has more time, and it will, no doubt, be a
very interesting one.

LIV.    Reply to a Letter    of Dr. Marcet to Dr. Bostock,
   on the Subject    of the Alkali in the Animal Fluids.           By
   George Pearson, M.D. F.R.S., &c.
                          To Mr. Tilbch.
                                       George-Street, Hanover-Square,
       I                                       October 27, 1812.
          n your Journal for the preceding month I read the
letter of Dr. Marcet addressed to his friend Dr. Bostock, in
which he offers the evidence of some experiments to prove
that ihe potash which exists in the animal fluids is in the state
of inuriat (muriate), and that the whole of the uncombined
alkali is soda.     It appears that Dr. Bostock was of opinion
that the supposed uncombined alkali was potash, as I pro
visionally concluded, and not soda ; but on the representa
tion of evidence just mentioned, he has changed his opi
nion ; and therefore has become the vehicle of Dr. Marcet'*
letter to the public, confiding, he says, that you Mr. Editor
will assent that the experiments stated         "  must entirely set
the question at rest." One authority declaring the question
to be entirely set at rest, and the other (the author) affirming
that every shadow of doubt is now removed, although I
was not ready to believe, as I have had occasion to assert,
 that more than provisional conclusions are likely to be ob
 tained, I at least expected to find some new contravening
 testimony.      This I was prepared to acknowledge ; for, rea
 soning merely from the known facts, I should have felt no
 humiliation if new evidence indicated adverse conclusions :
 Nos nonjudicis sed indicis personam sustinemus. ( F. Bacon.)
    But on examining the evidence which it is asserted has
 produced conviction, " removed every shadow of doubt,"
 and "set the question at rest," I was unable to perceive
 any new facts to alter my former conclusions.             Hence, I
 might have replied merely by a counter declaration, and
 reference to my unanswered experiments and inferences.
 As however this mode of procedure may be deemed neither
 decorous to my opponent and the testimony produced of
 respectable personal authority, nor satisfactory to the public,
 I respectfully offer the following brief exposition and re
 marks.      The process which Dr. Marcet says authorises his
 confidence was this :
    The saline matters of the serum of blood were procured
  by evaporation to dryness, incineration, dissolution in wa
 ter, filtration, evaporation again to dryness, dissolution in
 acetic acid, dissolution again of the desiccated acetic coni-

pound in alcohol ; evaporation of this to dryness, and fu
sion.     The fused mass amounting to about four grains was
divided into four parts  a, I, c, a.
    1. a. 1. " Contained abundance of muriatic acid."
        S. Dissolved  in water and suffered        to evaporate-
spontaneously, it afforded an efflorescent mass of feathery
with cubical crystals.
   * 3. Tartaric acid and
                              oxymuriate of platina manifested
the presence of potash.
    Now, I cau only infer from these experiments that a
muriate was present, probably either of soda or of potash,
or of both.     That potash was present combined, but with
 what substance is quite equivocal; being only a small frac
tional part of a grain, it might be united to a double suit ;
 although weakly, yet to be no longer deliquescent.             It
 may also be united to muriatic or other acids, especially
 the sulphuric and carbonic ; but here is no evidence of soda
in a free state, and even only equivocal evidence of it as
united to muriatic acid.       If free soda were present, why
 was not soda- tartrate of potash observed ?
    2. The portion b with sulphuric acid gave sulphate of
¦oda and sulphate of potash.        Here the testimony is equi-
Tocal, for the sulphate of soda may, and indeed most pro
bably was from the decomposition of muriate of soda by
the sulphuric acid, and the sulphate of potash may arise
from the decomposition of potash united to some acid,
such as carbonic muriatic, &c. united though weakly to
 the other salts.    Hence I perceive no evidence of soda in
a free state.,
    3. The portion c with nitric acid afforded rhomboidal
crystals and no prismatical crystals.      1 will not repeat my
objections to any conclusions from the form of crystals,
especially in such minute portions of matter as a small part
of a grain, set forth so fully in a former paper ; but it may
be right just to remark that this experiment is inconclusive
and unsatisfactory : I. because, if all the crystals were ni
trate of soda, then all the saline mass must be soda ; or, 2. if
only a part was soda, and the rest was muriate, then thi*
must have been decomhounded by the nitric acid : but,
i.   if this could happen, then the whole of the rhombs
might be from the decompounded muriate of soda : 4. if
the whole of the crystals were rhombs of nitrate of soda,
what became of the cubical crystals of muriate of potash ?
    4. The portion d with oxymuriate of platina gave a
precipitate of potash-oxymuriate of platina, and by evapo
ration, soda muriate of platina.        Here the questions na

Hirally occur ; 1. What are the proofs of soda-muriate of
platina ? 2. What arc the proofs that soda-muriate of
platina was from free soda, and not from muriate of soda?
    To omit nothing supposed to be favourable to the adverse
party, it must be noticed that
                                     " the carbonaceous alkaline
mass" above spoken of after fusion, did not deliquesce on
exposure to even damp air.           I never met with such a re
sult, at least with expectorated matters and dropsical fluids ;
and if no deliquescence took place with the salts of serum,
it is not unreasonable to account for it from the very small
proporti6n, probably not one fourth of a grain, or at most
half a grain of alkali in the whole mass ; and this by
fusion might be united to form a compound unknown.
    To the inferences of my adversary I also object ; that it
is assumed without testimony, that alcohol dissolved a large
proportion of muriate of potash.            It is I believe admitted
 (but  it may   be  an  error)   that  this   menstruum dissolves
none at all t but if this be an error, I demand the proof.
    2. It was not admitted as I reasoned that acetate of soda
is non-deliquescent, and therefore the proof 1 offered of the
alkali being potash from the deliquescent property of the
acetate was eagerly seized to expose my ignorance, bv-ex-
ultingly exclaiming that I had committed a palpable error.
4 acknowledged that       I had taken for granted, with most
chemists, what 1 subsequently admitted was not a fact: but
I am now in a doubtful state of mind with respect to this
property : for Professor Berzelius confidently assures me
that he found by repeated experiments acetate of soda to be
uniformly non-deliquescent ; and on observing that in my
experiment I had found it otherwise, we agreed that pro
bably the different results were owing to the soda 1 used
containing a proportion, however minute, of potash, and
which I could not perceive by tartaric acid; whereas that
he used was exempt.         If this be true, it will be a stronger
proof that the alkali is potash, than the united testimonies
 to prove that it  is soda.
    3. Dr. Marcet argues, that from principle it maybe in
 ferred that soda and not potash is the impregnating alkali,
because the latter attracts muriatic acid more strongly than
the former.     This is true in the circumstance of simple
elective attraction: but any reasoning from this law when
more than one menstruum is present and two or more bases,
is fallacious; especially when the different substances pre
 sent are not certainly known : and here I must observe that
1 have never contemplated potash as existing in an uncom-
hiued slate in the, animal fluids, but in reality in combina-

tion with   a destructible aoid, or with animal oxide      This
 acid from some trials, I was inclined to propose is the
 malic acid, but 1 subsequently did not venture to offer it i
 however, I find from the conversation of Professor Ber2e-
 lius, now in London, that he coincided with me in an
 analogous, if not a similar result.
                                            " You very nearly,"
 said he, " made a capital discovery, for I have ascertained
 it is the lactic acid in union with the alkali of the animal
 fluids." I hope the British public will soon be edified by
 the translation from the Swedish language of the works of
 this most acute chemist, and as I hear by a most able
 editor.    Hence much light will be afforded, especially in
 animal chemistry.      This fact is however only within the
 record before us, to refute any a priori conclusion from a
 case of simple elective attraction.      I had long considered
 the case of this kind noticed by my opponents, for it was
 too glaring to be unnoticed.        If reasoning from principle
 could be depended upon I would argue ; that as all animals
 either immediately or mediately live upon vegetable matter ;
 and as vegetables very generally contain potash combined
 with acids, or some other things destructible by fire, it is
 reasonable to conclude that the fluids of animals must be
impregnated with potash in such a state of combination.
     1 know it has been inferred by some able chemists that
 the potash must be united to muriatic or sulphuric acid,
 and soda must be united to some weaker acid, such as car-
 honic, lactic, acetous, malic, &c. agreeably to the assumed
 law that the stronger menstruum unites with the stronger
 basis, and the weaker menstruum with the weaker basts :
 but there are so many exceptions to this rule that I appre
 hend it cannot rightly be termed a law.
     Lastly, in his P.S. Dr. Marcet says he has instituted
 the processes above examined, on a large quantity, some
 gallons of bullocks blood, with the same results as on small
 quantities of animal matter.         1 believe such evidence is
 inadmissible ; for, if mere general statements of results be
 received as testimony, much error will be liable to be in
  troduced, as the public in these cases cannot be in pos
  session of the means of repeating the experiments and
 judging of their accuracy.        It is to be regretted that the
  author did not render his experiments instructive by a due
  detail : however, if they were a mere repetition of his for
  mer ones, the questionable fact would still remain undeter
  mined.
     The chemical world may now perhaps be furnished with
  the means of judging whether or not Dr. Marcet has " re
                                                           moved

                 On the  Alkali   in the Animal Fluids.                325
moved every shadow ,of doubt," by legitimate inductive
reasoning.        My opponent, not con t em with proofs by ex
periment, ha9 endeavoured to command assent by a most
respectable      authority of opinion.          But Truth is not the
daughter of mere human authority, but of Time producing
evidence of sense and of reason.
    I beg permission lo make a very few remarks, which
although justifiable, yet, being personal, will afford but
lenten entertainment, and still less instruction to the
public.
    In making the above authority the vehicle of his letter,
my opponent thinks proper to express disapprobation of
my mode of controversy, and to more than insinuate I
should not have been honoured with further notice, but
for the " interference " of his friend.            Accordingly, but for
this fortunate circumstance the public would not have been
instructed by his letter now under examination.                  This con
duct I own, 1 think, is rather selfish ; for a public-spirited
man will always make sacrifices for the benefit of the re
 public.     It is however good, that the interference overcame
 the resolution after four months ob-tinate resistance. The
 head and front of my offending was, it seems, to the extent
 of an attempt to be jocular, in which I never meant to in
 flict any wound of the feelings.            It grieves me to find that
 some of my expressions were misconstrued insidious-
 ness :  non vulnera Jidelia amantis, sed oscnla                 blandosa
 malig?iantis.       In the endeavour to expose the inefficiency
 of the proposed method of investigation, and to honour il
 lustrious chemists, whose successful methods were un
 worthily disvalued, I preferred the manner of controversy
 complained of to the alternative  a serious remonstrance.
 For, as my affectionate friend, the prince of philologists,
 now no more ! was wont to sav, " Cantantes minus via
 lirdit."
     In conclusion, I would fain hope that, if this warfare
 must he continued, special care will be employed that no
 thing be said, or arise, whicb can reasonably excite painful
 sensations, in either party.           And if it be agreed that our
 axioms and conclusions are but inductive reasonings, ac
 cording to known facts, which therefore are liable to be
 subverted* by the facts being multiplied ; whatever be the,

   Here the first term is the attraction of the whole hemi
sphere ; and consequently the other term expresses the
action of that part of the hemisphere which remains after
taking away the portion cut out by the cylinder ; so that

such a portion as is intercepted by ihe cylinder in Viviani's

Van Helmont was of the same age as those men, and as he
has not quoted them, but calls the instrument his own,

find them wholly unlike.         Sanctorio's (fig. I. PI. VIII.)

 the College of Edinburgh, and which are perfectly alike.

      Mr. Leslie has not noticed a sentence immediately fol
 lowing that to which he has referred, in which the prin
 ciple of the differential thermometer is described.         I shall
 supply his deficiency:
                              " Applicatur vasi A aliquis calor, ex-
 cedens temperiem ambientis : tunc enim aer inclusus, se
 dilatabit, secundum          plus aut minus caloris, ac juxta,
 attjue excedit veram aeris teni|ieriem clausi in vase D, con
 tra quern propellens aquam BC destruet sequilibrium per
 nimiam actionem.          Ita quod in D erit compressus et con
 densates aer, per restrictionem : ut cedat dilatationi facta)
 in A."
     It appears from these facts that Sir H. Davy is fully
justified in saying that a curious instrument like the dif
 ferential thermometer          is described by Van Helmont,
 "   which appears to have been the first in which the expan
 sive power of .heated air was exhibited by its action upon
 coid air."
     I shall not pretend to determine whether Mr. Leslie has
 not read this last passage, or whether he has read it and
 has not thought proper to quote it: nor shall I offer any
 observations on insinuations so unwarrantably and unjustly
brought forward by the Professor: as the ground for them
 has been removed, they will fall of course.

LVIt.     Tabular     Corrections   for the Rise and Fall of the
    Mercury in the       common    Barometer.   By E. Walker,
     Esq.
                            To  Mr. Tilloch.
Sir,    No     meteorological instrument is in higher estima
tion than the Barometer.          But barometers of the common
construction, with an upright tube and open cistern, are
not sufficiently correct for investigating the laws of meteo
rology with the greatest precision, in consequence of the
quicksilver's rising or falling in the cistern with every va
riation in the pressure of the atmosphere.            In the best
barometers, however, this imperfection is corrected by
                                                              some

                       On the common Barometer.                                      331
some mechanical contrivance ; but none of ihese can be
added to an instrument, without adding to its price.
   But this imperfection may be removed, without any ad
ditional apparatus or expense ; for we need only find how
high the surface of the mercury in the cistern would be
raised by any given fall in the tube, to find the correction
for every other point in the scale.
   Suppose it were required to find the correction for one
inch rise of the quicksilver above the zero, or that point
in the scale where no correctiop is necessary : Let a =?
the diameter of the cistern, and £ = the inside diameter
of the tube j then, as equal cylinders have their altitudes
reciprocally    as     their bases,       we     have      aa   : bb : :   1   :
which is the correction tp be added, to the altitude of the
column of quicksilver, when it rises one inch above the
zero, and subtracted from the altitude of the column, when
its surface falls one inch below that point.
   Example. Suppose the inside diameter of the tube be
~ of     an    inch, and      the diameter            of   the cistern          be   two
inches =        -^j-
                   :   Then                "01          the correction for one
inch rise or fall of the mercury in the tube.
   Suppose the barometer needs no correction, when the
surface of the quicksilver stands at          on the scale, then
the corrections for the whole scale, according to the pre
ceding example, would be as         Table 1.
                                          in
   But Mr. De Luc observes, that the cistern barometer
does not give the true pressure of the atmosphere; the
quicksilver in being little depressed on the same principle
                  it        a
as in capillary tubes.          therefore
                                It   is     thought necessary                          j
where so much nicety        required, to determine
                                is                        experi           by
ment how much the quicksilver           depressedis   tubes of      in                 a
given bore, and to allow accordingly.          By some experi
ments which have been made on this subject          Lord Charles  by
Cavendish, the depression appears to be -067 of an inch
for  atube whose inside diameter       0*3.*     is
   Now,   if  *067  be  added  to  each   of the corrections                           in
Table 1.  we  shall have  the corrections   in Table g.

   But if the inside diameter of the tube be larger at one
end than at the other, the corrections cannot be found by
the preceding r,ule ; but by the following method they may
be obtained, with the same precision as before.
    Fill about five or six inches of the sealed end of the
tube with quicksilver; and after having determined the
altitude of the surface of the mercury in the cistern, pour
that which is in the tube into                         it,
                                        and measure how high
the surface of the fluid has been raised.        Then divide this
rise in the cistern                by
                            the number of inches of mercury
poured into       from the tube, and the quotient will be the
                it,
correction for one inch rise of the mercury above the zero.
   Suppose the number of inches of qnicksilver           the tube                    in
were five, and this quantity raised the surface of the fluid
in the cistern 5-100dths of an inch, then the correction
would be l-ioodth of an inch, for every inch rise of the
mercury above the zero from whence all the other cor
                                        ;
rections may be found.
  If   the numbers found                    by
                                 these rules were
                                                  engraved upon

                                                 is
controversy respecting the priority of Dr. Marcet or Mr.

and be says it was near the Roman pitch. Dr. Young states
the number at the eighth power of 2, or 256. In page 436
of the xxwith vol. of the Philosophical Magazine, 240 is
given as the number, as it is also in the number for July
last, on the authority of Dr. Crotch.        I have examined two
modem forks for this note, and have found one to make
254$ and the other 252J vibrations in a second : so that
it appears there is no precise number of vibrations which
has yet been fixed upon as a standard of musical pitch.          It
must be confessed that the number is purely arbitrary \ but
if that number shall be preferred which is more convenient
than another in this kind of calculations, and at the same
time approaches nearly to that which corresponds with the
present concert pitch, 252 is probably the best, being di
visible by all the digits except 5 and 8.
    But whatever number may be fixed upon as a standard
by those interested in any way in its determination, I am
persuaded    that the following mode of ascertaining the
sound producible by any given number of vibrations will
be found very practicable and convenient.

LX. Additional   Experiments on the Muriatic and Oxy-

  V. P.    the Lit. una Phil. Society, and Physician to the

  Lifirmary, at Manchester*,
The      experiments which form the subject of the following
pages, are intended as supplementary to      more extensive                            a
series, which the Royal Society did me the honour to in
sert in their Transactions for the year 1800     Of the ge                                 f.
neral accuracy of those experiments     have since had no                    I
reason to doubt   and their results, indeed, are coincident
                        ;
with those of subsequent writers of the highest authority
in chemistry.   My attention has been again drawn to the

 338                 Additional Experiments
 subject by the important controversy which has lately been
 carried on between Mr. Murray and Mr. John Davy, re
 specting the nature of muriatic and oxymuriatic acids * ;
 and I nave been induced, by some hints which the discus
 sion has suggested, not only to repeat the principal experi
 ments described in my memoir, but to institute others with
 the advantage of a more perfect apparatus than I then pos
 sessed, and of greater experience in the management of
xthese delicate processes.
    This repetition of my former labours has discovered to me
 an instance in which I have failed in drawing the proper
 conclusion from facts. In two comparative experiments
 on the electrization of equal quantities of muriatic acid
 gas, the one of which was dried by muriate of lime, and
the other was in its natural state, I found a difference of
not more than one per cent, in the hydrogen evolved, re
latively to the original bulk of the gasf. Yet, notwithstand
ing these results, I have expressed myself inclined to be
lieve that some water is abstracted by that deliquescent salt ;
and this belief was confirmed several years afterwards, by
the event of an experiment in which muriatic acid gas,
dried by muriate of lime, gave only                 its bulk of hydro
gen   J, a  proportion   much   below    the  usual average. The ques
tion, however, was too interesting to be left in any degree
of uncertainty ; and I have, therefore, made several fresh
experiments with the view to its decision.              In the course of
these I have found, that though differences in the results are
produced by causes apparently trivial, some of which I shall
afterwards point out, yet that under equal circumstances,
precisely the same relative proportion of hydrogen gas is
obtained from muriatic acid gas, whether exposed or not to
muriate of lime ; and that its greatest amount does not
exceed tV or tV 'he original volume of the acid gas.
    In the paper last quoted §, I have also described an ex
periment, in which sensible heat was evolved by bringing
muriate of lime into contact with muriatic acid gas ; a fact
which, if established, would go far to prove the existence
of water in that gas. But on repeating the experiment
with muriate of lime recently cooled from fusion, and over
mercury carefully deprived of all moisture by boiling, 1 was
not able to discover any increase of temperature, though a
 very sensible air thermometer was inclosed in the vessel
containing the gas.           The evolution of heat takes place,

only when     the muriate of lime has attracted moisture, either
 from the atmosphere or the mercury, and is then owing to
a condensation of a part of the gas.
    Essentially, the changes produced by electrifying muriatic
 acid over mercury are those which I have stated ; viz. a con
 traction of the volume of the gas, the formation of muriate
 of mercury (calomel), and the evolution of hydrogen.         Re
 cent experiments, also, have confirmed the accuracy of the
 observation*, that when a certain effect has been produced
 by electricity, nothing is gained by continuing the process;
 for neither is more hydrogen evolved, nor can the con
 traction of bulk be carried any further.
    I have lately applied, to experiments on muriatic acid, an
 apparatus which I used advantageously for the analysis of
 ammoniaf- It consists of a spherical glass vessel, into
 which are hermetically sealed two small tubes containing
 platina wires, the points of which approach within the
 striking distance.    To the globular part is attached a neck,
which may be closed, as occasion requires, either by a glass
 stopper or by a metal cap and stop-cock.         Into a vessel of
 this kind I introduced 4 \ cubic inches of muriatic acid
 gas, and passed through it 3000 discharges from a Leyden
jar ; at the close of the process, no traces of moisture could
he perceived on the inner surface of the vessel, nor could                 I
 discover, on opening the stopper, that any change of bulk
 had taken place.     After absorbing the unchanged muriatic
 acid gas by a small quantity of water, a volume of gas re
 mained, in which there were present 100 measures (each
 equal to one grain of mercury) of oxymuriatic acid gas,
 and 140 measures of hydrogen*         Two causes might, per
 haps, contribute to diminish, in some degree, the propor
 tion of the former.      It was difficult to exclude from the
 apparatus, on admitting the muriatic acid gas into           twoit,
 or three very minute globules of mercury, which became

                     Additional Experiments
per, however, no change of volume was apparent. The hy
drogen evolved, instead of being more than in the former ex
periment, equalled in bulk only 20 grains of mercury. The
production of oxymuriatic acid was sufficiently evinced by
its effect in tarnishing some very small globules of quick
silver, which adhered to the inside of the vessel ; but the
minuteness of the quantity frustrated an attempt to mea
sure it.    From subsequent experiments on similar quan
tities of gas, confined in the same apparatus, it appeared
that the electrization in this last instance had been con-<
jtinued much longer than was necessary ; and that an equal
effect was produced by ^ the number of electrical dis
charges.
    In this way of making the experiment, the greatest pro
portion of hydrogen gas obtainable from muriatic acid
amounted only to about y^th, while, by electrization over
quicksilver, -fa or -fa was generally evolved. It was evident,
then, that the mercury had considerable influence over the
results ; and I found, by experiments with tubes of dif
ferent diameters, that the larger the surface of the mercury
exposed to the gas, the more rapid and complete was the
change.      Its action was greatly accelerated, also, by caus
ing the electric discharge to strike from the conducting
wire, sealed into the tube, to the mercury, which was pro
bably thus raised into vapour ; for, in some instances, the
whole of the inner surface of the glass was coated with
sublimed calomel.
    The only way in which the mercury appeared to me
likely to be efficient in this case, was by removing the oxy
muriatic acid as fast as it was formed ; for I have never
found any mixture of this gas in the results of experiments
on muriatic acid, when carried on over quicksilver.        Upon
any theory of the constitution of muriatic acid, it may be
expected that when, in a mixture of that acid gas with hy
drogen and oxymuriatic acid gases, the two latter come
to bear a certain proportion to the former, they will be
brought within the sphere of mutual agency, and will re
produce muriatic acid. This point appears, from my ex
periments, to be attained, when the hydrogen and oxy
muriatic acid, taken together, have the proportion to the
muriatic acid of about 1 to 35. The amount of the change,
therefore, which is capable of being effected on muriatic
acid gas, electrified without the contact of mercury, is li
mited by the reaction of the evolved hydrogen and oxy
muriatic acid gases on each other, whenever they compose
a certain proportion of the mixture.        This proportion be

             on the    Muriatic and Oxymuriatic            Acids.         341
ing attained, we only, by continuing the electrization,
work in a circle.
     It may now be inquired, what is the limitation to the
action of electricity on muriatic acid gas which is con
fined over mercury ? In this case, it was suggested to me
by Mr. Dalton, who favoured me with his presence at most
of the experiments, that the evolved hydrogen might pos
 sibly in some way prevent the effect from being carried
beyond a certain amount.                 Availing myself of this hint,
 I mixed 30 measures of hydrogen gas with 400 of muriatic
 acid gas in its ordinary state, and passed 900 discharges
 through the mixture.             It soon became evident that the ad
 dition of the hydrogen had produced an important dif
 ference in the results of the experiment; for the surface of
 the mercury, over which the gas rested, was untarnished
 after some hundred explosions, and was scarcely changed
 at the close of the process.              When the residuary gas, the
 volume of which remained unaltered, was analysed, it was
 found to contain the same quantity of muriatic gas as at
 the outset, and neither more nor less hydrogen.                        To ex
 plain the event of this modification of the experiment, on
 the old theory, we may suppose that by the action of
 electricity a particle of water is decomposed, and that
  the atom of oxygen, forcibly repelled from that of hy
  drogen with which it was associated, finds another atom
  of hydrogen uninfluenced by the electric fluid, and within,
  the sphere of its attraction. With this it unites, and recom
  piles water. On the theory of Sir H. Davy, the same series
  of decompositions and recombinations may be assumed to
  take place between the oxymuriatic acid and hydrogen*.
      It still, however, remains to be determined, what is the
  source of the hydrogen gas, which, in a limited proportion,
  is always evolved by the electrization of muriatic acid ?
  Does it result from the decomposition of water, existing as
  an element of the gas ; or from the disunion of the oxy
  muriatic acid and hydrogen, which, according to Sir H.
  Davy's view, compose muriatic acid ? The limitation to

                                    apparent inconsistency in supposing changes
  of precisely an opposite kind to be dieted by the same means. But in
  stances are not wanting, in which the very same elements are brought into
  combination    by electric discharges, and are again disunited by the lame
   agency.   As examples, it may be sufficient at present to state, that nitrous
   ¦cid and nitrous gas are generated by the action of the electric spark on
   mixtures of oxygen and nitrogen gases; and that, by the same power, they
   are again resolved into their elements.     If this were the proper place, it
  might, I think, be rendered probable by several arguments, that electricity,
   when thus applied, acts rather by mechanical collision, than by inducing a
  hanee in the electrical slates of the elements of bodies,

its amount, which, it formerly appeared to me*, could
only be accounted for by the complete destruction of the
water contained in the gas, may now be equally well ex
plained on the principle which I have just pointed out.
The fact, also, 'that no appreciable change of bulk is pro
duced by the electrization of the muriatic acid, when the
presence of mercury is excluded, is perhaps favourable to
the new theory.       For, since equal measures of hydrogen and
oxymuriatic acids afford muriatic acid without any conden
sation of volume, no alteration of bulk should result from
the disunion of those elements ; and the products should
be equal measures of the same gases.                   The proportions
which I obtained (100 to 140) did not, it must be acknow
ledged, exactly correspond with the theory; but the dif
ference was not greater than might naturally be expected
from the circumstances of the experiment.                    That equal
measures      of hydrogen and oxymuriatic acid are really
evolved, appears to me to be proved by the agreement,
which I have iu several experiments remarked, between the
hydrogen gas obtained, and the contraction of volume in
muriatic acid electrified over mercury.                Now the latter
effect of the process can be explained on no other principle
than the absorption of oxymuriatic acid by the quicksilver.
    When muriatic acid and oxygen gases are electrified to
gether over mercury, a gradual diminution ensues in their
hulkfj and the mercury becomes tarnished, precisely as by
the contact of oxymuriatic acid.               I have lately examined
the agency' of thi3 process on a considerable quantity of
the two gases confined in a vessel, into which they were
admitted after exhausting it by the air-pump.                  The phae-
nomena, which iu this way of making the experiment are
extremely decisive and interesting, are the production of
water and of oxymuriatic acid. The former, combining
with a portion of the undecomposed muriatic acid, is de
posited in drops upon the inner surface of the vessel,, in ihc
state of liquid muriatic acid.         When the stop-cock, which
confines the gases, is -opened under mercury, a quantity of
that metal rushes iu, and has its surface instantly tarnished.
Besides this test of the production of oxymuriatic acid, its
presence is rendered unequivocal (after absorbing the un
decomposed muriatic acid by a few drops of water), both
by its smell, and by its effect in discharging the colour of

    These results, it will be found, may be reconciled with
either theory.       According to the one which has been com
monly received, the oxygen unites with the real acid of
muriatic gas, which becoming oxymuriatic acid, deposits
water.      On Sir H. Davy's view, the oxygen unites with
the hydrogen of the muriatic acid, and composes water,
while the oxymuriatic acid is merely an educt.                       I am not
aware of any refinement of the process, by which the value
of these two explanations can be compared. Something,
however, would be gained by a precise determination of the
proportions in which the two gases saturate each other.
For since, on Sir H. Davy's theory, muriatic acid contains
half its volume of hydrogen gas, two measures of which
are known to be saturated by one of oxygen, it follow*
that muriatic acid gas should be changed into oxymuriatic
by one-fourth of its bulk of oxygen.                   According to Gay
jJussac and Thenard *, three measures of muriatic acid
should condense one of oxygen (or only one-third their
bulk), and should form two measures of oxymuriatic acid.
Hitherto, I have not been able to satisfy myself respecting
the true proportions of oxygen and muriatic acid gases, that
are capable of being united by electricity ; for, though                        I
have made several experiments with this view, they have
not agreed in yielding similar results. The condensation
of a part of the undecomposed acid by the water, which
is formed during the process, will probably, indeed, always
be an impediment to our learning these proportions exactly.
The fact is chiefly of value, as it affords an example of the
production of oxymuriatic acid under the simplest possible
circumstances; and as it shows unequivocally that, under
such circumstances, the visible appearance of moisture it
a part   of the phaenomena.

observations and erroneous conceptions which appeared in
No. 30 of that work, relating to your Dividing Engine.
This learned critic I believe is determined, right or wrong,
to have the last word ; and I am also determined, after a
few remarks, to give him no further interruption.                I well
know that I have no skill in book-making. What I have
said on your machine was my first essay, for which I am
accused of arrogance, confused and obscure explanation,
&c. Now, as that is the case, I may as well add a little
more to   it,   bydeclaring that think my judgement
                                     1                           book-  in
making, so far as machinery used in the mathematical line
is  concerned,    isat least equal to that of my accusers, pro
bably, pretty much upon          apar.
    In the first place, no other part of your Dividing Engine
was offered to the Society of Arts, for their consideration,
but   a  model of that on which the teeth are cut, and that
was merely to give some idea of new plan, for producing
                                          a                                       a
certain number of equal teeth round            circle, with more ac
                                                    a
curacy than had yet been done. The discussion therefore
rested solely on this one point, and was ultimately given in
your favour, and for the communication, the Society of Arts
have thought proper to honour you with the gold medal.
     After all this, the Editor of the Retrospect seems still
 disposed to cavil, and will not admit of any merit in your
 invention. The reason          believe
                                 I           this, that he does not

                                         probably, ignorant that on
 your plan there are two rings in use, of the same diameter
 and thickness, with an equal number of teeth in each, the
 upper one moveable and the other fixed, perfectly concen
 tric to each other, and also to the centre of the machine
  from which they move,  and so contrived, that when the
  two rings are brought into contact and fastened together,
  they appear as one only.        In this stale the racking           to     is

   Respecting the equality of the teeth of your dividing
machine, whatever error there may be before the shifting
of the moveable ring, it is clear, the same must exist in
them both, being in contact and cut together at the same
time. After being reversed and worked round with the cut
ter a few times, which will produce opposite teeth all the
way round, as stated in my last, the next move must be
one quarter, or QO°, and this leads me to the grand point at
once. I will now suppose that there is some considerable
error, however. In this situation there will be found four
teeth, and no more, in perfect coincidence and in their
true place, on the upper and lower ring, at the four quar
ters, and by this move it is clear that the largest teeth are
placed so as to meet the smallest on the opposite ring. Con
sequently, when the cutter is turned round, its whole ten
 dency will be to equalize the teeth, which are now under
 the reciprocal control of each other, so that, by shifting and
 racking a few times more, this business will be finished to
 the greatest degree of exactness: the proof of which is
 simple and easy, it lies in the machine itself, which is,
 after the cutter is taken away, to move the ring 90°, and
 then examine the coincidence in every part, which from
 the nature of the process, I have no doubt, will be found
 perfectly correct.     If ocular demonstration will satisfy,
 here it may be had.
    In all that I have said on this subject, my aim has been
 not elegance of style, but plainness and precision ;-and
I   think, whoever cannot understand it so far as to enable
  him to make such a machine, would be unfit to undertake
 it on other accounts.

 and the efforts they apparently make to approach and

 have rejected this hypothesis, few or no experiments have
 been made by them to ascertain with what propriety the
 various motions of tendrils, of different kinds, can be at
 tributed to peculiarity of organization, and the operation of
 external causes.    I was consequently iuduced, during the
 last summer, to employ a considerable portion of time to
 watch the motions of the tendrils of different species of
 plants ; and I have now the pleasure to address to you an
 account of the observations I was enabled to make.
    The plants selected were the Virginia creeper (the am-
 pelopsis quinquefolia of Michaux), the ivy, and the com
 mon vine and pea.                     , ,
    A plant of the ampelopsis, which grew in a garden pot,
 was removed to a forcing-house in the end of May, and a
 single shoot from it was made to grow perpendicularly up
 wards, by being supported in that position by a very slen
der bar of wood, to which it was bound.         The plant was
placed in the middle of the house, and was fully exposed to
the sun ; and every object around it was removed far be
yond the reach of its tendrils.       Thus circumstanced, its
tendrils, as soon as they were nearly full grown, all pointed
towards the north, or back wall, which was distant about
eight feet : but not meeting with any thing in that direc
tion, to which they could attach themselves, they declined
gradually     towards the ground, and ultimately attached
themselves to the stem beneath, and the slender bar of
wood.
    A plant of the same species was placed at the east end
of the house, near the glass, and was in some measure
skreened from the perpendicular light; when its tendrils
pointed towards the west, or centre of the house, as those
under the preceding circumstances had pointed towards the
north and back wall. This plant was removed to the
west end of the house, and exposed to the evening sun,
beng skreened, as in the preceding case, from the perpen
dicular light; and its tendrils, within a few hours, changed
their direction, and again pointed to the centre of the
house, which was partially covered with vines. This plant
was then removed to the centre of the house, and fully ex
posed to the perpendicular light, and to the sun ; and a
piece of dark-coloured paper was placed upon one side of
it,  just] within the reach of its tendrils;  and to this sub
stance they soon appeared to be strongly attracted.        The
paper was then placed upon the opposite side, under similar
circumstances, and there  it   was soon followed   by the ten
drils. It   was then removed,, and piece of plate glass was

dicate any disposition to approach.        The position of the
glass was then changed, and care was taken to adjust its
surface to the varying position of the sun, so that the light
reflected might continue to strike the tendrils j which then
receded from the glass, and appeared to be strongly repulsed
by it.
    The tendrils of the ampelopsis very closely resemble
those of the vine, in their internal organization, and in
originating from the alburnous substance of the plant; and
in being, under certain circumstances, convertible into fruit
stalks.    The claws or claspers of the ivy, to experiments
upon which I shall now proceed, appear to be cortical pro
trusions only; but to be capable (I have reason to believe)
of becoming perfect roots, under favourable circumstances.
Experiments in every respect very nearly similar to the pre
 ceding, were made upon this plant; but I found it neces
 sary to place the different substances, to which I proposed
 that the claws should attempt to attach themselves, almost
 in contact with the stems of the plants.        I observed that
 the claws of this plant evaded the light, just as the tendrils
 of the ampelopsis had done ; and that they sprang only
 from such parts of the stems as were fully, or partially,
 shaded.
     A seedling plant of the peach tree, and one of the am
 pelopsis and ivy, were placed nearly in the centre of the
 house, and under similar circumstances ; except that sup
 ports, formed of very slender bars of wood, about four
 inches high, were applied to the ampelopsis and ivv.        The
 peach tree continued to grow nearly perpendicularly, with
 a slight inclination towards the front and south side of the
 house, whilst the stems of the ampelopsis and ivy, as soon
  as they exceeded the height of their supports, inclined many
  points from the perpendicular line, in the opposite direction.
     Jt appears therefore that not only the tendrils and claws
 of these creeping dependent plants, but that their stems
  also, are made to recede from light, and to press against the
  opake bodies, which nature intended to support and protect
  them.
     M. Decandole, I believe, first observed that the succulent
  shoots of trees and herbaceous plants, which do not depend
  upon others for support, are bent towards the point from
  which they receive light, by the contraction of the cellular
  substance of their bark, upon that side, and      I believe his
  opinion to be perfectly well founded. The operation of
  light upon the tendrils and stems of the ampelopsis and

Of this plant, like those of the ampelopsis, spring alternately
from each side of the stem, and as one point only in three
is without a tendril, and as each tendril separates into two
divisions, they do not often fail to come into contact with
any object within their reach ; and the effects of contact
upon the tendril are almost immediately visible.       It is made
to bend towards the body it touches, and, if that body be
slender, to attach itself firmly by twining round             it,

               a close connection between its vascular struc

 I    have proved   in the Philosophical Transactions of 806,       1
that centrifugal force,      by operating upon the elongating
plumules of germinating         seeds, occasions an increased
growth and extension upon the external sides of the young
stems, and that gravitation produces correspondent effects               ;

tract, to the opposite side, which will expand            and the
tendril will thence be compelled to bend round                a ;

florence flask. When      the hydrosulphuret  of platina is
treated with strong nitrous acid, an immediate action takes
place, heat is excited, the acid is decomposed, nitrous gas
is evolved, and sulphuric acid formed.      The spontaneous
action, however, is very limited, and soon subsides ; heat
must now be applied, and the materials boiled to dryness. ¦
When the excess of nitrous acid is expelled, a little more
 should be added, to insure the entire conversion of the
hydrosulphuret into sulphate.     The utmost heat of a large
 Argand's lamp may now be applied for a considerable time.
 When the superabundant acid is driven off, and no more
 fumes can be perceived, the sulphate of platina alone re-'
 mains, and exhibits the following properties.
              Physical and Chemical Properties.
    Its colour is very dark brown, approaching to black. It
is obtained in the form of a porous crust or cake, resembling
a dry cinder, or the carbonaceous matter resulting from
the decomposition of sugar by heat. It is very brittle, and
easily pulverized.     It has a brilliant resinous lustre, some
what analogous to crystallized         blende, and the powder
exhibits a granular appearance.  Its taste is rather acid and
metallic, with some degree of causticity.  It slightly affects
litmus paper. It is very delicmescent, and, of course, readily
 soluble in water. When exposed in a dry state to the
 atmosphere for a few minutes, it becomes quite moist, and
 after a short time assumes the fluid form.  In this state
 it appears as a dark brown viscid substance, and a single
 drop of it colours about a gallon of water.         The dry sul
 phate is soluble in alcohol, and in ether.       It is soluble in
 muriatic acid.    When it is boiled to dryness in this acid
 and heated, it is decompounded, the sulphuric acid is ex
 pelled, and the insoluble compound of platina and chlorine
 remains. It is soluble in nitric acid ; but this acid may be
 successively boiled to dryness on        it,without apparently
 altering its constitution. It is soluble in phosphoric acid.
 When the aqueous solution of sulphate of platina           is
                                                            treated
 with pure potash, soda or ammonia, peculiar triple com
 pounds are formed.
                         Muriate of aluminc, and muriate of
 barytes, also produce peculiar compounds with sulphate of
  platina.    Of these alkaline and earthy substances, more
 will be said hereafter.
  I     have not obtained the sulphate of platina      in

  kind, but have not succeeded      in  determining the form of
  the crystals.

352            On some Combinations   of Platina.
    The aqueous solution of sulphate of platina, as M. Proust
has stated, is not precipitated by muriate of ammonia 5 but
if the solution be boiled to dryness, the yellow compound
is formed.
    The sulphuric acid cannot, it would seem, be separated
from the aqueous solution of sulphate of platina, by any of
the common methods, even though an excess of nitric acid
is present. Acetate and nitrate or lead occasion in it a dark
brown coloured precipitate, which I have not examined,
but which is probably a triple compound of the oxides of
lead and platina with sulphuric acid.
    When the dry sulphate of platina is heated to redness in
close vessels over mercury, it is entirely decompounded}
the platina remains in its metallic state.         The gaseous
 products are oxygene gas, with a little sulphureous acid
gas, and a fluid is obtained which evolves copious whits
fumes when exposed to the atmosphere, and is probably
concentrated sulphuric acid, impregnated with sulphureous
 acid gas ;  a fluid precisely analogous to the glacial sul
 phuric acid of some authors.
                            Analysis.
    To determine the composition of this substance,         I de
 compounded it by the agency of heat, in small retorts over
 mercury, and over water j and from a comparison of the
 results furnished by both methods, I shall venture to state
 the proportions of its constituent parts.
    I hoped to have been able to separate all the acid from
 the sulphate of platina by heat, and thus to have obtained
 the pure oxide alone ; but this was quite impracticable, as
 both the oxygene and acid appeared to be expelled at the
 same temperature.      In analysing this substance, some pre
 cautions were necessary, to avoid the powerful agency of
 the atmosphere on it.  It could not be pulverized and
 transferred to any vessel, or weighed, without acquiring an
 increase of weight.  The dry cake of sulphate of platina
 was therefore broken into small pieces whilst it was quite hot,
 and then exposed to the utmost heat of a lamp for about
 two hours. It was then hastily transferred into a very small
   round stoppered bottle previously dried and heated. The
 §ottle was now poised in a very delicate balance, and some
 of the sulphate put into a small warm retort ; the weight
 the bottle had lost, indicated, of course, the quantity of sul
 phate which had entered the retort ; the minute portion of
 air could make no ascertainable difference in the results.

presence of water in the dry sulphate of platina, yet they
seem to show that, if it contain any, the quantity must be

from some probable arguments furnished by the agency of

              and from the results of its decomposition in
 close vessels over dry mercury.  Thus, when the sulphate

   The three preceding experiments were all made with
equal care, yet they do not appear to merit the same degree
of confidence.      shall venture to deduce the composition of
                      I
the sulphate from the two first experiments, as they very
nearly agree.     But independent of this circumstance, their
near coincidence with results derived from the analyses of
the fixed alkaline sulphates of platina, and with the rule
given       Professor Berzelius relative to the constitution of
           by
metallic sulphates, are obvious reasons for the choice.
   By calculations, these experiments will be found to fur
nish the following results for 100 grains of dry sulphate
of platina.

   The two preceding experiments afford almost precisely
 the same results; the metallic platina and sulphate of potash,
in both instances, weighed the same; and to diminish the
average   loss, they were mixed together, and boiled .in
about a pint of distilled water : by this means all the sul
phate of potash was dissolved, and the platina alone re
mained.     After the aqueous solution of sulphate of potash
had been decanted off, and the grains of metal well washed
and heated to redness, they weighed 14-8 grains.

   This substance is procured in a similar manner as thq
potash sulphate of platina, by treating sulphate of platina
with a solution of pure soda, and boiling the materials for
a few minutes.       The precipitate, after being well washed
with pure water, and dried for a considerable time at a tem
perature not exceeding 212° Fahrenheit, exhibits properties
analogous to those of the potash sulphate of platina.
   Its colour is black or very dark brown.             It is in small
hard lumps.       It has a shining resinous lustre, similar to
that of the potash sulphate of platina, but rather less di
stinct.   It is tasteless, and insoluble in water. The effects
of the mineral acids and alkalies on it appear to be very
similar to those produced on the potash sulphate of platina.
Its general characters so closely resemble those of the potash
sulphate of platina, that I have not observed a single pro
perty which may be said distinctly to characterize the one
from the other.  Like that substance, it is decompounded
by the agency of heat, and this mode I adopted to ascertain
the proportions of its constituent parts.

                                                                 from

 decompounded at a red heat in a small retort, and furnished

    The metallic platina      and sulphate  of soda, from      the two
preceding experiments, amounted together to rather more
than 1 5*3 grains.         After being boiled in a quantity of dis
tilled water, well washed, and heated to redness, the pla
tina weighed 14 grains.          Hence, taking the mean of these
two experiments, 100 grains of soda sulphate of platina ap
pear to consist of

     The difference in
                     these experiments appears to be owing
 to the circumstance, that a little of the salt was carried into
 the neck of the retorts during the expulsion of the water,
 which was not noticed in  the preceding experiments.
     Inthe potash sulphate of platina, and soda sulphate of
platina, as in the sulphate of platina, the metal, it is pre
sumed, must be at its minimum of oxidation, in the slate
of black oxide; and there is a very near coincidence as to the'
composition of this oxide, furnished by the decomposition
of all these substances.

                                Ammonia
    This compound, like the preceding, is made by neutra
 lizing an aqueous solution of sulphate of platina by pure
 ammonia, and boiling the fluid for a few minutes.   After
 being washed with distilled water, and dried for some hours,
 at a temperature pot exceeding 212° Fahrenheit, it exhibits
 the following properties.
                 Physical and Chemical Properties.
   Tt is of a lightish brown colour.       It is in fine powder or
small loosely aggregated lumps. It is tasteless, and insolu
ble in water.     It undergoes no apparent change by exposure
to the atmosphere.        It dissolves slowly in cold muriatic
acid, and readily at a gentle heat. It is soluble in sulphu
ric acid at a moderate heat.       It is insoluble in nitric acid
at a boiling heat.     When strong nitric acid is boiled to
dryness on      it,   decompounded, and
                      it   is                  black substance re

oxide of platina with nitrate andsulphateof ammonia. When

of   it  dissolved.
          is              insoluble in acetic acid.

                                                          It   is

   36f           On some Combinations      of Platina.
  in a similar manner, several     comparatively feeble explosions
  occurred.     In these instances, as also when it was exploded
  on glass, the materials were all dissipated, there was not
  the slightest trace of the plalina, which in all probability
  must be reduced in the process.          It does not explode by
  percussion or friction, nor could I fire it hy flint and steel.
  The detonating properties of this compound are far inferior,
  and differ maierially from those belonging to fulminating
  silver, gold, and mercury ; yet they seem sufficiently distinct
  to entitle it to a place in this class of bodies, and serve to
  complete the analogy existing between the nuble metals.
      Fulminating platina is soluble in sulphuric acid at a
  moderate heat.      It dissolves hut slowly in boiling muriatic
  acid. Jt is slighllv soluble in concentrated phosphoric acid,
  and the solution is of a very deep colour like the sulphate :
  on the addition of water, a brown precipitate lakes place,
  and the fluid remains turbid and slightly coloured ; but
  after a short time, all the platina is precipitated, and the fluid
 remains colourless.  I have not examined this substance,
 but am inclined to think it is a phosphate of platina.
     Fulminating platina is slightly soluble in boiling pure
  nitric acid : the solution affords a precipitate with muriate
 of barytes; and with all the alkalies, a yellow precipitate.
 Whether this vellow substance be an oxide or a triple com
 pound of the alkalies oxide and acid, I have not ascertained.
 When it is boiled to dryness with nitric acid, a black sub
 stance remains, which is probably a triple compound.          It is
 insoluble in acetic acid, and when boiled to dryness with
 this acid it still retains its detonating properties.
     I cannot speak with certainty as to the constitution of
 this compound ; but from the foregoing statements I am
disposed to believe, it is analogous to the ammonia sulphate
of platina, and only differs from this substance, in the
proportions of its constituent parts.
              12. Of Alumine Sulphate of Platina.
    This compound is procured, by treating an aqueous solu
 tion of sulphate of platina with muriate of alumine, a
copious gelatinous precipitate of a brown colour occurs :
after being well washed with pure water, and dried for a
considerable time at a temperature not exceeding 212°
Fahrenheit, it exhibits the following propeities.
                Physical and Chemical Properties.
    Its colour is black, or extremely dark brown. It is in small
lumps.      It has a shining resinous lustre, resembling that of
potash sulphate of platina. It is tasteless, insoluble in water,
and unaffected by the atmosphere.           When it is heated on
                                                             a thin

obliged me to relinquish this design. I shall, however, itate
a few facts I have observed relative to these compounds.
   The potash muriate of platina, when properly prepared,
makes, 1 presume, a good colour for painters.                   I am not
aware that this substance has been proposed as a pigment,
or that the fact is generally known ; I shall therefore de
scribe the method I have adopted to procure                      together       it,
wilh the properties which seem to characterize and fit                  for                it
this purpose.
   The purified platina of commerce should be dissolved in
nitro-muriatic acid, composed of about three parts of muria
tic and one part of nitrous acid, the solution evaporated
nearly to dryness, redissolved in water, filtered and treated
with   a
         strong solution of nitrate or muriate of potash, till no
fnrther precipitate takes place.            The precipitate should be
washed with         little distilled water, and dried at
                     a                                              mode              a
rate heat.     As the purified platina of commerce sometimes
contains other foreign metals,                    necessary precaution,
                                                      it   is

existence of triple sulphates and nitrates of platina.                 The

 and the nitrate       still unknown. These compounds, from the

     Platina appears to be characterized no less by its valuable
  properties than by its disposition to form peculiar triple
  compounds ; and there can be little doubt but that a more
  extensive acquaintance with the combinations of this metal
  will add considerably to the number of such substances. It
  would be an interestinginquiry, whether the same laws w hich
  seem to govern the formation of binary compounds, extend
  likewise to thoseof ternary compounds. For an investigation
  of this kind no metal seems so well adapted as platina;

  whether we consider the variety of its compounds, or the
  simplicity of the results furnished by their decomposition.
     Some of the preceding combinations seem to agree with
  the doctrine of definite proportions, and to correspond very
  nearly with experiments made by Professor Berzelins of
  Stockholm.      But there is not the same coincidence with
  others. Whilst I cannot but regret the imperfect ion.of this
  investigation, I indulge a hope, that should the subject here

 LXIV.     Case of Femoral Hernia, with some Peculiarities,
    sticessftilly treated by an Operation. By John Taunton,

 Society,  recommended by Mr. Lincoln, Hatlon Garden,
 has had femoral hernia on the right side for about six months;
 but this gave very little uneasiness, as the tumour was very
 small, and could at all times be returned            by
                                                 slight pressure.
    July 16, 1812,       became painful and irreducible; the
                          it
                                                                       a by
 pain was referred to the umbilicus, and was preceded
 hiccough, sickness, and vomiting.        On the 17th she had
 stool, but the symptoms continued       the hiccough, sickness,
                                              ;
 and vomiting were worse.
    On the 19th,       A.M. visited her for the first time,
                         3        I
 found the tumour small, but tense and irreducible. The pain,
 on attempting to reduce           it,
                                 was referred to the umbilicus
 and region of the stomach. Two of the following pills were
 directed to be taken every second hour           :

      9 P. M. The pills remained on the stomach ; the hie*
  cough and sickness were less. An enema was directed to be
  given.
      20. 5 A.M. Much the same as on the preceding even
 ing. Another box of pills was ordered to be taken as be
  fore ; the same ai the former, excepting (ithe omission of
 the opium.          The tobacco enema was directed to be given*
  which had the effect of producing a stool, after which she
 seemed a little relieved ; but the hernia remained in the same
 state.
     4 P. M. Restless, skin dry, tongue furred, the hiccough
 and sickness worse.
     9 P. M. The unfavourable symptoms had all increased
 considerably.          On proposing the operation it was agreed to
 immediately, and performed soon after 10 P. M. The peri
 toneal sac was verv thin, and contained only a few drops
 of serum ; the contents of the sac was an adipose tumour *,
 having exactly the appearance of condensed omentum. This
 tumour grew from the coat of the intestine, by a small neck.
 No part of the canal of the intestine was included in the
 stricture.
     The stricture was dilated in the usual way inwards and
 downwards towards the symphysis pubis. Immediately on
 the part beine returned she experienced relief, and said she
 felt much more comfortable. The wound was dressed with
 lint and adhesive plaster, secured by a bandage j but no medi
cine was given.
     91. 5 A. M. Has had some sleep; the sickness, hic
cough, and pain have subsided.                      There remains only a
sense of soreness            in the abdominal viscera ; the skin is a
little dry.

   Sept. SO. She has taken her accustomed exercise, and
nursed a child without pain or inconvenience.              Nor is there
 the least appearance of any protrusion of the hernia.             The
bandage has been continued to make pressure on the part,

LXV.       An  easy Method of forming all Kinds of Ovals,
   commonly known by the Name of Gardener's Ovals *.
 .The oval,    as is  well known, is an elliptical figure formed
by curved line, which re-emers into itself, and which is
     a
composed of several portions of a circle which have various
centres.
   The execution and demonstration of this figure pre-sup-
pose a degree of knowledge which every body does not
possess; but a method has long been known of forming
it with exactitude in a practical manner ; and an acquaint
ance with it will be sufficient for artists, gardeners, and
other persons who wish to trace this figure : the following
is a description of the method in question :
   Every oval has two diameters: one long like the line
AB (Plate IX.), which is called the great diameter, and the
other short, which is called the small diameter, like the
line F H, which forms with A B four right angles, since
it is perpendicular to it. These two lines are reciprocally
intersected at their middle point, whatever length we may
suppose these two diameters to have.
    It is requisite to trace a curved line, which passes at the
different points A FBfJ, where the great and small diame
ter terminate.
    With this view, from the middle of the great diameter tc
the point    L   trace the small arcs to the points G and D,
which ought to be equally distant from the point L, and
consequently from the points A and B.
   Plant at the point of intersection of these two arcs, C and
              * Bit. Phyt. Ecun. 2d Scmttlrt 1811, p. 266.

   D,   two stakes a b, well fixed in the ground, in order that
   they may not shake.        Afterwards take with a string the
  distance from the point D to the point A, or from the point
   C to B ; double this string and knot it firmly, so that, by
   placing between the two ends at the extremity a tracing
   stick, it points precisely at the point A, and the stakes G
  and D are embraced by this string.
       Then guide the tracing stick, with the string well
  stretched but moving fret I v, from the point A to the point
  O, and -successively to E, F, G, B, H, and finally to A.
      The triangles DCO, DCE, DCF, DCG,' represent
  the various movements of the string turning upon the two
  centres of the oval to the points D and C.
      We may always strike an oval, whatever may be the
  length of the u;reat and small diameter, by taking the dif
  ference which is between them, and by sharing out this dif
  ference so as that the half of the leugth which exceeds the
  grtat diameter may be subtracted from each extremity of
  the' line A B, or from the greatest diameter.
      Let us suppose, for instance, that the line AB of the
 great diameter is 20 metres long, and that the line FH of
 the small diameter is twelve metres long, it is evident that
 the great diameter will exceed the small by eight metres,
 the half of which is four metres. We must therefore place
 a stake four metres from the point A, i.e. towards G, and
 another at a similar distance towards D.
      It is right to observe, that the oval will be so much the
 longer, the nearer the stakes approach the points B and A;
 in trie contrary case, the oval will more nearly approach the
form of the circle.

Sir, In       compliance with a wish expressed by marly, I have
Ions; had an inclination to communicate, through the me
dium of your journal, an account of the causes and circum
stances that led me to contrive a self-correcting      mathema
tical dividing engine ; but the difficulties which individuals
unused to literary composition experience in attempts to
convey mechanical ideas, and a diffidence in my own powers,
operated      so powerfully on my mind, that I doubt whether
I should yet have ventured, did I not feel myself called upon
hv a second illiberal attack from an anonymous writer in
                                                             a«

an obscure publication               ;    a writer who, I        presume          to pre
dict, will not venture to claim in his own name the merit
that may be due to his luminous retrospection!.
    About ten years                  made a dividing engine, nearly
S9 inches in diameter, now in the possession of Mr. Cook of
Shadwell, in making of which 1 met with difficulties of
which none can form an idea hut those who have attempted
to make dividing engines;  difficulties which ate now al
most entirely removed by the new method that I have con
trived.      Jn the first place, in making the former engine I
turned a rabbet on the edge to receive a ring of plate brass,
in which the teeth were cm ; but after 1 had racked                    that        it,
js   cut the teeth,     I  was not satisfied.         took
                                                         I     off and putit
on   a  second, which experienced the same late.                  then put I
on   a  third, and cut          it  divisions with
                                         by              single cutter, in
                                                              a
 the same way that          a clock-wheel        cut, and then applied
                                                    is
 the screw-cutter to regulate the teeth.                   found that
                                                                 I                        by
 this   method    I   got nearer      to truth  than       didI in the two
 former rings. In fact,            found (hat
                                     I            got
                                                    I      as true as other
                                                                 it
 engines are       in general. But though             did1    good deal of
                                                                      a
 dividing    for  the  trade,   and  even   gave general    satisfaction  to
 my customers,        still I  conceived    that  some    method    or con
 trivance might be discovered               which the truth of the teeth
                                              by
 would be self-evident.          I thought that         could fix
                                                         if  I       second    a
 screw-cutter directly opposite, and communicate exact mo
 tion to both at the same time, this would in great measure           a
 answer the purpose         ;  (on this method         had many conver
                                                         I

 lane    ;) but alter long consideration, and for many reasons
 that would be too tedious to mention here,                 was obliged to
                                                                 I
 give   up  the  idea as   impracticable           in
                                               my opinion. However,
J    did not despair;       Istill entertained hopes of devising some
 method w hereby the teeth of dividing engine could be cut
                                              a
  to a  greater degree of certainty than hitherto had been done;
  and also upon       a self evident principle, that would exclude
 every degree      of doubt    respecting its accuracy.
      At length new idea presented itself to my mind, which
                  a
  was, to make second wheel act on the same centre or axis,
                   a
  to fiord me an opportunity to shitt the one half of the rack
     a
  or teeth to different parts of the circle, when under the
 operation of cutting the teeth. The screw-cutter being fixed
  so as to cot half of the teeth           the one ring, and half
                                              in                         the        in
  other,      directly saw that this method would afford me an
              I
 opportunity of examining the error of the teeth, and also
        the cutter an opportunity to correct errors. The more
five thought of this method the belter              likedI       but saw,
                                                                      it  ;        I

also, that it was a method that would be attended with con
siderable expense, and which I could but ill afford at the
time, having spent so much of my time and earnings in
gaining experience by making the former engine. The next
Idea was the ring; which 1 saw would be attended with
considerably less expense, and would answer the same pur
pose if well executed : tor here only one particular point
required to be carefully attended to, viz. to make the rabbet
true which was to receive the-ring ; for it was evident, that
if that were turned sufficiently true, the ring would be sure
to shift correctly.
    I was so well aware of the necessity of strictly attending
to this point, that I did not content myself with having the
rabbet turned on its own axis in the lathe ; but after I had
it fitted on its own stand, where it now acts, I fixed a tool
with an adjustment to touch the rabbet where the ring is
fitted on ; and by moving the wheel horizontally round to.
the said tool, I found that I got it extremely true.      This
being done, I fitted on the ring, and then found that it would
move very correctly to opposite lines or divisions.     Which
circumstance gave me full confidence that I had obtained
my object.
    In the description which I gave to the Society of Arts,
J  made mention of steady pins, which I find does not please
some of the critics. I understand that they imagine that the
steady pins are made fast in the rings, but which is not the
case. The holes that I broached with the stop- broach were
through both substances, and which I got true by shifting
the ring to halves and quarters as I broached. I then fitted
in steel pins, which would push out and in every time that
I  shifted the ring. I, however, placed more dependence on
the opposite lines than on the steady pins; but these were
useful in assisting me to shift the ring correctly to the op
 posite lines or divisions.
    That the anonymous author above alluded to does not
 understand the subject that he writes on, is evident from,
 one circumstance, namelv, his comparing my improvement
 on jhe dividing engine of Ramsdcn with Mr. Troughton'g
 method of dividing Targe circles by hand ;  two things which
 are as different from each other as light is from darkness.
 He makes his conclusion (after finding all the faults with
 my method that he can) by saying, that under all the cir
 cumstances of the case, we must give the preference to Mr.
 Troughton's method of dividing ; although Mr. Troughton
 himself, in his description, says that it has nothing to do
 with Mr. Ramsden's engine. By hazarding such remarks

the obscure anonymous gentleman does niemore good than
he is aware of.
   The making of dividing engines lias hitherto been con
sidered so very difficult an undertaking, that but few have
ventured on the labour; and those that have were men of
the first abilities as workmen : therefore, if I have made an
engine equally correct with the best that has been made,
] conceive that I deserve well of my country, because I have
found out a method by w hich any ordina-y workman can
make a dividing engine equally correct, if not more so than
any engine thai hitherto has been made, and that with
ease.
     I cannot be surprised, much less should I be angry, that
a person   whose profession is writing, should not understand
the value of my invention ; for 1 can find men in the same
trade with myself who arc equally ignorant, but among
them none of those *ho have ever attempted to make a di
viding engine. Those w ho have made the attempt all ac-
knowledi!,e   its value in the strongest terms.    Among the
latter I may mention a most competent judge, Mr. Stan-
clifle, who was foreman to the late Mr. Kamsden at the
time that the engine which obtained the tew aid from the
Board of Longitude was made ; who of course had the
greatest share in the making of               it,
                                      and who has since made
one for himself. This gentleman was with me on Saturday
last and after examining the engine for some length of time,

    Mr. liergc, who        now in possession of the engine that
                            is
the Board of Longitude rewaided, and who lived (as             un              I
derstand)    with   the late Mr.  Ramsden    from his youth,   has
also examined my engine          second time, and declared

has been communicated to the public w ithin his knowledge.
Mr. Troughtnn, understand, also considers the principle
                        I
to be excellent.
    In fact, every one who knows the difficulty of cutting the
teeth of     dividing engine correctly, allows
               a                                     all the merit     it
that  I wish     and all agree that an engine racked or cut
                    ;

one half of the teeth to different situations, while under the
operation of the cutter, and finally producing full sound and
complete teeth all round, is a self-evident proof of its supe
rior accuracy. This I have done, after shifting it to oppo
site quarters and eighths, perhaps not less than 30 times,
while under the cutter, and finally the teeth are complete.
    The last time that I shifted it was the 10th of last June,
which was one-eighth.       I then cut a line on the one side,
half on the solid wheel and another on the ring, with the
dividing point, which is fixed to have no other motion but
to and from the centre of the wheel. I then turned the screw
720 times, which is one half of the number of teeth in the
wheel. I then cut a similar line with the same fixed point,
and then withdrew the 24 bending screws, and shifted the
ring half round.     Of course the lines now stand in an op
posite situation to what they were when cut, yet tbey are
good coincidents.
    The anonymous critic, above alluded to, may, when
ever he pleases, satisfy himself as to the accuracy of the
coincidence of the lines, by a personal inspection of the
engine  which will, I think, put an end to all his suppo
sititious cases respecting ihe shifting of the ring having a
tendency to diminish the teeth.       He calls me an obscure
individual : the charge is certain! v true ; and had he added,
that my obscurity is the cause that my invention has not
been more noticed, it would have been equally true.         But
of this I am confident, that however obscure I may re
main, my invention will continue to live as long as mathe
matical dividing engines continue to be used ; and little as
he yet knows of the value of my discovery, I have no hesi
tation in asserting my opinion, that there never was (nor
ever will be) a dividing engine cut on the single edge, in
the old way, but would, could the teeth be reversed as in
niy invention, exhibit considerable errors.  Let any person
but make the experiment, and he will be compelled to ac
knowledge the truth of my statement.
    Those who have seen circles divided by my engine, and
who arc competent judges, all approve of their accuracy.
The author of the observations w hich have appeared in Dr.
 Rees's Cyclopedia stales, that he has seen one of my im
 proved reflecting circles well divided.       I have received
 testimonies to the same effect from a Captain M'Lennan,
 from South America, and from Lieutenant Phipps, of His
 Majesty's ship Bellerophon ; and at this moment I am busy
 with another reflecting circle, which I hope will be divided

 soon,    when    I will be glad that the anonymous critic, who
 says   I  have never given any proof, would come and exa
 mine the engine, and what it produces.
   I fiave only one more remark to offer, for the sake of those
 who may hereafter make dividing engines : it is to correct
 a mistaken notion, which I find exists among men even in
 the mathematical linej some of whom imagine, that the
 way to rack an engine, is to press the cutter to the edge of
 the wheel, and to go on at once all round, by turning the
 screw-cutter until they have effected a complete revolution
 of the wheel j trusting, at the same time, that they have
 got the wheel exactly of the size that will take in the
 uumberof teeth that they want, by which means they con
 ceive there could exist no error.         But such a method,   I
 believe, was never attempted, and I believe never will j
 and could it be done, the wheel would be too little for the
 screw, when the teeth became full.          To such as might be
misled by this idea, the following directions may be useful :
 The wheel, at first, must be kept as large as possible for
 the screw-cutter to act properly, and by joining different
 portions of the teeth, which is done from divisions laid
 clown for the purpose as a guide.         Hoping that this com
 munication may prove useful,

he has added a circular motion, which he has done upon
my principle, and which enables him to speak from expe

                                      INTRODUCTION,
    T  wo years ago,     engaged, at the request of my brother,

.   Sir H. Davy, in an    inquiry respecting the nature of com
     mon fluoric acid y.as.   My prhicipal object was to ascer
     tain whether silex       essential to its constitution,
                                   is                          and
     whether the proportion     constantly the same. This sub
                                        is
    ject, and experiments on the fluoric and fluoboracic acids,
     occupied me for about six months.        Since that time, the
     work of MM. Gay Lussac and Thenard has appeared, en-

  titled  " Rechcrches       Physico-Chemiques," in the second
  volume of which is an elaborate dissertation on fluoric acid.
  These philosophers, I find, have anticipated many of my
  results, and consequently very much abridged my labour
  of detail in the following pages.           To repeat what is already
  known would be useless, I shall therefore confine myself to
 describe what I have observed, which appears to me yet
  novel, or different from the observations of the French
  chemists.     The order which I shall pursue, will be that
  which I observed in my experiments.                  I shall divide w.hat
  I have to advance into four parts. The first part will relate
 to the silicated fluoric acid gas, and to the subsilicaled
 fluoric acid ; the second to the combinations of these acids,
 and of pure fluoric acid with ammonia ; the third to fluo-
  boracic acid ; and the fourth to its ammoniacal salts.
 Sect. i.      On Silicated Fluoric Acid Gas, arid Subsilicaled
                                Fluoric Acid.
      The facts which     have already been published by MM. Gay
 Lussac and Thenard and others, appear to me to be suffi
 cient to prove that pure fluoric acid has not yet been ob
 tained in the gaseous state, and that silex, or boracic acid,
 is requisite that it may assume this form.               Were more evi
 dences necessary, ( could advance many in point.                       One
 circumstance only I shall mention, proving that common
 fluoric acid gas is perfectly saturated with silex.                 I have
 preserved this gas, made by healing, in a glass retort, a
 mixture of fluor spar and sulphuric acid, for several weeks
 over mercury in a glass receiver uncoated with wax, with
 out observing the slightest erosion to be produced *.
     This gas, with great propriety, has lately been called si
 licated fluoric.      Before I proceed to its analysis, I shall
notice what method I have found the best for obtaining it.
 I have for a considerable time, long before MM. Gay Lussac
and Thenard's work was published, added to the mixture
of fluor spar and sulphuric acid, a quantity of finely pounded
glass, and have thus procured the gas with the greatest
facility.    The advantages of this addition are considerable.
                                                                            1
The retort is saved, which otherwise, in less than one ope-.
ration, would be destroyed ; and a much larger quantity of
gas is procured from the same materials, and with less1
    * The sides of the receiver indeed became obscure ; but this was not
from erosion, but from deposition, as appeared from the transparency and
polish of the glass being readily restored by slight friction. What the de
position was, I am ignorant of. After several weeks it was 10 trifling, as
to give only a slight degtee of opacity to the receiver.
                                    A   a 4                         trouble

378              Account     of   some   ETpel imenli
 gas, after having remained in contact with the water                   i
 whole night, ceased to be diminished.        According to this
 result, the proper correction being made for the additional
 pressure, water decomposes about 263 times its bulk of si-
 licated fluoric acid gas.
     Dr. Priestley observed, that muriatic acid gas reproduced
 silicated fluoric gas from the crust of silex formed, when
 the latter is condensed by water*.         This experiment I
 have repeated, and as it appears to show more correctly the
 quantity of gas water can condense, I shall describe the re
sult.    2*4 cubic inches of muriatic gas were added to a
drop of water, that had previously absorbed one cubic inch
 of silicated fluoric gas, in ajar over mercury.     There was
an immediate absorption equal to         of a cubic inch. The
mixture of silex and subsilicated fluoric acid effervesced,
and from an apparent solid became fluid, the whole of the
silex gradually disappearing.       After the first-mentioned
absorption, there was no further.       The gas produced was
silicated, as appeared from the crust it deposited when
removed to water* aud the liquid formed was pure muria
tic acid } for, decomposed by concentrated sulphuric, it
afforded merely muriatic acid gas, without any silicated
fluoric. The evident conclusion from the preceding result
is, that water condenses equal quantities of the muriatic
and silicated fluoric acid gases, and consequently that the
first estimate is loo low, and instead of 263 times its bulk,
it is probably more correct to say that water to be saturated
requires at least 365 times its volume.        Neither will this
estimate appear inconsistent with the former result, when
the deposition of silex is considered as an obstacle to the
free exposure of the surface of the water to the gas.
    Subsilicated fluoric acid is decomposed by ammonia and
the fixed alkalies, and by all the earths that I have made
trial of.    It is also decomposed by the sulphuric acid and
the boracic, as well as by the muriatic acid gas.
     Of the particular changes which occur when it is acted
upon by the alkalie3, I defer giving any account at present,
as it is my intention to do it in the next section.

retort connected with mercury.           A

plied, about three cubic inches of silicated fluoric acid gas
were produced.       The neck of the retort was lined with        si
lex in  a    gelatinous state, and much liquid subsilicated

fluoric acid, that had distilled over$ was condensed in the
colder part of the neck, and was absorbed by bibulous
paper, previously introduced to prevent the distilled fluid
from entering the jar for the reception of the gas. When
the whole of the acid in the bulb of the retort had been
evaporated, little or no silex remained.
    The general result of this experiment is very different
from that which Dr. Priestley, who first made                     it,
                                                            obtained*
Instead of silicated fluoric acid gas, he procured " vitriolic
ac'd air," sulphureous acid gas.
 I     have tried also the effect of heat on the siliceous crust,
formed    by   the decomposition of silicated fluoric acid gas,
 by   water; but could obtain no sulphureous acid gas, as
Dr. Priestley did only        small quantity of silicated fluoric;
                              a
    The correctness of Dr. Priestley's observations cannot be
doubted.      I  can only account for his results,            by
                                                           supposing
that some sulphuric acid           consequence of the high tem
                                  in
perature employed in making the gas was volatilized, and
mixed with the subsilicated fluoric acid, and that mercury also
was present from the acid being prepared over this metal.
    These experiments too oppose another statement relative
to    a  method prescribed for making fluoric acid gas free
from silex,         by
                     merely heating strong subsilicated fluoric
acid in   a  retort, and collecting the gas over mercury.                     It
is   asserted, in chemical works of some reputation, that this
 process  i3   successful.    I have never found          so, having
                                                             it
always obtained results similar to those above stated. This
I   suppose    isone of the many errors that have secretly crept
into repute, and has been believed, because never subjected
 to the test of experiment.
     The action of concentrated sulphuric acid on subsilicated
 fluoric acid,      issimilar to that of muriatic acid gas, occa
 sioning  a     disengagement      of silicated fluoric acid gas.

glass, for I have kept it in bottles of this substance more
than a month without any action being perceptible.        Ex
posed to the air, it slowly and almost completely evaporates,
there being only a very trifling siliceous residue ; and when
gently heated in an open vessel, it is rapidly dissipated in
white fumes.
Sect.  II. On the Combinations of Silicated Fluoric Atid
   Gas, and the Subsilicaled Fluoric, and the Fluoric Acids
   with Ammonia.
   M. Gay Lussac has shown that silicated fluoric acid gas,
like carbonic acid gas, condenses twice its volume of the
volatile alkali*.  The experiment I have several times re
peated, and constantly with the same result, no difference
appearing when the acid gas was added in great excess to
the alkaline, or the alkaline to the acid.   This being the
case, and knowing the specific gravities of the two gases t»
 100 parts by weight of silicated fluat of ammonia seem to
consist of            24*5 ammonia
                      75 5 acid
                         1000
 Silicated fluat of ammonia volatilizes unaltered, if heated
 by a spirit-lamp in the vessel in which it is formed, and
 provided moisture be entirely excluded.
    Like silicated fluoric acid gas itself, this salt is decomt
 posed by water, and a similar precipitation of silcx occurs,
 and in the same proportion.        Thus the salt formed by the
 union of 30 cubic inches of silicated fluoric gas, and 60
of volatile alkali (barom. 30, therm. 60) in a small glass
jar over mercury, being carefully collected and introduced
 into water, afforded five grains of pure silex, weighed after
 being well washed and heated to redness.
    The saline solution, since part of the silex of the silicated
 fluoric acid gas is separated during its production, appears
 to be a subsilicated fluat, or a combination of subsilicated
 fluoric acid and ammonia.      Another mode of making               it,
 more directly proves that this        its composition.
                                      is                   When

 39*             Account    of some     Experiments
   Ammonia seems to me to separate completely the silex,
and by uniting with the pure acid to constitute a true fluat.
MM. Gay Lu3sac and Thenard are of a different opinion.
They say that the whole of the silex cannot by this method
be removed, but only the principal part.      Their reason for
this belief is, that on repeatedly evaporating the salt after
the addition of ammonia and redissolving                  it,
                                                they have each
time observed residue of silex.
                 a                  If they employed metallic
evaporating vessels, the results of my experiments do not
agree with theirs; for making use of platina for this pur
pose, and adding an excess of ammonia,         never detected
                                                     I
traces of silex on evaporating the filtered fluat.    But our
results agree,   ifthey employed glass or porcelain vessels,
which fluat of ammonia has the. property of corroding.
 I   now proceed to the consideration of fluat of ammonia;
but before   I describe some of the properties of this fluat
which have observed,
         I                  shall briefly mention the means
                            I
pursued for ascertaining the proportions of its constituent
parts.
  The composition of subsilicated fluat of ammonia being
known, that of the fluat (granting what   already advanced
                                                     is
respecting its formation to be correct) may be inferred
from the proportion of silex that          given quantity of am
                                             a
monia will precipitate.       18 cubic inches of ammoniacai
gas were condensed     by  | of     cubic inch of distilled water
                                    a
ina    small glass tube over clean mercury.        This ammonia
cai solution was added to         aclear filtered solution of sub
silicated fluat of ammonia.       A precipitate of silex was im
mediately produced.       After several hours standing, this
precipitate was collected on       filter, well washed, and dried
                                    a
and heated to redness.         It was pure silex, and weighed
1*6 grains.     This experiment, like all the preceding, was
repeated, and the result confirmed.            In both instances
there was an excess of subsilicated fluat. The precipita
tions were made in    a platina vessel, and the solutions were
neither heated before or after the separation of the silex,
Calculating from this result, 100 parts of fluat of ammonia
seem to consist of       76'4 ammonia
                         23     fluoric acid

384                Account   of some  Experiments
spar with concentrated sulphuric acid. One part by weight
of fused boracic acid, two parts of fluor spar, and about
12 of sulphuric       acid, appear to be the proportions best
adapted for the purpose.          This method will require no
explanation when it is considered that boracic acid, as has
already been observed, precipitates silex from liquid sub-
silicated fluoric acid. If the heat is gentle, not nearly suf
ficient to occasion the ebullition of the sulphuric acid, and
the proportions just recommended are used, the retort will
not be injured, and pure fluoboracic acid gas will be pro
duced in abundance.        When the gas ceases to come over,
if the heat is raised, more will be evolved, and there will be
distilled over at the same time, a viscid fluid, which is a
compound of sulphuric acid and fluoboracic acid gas.
Now the operation should be stopped, if the object is to
obtain merely pure fluoboracic gas, a long continuation of
the heat producing some silicated fluoric.        Before quilting
the subject, it should be observed that the quantity of sul
phuric acid employed is of considerable consequence to the
success of the experiment.        If too much is used, there is a
great   loss   of gas  from   the  property which sulphuric acid
has of absorbing fluoboracic acid gas ; and if too little is
employed, it soon becomes diluted, and loses the power of
generating the gas, though it may still decompose the fluor
spar.     Both extremes, therefore, are to be avoided, and the
proportion of acid mentioned above, as far as my expe
rience goes, appears to be the best.
    I have endeavoured to ascertain the specific gravity of
fluoboracic gas.
        The flask exhausted weighed 1400*5 grains.
        Filled with common air      ....  1400*5 + 6*2
        Again    exhausted                1400 5
        Filled with pure acid gas . . . 1400*5 + 14*7-
    Thus it appears that 100 cubic inches of fluoboracic gas
are equal    to 73*5 grains.
    MM.     Gay Lussac and Thenard have described the com
 pound of this gas and water, a fuming fluid, in many re
 spects similar to concentrated sulphuric acid. Like this
 acid, I have observed that it possesses a slight degree of
 tenacity, so that it has an oily appearance when poured
from one vessel to another; and similar in another respect,
it possesses the property of charring animal and vegetable
substances, and which the French chemists observed be
 longing to the gas itself. I have found that water con
 denses more of this than it does of any other known gas,
 no less than 700 times its volume.         The experiment was
                                                             then

Water were introduced into a tube over mercury, and ihe
gas, in portions of 5 cubic inches at a lime, was added until
10U cubic inches had been absorbed, when the waier was
apparently saturated.          This acid was of the sp. grav. l-77«
    The property which sulphuric acid has of absorbing fluo-
boracic acid gas has already been noticed.                    I found that
i   cubic inch of sulphuric acid, of the specific gravity I "85,
condensed 25 cubic inches of the gas, or jO times it*
volume.        The compound acid was strongly fuming, and
appeared more tenacious than pure sulphuric acid, yet not
nearly so much so as that compound of the two which di
stils over during the latter part of the operation of making
Suoboracic gas.
     This latter compound has some peculiarities.                  It is so
tenacious that it flows very slowly.                    Jt appears to be
 far more volatile than pure sulphuric acid.                 When poured
into water, a dense white precipitate is formed, the txact
 nature of which I have not yet satisfactorily ascertained ;
 but which is not produced by the direct compound of sul
 phuric acid, and the fluoboracic.
 Sect. I V.     On the Combinations of Piuoloracic               Acid Gas
                         and Ammoniacal Gas.
     M. Gay Lussac has combined fluoboracic acid gas with
 ammonia.         He states, that equal volumes of the two gases
 condense each other*.           This I have found to be the case»
 and I have also found that fluoboracic acid gas condenses
 twice and even three times its volume of the volatile alkali.
 The compound observed by M. Gay Lussac is solid» white>
 and opake, like the ammoniacal salts. The combinations
  I have obtained are liquid, transparent, and colourless, like
 water, though they are entirely free from this fluid* They
 were made by the direct union of the two gases.                        Five
 cubic inches of ammoniacal gas were added to the same
  Volume of the fluoboracic gas contained in a small jar over
 dry mercury.        There was a complete condensation of both,
 and the solid salt was the result.              Five cubic inches more
 of ammonia were introduced. The whole was quickly
  absorbed, and the solid salt was converted into the trans
  parent fluid.      Five cubic inches more were added, which
  too were slowly absorbed, but without any change of
  form.
      The solid salt volatilizes in close vessels unaltered, on
  the application of a gentle heat.

 the Right Hon. Sir Joseph Banks in the chair.
     A letter from Sir H. Davy to the President was read.
     In this letter Sir H. Davy describes the properties of a
 new and very extraordinary detonating compound.
     It may be formed by exposing chlorine, or oxymuriatic
        to a weak solution of ammonia, of nitrate or of oxa*
 fjas,
   ate of ammonia.
     It appears in the form of a yellow oil, heavier than water.
 It appears to be composed of chlorine and nilrogene.          It
 detonates violently by a heat below that of boiling water,
 and even explodes hy a very gentle friction.
     It seems lo be bv far the most powerful1 explosive sub
 stance known. Sir H. Davy, in endeavouring to collect the
'products from the explosion of a small panicle not bigger
 than a grain of mustard seed, was severely wounded in the
 eye, and the vessel in which the experiment was made was
 broken into pieces.
     Sir H. Davy stated in his letter, that the first notice of
 the existence of such a substance was contained in a letter
 he received from a gentleman at Paris, but the manner of its
 preparation was not mentioned ; and though said to be dis
 covered a year ago, no reference to it      made in any of the

             PHILOSOPHICAL        SOCIETY OF LONDON.
   During this month the attention of the Society has been:
directed to two lectures on the subject of Light and Heat,
by Mr. W. Henley.
   As the ancient theories of light and caloric had under
gone so much discussion, and as other new ones had lately
been adopted and supported by several illustrious philoso
phers, it became an interesting subject for the investigation
of the Society.        In the lecture on Light Mr. H. gave a
very able analysis of the curious experiments of Mr. Ma-
lus, which confirmed his opinion of the polarity of light ;
and after the most impartial review, he felt perfectly satis
fied with the opinions of Sir Humphry Davy on this point.
   On the subject of Caloric he entered at much length,
and gave an abstract of the different theories, from that of
Zeno to those of the present time.             He dwelt more parti
cularly on the two theories maintained by the philosophers
of the present day, and his arguments were directed prin
cipally against the material theory ;  that which supposes
caloric to be a peculiar and subtle fluid, capable of pervad
ing, in a greater or lesser degree, every kind of matter, and
of counteracting, by its repulsive power, the attraction of
cohesion, an opinion adopted almost universally by the che
mists.     Mr. H. brought forward a number of facts which
it could not satisfactorily explain, but which favoured in the
most happy manner that hypothesis, which accounts fur the
phenomena of heated bodies, by supposing the particles of
matter to be endowed with a power of repulsion, and that
the effects of heat are only attributable to a rapid motion of
the minuter particles of matter, rather of a vibrating kind,
or of one round their own axis,  an opinion now warmly
supported by Sir H. Davy. The theory was supported by
the lecturer by a number of well chosen experiments, which,
though not 'able perhaps to carry conviction to the sup
porters of the material theory, are yet deserving of their
attention, as affording a proof of the impossibility of satis
factorily accounting tor all the phenomena of heat by one
¦ingle theory.

    Nov. 18. A    Paper " On    the Nature and certain Combi
 nations of a newly discovered Vegetable Acid," was read
 by M. Donovan, Esq.
    In examining the combinations of this acid, the auihor'i
 principal object was to point out the characteristics by
 which they may be distinguished from those of other acids.
 Distinctions so obvious as not to require particular notice,
exist between this and all other acids except the malic.
Even the latter, although having a resemblance in some in
 stances, isdistinguisable by several striking properties. The
following abstract, notwithstanding that it does not comprise
every particular difference, will sufficiently illustrate the
comparative properties of the two acids.

  This society held its first meeting of the present Session
on Friday, Nov. 6, 1812. rThe President in the Chair.
  Sundry presents of hooks and specimens were reported.
  A second letter from Ed. L. Irton, Esq. in answer to
some queries by the President, relative to the sand tubes
found at Drigg in Cumberland, was read, and thanks were
yoted for the same.
    From this it appears that the tubes have hitherto been
found only in a single hill of drift sand on the sea shore,
of the extent of about five acres. The entire form of the
tubes is not known, for they are discovered in consequence
of being laid bare by the drifting of the sand ; and the
same cause almost always breaks off and injures their upper
extremity.      The manner in which they terminate below is
still less known ; one of the tubes was exposed by hazardous
digging in running sand, to die depth of about fifteen feet,
 without the least appearance of its being about to terminate.
They he parallel to each other, and nearly vertical, but at
unequal distances ; the number must be very considerable,
 Mr. Irton having himself taken away, at different times,
 not less tha.n a hundred.     The tubes, when first dug out,
 are very flexible, but exposure to the air for a few seconds
 deprives them of this quality.      The unctuosity of the in
 ternal glazing of these tubes, when recently dug up, slated
 by Mr. Irton in his first letter, on the authority of an
 other person, appears on more accurate examination to be
 a mistake.

                                         in,

      The strata here described compose the rocks opposite to
  the Hotwell walks, and are further illustrated          by  two
  drawings      the one of the external face of the rocks, the
  other ofa ;                                        In clearing

  hotel, on Clifton downs, some interesting varieties of sul-

  covered with building and garden-grounds, there         islittle
  likelihood of its being soon again opened to the researches
  of the mineralogist.
   A     communication,    accompanied by three drawings in
  illustration from Dr. Mac Culloch, Mem. G. S. rtTative
   to a   remarkable interrupted vein in limestone, was read,
   and thanks were voted for the same.         This vein occurs
 in   a  millstone which was shipped from Limerick, and         is,
                                                                at

at present at the royal powder-mills        at Waltham Abbey.
The   stone itself is a dark blue siaiy limestone, containing
comminuted fragments of marine remains ; the vein by
which it is traversed    is whitish compact carbonate of lime.
This vein,    in  its present   state, consists of a number of
separate angular fragments, having somewhat of a general
parallelism, with such a correspondence at any two neigh
bouring extremities, as to render it a matter past doubt
that they have once formed a continuous vein.           To dis-'
place such a vein into its present position, it is necessary
to suppose that the*rock originally consisted of a series of
very thin strata, which being fissured across, formed a
space for the reception of the substance of the vein.       It is
evident from the angularity, and the irregularly serrated
edges of the displaced fragments, that the white calcareous
carbonate must have been perfectly indurated at the time
of its displacement ; yet, that the strata of the limestone
must have been in a state to admit of a series of shifts or
slides, each successively advancing with equal intervals
beyond the one preceding it : it is necessary also to sup
pose that the straia must have been in some condition
admitting them to adhere intimately together, either at
the period when the slides took place, or afterwards, from
the perfect obliteration of the seam.        By what theory can
these facts be explained?
      Friday, Nov. 20.  The President in the Chair.
   Mr. Dunston, having signed the obligation, was admitted
a member of the Society.

     A communication from Arthur Aikin, Esq. Secretary,
 entitled, « Some observations on a bed of greenstone near
 Walsall, Staffordshire^" was read, and thanks were voted
for the same.
    The greenstone, which is the subject of this paper, is of a
 dark blackish-blue      green colour ; has a glimmering lustre,
 and an uneven fracture, breaking into irregularly wedge-
 shaped    blunt-edged fragments: it is tough, acquiring a
 kind of polish under the hammer, is moderately hard, and
 rather heavy.     It strongly attracts the magnetic needle, and
 effeivesces op immersion in cold diluted muriatic acid.          It
 consists principally of felspar, mixed with- calcareous spar,
 with minute shining black grains of angite, and of horn
 blende. -It is penetrated by nearly vertical contemporaneous
 slender veins of calcareous spar, and alter a few weeks
 exposure to the air acquires a liver-brown colour, and falls
 to pieces.
     It occurs in the Independent Coal Formation, but is
 not co txiensive with that formation; nor, indeed, in the
 opinion of the author of the paper, is it to be considered as
 a true bed, but rather a lateral vein branching off from a
large dvke of greenstone that conies up to the surface,
 dividing the colliery in which the greenstone bed              is,
                                                              from
 ano. her adjacent to it.
     On comparing the strata above and below the greenstone
 with the very same strata that have been pierced through
 in  a   part of the colliery where the greenstone does not
 occur,    itappears, That the bed of slaty clay, with balls of
 ironstone lying upon the greenstone, does not materially
 differ from the same bed where the greenstone             absent
                                                           is            ;
 but that the beds immediately below the greenstone, present
very different characters where they are covered                by
                                                               this
latter, from what they do where the contrary          is the case.
These beds are 1. Sandstone; 2. Bituminous shale with
 slender seams of coal and 3.
                        ;          A   coal somewhat more than

   Count Laplace was the first to announce that the Im
perial Library possessed the Latin translation made by
Ammiratus Eugenius Siculus.          M. Humboldt having read
this translation, communicated           to M. Delambre, who
                                            it
made an extract from         too copiou« to be inserted here at
                            it
length, and which he read to the Class on the ?ih of Octo
ber. This work, the first book of which was wanting in
the Arabic MS. from which Ammiratus translated, con
tains abundance of obscure metaphysics, physical explana
tions which are little better, an erroneous svstem on Vision,
which we find more amply detailed in the Optics of Euclid,
and in Cleomcdes, some true theorems, but demonstrated in
a  long and tedious manner.         A more careful translation
would add absolutely nothing to our present stoek of know
ledge.    But the errors even of Ptolemy are not without in
terest to the history of science: an extract from           few ofa
its pages will satisfy our curiosity       this respect
                                             in            but not
                                                                 :
withstanding these imperfections, the work in question con
tains two very remarkable articles.
    In the first, Ptolemy gives      very precise and complete
                                        a
account of the effects of astronomical refraction.          He po
sitively asserts that these effects are the more considerable
the nearer the star         to the horizon
                           is                  that the refraction
                                                   ;
constantly brings the star to the zenith        that
                                                   ;    diminishes
                                                            it
 in appearance the parallel of the described star, because            it
generally diminishes its polar distance, except however
 when tbe star passes the meridian between the zenith and
 the pole, because then by drawing the star to the zenith             it
 removes     itfrom the pole: thus, its parallel          this case
                                                             in
 ought to increase; but then the effect            insensible, be
                                                       is
 cause the star      too close to the zenith.
                    is                            In this respect,
 therefore, Ptolemy was further advanced than Tycho Brahe,
 Kepler, Hevelius, and all the astronomers to the time of
 Cassiui, who was the first among the moderns to ascertain
                                                               that

394                    Natural Histoty.
that refraction     did not cease entirely but at the zenith.
To conclude   :   Ptolemy contents himself with vaguely point
ing out in what way wc may determine the quantity of re
fraction ; but he gives no part of it.     We were hitherto
far from supposing that Ptolemy entertained so expansive
and accurate ideas, more especially as there is not a single
passage in the whole Almagistus which speaks of refraction,
and that it was by a false interpretation that in two places
a vague idea was supposed to have been conveyed of their
principal effects.
   But it is still more curious, that Ptolemvknew as well as
the moderns the refraction which the light undergoes in
passing from the air into water or into glass, and gives
tables for all the angles of incidence fron 10 to 100°.     He
even points out the method of constructing        these tables
from observation ; and he sees that the angles broken off
do not decrease in the same ratio with the angles of inci
dence.    He had no idea of comparing the sines or the
chords of the double arcs j but from these tables we may
easily deduce the relation of the sines ; and what proves
that these observations were accurately made,         that M.
                                                    is,
Delambre has determined that they differ very little from
those which were found     by  Newton.
    The calculations     of Ptolemy are     4
                                            :   3,05656    and
3:  2,0098;   those of Newton are  4
                                   :  299432 and   3
                                                   :
                                                   t  ,93408     ;
this small difference may arise from Newton's using rain
water in his experiments  ;   whereas Ptolemy may have used
common water; and perhaps also the common glass used
by  Newton had not the same density with the purest glass
of the ancients.

two centaurs, who are seen forcibly carrying away the vir
gin, and the youth her lover. The latter subject is more
difficult of divination ; and the suggestion of its being the
abovementioned, arises only from the persons of Antiope
and Theseus being very conspicuous in the groupe.         The
whole formed the frize of the interior of the Cella, which
was of the Ionic order, and the relievo is even higher than
that of the temple of Theseus.      The opinion of its being
the work of Phidias, independently of the style of sculp
ture, is also strengthened by the circumstance of the temple
being built by Ictinus, who generally gave the preference to
the above sculptor.

    1.  " An  account of the origin, appearance or formation
of aerolites, either ancient or modern, but founded upon ri
gorous principles, and upon conclusions from incontro
vertible facts, and which will consequently agree with the
various atmospherical phasnomena which precede, accom

                       THE NEW COMET.
     Extract from a Paper read to the French Institute,
                Aug. 31, 1812. by M. Aicolet.
    " A new comet was discovered on the 20th of July, by
 M. Pons, at Marseilles, and on the 1st of August follow
 ing by M. Bouvard at Paris.         M. Bouvard and myself
 calculated that the comet would come nearest in contact
 with the sun on the 15th of September, 92'. 27". mean
 time, reckoned from the midnight of Paris.
    "  The distance from the earth to the sun being taken aa
 unity, that of the comet in its perihelion will ba 0,77)835.

     " The   motion of the comet is direct : in addition to its-
slow motion, it affords a remarkable uniformity in longitude
and latitude ; and these two circumstances have reudered
the calculations more difficult of execution.
     "It approaches the earth very slowly.          There are some
days when we know its place in the heavens, and when the
absence of the moon admits of our observing               on which    it,

from being so luminous as the comet of last year. But this
is of little consequence to astronomers, who do not found
their observations upon the fugitive characters which attend
these phenomena.           The comet in question was at first seen
and calculated upon without             tail, and might have dis

astronomers.         If they now pursue its progress until it
disappears,      itwill only be to perfect its elements, and to
ascertain     iftheir series of observations furnishes any index
on the subject of its revolution."
    A private letter from the environs of Mount Caucasus
conveys the following intelligence:                    "It
                                             has been long
known that the rich inhabitants and invalids of Russia used
to frequent the hot springs of Caucasus, and that they were
in great repute. They suddenly disappeared in the month
of March last, and re-appeared in April upon the ridge of
the mountain, but in much greater quantity, and much
hotter than before    but not
                           ;    drop was to be found
                                         a              the                     in

                   the former buildings.  The springs dis
appeared    without any earthquake or other perceptible
phenomenon.       New bath-houses have been hastily con

1)ear     Sir,    If    you deem the following Description          of
the Marine Transit worthy of insertion in The Philosophical
Magazine^ it is much at your service.
                        I remain, dear sir,
                                    Yours very truly,
 12, Great Castle Street, Cavendish Square,       VVm. CHAVASSE.
                 Dec. 10, 1812.
                           The Marine Transit.
    The Marine Transit           is intended for the  same    purposes
at sea, as the     Transit Telescope on land,     to afford the means
of obtaining       a daily correction or adjustment of our time
keepers, whereby the longitude, or a ship's position, with
respect to a particular meridian, may be ascertained, and
many useful problems relating to astronomy satisfactorily
6olved. Should this instrument answer the end proposed,
the public will be indebted to the Right Honourable the
Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, and the Honour
able the Court of Directors of the East India Company, for
their fostering care in extending to me the means and pa
tronage necessary to insure the trial of it under the most
favourable circumstances.
    At the beginning of the present year, an outline of the
plan was submitted to the Right Honourable the Lords of
the Admiralty, when they were pleased to order 'that two               ^
instruments should be made under my superintendence.
I have now the pleasure to announce that the same have
been completed by that most competent workman, Mr.
Thomas Jones, of Oxendon-street,              London ; and that we
are employed adjusting their rates of going, previous to
such a course of experiments on shore, as will determine
the propriety of taking them to sea.
    The principle on which the instrument is constructed is
simple, and promises, if there be no improper assumption
in the premises, or mistake in the reasoning, to be effica
cious.     The principle in few words is this : that equal
quantities of mercury will pass through a given aperture
in equal times, if the same height of column, reckoned
    Vol. 40. No. 176. Dec. 1812.                      Cc         from'

    from the discharging aperture, can be uniformly maintained,
    provided that changes of temperature have no effect on the
     result ; or, if they have, that the quantity of the deviation
    may be estimated, and added or subtracted as the case may
    require.
        A drawing, with a brief description, will best explain the
    construction of the instrument, and the way in which it is
    proposed to apply to practice the principle that has just
    been stated.     (See Plate X.)
        The figure is a perspective representation of the Marine
    Transit, No. 1, complete, and pendent from the deck of
   the ship.     The iron magazine AA, containing a sufficiently
   abundant but an indefinite quantity of pure mercury, is
   arranged, like the steering compass, to swing in gimbals,
   so that the parts attached to it may at all times preserve a
   vertical position.     7'he regulator B, the graduated tube C,
   and the gauge D, are of glass, connected by iron joints ppp,
   and further strengthened by brass supporters       iiii: jointed
   brass rods fh^j'h, by which the globe E swings, are also
   fastened to the magazine.         The waste pipe nnn, and the
  other tubes mmm, ooo, are made of the elastic gum, which
  has been found to be impenetrable to air.
       In the bottom of the magazine, at the joint p, there is
                                 j
  an aperture communicating with the conduit k ; it is rather
  larger than the aperture          in the regulator B ; and as the
  waste pipe continually carries off the excess of its volume,
                                           j
  there will be always the same depth of mercury maintained
 hi B to regulate the issue through          into the gauge D.
       Experience will determine the most suitable substance
  for mercury to run through.          Trial will be made of ruby,
  which it is apprehended has neither affinity to mercury, nor
 will be liable to any sensible influence from temperature
 or friction. By the elevation or depression of the hollow
 screws in which the apertures are fixed, they receive their
 necessary adjustments; the lower one /being set to fill the
 gauge D in 24 hours, when the gauge and its contents are
 at the temperature of 62°.
      As it may be assumed that mercury expands uniformly
 throughout the small range of temperature, to which the
 interior of a ship is ever exposed ; (supposing this range to
be from 20° to 110°,) tables for immediate use have been
 calculated on this principle, from data obligingly supplied
by Mr. John Dalton, of Manchester, to show the contents,
and, consequently, the corresponding value in time of the
           D, at every tenth of a degree of the thermometer,
    'his minute temperature is indicated by the thermometer Mt
fauge
                                                             which

                 Description of the Mdrtne Transit.    <      404
which     has been graduated      according to Fahrenheit, and
in made    to resemble, as much as possible, the gauge D, in
every circumstance which might affect its result : ihe scale
is great, being about | of an inch to a degree, which again
is divided into tenths ; and the bulb is kept immersed in a
body of mercury, contained in the bottom of the glass case,
which is to be closed at the same time as the machine, and
like it to be well secured from the intrusion of t|ie external
atmosphere.        In the drawing but little of this thermometer
can be seen.
    Much of    the accuracy of the machine will depehd on the
tube    C, which communicates with the regulator and the
gauge.      It is about six inches in length, of considerable
       j
thickness, and its interior capacity such, that the volume
from      is nearly three minutes in filling it.     On its front
there are marked small segments of circles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
 7, 8 ; directly on the opposite side there are as many other
segments, corresponding with the same, each to each. The
Sight of the observer must be directed so, that by the re
flection of the glass, two corresponding segments appear a
perfect circle.     When the transit of the rising column of
mercury interrupts this circle, the instant shown by a se
cond watch is written down by an assistant, in the same
way as is usual in taking celestial altitudes or distances.
This transit of the column of mercury can be observed to
the fraction of a second of time.
    The cocks y and z, are both air and mercury tight, and
are so connected by the parallel bars, that the one cannot
move independently of the other. When the ivory handle         N
is up, as represented in the drawing, the lower cock z it
shut, and y is open.          By putting the handle down, y
 Closes, and z opens ; by which simple movement, having
previously lowered the elastic tube from the hook IV, the
 mercury in the gauge D, discharges itself into the globe E,
 from whence it is restored to the magazine A A, by drawing
a rope fastened to the ring R, and passing through a pulley
 fixed above in the deck.       In this operation the globe Et
 attached to the rods /;/(, ascends, forming a circular sweep,
and carrying with it the rods hh, which turn upon their
joints  Jf.      When the globe E has been raised in this
manner to the necessary height, the mercury runs from
it into the magazine AA, through the pipe ooo; which of
course is the-n elevated.      The globe E being emptied, it
must be let gradually down again to its place.           A couple
of prongs s and /, attached to the framing at the bottom of
 the gauge D, embrace the rods by which it is hung,, and
                             CcS                             lock

 404            Description  of the Marine Transit.
 lock it securely  ; so that while locked it can have no mo
 tion independent of the machine.
     The bent tube in the regulator B is an air pipe, for the
 purpose of maintaining a free circulation of the air con
 tained in the apparatus, whether atmospheric or any other;
 should it be found expedient to close the machine without
 adopting the Torricellian vacuum.       A simitar tube is fixed
in the magazine, and for the same purpose.
     With this knowledge of the several parts, the following
will be sufficient instructions for conducting the operation
 on ship board.
     On leaving a known meridian, unhook the tube m mm,
and put down the ivory handle N. While the mercury is
running out of the gauge into the globe, be careful to
compare, with the time of the day, the instants of tire
transit of the rising column of mercury over the segments
 J , 2, 3, 4, &c. Having recorded these observations, and
the gauge being perfectly empty, put up the ivory handle,
raise the globe E, and let the mercury that is in it run into
the magazine AA.
     On the morrow when the gauge is full, and the mercury
has appeared rising above the cock y, put down the han
dle iVto cut off the communication, and unhook the elastic
tube as before. Now carefully observe again the column's
transit over the segments 1, S, 3, fcc. ; and together with
these observations write down the height of the large ther
mometer M. The gauge being empty, put up the ivory
handle, and restore the mercury in the globe E to the ma
gazine AA. By reference to the tables showing the capa
city of the gauge at every tenth of a degree, find against
the temperature, which was noted down, the time that has
elapsed since the last operation ; which, compared with the
ship's time, gives the longitude sought, or the ship's de
parture from the meridian of the preceding day.          Record
this time in your book of reckoning, and proceed from day
to day in the same manner.
     If the operator should be too late, and find the graduated
tube C filled, he will have lost the opportunity of observing
ture   j
bis time- for that day.     The chamber G, which the aper
         would be about an hour and a half filling, will se
cure the instrument from going down ; .if, in allusion to a
watch, I may be permitted the expression.          On such an
occasion it will toe only requisite to unhook the tube, put
down the ivory handle, and register the time found in the
                                                                 "
tables to correspond with the height of the large thermome-

                                                        handle,

                           [Continued     from vol. ixxvii. page 452  ]
 In   the Croonian Lecture for the year 1810,          gave an ac      I
count of some experiments, which led me to conclude that
the production of animal heat         very much under the in
                                                      is
fluence of the nervous system.      Some circumstances which
I  have since met with, illustrate this subject, and seem to
                                                           *
confirm the truth of my former conclusions.                                         i

                                          is          of     poison             a
that operates              by
                   disturbing the functions of the brain, in
proportion as the sensibility becomes impaired, so               the                is
power of generating beat impaired also.
      If
       an animal     apparently dead from
                             is                    poison of this a
description, and the circulation of the blood           afterwards         is
maintained       means of artificial respiration, the generation

   Under these circumstances,        the artificial respiration

kept up until the effects of the poison cease, as the animal
recovers his sensibility, so does he also recover the power
of generating heat     but       not till the nervous energy

each expiration ; and hence I was lrd to believe, that the
respiratory function was performed nearly as under ordinary
circumstances, and that the usual chemical changes were
produced on the blood.       It appeared, however, desirable to
obtain some more accurate knowledge on this point, and
I  have therefoie instituted a series of experiments, for the
purpose of ascertaining the relative quantities of air con
sumed in breathing, by animals in a natural state, and by
animals in which the brain has ceased to perform its office,
and I now have the honour of communicating an account
of these experiments to the Society.
    It has been shown, by Messrs. Allen and Pepys, first,
that every cubic inch of carbonic acid requires exactly a
cuhic inch of oxygen gas for its formation* ; secondly, that
when respiration is performed by a warm-blooded animal
in atmospheric air, the azote remains unaltered, and the
carbonic acid exactly equals, volume for volume, the oxygen,
gas which disappearsf.
    There is therefore reason to believe, that the watery va
pour, which escapes with the air in expiration, is not
formed from the union of hydrogen with oxygen in the
lungs, but that it is exhaled from the mucous membrane
of the mouth and pharynx, resembling the watery exhala
tion which takes place from the peritonaeum, or any other
internal surface when exposed; and this conclusion appears
to be fully confirmed by the experiments of M. Magendi*,
lately communicated to the National Institute of Pans.
    These circumstances are of importance in the present
communication,      which they render more simple, as they
8how, that in order to ascertain the changes produced on
the air in respiration, it is only necessarv to find the quan
tity of carbonic acid given out from the lungs. This be
comes an exact measure of the oxygen consumed, and the
azote of the air and the watery vapour expired need not be
 taken into the account.
    For the purpose of examining the changes produced on
the air, by animals breathing under the different circum
 stances above mentioned, I contrived the apparatus which
is represented in the annexed Plate.

the bell-glass is an opening, admitting a tube connected

E connected with it.
     F. Is a silver tube, of which one end is adapted to receive
the tube of the stop-cock E, while the other extremity,
making a right angle with the rest of the tube, passes
through a hole in the wooden siand, and projects into the
cavity of the bell-glass, where it makes a second turn also
at a right angle, and becomes of a smaller diameter.      In the
upright part     of the tube  is an opening G.
     The tubes are made perfectly air-tight, where connected
with each other, and with the rest of the apparatus, and
the circular groove is filled with quicksilver.
     The capacity of the bell-glass, allowance being made for
the rim, which is received in the groove with the quick
 silver, is found to be 502 cubic iucbes. The capacity of
 the gum-bottle is 52 cubic inches, and in the calculation*
 after the experiments two cubic inches have been allowed
 for the air contained in the different tubes, and for the
 small remains of air in the bladder after being nearly
emptied by pressure.
                    Mode   of using  the Apparatus.
     In order to ascertain the quantity of air consumed under
 ordinary circumstances, the animal was placed on the stand
 under the bell-glass, the bladder being emptied by pressure,
 and the gum-bottle being distended with atmospheric air.
 During the experiment, by pressing occasionally on the
 gum bottle, the air was forced from it into the bell-glass.
 On removing the pressure, the gum-bottle became filled by
 its own elasticity with air from the bell glass. Thus the
 air was kept in a state of agitation, and the dilatation of the
 bladder prevented the air being forced through the quick
 silver under the edge of the bell-glass.      At the end of the
  experiment, the gum-bottle was completely emptied by
  pressure, and allowed to be again filled with air from the
 bell-glass ; this was repeated two or three times, and the air
  in the bottle was then preserved for examination.          The
  proportion of carbonic acid being ascertained, and the
  capacities of the different parts of the apparatus, and the
  space occupied by the animal being known, the total quan
  tity of carbonic acid formed, and consequently of oxygen
  consumed, was easily estimated.
       When the experiment was made on an animal in whom
                                  c4                          the

408              On the Influence    of the Brain
the functions of the brain were destroyed, and in whom
therefore voluntary respiration had ceased, the narrow ex
tremity of the tube was inserted into an artificial opening
in the trachea, and the animal being placed under the belU
glass, the lungs were inflated at regular intervals, by means
of pressure made on the gum-bottle.              The tube being
smaller than the trachea, the greater portion of the air in
expiration escaped by the side of the tube into the general
cavity of the bell-glass, while the gum-bottle filled itself
by its own elasticity with air through the opening G. At
the end of the experiment, a portion of air was preserved
for examination, and the quantity of carbonic acid was esti
mated in the way already described.
    The animals employed in these experiments were of the
same species,      and nearly of the same size.        Attention
 to these circumstances was judged necessary, that the re
sults might be as conclusive as possible.           The chemical
examination of the air was made by agitating it in a gra
duated measure over quicksilver, with a watery solution of
 potash.    My friend Mr. Brande gave me his assistance in
this part of the present investigation, as he had done on
many former occasions.         It will be observed, that in esti
mating the proportion of carbonic acid, no allowance has
been made for that contained in the atmospheric air; first,
 because the quantity is so small that the omission can oc
 casion no material error ; and secondly, because the object
is to ascertain, not so much the absolute as the relative
 quantities of carbonic acid evolved by animals breathing
 under different circumstances.
    The experiments which I shall first notice, were made
 on the respiration of animals in a natural state.
    Experiment I.  Thermometer 653. barometer not noted.
    A young rabbit was allowed to remain under the bell-
 glass during 30 minutes.        The respired air at the end of
 this time was found to contain -±0- of carbonic acid.
    It was ascertained that the rabbit occupied the space of
 50 cubic inches.
    The capacity of the bell-glass = 502 cubic inches.
    That of the gum-bottle 52 cubic inches.
    The air in the tubes and bladder = 2 cubic inches.

 The rabbit therVforc in 30 minutes gave out 25-3 cubic
 inches of carbonic acid, and consumed the same quantity of
 oxvgen gas, which is at the rate of 50-G in an hour.
    Experiment 2. Thermometer 65°, barometer 30 1 inch.

    A somewhat smaller rabbit was allowed to remain under
the bell-glass during 30 minutes.           The respired air con
tained      of carbonic acid. The animal occupied the space
of 48 cubic inches.

cubic inches in half an hour, which is at the rate of 56 44
cubic inches in an hour.
    Experiment 3.  Thermometer 64°, barometer 30 2 inch.
    A young rabbit, occupying the space of 48 cubic inches,
was     allowed to remain under the bell-glass during the
ame period as in the two former instances.            The respired
air contained         of carbonic acid.

The results of this were therefore precisely the same as
 those of the last experiment.
    These experiments wire made with great care.               The
 animals did not appear to suffer any inconvenience from
 their confinement, and their temperature was unaltered.
    The next order of experiments were made for the pur
 pose of ascertaining the quantity of air consumed by ani
 mals in which the circulation of the blood was kept up by
 means of artificial respiration, after the brain had ceased to
 perform its lunctions.
     Experiment 4.  Thermometer 65°, barometer not noted.
     Having procured two rabbits of the same size and colour,
 I divided the spinal marrow in the upper part of the neck of
 one of them.        An opening was made in the trachea, and
 the lungs wese inflated at first by means of a small pair of
 bellows.     Two ligatures were passed round the neck, one
 in the upper and the other in the lower part, behind the
 trachea.     The ligatures were drawn tight, including every
 thing    but  the trachea ; and the nerves, vessels, and other
  soft parts between         them were divided with a bistoury.
 Eight minutes after the division of the spinal marrow, the
 thermometer in the rectum had sunk to 97°. The animal
 was placed under a bell-glass, and the lungs were 'inflated
 by pressing on the gum oottle about 50 times in a minute.
  When this process had been continued for 30 minutes, a
  portion <>f air was preserved for examination.          The heart
  was found acting regularly, but slowly, the thermometer in
  the rectum had fallen to go0.
     The second rabbit was killed by dividing the spinal mar
                                                                 row

time was noted when the thermometer in the rectum had

that it might be as nearly as possible under the same cir
cumstances with the first rabbit. At the end of 30 minutes
the thermometer in the rectum had fallen from 97 to 91*.
    The air respired by the first rabbit contained                    of car
bonic acid.        The bulk of the rabbit was found = 50 cubic
inches.

20*24 cubic inches of carbonic acid were therefore extri
 cated in 30 minutes,           which is at the rate of 40-48 cubic
inches in an hour.
    The carbonic acid given out in the same space of time
 was less than in the former experiments ; but it is to be
 observed, first, that in consequence of the ligatures the ex
 tent of the circulation was diminished ; secondly, that in thi*
 instance one of the ligatures accidentally slipped, and an
 ounce of blood was lost in the beginning of the experiment.
     As it was desirable to avoid any circumstances which,
 might occasion a difference in the results, in the subsequent
 experiments I employed animals which had been inoculated
 with the poison of woorara, or the essential oil of almonds ;
 by which means, while the functions of the brain were
 completely destroyed, the extent of the circulation was un
 diminished, and all chance of accidental haemorrhage                      was
 avoided.
     Experiment 5. Thermometer 65°, barometer 29*8 inch.
     Two rabbits were procured, each occupying the space of
 45 cubic inches.           They were both inoculated with the
  woorara poison.
  '
     The first rabbit was apparently dead in nine minutes after
  the application of the poison ; but the heart continued to
  act.   The lungs were inflated for about two minutes, by
  means of a pair of bellows, when the thermometer in the
  rectum was observed to stand at 9S°.                    The animal was
  placed under the bell-glass, and artificial respiration was
  produced by means of pressure on ihe gum-bottle, as in the
  last experiment.       At the end of 30 minutes, a portion of

  heat longer than the superficial.

rectum had fallen to 98°, and he was placed under           a   bell-

 action was kept up for 30 minutes longer by means of arti
 ficial breathing, when the thermometer had fallen to 76°.
 The carbonic acid evolved during these last 30 minutes
  amounted to nearly 13 cubic inches'.
     From the precautions with which these experiments were
 made, I am induced to hope that there can be no material
 error in their results. They appear to warrant the con
 clusion, that in an animal in which the brain has ceased to
 exercise its functions, although respiration continues to be
 performed, and ihe circulation of the blood is kept up to
 the natural standard, although the usual changes in the
 sensible qualities of the blood take place in the two capil
 lary systems, and the same qtiantity of carbonic acid is
 formed as under ordinary circumstances ; no heat is gene
 rated, and (in consequence of the cold air thrown into the
lungs) the animal cools more rapidly than one which is
actually dead.
     It is a circumstance deserving of notice, that so large a
quantity of air should be consumed by the blood passing
through the lungs, when the functions of the brain, and
those of the organs dependent on              it,
                                            are suspended.   Per
haps   it   is not unreasonable to suppose, that by pursuing
this line of investigation we may be enabled to arrive at
some more precise Knowledge respecting the nature of re
spiration, and the purposes which          answers in the animal

present communication to enter into any speculations on
this subject, and     Ishall therefore.only remark, that the in
fluence of the nervous system does not appear to be neces
sary to the production of the chemical changes which the
blood undergoes in consequence of exposure to the air in
the lungs*.
                                                                       The
  * This   conclusion isdirectly contrary to that deduced by M. Dupuytren,
from a scries of curious experiments, made with     a  view to ascertain the
effects which follow the division of Uie nerves of the par vagum, and  it   is
an object of some importance in the present investigation,   to ascertain in
                                                                        what

                   on ike Generation      of sinvnal Heat.                413
    The facts now, as well as those formerly adduced, go far
towards proving, that the temperature                    of warm-blooded
animals is considerably under the influence of the nervous
¦ystem ; but what is the nature of the connection between
them ? whether is the brain directly or indirectly necessary
to the production of heat ? these are questions to which
no answers can be given, except such as are purely hypo
thetical.        At present we must be content with the know
ledge     of   the  insulated fact : future observations may, per
haps, enable us to refer it to some more general principle.
     We have evidence, that when the brain ceases to exer
cise its functions, although those of the heart and lungs
continue to be performed, the animal loses the power of
generating heat.            It would, however, be absurd to argue
From this fact, that the chemical changes of the blood in
the lungs are in no way necessary to the production of
 heat, since we know of no instance in which it continues
 to take place after respiration has ceased.
     It must be owned, that this part of physiology still pre
 sents an ample field for investigation.
     Of opinions sanctioned by the names of Black, Laplace,
 Lavoisier, and Crawford, it is proper to speak with caution
 and respect ; but without trespassing on these feelings, I
 what manner the apparently opposite facts, observed by M. Dupuytren and
 myself, are to be reconciled with each other.
    It was observed by this physiologist, that in an animal, in which both the
 nerves of the par vagum are divided, the blood returned from the lungs has
 a darker colour than natural, and that the animals, on whom this operation
 is performed, die sooner or later with symptoms of asphyxia, notwith
  standing the air continues to enter the lungs ; and hence he concludes, that
 the changes which are produced on the blood in respiration are not the re
 mit of a mere chemical process, but are dependent on the nervous influence,
 and cease to take place when the communication between the lungs and
 the brain is destroyed.
     M. Provencal, in prosecuting this inquiry, ascertained that the animals
  subjected
  '
              to this experiment give out less carbonic acid than before.
     M. Blainville observed, that the frequency of the inspirations is much
 diminished; and M. Dumas restored the scarlet colour of the arterial blood
  by artificially inflating the lungs, and from these and other circumstance*
  be has arrived at conclusions very different from those of M. Dupuytren.
     My own observations exactly correspond with those of MM. Dumas and
  Blainville.    After the nerves of the par vagum are divided, a less quantity
  of carbonic acid is evolved, the inspirations are much diminished in fre
  quency, and the blood in the arteries of the general system assumes a darker
  hue ; but its natural colour may be restored by artificially inflating the
  lungs, so as to furnish a greater supply of air to the blood circulating
  through them.
     We may suppose that, on the division of these nerves, the sensibility of
  the lungs is either extremely impaired, or altogether destroyed, so that the
  animal does not feel the same desire to draw in fresh air : in consequence
  his inspirations become less frequent than natural, and hence arise the phx-
  aemcna produced by this operation,
                                                                          may

 414              On the Influence  of the Brain
 may be allowed to say, that it does not appear to me that
 any of the theories hitherto proposed afford a very satisfac
 tory explanation of the source of animal heat.
     Where so many and such various chemical processes are
 going on, as in the living body, are we justified in selecting
 any one of these for the purpose of explaining the pro
 duction of heat ?
     To the original theory of Dr. Black there is this unan
 swerable objection, that the temperature of the lungs is not
 greater than that of the rest of the system.      To this ob
jection the ingenious and beautiful theory of Dr. Craw
 ford is not open ; but still it is founded on the same basis
 with that of Dr. Black, *' the conversion of oxygen into
 carbonic acid in the lungs ;" and hence it appears to be
 difficult to reconcile either of them with the results of the
 experiments which have been related.
     It may perhaps be urged, that as in these experiments
 the secretions had nearly if not entirely ceased, it is pro
 bable that the other changes which take place in the ca
 pillary vessels had ceased also ; and that, although the
 action of the air on the blood might have been the same
 as under ordinary circumstances,        there might not have
 been the same alteration in the specific heat of this fluidj
 as it flowed from the arteries into the veins.    But on this
 supposition, if the theory of Dr. Crawford be admitted as
correct, there must have been a gradual but enormous ac
cumulation of latent heat in the blood, which we cannot
suppose to have taken place without its nature having been
entirely altered.    If the blood undergoes the usual change
in the capillary system of the pulmonary, it is probable
that it must undergo the usual change in the capillary sy
stem of the greater circulation also, since these changes are
obviously dependent on and connected with each other.
The blood in the aorta and pulmonary veins was not more
florid, and that in the vena cava and pulmonary artery was
not less dark-coloured, than under ordinary circumstances.
We may moreover remark, that the most copious secretions
in the whole body are those of the insensible perspiration
from the skin, and of the watery vapour from the mouth and
fauces, and the effect of these must be to lower rather than
to raise the animal temperature.          Under other circum
stances also the diminution of the secretions is not observed
to be attended with a diminution of heat.         On the con
trary, in the hot fit of a fever, when the scanty dark-co
loured urine, dry skin and parched mouth indicate that
scarcely any secretions are taking place, the temperature of

               on the Generat ion       of Animal Heat.            41 A
the body is raised above the natural standard, to which it
falls when the constitution returns to its natural state, and
the secretions are restored.
    It has been observed, by a distinguished chemist, that
"   the experiments to determine the specific heat of the
blood are of so very delicate a nature, that it is difficult to
receive them with perfect confidence*."                The experiments
of Dr. Crawford for this purpose were necessarily made on
 blood out of the body, and at rest.              Now, when blood is
 taken from the vessels, it immediately undergoes a remark
able chemical change, separating into a solid and a fluid
 part. This separation is not complete for some time ; but
 whoever takes the pains to make observations on the sub
 ject, can hardly doubt that it begins to take place imme
 diately on the blood being drawn.                Can experiments on
 the blood, under these circumstances, lead to any very sa
 tisfactory conclusions, respecting the specific heat of blood
 circulating in the vessels of the body ? The diluting the
 blood with large quantities of water, as proposed by Dr.
 Crawford, does not altogether remove the objection ; for
 this only retards, it does not prevent coagulation ; and some
 time must, at any rate, elapse, while the blood is flowing
 and the quantity is being measured, during which the se
 paration of its solid and fluid parts will have begun to take
 place.
     More might be said on this subject ; but I feel anxious to
  avoid, as much aa possible, controversial discussion.             It is
 my wish not to advance opinions, but simply to state some
  facts which I have met with in the course of my physiolo
  gical investigations.        These facts, 1 am willing to hope,
  possess   some  value  ;  and   they may perhaps lead to the de
  velopment of other facts of much greater importance.
  Physiology is yet in its infant state.            It embraces a great
  number and variety of phaenomena, and of these it is very
  difficult to obtain an accurate and satisfactory knowledge ;
  but it is not unreasonable to expect, that by the successive
  labours of individuals, and the faithful register of their
  observations, it may at last be enabled to assume the form
  of a more perfect science.

LXXI V.       On stone Combinations of Phosphorus a?id of Sul
     phur, and on some other Subjects of Chemical Inquiry.
     By Sir Humphry Davy, Knt.                LL.D.     Sec. R.S*
                              INTRODUCTION.
    n  this paper, T shall do myself the honour of laying be
 fore the Society the results of some experiments on phos
 phorus and sulphur, which establish the existence of some
 new compounds, and which offer decided evidences in fa
 vour of an idea that has been for some time prevalent
 amongst many enlightened chemists, and which I have de
 fended* in former papers published in the Philosophical
 Transactions ; namely, that bodies unite in definite pro-
 |x>nions, and that there is a relation between the quantities
 in' which the same element unites with different elements.
     I shall not enter into a minute detail of the methods of
 experimenting that I employed ; I shall confine myself to
 general sta'enieiiis of the facts.         The common manipula-
 i ions of chemistry       are now too well known to require any
 new illustrations : and to dwell upon familiar operations
 would be to occupy unnecessarily and tediously the time of
 this learned body.
             2.  Of  some Combinations        of Phosphorus.
     In a paper read before the Royal Society in 1810, have      I
 described the mutual action of phosphorus and oxymuriatic
 gas, or chlorine.       I have noticed two compounds which
 appear to be distinct and peculiar bodies, formed by the
 union of the gas and the inflammable substance. One is
                     From Pliilos. Tram, for
                                              1812, part ii.
 Vol.40. No.      176.   Dec. 1813-                  D d           solid,

418                 On some Comlbiatlons   of
solid, white, and crystalline in its appearance; easily vola
tile, and capable of forming a fixed infusible substance by
uniting with ammonia.       The other is fluid, limpid as wa
ter, and, as I have since found, of specific gravity 1-45; it
produces dense fumes by acting upon the water of the at
mosphere, and when exposed to the atmosphere gradually
disappears, leaving no residuum.
    The composition of the white sublimate is very easily as
certained by synthetical experiments, such as I have de
scribed on a former occasion in the Transactions.       By em
ploying chlorine dried by muriate of lime, in great excess,
and making the experiments in exhausted vessels, and ad
mitting solution of chlorine to ascertain the quantity of
gas absorbed, 1 have ascertained that three grains of phos
phorus unite with about 20 grains of chlorine to form the
sublimate.
    If the phosphorus be in great excess in* the experiment
of its combustion in chlorine, some of the liquor is formed
with the sublimate; but to obtain it in considerable quan
tities, phosphorus should be passed in vapour through
heated powdered corrosive sublimate.        A bent glass tube
may be used for the process, and the liquor condensed in
a cold vessel connected with the tube.
    I have not been able to determine its composition by
synthetical experiments ; but by pouring it gradually into
water, suffering the water to become cool after each addi
tion of the liquor, and then precipitating the solution by
solution of nitrate of silver, I have ascertained the quantity
of chlorine and of phosphorus it contains.         13*6 grains,
treated in this way, afforded 43 grains of horn silver.
    It is evident from this analysis, compared with the result
of the synthetical experiments on the sublimate, that, the
quantity of phosphorus being the same, the sublimate con
tains double as much chlorine as the liquor.
    When phosphorus is heated in the liquor, a portion if
 dissolved, and it then when exposed to the atmosphere
 leaves a film of phosphorus,      which when the liquor is
 thrown on paper usually inflames : a substance of this kind
 was first procured by MM. Gay Lussac and Theuard, by
distilling phosphorus and calomel together; and it may be
produced iii the experiment with corrosive sublimate, if
sufficient heat be used to sublime the phosphorus, or if
 there be not an excess of the corrosive sublimate.      I have
 made no experiments in order to ascertain the quantity of
 phosphorus the liquor will dissolve.
    When tbe white sublimate is made to act upon water, it
                                                       dissolves

 dissolves in      it,producing much heat.             The solution evapo
 rated affords      a   thick liquid, which               solution of punt
                                                                is   a
  phosphoric acid, or hydrat of phosphoric acid.                                          fi
     When the liquor             is a
                                 treated with water in the same way,
it    furnishes likewise             thick fluid of the consistence of
                                        a
 syrup, which crystallizes slowly                          by
                                                      cooling, and forms
 transparent parallclnpipedons.
     This substance has very singular properties when                      :         it   is
 heated pretty strongly                the air,

     Ten parts      in weight of the crystalline acid            found proI
 duced about               parts of solid phosphoric acid, and the

                    S
 elastic product must of course have formed the remainder
 of the weight, allowing for                small quantity of the sub
                                               a
 stance not decomposed.
    The peculiar gas            not spontaneously inflammable
                                 is                                        but       ;
 explodes when mixed with air, and heated to                    temperaturea
 rather below 218°.
     Its specific graviiv appeared from an experiment in which
a   small quantity of           only was weighed, to be to that of air
                                 it
 nearly   as  87  to   100.      Water absorbed about one-eighth of
 its volume of this gas.            Its smell was disagreeable, but not
nearly    so  fetid  as   that  of   common phosphuretted hydrogen.
     When     it was detonated          with oxygen,        was found that
                                                                     it
 three of it   in  volume absorbed more than five                 volume of    in
 oxygen,     and   a little   phosphorus     was  precipitated.
     When potassium was heated in contact wilh                    its volume   it,
 increased rapidly till           became double, and then no further
                                     it
effect was produced.             The potassium was partly converted
in> substance having all the characters of phosphuret of
      a
 potassium and the residual gas absorbed the same quantity
              ;
of oxygen      by  detonation as pure hydrogen. When sulphur
was sublimed in the gas over mercury, the Volume was
lrkewise doubled;              compound of phosphorus and sulphur
                                 a
was formed, and the clastic fluid produced had all the cha
 racters of sulphuretted hydrogen.
    It  appears from these experiments, that the peculiar gas
consists of 4*5 of hydrogen in weight to 22*5 phosphorus;
                                    D          d
                                               2                          and

                        On some Comlinations            of
 and ils composition being known, it is easy lo determine
 flte composition«of the hydrophosphorous acid, and likewise
*ajhe quantity of oxygen required by a given quantity of
 phosphorous acid to be converted into phosphoric acid ;
 for, for every volume of gas disengaged, a volume of oxy
 gen must have been fixed in the phosphoric acid.
     And calculating for 1 74 grains, 30 parts of oxysicn must
 be fixed in the 150 parts of phosphoric acid, and 20 parts
 of phosphorus disengaged in combination with four parts
 of hydrogen ; and on the idea of representing the pro
 portions in which bodies combine by numbers, if hydrogen
 be considered as unity, and water as composed of two pro
 portions of hydrogen, 2, and one of oxygen 15*, phos
 phorus will be represented by 20.
      When the compounds of chlorine and phosphorus are
 acted on by a small quantity of water, muriatic acid gas is
 disengaged with violent ebullition, the water is decom
 posed, and it is evident that for every volume of hydrogen
 disengaged in combination with the chlorine, half a volume
 of oxygen must be combined with the phosphorusf ; and
 the products of the mutual decomposition                      of water, and
 the phosphoric compounds of chlorine, are merely the
  phosphoric acid from the sublimate and the phosphorous
 acid from the liquor, and muriatic acid gas; so that, the
 quantity of phosphorus being the same, it is evident that
 phosphoric acid must contain twice as m^ich oxygen a«
 phosphorous acid, which harmonizes with the results of
 the decomposition          of hydrophosphorous            acid.    For sup
 posing water to be composed of two proportions of hydro
 gen, and one of oxygen, and the number representing it
  17 ; then 174 parts of hydrophosphorous                 acid must consist
 of two proportions ; 34 parts of water, and four propor
 tions of phosphorous acid, containing 60 of phosphorus
  and 60 of oxygen ; and three proportions                    of phosphoric
  acid must be formed, containing three proportions of phos
  phorus 60, and six proportions of oxygen 90, making 150.
      It is scarcely possible to imagine more perfect demon
  strations of the laws of definite combination, than those
  furnished in the mutual action of water and the phosphoric
  compounds.          No products are formed except the new
  combinations; neither oxygen, hydrogen, chlorine, nor
      Supposing 100 cubical inches of the gas to weigh 27 grains: 274-5
  the weight of 200 cubical inches of hydrogen = 22 5 grains.
     f  This mode of estimation is the same as that I have adopted on a former
  occasion, except that ihe number representing oxygen is doubled to avoid a
  fractional part.
                                                                  phosphorus

pho#phorus is disengaged, and therefore, the ratio in which
any two of them combine being known, the ratios in which
the rest combine, in these cases, may be determined by cal
culation.
    I   converted      phosphorus into phosphoric acid, by burning
it in   great excess of oxygen gas over mercury in ^ curved
         a
glass tube, and heated the product strongly.        I found in
several processes of this kind, that for every grain of phos
phorus consumed, four cubical inches and a half of oxygen
gas were absorbed ; which gives phosphoric acid as com
posed of 20 of phosphorus to 30 6 of oxygen; a result as
near as can be expected to the results of the experiments
on the sublimate and the hydrophosphorous acid.
   Unless the product Qf the combustion of phosphorus is
strongly heated in oxygen, the quantity of oxygen absorbed
is less, so that it is probable that phosphorous acid is
formed, as well as phosphoric acid.
    Phosphorous acid is usually described, in chemical authors,
as a fluid body, and as formed by the slow combustion of
phosphorus in the air; but the liquid so procured                 is,

              3. Of some   Combinations   of Sulpliur.
    I have  shown, in   a  paper published in the Philosophical
Transactions for 1810, that sulphuretted hydrogen is form
ed by the solution of sulphur in hydrogen, and I have sup
posed that sulphureous acid, in like manner, is constituted
by a solution of sulphur in oxygen.            There is always a
little condensation of volume in experiments on the com
bustion of sulphur in oxygen ; but this may fairly be attri
buted to some hydrogen loosely combined in the sulphur}
and to the production of a little sulphuric acid by the mu
tual action of hydrogen, oxygen, and sulphur.
    It is only necessary, if these data be allowed, to know
the difference between the specific gravity of sulphureous
acid gas and oxygen, and sulphuretted hydrogen and hy
drogen, to determine their composition.
    In the Philosophical Transactions for 1810, page 254, I
have somewhat under-rated the weights of sulphuretted
hydrogen and sulphureous acid gases : for I have since
found, that the cubical inch measures, employed for ascer
taining the volumes of gas weighed, were not correct.
From experiments which 1 think may be depended upon,
as the weights of the gases were merely compared with
those of equal volumes of common air, I found that 100
cubical inches of sulphureous acid gas weighed 68 grains
at mean temperature and pressure, and 100 cubical inches
of sulphuretted hydrogen 36-5 grains, and the last result
agrees very nearly with one given by MM. Gay Lussac and
Thenard, and one gained by my brother Mr. John Davy.
    If  34, the weight of 100 cubical inches of oxygen ga9,
be subtracted from 68, it will appear that sulphureous acid
consists of equal weights of sulphur and oxygen, an esti
mation which agrees very nearly with one given by M. Ber-
 zeliusj and if 2-27, the weight of 100 cubical inches of
hydrogen, be subtracted from 36-5, the remainder 34*23
will be the quantity of sulphur in the gas ; and the number
representing sulphur may be stated as 30; and sulphureous
 acid as composed of one proportion of sulphur 30, and two
 of oxygen 30 ; and sulphuretted hydrogen as composed of
 one proportion of sulphur and two of hydrogen.
     From the experiments of MM. Gay Lussac, it appears
 that sulphuric acid decomposed by heat affords one volume
 pi oxygen to two of sulphureous acid: from this it would
                                                            appear

                 Phosphorus and Sulphur,    &c.             423
appear to be composed        of one proportion of sulphur to
three of oxygen.      I have endeavoured, in several trials by
common heat and by electricity, to combine sulphureous
acid gas with oxygen, so as to form a sulphuric acid free
from water, but without success ; and it is probable that
three proportions of oxvgen cannot be combined with
one proportion of sulphur, except by the intermedium of
water. Mr. Dalton has supposed that there is a solid sul
phuric acid formed by the action of sulphureous acid gas
upon nitrous acid gas.        But I find, that when dried sul
phureous   acid  gas and  nitrous acid gas are mixed together,
there is no action ; but by introducing the vapuur of water,
they form together a solid crystalline hydrat ; which when
thrown into water gives off nitrous gas, and forms a solu
tion of sulphuric acid.
   I have referred, in the Philosophical Transactions, to the
combination of chlorine and sulphur.        I have been able to
form no compound of these bodies, which does not deposit
sulphur by the action of water.      When sulphur is saturated
with chlorine, as in Dr. Thomson's sulphuretted liquor, it
appears to contain, from my experiments, only 67 of chlo
rine to 30 of sulphur.
                 4.  Some general Observations.
   It is a fact   worthy of notice, that phosphoric and sul
phuric acids should contain the same quantity of oxygen
to the same quantity of inflammable matter; and yet that
the oxygen should be combined in them, with such dif
ferent degrees of alfiiiity.     Phosphorous acid has a great
tendency to unite with oxyuen, and absorbs it even from
water; and sulphureous acid can only retain it when water
is present.
   The relation of water to the composition of many bodies
has already occupied the attention of some distinguished
chemists, and is well worthy of being further studied : most
of the substances obtained bv precipitation from aqueous
solutions are, 1 find, compounds of water.
   Thus zircona, magnesia, silica, when precipitated and
dried at 212°, still contain definite proportions of water.
And manv of the substances which have been considered
as metallic oxides, that I have examined, obtained froiti
solutions, agree in this respect; and their colours and other
properties are materially influenced by this combined water.
   I shall give an instance The substance which has been
called the white oxide of manganese is a compound of
water and the protoxide of manganese, and w hen heated
strongly, it gives offits water and becomes a dark olive oxide.

424                  Ignition from      compressed     Air.
   It has been often suspected, that the contraction of
volume produced in the pure earths by heat is owing to
the expulsion of water combined with them. The following
fact seems to confirm this suspicion, and offers a curious
phamomenon.
   Zircona, precipitated from its solution in muriatic acid
by an alkali, and dried at a temperature below 300°, appears
as a white powder, so soft as not to scratch glass.     When
heated to 700° or 800°, water is suddenly expelled from                             it,
and notwithstanding    the quantity of vapour formed,     be                  it
comes at the moment red hot.         After the process,                        it   is
found harsh to the feel, has gained    tint of gray, its parts
                                                 a

riched natural philosophy. Many have reasoned on its
cause; which some consider to be caloric, others electri

port his opinion         by
                     experiments.   Without bias for any
hypothesis,  I  have made some researches on the construc
tion and effects of the pneumatic tinder-box, the results of
which shall be the subject of the present paper. In the
first part,I  shall consider what relates to the structure of
the instrument      in' the second,
                     ;                shall give an account of

the experiments that tend to the discovery of the cause of
its effects,
  I.    The first construction of these tinder-boxes was                            a
little faulty, in the piston being commonly 18 or 20 Iine3
long. This was said to be necessary, that the air might
not escape when the piston was in action          for,    there
                                                            ;            if
were any point not accurately fitted to the inside of the
tube, the air escapes, and the spunk does not kindle.
    The goodness of the instrument does not depend on the
 length of the piston, but on the accuracy with which       fills             it
the bore of the tube; with        tube well bored and

of six lines, the air will no more pass than with a piston of
twenty.       Accordingly, for a tube of six inches I have re
duced the piston to six lines, which adds an inch to the
column of air, and diminishes the friction two-thirds, so
that the effect of the tinder-box is more certain, and it is
more easily used.           With a little dexterity you may kindle
the spunk by holding the tube in one hand and pushing the
piston with the other, without being obliged to rest it on
a table, or any other solid body.             Mr. Duinoticz, a skilful
 maker of philosophical instruments, is so fully convinced
 of the advantage of short pistons, that he now makes them
 of these dimensions*.
    They should be employed also in the syringes of air
gunsf, of fountains acting by compressed air, of the ap
 paratus for artificial mineral waters, of fire-engines, which
 are worked with so much labour, and even of air-pumps.
 As the shortening the piston is an advantage to the pump,
 we obtain a greater effect with less labour, and in a shorter
 time, than with long pistons.
    It is essential, too, that the instrument does not leak at
 the part where the spunk is placed, because there the tran
 sient action of inflammation takes place, and a slight
 emission of air would prevent the effect.                But this effect
 is produced, though the piston does suffer the air in the
 tube to pass it. To satisfy myself of this, I made the fol
 lowing experiment, at which they who have seen it were
 greatly surprised.
     In the length of the piston I made a groove a quarter of
 a line broad.        The spunk took fire as before. Three other
 grooves were added successively, opposite one another, so as
 to divide the piston into equal parts; and still the spunk took
 fire. When the grooved piston is moved backward and for
 ward in the tube, the air may be heard entering or issuing
 out ; and the friction is so slight, that the effect of the
 instrument is easily obtained by pushing it with the hand.
 This kind of piston would be preferable to those that fit accu
  rately, if a solid substance were employed, hard enough to
 resist the continual friction of the air passing through the
  grooves, if I may be allowed the expression. The grooves
  in leather pistons soon alter their shape, and spread so as
  to allow the air to pass it jn too large quantity.
     Mr. Gill, of St. JamesVstreet, London, makes these instruments of still
 smaller dimensions.  Edit.

                                                                         The

 426                Ignition from  compressed   Air.
     The piston with four grooves acting very well, I made one
 with a single groove, of dimensions equal to the other four,
 and what I foresaw actually took place : there was no in
 flammation.       The following are the reasons of this dif
 ference.
    The extremity of the grooved piston exhibits the area of
 a circle, the periphery of which touches the interior edge
 of the grooves.         The column of air contained in the
 tube rests almost wholly on this base.            Only the parts
 corresponding      to the grooves, that are continued    through
 the length of the piston, communicate with the exter
 nal air.     When the piston is pushed with sufficient ve
 locity to kindle the spunk, the parts of the column cor
 responding to the grooves rush into them with equal velo
 city ; but the friction they experience in passing through
 such narrow tubes occasions a resistance to their passage,
 a kind of choking, that suffers only a pari to escape, while
 the column resting on the area of the piston is pushed en
 tirely toward the extremity of the tube, where the spunk
to be kindled lies.
     In the piston with a single broad groove, the area of the
 circle, on which the column of air rests, is much smaller,
 consequently the column itself is less. The resistance the
air experiences in passing through the groove is next to
nothing ; for we hear no noise on moving the piston back
ward and forward; and as air expands in all directions,
when the piston is moved, the column resting on the area
of the circle, resting at the same time laterally on that
which answers to the groove, it recedes from all the points
of contact, and flows entirely through the channel it finds
open.      It is so true, that it wholly flows out, that the pis
ton, when it touches the extremity of the tube, remains
there ; while with other pistons a sufficient quantity of air
is retained to occasion a spring and repel them.
    I think it proper to say a word or two . on the quality of
the spunk.       The driest, softest, and least impregnated with
nitre should be chosen. In that of the best quality a piece
will not always be found equally good throughout.           Some
contains a great deal of nitre, and is kindled with more
difficulty. This may be known by the cool taste it leaves
on the tongue ; or by kindling it : for when it has taken
fire the nitre melts, and sometimes throws out sparks, that
may be dangerous when they spirt out of the instrument,
particularly if made with a cock.         As it is usual to blow
on the spunk, to try whether il be kindled, a spark may be
                                                          thrown

thrown from it into the eye.             This painful accident once
happened to me.
   They who imagine that electricity kindles the spunk,
ponsider these sparks as an incontrovertible proof of their
ppinion.       1 think they are niistaktn in this case; yet                                  I
must not conceal a fact communicated to me by Mr. Veau-
Delaunay, which seems to confirm this opinion, of which
he is a partisan.       Out of twelve times, when he operated
with the instrument without any spunk in                he saw sparks it,
emitted three times.          There are strong reasons, however,

this paper, concluding         the present with an important ob
servation on the construction of pistons.
    If we could find an elastic substance sufficiently com
pact to be turned         in lathe, we should have perfect pistons,
                               a
that would spring and adapt themselves to the inequalities
of the tube, without suffering              bubble of air to escape.
                                               a
I  have made some with caoutchouc,               softened before the
fire, in order to give         itdegree of elasticity more obedient
                                    a
fo the inequalities of the tube.           But on attempting to turn
it in a  lathe,      bent under the tool.
                     it                          Even (he edge of                           a
razor would not take hold of                  so that the piston re
                                                   it
                                                    ;
mained uneven and almost ragged, and yielded like soft
wax under the fingers.           In this imperfect state         so far          it
prevents the air from escaping, that                column of three

inches     issufficient to kindle the spunk          but after    ; few               a
strokes of the piston the heat dilates             to such   it degree,          a
that  it cannot be moved without considerable force.               If                       a
drop of oil be put on               it,moves easily
                                          it            but this soon ;
spoils the instrument; for the oil dissolves the caoutchouc,
and forms       avarnish, which, as the piston grows hot, makes
jt  adhere still more strongly to the sides of the tube.
    Might not these inconveniences be avoided,                  arming           by
 the piston rod 'with caoutchouc,            and covering this with
leather?    If  this process succeeded,        might be applied with

are to he considered  the materials of the tube, the matter
contained       inthe tube, the materials of the piston, and the
friction. Among the materials of the piston                include the
                                                                          it I

    In examining the question whether the spunk be kindled
 by  electricity,    Iconsider,
                                                                                 1st,     That

 428              Ignition from compressed   Air.
     1st, That no part of the instrument is insulated ; and
 that insulation is a necessary condition for producing sen
 sible electricity with any of the machines we know.      I say
 machines that we know, because the animal electricity,
 that manifests itself without insulation, is an exception to
 our mechanical means, and cannot here be taken into con
 sideration.
    2dly, The friction of the piston, which is a greasy body,
 against a metallic substance, js not calculated to produce
 electricity.
    3dly, Experience      demonstrates,   that, unless during
 storms, the atmosphere seldom exhibits any signs of elec
tricity at the height we breathe it ; and that we must
 search for them with instruments in a more elevated re
gion, or when electric clouds are passing over our heads.
How then shall we estimate the in finitely small quantitv
of electric matter in a cubic inch of air, or even less, which
the instrument contains ?
    4thly, It is not without great difficulty that we can kin
dle spunk with strong electric sparks.       I have discharged
a large jar on spunk strewed with powdered resin, anJ it
has remained unkindled, though the resin caught fire, and
burned entirely away.
    As long as the instrument was made with metallic sub
stances only, we were obliged to confine ourselves to (he
exterior marks of inflammation alone, without being able
to assign the true cause, or at least furnish proofs of it.
For to guess, is not sufficient in natural philosophy ; we
must demonstrate, in order to give to facts that dcs;rce of
certainty     which befits science ; and this we cannot do
here, without seeing what passes at the very point of in
flammation.
    The means are very simple.       Nothing is necessary but
to substitute a glass for a metal tube.     Those found in the
shops being too slight, T applied to Mr. Laurent, the in
ventor of glass flutes, requesting him to procure me tubes
of a similar quality. This artist, as much distinguished
by his civility as by his talents, furnished me with three,
which I fitted up. The first, eight inches long by eight
lines in diameter, did not kindle the spunk.       The second,
nine inches long by six lines and three-quarters in diame
ter, kindled it completely.    This being destroyed by acci
dent, I tried the third, eight inches long by seven lines in
diameter, which succeeded equally well.
   When the instrument is made to act, and the spunk
kindles, we see a bright flash, that fills the capacity of the
                                                         tube ;

                      Ignition from      compressed     Air .             429
tube; and this light is         so much the more vivid, in propor
tion as the compression is more rapid.                 If the compression
be less powerful, the spunk does not kindle ; but we per
ceive in the upper pari of the tube a light vapour, that falls
in undulations on the piston.              When this has disappeared,
if we draw back the piston, the vapour will re-appear, as.
long as there is any air in the tube. These effects may be
produced several times in succession, merely by pushing
the piston with the hand.             This vapour is so thin and dia
phanous, that it is not perceptible in a strong light.                       It
requires a sort of twilight to see it well.
     But whence arises this vapour, and what is its nature ?
Assuredly it is not furnished by the materials of the in
strument; it can only proceed, therefore, from what it
 contains, from the atmospheric air.                  Now, according to
 the present state of our knowledge, the air contains only
 nitrogen, oxygen, and a very small portion of carbonic
 acid ; all gasiform substances, which are kept in this state
 by the great quantity of caloric that penetrates them, and
 are consequently          heavier than it *.         But in compressing
 the air contained in the tube, what is the substance that
 must first give way? Is it not that which is lightest, the
 caloric, thai general solvent, that principle of fluidity and
 volatilization, which gives wings even to metals to raise
 themselves in the air ?          Is then the vapour in question ca
 loric, rendered visible by approximation of its particles,
 which are compressed by the surrounding air, as air becomes
 visible in passing through liquids ? This idea, which I am
 far from presenting as a thing proved, acquires more pro
 bability from the following experiments.
     I substituted hvdrogen for common air, and the vapour
 showed itself as before; but the spunk did not take fire.
 With carbonic acid oas, and with nitrogen, the effects were
 the same. The latter, which contained a little nitrous gas,
 gave a somewhat denser vapour.                   Oxygen, lightly com
 pressed, yielded a vapour more rare and transient thau that
 of the common air. It had scarcely fallen on the piston,
 when it rebounded and disappeared.                   When I compressed
     The air likewise, in its
                               ordinary state, contains twelve grains of water
 in a cubic foot. This small quantity of water, reduced to tlie proportion of
 the quautity of air contained in the apparatus, contiibutes nothing to ii«
 effect ; for the heat produced by the friction could at most reduce it to va
 pour, and in this state it would not kindle the spunk.    If the vapour seen in
 the tube were water in a state of expansion, when it fell on the surface of
 the piston it would condense there, and appear in the state of a liquid.   But
 the surface of the piston always remains dry, though ou moving it the va
  pour appears and disappears several times.
                                                                        oxygen

   oxygen with a proper force for producing inflammation/
   the spunk, which commonly takes fire only at the anterior
   part, was almost burned: yet for this experiment I used a
   copper instrument, the piston of which lost air so much,
   that it would no longer kindle spunk with common air.
      Perhaps it will be said that ihe vapour came from the
   greasy matter on the piston, which adheres to the sides of
   the tube; and that it is expanded by the heat produced by
   the friction.   To this I answer, in this case, ist, The va
   pour should not show itself before the. greasy matter is de
   posited on the sides of the tube 5 yet it appears at the first
   stroke of the piston, before the tube becomes greasy.
   Sclly, It should »how itself below the; piston, in the part
   which the piston has left; but, on the contrary, it always
   shovvSv itself above.   3dly, There is no vapour, when the
   piston loses much air, if the friction be ever so rapid.
  4ihly, The vapour should be more apparent, when the
   piston exerts its friction throughout the whole lenyth of
   the tube, than when it is confined to a small part of its
  upper extremity ; yet the reverse frequently happens, othlv,
  When the air is entirely decomposed no more vapour ap
  pears, but it shows itself again, if ever so little fresh air be
   introduced.
      As it was. essential to ascertain whether the vapour did
  not contain an acid principle, I fastened to the surface of
  the piston, with a little green      wax, a piece of muslin
  dipped in infusion of litmus, and afterwards dried.       After
  twenty strokes of the piston the colour was not changed.
  I put on a second piece of muslin larger than the first, and
  the edges of which were loose.        This burned all round,
  without the colour of the rest being altered.    Lastly, a third
  piece, which was wet, experienced no change of colour.
      From these experiments it follows, that no acid princi
  ple is developed j that all aeriform substances, as well as.
  common air, produce a light vapour : that no other gas,
  except oxygen and common air, kindles the spunk : that
  oxygen produces a much more powerful combustion than
, common air, consequently       oxygen acts an important par*
  in the inflammation : that as it can exert its action only
  when set free by the decomposition of the common air, of
  which it constitutes a fourth part, it follows, that the air'
  contained in the tube is decomposed by the simple force of
  compression : that the vapour produced is not owing to
  the oxygen, since it shows itself equally in gases that con
  tain no oxygen: that this vapour is the effect of some
  agent common to all gases : and that we may presume it

is caloric itself, rendered visible by the sudden approxima
tion of its pans in a small space, where it rises to a tem
perature       that is increased in the oxygen so as to kindle
the    spunk*.
     I  am equally induced to believe, since the air (and it is
the     same with all gases) is decomposed                 by rapid com
pression, that the luminous meteors frequently perceived in
hurricanes are not always the effects of electricity.                  I have
observed several times, on these occasions, that Saussure's
 atmospheric electrometer affords no signs of any.                      I will
mention a particular instance, as it occasioned me no less
 surprise than damage.
     In the beginning of the year 1803, being at my country
 seat, toward evening a violent wind arose, which continued
 increasing lor two hours to such a degree, as to blow down
 about sixty trees of prodigious size and height in an orna
 mental plantation.          It threw them one upon another in a
 row, and some of them were broken off. Those that were
 torn up by the roots brought up the earth with them to the
 distance of fifteen feet. The clouds flew with extreme
 rapidity, and I saw flashes of light from them.                     I raised
 my electrometer, armed with its conductor two feet long,
 but the balls slill continued in contact.
 LXXVI. Mr.             Hume's Remarks          on  Dr. Roget's Reply.
                              To    Mr. Tillock.
 Sir,     Dr.     Roget having        confessed that I did make use of
 the 'words       " or any other alkali," the question at issue
 between us becomes more simple; it is merely this,
 Whence are the distinctions between sulphate of copper and
 nitrate of silver, which prove that one of these salts is
 totally different from the other, when applied for the detec
  tion of arsenic ?
     That there is a total difference, especially when ammonia
 is employed, has been asserted by Dr. Roget j  that there
 is no such dissimilarity in the application of these two
  tests, to support such an opinion, I shall now endeavour to
  prove.
     * It sometimes  happen*, th.it the spunk is turned black without kindling.
  In this case, as well as when it is kindled, if we draw back the pi&tou in
  the tube, a dense vapour, that may be smelt, issues out, which is not of the
 sa ne nature at the former.    That shows iuelf before the inflammation : th't
  always succeeds it. That is the principle of the inflammation : this is a pro
 duct furnished by the combustion of the spunk, of which it has the smell.

 432                  On Tests    for   Arsenic.
    Let us therefore compare the two tests, (for the ammonia
 is assuredly not to be called a test for arsenic) and see if there
 be an votherej.en^'tf/ difference between ihem than that which
 was first noticed by myself, in the Philosophical Magazine,
 nearly four year? ago, in these words :  " The test I propose,
 as a substitute (for sulphate of copper) appears to be more
efficacious, inasmuch as it produces a more copious precipi
 tate from a given quantity of arsenic."
    1. Both these tests have a melallicbase ; thev are applied
to the same purpose ; and they admit of the same variation*,
especially with respect to ihe alkaline agent, in their appli
cation for the detection of arsenic.
    2. The addition of an alkali, of some kind or other, is as
necessary with one test as it is to succeed with the other;
and no less caution is required in either of the experiments
to avoid an excess of the alkali.
    3. Any of the alkaline earths will serve with sulphate of
copper, as I have proved they will with nitrate of silver.
Though J have not made some experiments which I have
in contemplation, I suspect the sulphate of copper will
produce a more dense and conspicuous precipitate, when
the arsenic is combined with barytes ; if so, this notice will
prevent any one arrogating to themselves the discovery of a
 new test of this species.
    4. Both the copper and silver tests act exactly upon the
 same chemical principles, or, in the language of Bergman*,
 by double elective attraction.
                                                                      "
    5. It is here altogether in my favor that these metallic:
 jahs have the same properly in respect to ammonia, that of
 forming triple or ternary compounds.          Of this fact both
Dr. Marcet and Dr. Hoget seem to have been totally igno
rant, before [ prescribed the ammouiaco-nilrate         of silver,
which you did me the honor to place among your pages in a
late number.      Dr. Roget need not, therefore, be surprised
that I should become the " panegyrist" of such a finished
composition.      As we may with the same facility prepare a-
triple salt with copper, to serve as a test for arsenic, I trust,
it would be unnecessary to carry this parallel any further, or
advance additional arguments to shew that these tests are^
mutatis mutandis, identical in their application and mode of
operating, in respect to arsenic.
    6. Both these tests agree in producing more abundant
precipitates ; the silver   is,   however, as      have already
                                                   I
noticed,  by  far the most delicate and conspicuous.
   Lastly, there       striking analogy in these tests, in respect
                 is
                 a
to the colour each produces, so that the operator may

instantly discover in what state the arsenical salt exists,
whether it be an arsenite or arsenate ; with copper, the first
is of a yellowish green, and the arsenate is a bluish green ;
but with silver, the arsenite is of a bright yellow, and the
arsenate of a brick red.        In describing these appearances of
the silver-test, Dr. R. has copied me nearly verbatim*.
     So little indeed do these tests differ in the mode of apply
ing them, and in their habitudes with alkalies and arsenic,
 that I might have contented myself, when I first announced
the silver-test) by merely recommending it to the notice of
your numerous readers, to be substituted for that of copper^
as being more eligible.
     It is .also evident, that the kind of alkali was with me a se
condary object in the experiments with which I commenced
the enquiry; for, in the letter already quoted, I have said,
 "  though my process answer very well with potass, or
even with lime-water, I am inclined to prefer the common
 sub-carbonate of soda."
     I must insist, that the name due to the test is to be de
rived from the metallic salt I employ, that is, any soluble
 salt of which silver is the base ; and not from the alkali or
alkaline earth, more than from the acid or fluid, all of which
 the operator may have his choice.           In this particular point,
Dr. Roget has not done me justice ; he might have quoted
my test, in the way several respectable authors have done, as
the " Nitrate of Silver ;" he might have copied Dr. Henry at
 least as well as Mr. Thomson and some others, and not
 mock his friend by ascribing to him a new test when, take
 it in the most favourable light, it can only be a modification.
  It is singular that Dr. Roget did not act by me as he has
 done in quoting Dr. Bostock.  Here he mentions the sul
 phate of copper, but leaves the reader to guess at the alkali
 which this able philosopher employed.
     Dr. Roget has told you that " it was only at the moment"
 of sending his paper to the press that Dr. Marcet met with
 the quotation in Dr. Henry's Elements of Chemistry, which
 led Dr. R. to read my letters; and, you are likewise in
 formed, that Dr. Roget did no more than quote the proper
 authorities.
     Now, in all these documents, where did Dr. Roget find
 that my process " appears less convenient in its practical
 application" than any other?         That my test might prove s<j
 in some hands is not to be doubted ; but it was incumbent

is brought in contact with an ext-iied electrical body ; the
surface, opposite to that in contact, gains the opposite
electricity from that of the excited body ; and if the plate
be removed from the conductor and the source of electri
city, it is found to possess two surfaces in opposite slates.
If  a conductor be brought into the neighbourhood               of an
excited body, the air, which is a nonconductor, being be
tween them ; that extremity of the conductor, which is
opposite to the excited body, gains the opposite electricity,
and the other extremity, if opposite to a body connected
                                                                  with

with    the ground, gains the same electricity, and the middle
point is not electrical at all. This is easily proved, by exa
mining the electricity of three sets of gi i oitli balls raised on
wires on the diffeient pans of the condix'oi, which is thus
affected by induced electricity.          If, inotead or air, a plate of
mica or glass be bciwe* .;> the two conductors, the same phac-
liomena will occur; so that it would appear that the con
ductor merely gains two opposite electricities, or polar elec
tricities, of the same kind as those of the nonconductor.
The     phaenomena of sparks, of discharges, and of accumu
lated electricity, depend upon this law.              In the case of the
common electrical spark, a stratum of air is charged in the
same manner as a glass bottle, partially coated with tin foil,
is charged in the I-eyden experiment ; when the hand is
 held near the positive conductor of an electrical machine*
 the person standing on the ground, the hand is rendered
negative, and the states become exalted, till the polarities,
as they may be called, are annihilated through the air, pro
 ducing a spark, a snap, and a distinct sensation.                    If a
 number of small pith balls, placed upon a surface of metal,
 are caused to approach an electrified body, they are brought
 into the opposite state by induction, and arc attracted to
 wards the body 3 but when they come in contact with it,
 this state is destroyed, they gain the same state, and are
  repelled."
     So far the phenomenon of electrical polarity is perfectly
  analogous to that of magnetism.             The coincidence favours
  the reveries of speculators relating to an electrical and
  magnetic atmosphere.            As to the term induction, which is
  more    familiar  to   metaphysical than physical language, it
  seems as convenient and applicable as any ottier.                Mr. G.
  Singer,   indeed,     in  his  lectures  on   electricity   made   some
  objections    to it ;   but  as  he proposed    to stale  his reasons  in
  the Philosophical Magazine, we shall leave .l.i? opinions to
  his own enunciation.            " In consequence of th rtrinciple
  of induction," savs Sir H. " the condensing electrometer is
  much more sensible than the common electrometer. This
   instrument consists of two plates ot polished metal, the
   surfaces of which are parallel, one connected with the
   plate of the electrometer, the other moveable, in connection
   with the ground, and the, plates are very near each other.
   When the body supposed to be electrical, U made to touch
   the top of the electrometer, and is afterwards removed in
   separating the polished plates, the effect will be perceived."
      "  The difference in what are called the conducting
    powers of bodies, seems to depend entirely upon the dif-
                                        Ees                          ferent

  ferent manner in which they receive the electrical po*
  larities; or in which their parts become capable of com
  municating attractive or repellent powers to other matter.
  Nonconductors appear to receive polarities, only with
  great difficulty, but retain them for a long while, and present
  probably a number of different alternations or poles, within
  a small space, and cannot be affected to any great distance.
  Imperfect conductors receive polarity with more facility,
  but present fewer alternations, and preserve their electri
  cities for a shorter time.       Perfect conductors are easily
  affected throughout; but present at mo3t only two
  poles, and the powers rapidly destroy each other.            The
  difficulty with which nonconductors         receive polarity, it
  shown in the phaenomena of charging thick and thin
  coated plates of glass and mica.       The thin plates are capa
  ble of being charged much more highly than the thick
  ones, and the accumulation         on the opposite surfaces is
 much greater. Rarefied air or gaseous matter, is much
 more susceptible of receiving polarities, than dense air or
 gaseous matter ; and hence, the electrical spark will pass
 much further through rarefied air or light gases, than
 through dense air or heavy gases; it passes much further
 likewise in gases, than in nonconducting fluids."
     The terms quantity and intensity of electricity are ad
 mitted to be rather vague, although useful ; but if we consi
 der the former in its natural sense of volume       or measure,
 and the latter as indicating an increased impetus, we may
 form sufficiently definite ideas from these expressions.
 Thus, for instance, where, the quantity of electricity in any
conducting body is not altered, but the intensity           is,the
latter is   always in proportion to the diminution of the dis
charging surface  ;    hence the more the surface h   diminished
the more the electricity    is    rendered intense.    In this re
spect, it   may be said to be condensed or concentrated, and
the more condensed, the greater its intensity.            This    is
further confirmed     by  the author'3 observation, that"   when
very small conducting surfaces are used for conveying very
large quantities of electricity, they become ignited   ;   and of
the different conductors that have been compared, charcoal
is   most easily heated    by   (Voltaic) electrical discharges,
next iron, platina, gold, then copper, and lastly zinc. The
phaenomena of electrical ignition, whether taking place in
gaseous fluid or solid bodies, always seem to be the result
of violent exertion of the electrical attractive and repellent
powers, which may be connected with motions of the par
ticles of the substances affected."        Here Sir H. adduces
                                                          another

another argument or apparent fact before alluded to, to dis
prove the existence of a subtile fluid as matter of heat, that
a " platina wire may be preserved in a state of intense ig
nition in vacuo, for an unlimited time; yet such a wire
cannot be supposed to contain an inexhaustible quantity of
subtile matter." Should   it,  however, afterwards be discovered
that electric matter, and the matter of heat,         (if
                                                     there be any
such thing) are identical substances, only perceived             by
                                                             us at
present under different modifications,        the explanation of
these phanomena must be much more simple and consonant
with all our other knowledge of physical bodies. Tour
maline, boracite, and many other minerals become electric
by   heat ;  in fact, there
                          is   no existing vitreous or resinous
electricity without sensible heat.       We find much less dif
ference between the exterior influence of what         commonly
                                                            is
denominated matter of heat, and the electric fluid, than
between hydrogen, oxygen, and water.             Analogy seems
 to sanction this   :  thus, most of the substances which act
 distinctly upon each other electrically, are likewise such as
 act chemically, when their particles have freedom of motion.
It   isthe case with the metals, with sulphur and the metals,
 and with acid and alkaline substances.        Metals having the
 highest attracting powers are positive as for instance, zinc
                                             ;
is  positive with respect to iron, the latter to tin, tin to lead,
 lead to copper, copper to silver, silver to gold, gold to
 platina, and the latter to charcoal.      In stating the hypo
 thesis of " the possibility of the dependence of electrical
 and chemical action upon the same cause," the author
 complains of misrepresentation,       as
                                        if  he had maintained or
 supposed
              " that chemical changes were occasioned            by
                                                              elec
 trical changes."       On the contrary, be only supposed them
 " produced    by   the s:ime power, acting in one case (electric
 effects)  on  masses,   in the other case (chemical effects) on
 particles.     The controversy, however, was excited with             a
 view not less to notoriety than philosophical truth, or the
 development of the laws of matter.          In all such cases        si
 lence    is the best argument  ;   and it   is  serious injury to
                                                  a
  science to waste time on an artificial phantom, which might
  be employed in exploring       new and unknown paths in the
  vast fields of philosophical research.
     Among the multiplicity of facts here stated, should be
  noticed the experiment proving that the action of the com
  mon electrical machine does not depend on the oxidation
  of the amalgam.       Sir H. found that small machine pro
                                             a
  perly mounted was active in hydrogen gas, and more active
  in carbonic acid gas than in the atmosphere, probably

 owing   to its greater density.    This has been so often re
 peated as lo be deemed quite conclusive.          Before termi
 nating these remarks on electric attraction and repulsion,
 the Professor very judiciously guards the young student
 against idle speculations respecting electricity and sensitive
 action.    " The laws of dead and living nature," he truly
 observes, ** appear to be perfectly distinct : material powers
 are made subservient to the purposes of life, and the ele
 ments of matter arc newly arranged in living organs ; but
 they are merely the instruments of a superior principle."
 This sovereign truth deprives the modern materialists of
 the suffrage of the first chemist and philosopher of the age.
    The section   " on analysis and synthesis, the circumstances
 to be attended to in these operations, and the arrangement
 of undecfimpounded bodies," equally abounds in new and
 luminous views of chemical phasnomcna.             One instance
 will suffice to show that the results of even the most familiar
 experiments have been strangely misinterpreted, and that
 almost the very basis of all our chemical theories consists
 of errors and misconceptions.         Thus ; " when concen
 trated oil of vitriol, which consists of sulphuric acid and
 water, is poured upon common salt, and they are heated
 together, muriatic acid gas flies off, and sulphate of soda is
 obtained : hence it was concluded, that common salt con
 sists of muriatic acid gas and soda 5 and that the sulphuric
 acid merely displaced the muriatic acid gas ; and no ac
 count wa9 taken of the water of the sulphuric acid in the
 operation : yet the whole change depends upon this water;
 and no soda and no muriatic acid can be procured from
 common salt, without water; and common salt is made
 directly by heating sodium, the metal which I discovered
 to be the basis of soda, and chlorine together, and these
are both as yet undecompounded bodies ; and if 99 parts of
oil of vitriol, which consists of 75 parts, by weight, of sul
phuric acid, and 17 parts of water, be made to act upon
 111 parts of common salt, which consists of 44 sodium,
 and 67 chlorine, the water will be decomposed,            15 of
 oxygen will combine with the sodium to form 59 of soda,
 and two of hydrogen will combine with 67 of chlorine to
form 69 of muriatic acid gas, and the sulphate or soda wiil
be 134 parts."
    The second division, of radiant or ethereal matter, and
its effects in producing vision, heat, and chemical changes,
shows how much we are still deficient in correct data on
these curious and important points.          Sir H. inclines to
the Newtonian theory of light, but seems to admit Rum-
                                                           ford's,

                    Notices respecting    New Books.            439
  ford's notion that it is not a specific fluid.     The Bavarian
  Count however goes further, and compares light to sound ;
  but Sir H. does not include sound in his radiant matter,
  and if light he matter at all, it cannot he considered as per
  fectly analogous to sound.        There is also much reason to
  doubt the soundness of the Count's doctrine of light, as
  his lamp, which he presented to the Royal Society, has
  proved by experience      totally inadequate to the purpose of
  emitting light.     His series of burners contiguous to each
  other may possibly have illuminated his own imagination;
  but they have failed to enlighten the presiding room of the
  Royal Society.
      Empyreal or undecompounded substances that support
  combustion constitute the author's third division.        In con
  sidering their combinations with each other, Sir H. shows,
  that although " almost all cases of vivid chemical action
  are connected with the increase of temperature of the act
   ing bodies, and a greater radiation of heat from them, and
   in a number of instances, light is also produced ; yet no
  peculiar substance or form of matter is necessary for the
  effect, and that it is a. general result of the actions of any
   substances possessed of strong chemical attractions or dif
   ferent electrical relations, which takes place in all cases
-
   where an intense and violent motion can be conceived to
   be communicated to the corpuscles of bodies."                The
   strength   of the attraction   determines  the rapidity of  com
    bination, and the .latter the intensity of heat and light.
   This is a much more simple and more natural exposition
    of the actious of matter, than the supposed legerdemain
    operations of phlogiston or oxygen, which have been so
    confidently maintained by theorists. Many hitherto unde
    compounded bodies, which cannot easily be supposed to
    contain oxgyen, produce heat and light by their mutual
    chemical actiou ; such are potassium in combining with
    aisemc and tellurium, and sulphur with certain metals be
    come ignited by their union.           Oxygen and chlorine or
    oxyinuriatic gas are the substances that support combus
    tion, and here considered as undecomposed or simple ele
    ments, in the present state of our knowledge.
       In the fourth division, on undecompounded non- metallic
    inflammable or acidiferous substances, are hydrogen, a2ote,
    sulphur, phoshorus, carbon, and boracium or boron, all of
    which " are capable of combining with oxygen, and all ex
    cept azote and charcoal with chlorine."        The latter excep
    tion, such is the rapid march of the author's discoveries,
                                   E  e 4                           is

440               Notices respecting New Books*
 is no longer correct,  as his recent discovery of the extraor
 dinary detonating substance from the combination of chlo
 rine with ammonia, renders it probable that chlqrme may
 be combined with azote.        Of the various acids denomi
 nated from nitre, Sir H. observes that according to the
 principles of the French nomenclature, they should be
 called hydro-ri\ir\c or hy dr o-n\trous.    When the author
 discovered a solid hydrat of phosphorous acid in Feb. 1812,
 he also recognised the existence of an elastic fluid, pro
 duced with solid phosphoric acid by heating the hydrat in
 a retort out of the contact of air.     This product he calls
 hydrophosphoric    gas, which in specific gravity is twelve
 times heavier than hydrogen.      It contains four proportions
 of hydrogen, and one of phosphorus : water absorbs about
 one-eighth its volume of it,     Phosphoretted hydrogen pro
 bably contains this gas in many experiments.          The basis
 of borax, which the Professor originally concluded to be
 metallic, and consequently denominated it boracium, he
 now calls boron, as subsequent experiments have not de
 monstrated its metallic nature.      Boron is an opake, dark
 olive-coloured powder, infusible and not volatile at any
 known temperature; when strongly heated in contact with
 air it burns, and forms dry boracic acid.     It is a non-con
 ductor of electricity, and insoluble in water.      Much still
 remains to be discovered respecting the operations of this
substance and its application to the arts, owing perhaps to
its hitherto comparative scarcity.      Of the metals, Sir H.
has augmented their number to 39, five times the number
 known to our ancestors. The sixth division, on substances
the nature of which is not yet certainly known, treats ofv
the fluoric principle, and the amalgam procured from am-
moniacal compounds.
     The seventh and last division of this part embraces
a view of the analogies between undeconipounded             sub
stances, ideas respecting their nature, the modes of se
parating them, and the relations of their* compounds.      Here
the author's almost universal knowledge of physical or
chemical bodies enables him to trace the most curious and
interesting analogies in the appearances and operations of
matter, and the laws of the material world. The chain
of gradations in the metals, inflammable and other bodies,
leads to the conclusion that, as far as our knowledge of the
nature of compound bodies has extended,       " analogy of pro-
          is connected with analogy of composition.         We
   now nothing of the true elements belonging to nature j

bul   as  far as we  can reason from the relations of the pro
perties    of matter, hydrogen       is the substance    which ap-
  roaches nearest to what the elements may he supposed to
C e.    It has energetic powers of combination, its parts are
highly repulsive as to each other, and attractive of the par
ticles of other matter.         It enters into combination in a
quantity very much smaller than any other substance,
and in this respect it is approached by no known body."
It seems that " in the electrization of a globule of mercury
in water oxygen appears to be combined with the metal,
and yet no hydrogen evolved."              This experiment would
sanction the belief that water is the ponderable basis of
both oxygen and hydrogen ; but more experiments and cir
cumstances are wanting to allow of such an opinion being
seriously entertained.        The whole of this part should be
attentively studied by all clergymen who wish to conscien
tiously discharge their duty ; the sublimest conceptions of
the Deity are augmented by an enlightened consciousness
of our own inability to attain absolute demonstration and
certainty, even in the laws of surrounding and sensible
matter. The pious yet sublime opinions of a Newton and
a Davy have done more good to Christianity, and conse
quently to the true interests of society, than all the religious
controversies from the days of Arius to those of Priestley.

    The preceding extracts from these " Elements of Che-
mical Philosophy" sufficiently prove that this is the first
truly scientific work on chemistry in our language. The
superficial production of Fonrcroy, although dignified with
the title of " philosophy," is rather a concise systematic
arrangement of chemical substances, and is incomparably
inferior, not merely in original views, but in scientific elu
cidations and intellectual precision.        The present volume
gives   us  some  reason   to  hope   that,  before finishing his
work, the author will be able to furnish the public with a
new and improved chemical nomenclature, better adapted
to truth, nature, and the genius of our language, than that
imported from France.          It is quite time that we should
consider the English as a language and not a dialect, and
cease to let it be influenced by every vague fancy of the
French.      Even the very name of this science has fluctua
ted in humble imitation, and we have now almost uni
versally Chemistry for Chj mistry, according to etymological
propriety,      We regret that Sir H. has admitted ihe Hr-
barous word potassa into his pages.          It is a most useless
and absurd combination of letters adopted by Murray un
der the idle pretext of scientific distinction ; its origin how
ever tends to show the thoughtless promptitude with which
we have hitherto transferred French words into English.
Of ihe English term potash the French made potasse, and
Mr. Murray made it again into potassa, pretending to avoid
 its being confounded with the potash of commerce. Com
mercial men however say "Dantzic ashes," or "American
potash," so that there is no danger of the impute substance
 in trade being confounded with the potash of chemists.
But, besides the literal barbarism of potassa, it has other
and more serious inconveniences ; it encumbers chymical
science with a superfluous term, augments the already too
copious nomenclature, and embarrasses the memory of the
young student, without conveying any new idea, or being
                                                                 of

 444              On determining  the Longitude
 of any utility whatever. The author's papers in the Phi
 losophical Transactions are hitherto free from this affecta
 tion, and we hope he will see the propriety of using only
 pure potash in future in these Elements.      Sir Humphry is
 no less distinguished for the sublimity and beauty of his
 language than for his unparalleled discoveries : consequently
 his example in such a case must naturally become the
jus et norma loquendi.
     We understand that translations of this volume into
 Portuguese and Spanish have already been undertaken by
 gentlemen very well qualified for the arduous task.
 LXXVIII. An        Account of a Series of Observations made
     on the Distance of the Sun and Moon for determining the
     Longitude of the Place of Observation, with Remarks on
     the best Method of making such Observations, with their
     Calculation,   Deductions, &c.      By Mr. Firminger,
     late Assistant at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich.
 It    being generally understood,      that to determine the
  longitude of a place by the lunar observations, it is requi
  site to have three separate observers, viz. one to observe
  the moon's altitude, another the sun's, and a third to take
  the distance between the limbs of the sun and moon, or
 the moon and a star, I was induced to make a set of observa
  tions for determining the longitude of my place without
  any such assistance, it having frequently occurred to me
  that a series of observations might be made by only one
  observer, which would require but little additional labour in
  the calculation to that which is necessary when three se
 parate observers are employed, and the result of the trial
  has fully confirmed my conjecture.
     The following observations, from whence this conclusion
  was drawn, have not the best possible arrangement ; it was
  readily seen in making the calculation, that much of the
  trouble of reduction might have been avoided by a different
  method of taking the observations ; but what has been done
  will, it is hoped, be sufficient to show the value of the
  means which have been employed.
     The weather at the time of the year when these observa
  tions were made, is but seldom favourable in London, and it
  was owing chiefly to this circumstance that different sets of
  observations on the same day were taken, and which it was in
  tended to repeat till the number of independent sets amounted
  to ten, by taking two or three sets each day 3 but the fine
                                                         weather

                     of the Place of Observation.                          US
weather did not continue sufficiently long for this purpose;
nor has an opportunity offered since the period at which
these observations were made to repeat them.                       The seti
were four in number ; two were taken on the 25th of Oc-
                                                             The sun's and
moon's altitude were taken from an artificial horizon, and
the time at each observation noticed from a common hori
zontal watch showing seconds : great accuracy was not
regarded in taking the moon's altitude, nor indeed of the
sun's, except that set from whence the time was to be
computed, for a small error in the observed altitude cannot
materially affect the correction to be applied in reducing
the apparent to the true distance : great care however
should be observed in noticing the moment when the di
stance is completed, as, whatever error is committed here,
 will appear in the longitude, that being deduced by a com
 parison of the time at Greenwich,               given by the observed
distance compared with the distance deduced from the
 Nautical Almanac, and the time inferred from the sun's
 observed altitude.
    The method which I should advise would be, first, to
 take a single observation of the altitude of the moon's en
 lightened limb, then one of the sun's lower limb*, and when
 these have been completed, take with the greatest care five
 distances at least of the proper limbs of the sun and moon.
 When these are finished, take another altitude of the sun,
 then one of the moon ; these four altitudes of the sun and
 moon will be sufficient for clearing the distance ; and if
 they are taken at nearly equal intervals of time before and
 after the time at distance, it will be only necessary to take
 a mean of each two corresponding altitudes, which will
 very nearly correspond to the apparent altitudes when the
  distance was taken j but a set of observations of the alti
  tude of the proper limb of the sun should now he taken,
  and the time noted down with the greatest care.                        These
  observations should not be less than five, because from
  them the apparent time at distance is to be inferred by a
  comparison with the watch. From this method of proceed
  ing little difficulty occurs, or additional trouble to the usual
  method by three separate observers ; and I am induced to
  think that it possesses many advantages over that method
  in point of accuracy, for in the latter case the whole is com-
    * This applies equally to a star when that is used instead of the siin, and ii
  to be so understood in all cases here referred to.
                                                                          pleted

                 On determining the Longitude
pleted by one observer; and if he has a good eye, and is
careful in making his different sets of observations, it is
more than probable that the whole will be conducted with
much greater accuracy than when three separate observers
are employed, as it seldom happens that each of the ob-»
servers is equally correct and careful 5 and should it be
discovered that the one who takes the sun's altitude is
inaccurate, the whole deduction will be affected with that
inaccuracy : nor indeed is it scarcely possible for each ob
server taking the altitudes to complete his observation at
the same time that the one who takes the distance has
completed his ; and the inaccuracy arising will be of con
siderable importance, should this happen to the observer
who observes the object from whence the time is to be
computed.
    In the method I have adopted, the only inaccuracy af
fecting the observation arises from the altitudes of the
bodies not increasing or decreasing uniformly: this, in the
sun or a star, is of no importance if the observer is at all
expert at making his observation, and in the moon the
error will be too small generally to deserve notice.        The
watch by which the observations are made, should have a
seconds hand, and ought not to vary more than one minute
in twenty-four hours ;  a good horizontal or duplex watch
will answer very well, and will allow time for the observer
to take his final set of observations for determining the
error of the watch without hurrying himself.
    The deductions derived from a mean of the four sets of
observations about to be enumerated, give the longitude of
the place in time 38,9 sec. west of Greenwich ; or in space
9' 3l",35 west*.        By a reference to the best maps of
London, it appears lhat the Polygon, Somers Town, is
about 400 yards to the east of St. James's Church, Picca
dilly, and the longitude of this church is according to the
 trigonometrical   survey, 8' b" west of Greenwich*         The
observations give the longitude of the Polygon, Somers
Town, l' 26",35 to the west of St. James's Church, or
 about one mile ; this added to the distance that the Polygon
 is to the east of St. James's Church, makes the whole error
 in longitude deduced from these observations about one
 mile and a quarter, which, taking into consideration the
 errors of observation, of the instruments, and of the lunar
 tables, will be found very small ; and I am fully persuaded

that had the number of observations been augmented to
ten, and a mean of the results taken, a great part of the
present error would have been removed.
     I shall couclude these deductions by remarking,       that a
complete set of observations similar to those I have here
given may be taken in the space of a quarter of an hour,
or twenty minutes, by a single observer, and that they
may be facilitated, and rendered a little more accurate, by
 the assistance of some person to write down the observa
tion at the time : this part of the business, indeed, any one
may do, and I am inclined to believe that under such cir
 cumstances the greatest error committed, will seldom ex
 ceed five miles, but will generally fall short of this distance,
     I  have reduced the apparent distance to the true by the
method given in the supplement to the 3d edition of the
 requisite Tables, a method both simple and expeditious, and
 so easy in practice that a child of eleven years of age of
 moderate capacity might in a short time be fully instructed
 to perform the calculation.
      I cannot help remarking,    that many attempts have been
 made, and are still making, to construct machines for the
 more easily determining the longitude at sea; and although
 I   am far from wishing to discourage any such attempts
 when conducted upon scientific principles, yet I am greatly
  surprised that the means of determining the longitude by
  the lunar observations should even at this time be thought
  an operose task.      The improvements in the lunar tables,
  in the construction of sextants, and in the method of re
  ducing the apparent to the true distance, have been such as
  to ensure the observer, with even but a moderate degree of
  experience, an accuracy far greater than is ever required in
  nautical practice.    It may be said, that the weather is of
  tentimes too unfavourable to determine the longitude by
   the lunar method, and that for several days in the month
  the moon is invisible, being too near the sun.        Here the
   use of a good time-keeper would be of great advantage, as
   by it the longitude would be easily carried on between the
  opportunities which offer, to obtain distances of the sun
   and moon, or the moon and a star, and even a time-keeper
   of very moderate performance would answer this purpose
   with sufficient accuracy for every nautical purpose : would it
   not therefore be of great advantage to the maritime depart
   ment of this country to have young gentlemen designed
   for the service] of the sea, well educated on shore, both in
   the practice as well as theory of finding the longitude by
   the means here recommended ?

                          stand as follows :

    Hence the Longitude derived from the above observa
tions comes out 38,9 s. in time West of Greenwich, or
equal to 9' 31,35" in space.            The reason for giving the
calculations at full length has been merely to show their
simplicity ; and should they tend to induce other persons
interested   in the determination of this useful problem to
repeat them, the author's intentions will be answered. His
object has been in this instance directed only to an endea
vour to facilitate the acquirement of the method of deter
mining the Longitude by a means both simple and certain.

 Nov.  26.  Thk    Croonian Lecture, by Dr. Wollaston, was
 read.   It was an unusually brief lecture, and treated only
 on the integral molecules of crystals.          Dr. W., improving
 an ingenious speculation of Dr. Hooke, assumed the prin
 ciple, that the original molecules of matter are globular ;
 and with these globes, he very satisfactorily showed how
 many of the primitive forms of crystals might arise from
 their disposition.      He acknowledged that the assumption
 was perfectly gratuitous ; but alleged, that at present there
 is no ether mode of accounting for the tetrahedral and other
 forms of crystals.
    Saturday the 3nth November, being St. Andrew's day,
 the Royal Society held their annual meeting, at their apart
 ments in Somerset Place, for the choice of a Council and
 Officers for the year ensuipg, when the following gentlemen
 were elected :
     Of the old Council     :  The right hon. Sir Joseph Banks,
 Bart. K.   B. ;  Sir  Charles      Blagden, Knt. ; Samuel Good-

Lord Glenbervie; Philip Earl of Hardwicke ; Matthew
 Raper, Esq. ; Samuel Rogers, Esq. ; Smithson Tennant,

    Officers. The right hon.Sir Joseph Banks, Bart. K. B.,
 President; Samuel Lysons, Esq. Treasurer ; William Hyde
 Wollaston, M.D. and Taylor Combe, Esq. Secretaries.
    Dec. 10. The Society again assembled, the right hon.
 Sir Joseph Banks, Bart. President, in the chair, when a
 paper by Mr. Smithson on ulmin was read.       Mr. S. was so
fortunate as to procure a specimen from the same gentle
 man at Palermo, who originally forwarded it to Klaproth,
 and consequently operated on a substance perfectly similar
 to that of its original discoverer.  The author found that
 the characters given to the substance called ulmin by Dr.
T. Thomson are very incorrect ; and instead of its being
a resinous substance, he found that it chiefly consisted of
extractive matter united with potash.     It was very slightly
 soluble in alcohol.    Mr. S. made some experiments on the
juice and blanches of English elm, which he found some
 what different from the substance sent him from Sicily. He
 did not, however, pursue his experiments so far as to de
termine the exact nature of the matter obtained from the na
tive tree.
    Dec. 17. Dr. Wollaston, availing himself of the facts
 reduced to practice by Leslie, in freezing water by means
of evaporation in vacuo, described an instrument with
which this process might be effected for amusement. Taking
a glass tube of any length, such as used lor barometers,
making a bulb on each end of it four times its diameter,
nearly filling one of these bulbs with water, exhausting the
 tube of air bv boiling the water, and lrermeiicallv sealing
it like a thermometer, and afterwards plunging the bulb into
a mixture of salt and snow, ice would be immediately formed.
Thi* might be repeated as often as wished, in a tube three
feet long, when the effects of extracting heat from the water
would be very distinct to the eve.    1
    The astronomer royal, Mr. Pond, laid before the Society
a table of the latitudes of some stars near the north pole,
ascertained with great accuracy by means of the newly-
erected mural circle, made by Mr. Troughton, and which
Mr. P. seems to consider as approaching perfection.

surface.    The usual widih of the veins that are worked
varies from one foot to ihree; in particular instances, how
ever, portions of veins occur 24 feet or even 30 feet wide,
and on ihe other hand a vein of tin ore not three inches
wide has been followed with profit. .
   The substances thar accompany the metallic ores (or the
veinstones) vary considerably, not only in different veins,
but in different parts of the same vein ; and it is from these,
and not from ihcir metallic contents, that the miner's no
menclature of the veins is derived.
   Gossan is a friable substance of a loose texture, consist
ing of clay, mixed more or less with siliceous matter, and
coated or linked with oxide of iron ; its colour varies from
light yellow to deep red and brownish black.         A gossany
lode is more common than any other, and is considered as
promising both for copper and tin.
   When quartz predominates, the vein is said to be sparry ;
and if the quartz is considerably compact, it is looked upon
as a very unfavourable indication, more especially if ihe vein
becomes narrower as it descends.
   If iron pyrites abounds, the vein is said to be mundicky.
When this substance occurs at a shallower level, it is con
sidered as not unpromising, more especially it mingled with
yellow copper ore as it descends.
   A vein containing a large proportion of chlorite is termed
a peachy lode, and promises fur tin rather than for copper.
   A vein is said to be Jluokaiiy, when one or both of its
sides is lined w ith blueish white clay.  It sometimes is so
abundant as to occasion considerable difficulty and expense
to prevent it from' slipping down and obstructing the
works.
  When                  of a vein consist of a hard substance
             the contents
of    a greenishor brownish colour, which appears to be
chiefly a mixture of quartz and chlorite, the vein is deno
minated cuply.    Tin is often found in           it,
                                            copper rarely.
   When the ore, whether of tin or copper,       found  is dein
tached stones or lumps, mixed loosely with the other con
tents of the veins,      termed pry any lode.
                         it
                      in is        is &
     Avein abounding     blende    called blackjack lode, and
                                                  a
is considered as unpromising for tin, but       good sign of
                                                        a
copper.
     When   vein contains granite       masses or blocks, or
                                          is in

    state    semidecomposition,      it termed   groivan lode,

       is
for copper. Of late, however, many rich veins of copper
have been found      the granite district of Cornwall.

pass freely from schist into granite, and back again to
schi3t, without any deterioration.        The texture and hard
ness of both rocks is liable to considerable variation, af
fecting of course the profit and progress of the miner often,
in a very remarkable degree. Two shafts of Huel Alfred
were sunk in schist, and the cost of the one did not exceed
hi. per fathom, while that of the other amounted to 55/.
for the same length.
    The metalliferous or east and west veins are crossed by
others, the direction of which is nearly north and south.
These latter are called cross courses, and rarely produce
copper or tin, or any other metallic substances.         The prin
cipal   practical advantage derived   from  these veins, especially
when consisting of clay,          is,
                                   that they oppose an effectual
obstacle to the passage of water, and therefore the miners
do Aot willingly pierce them without some adequate object
in   view.    The disadvantage of them                  is,
                                                that they not only
interrupt the course of the metalliferous veins, heaving them
 from  a   few inches to several fathoms, but not (infrequently
 totally impoverish them, so that          long and costly search,

Jewel and Tol Cam.
    There  is   another species of vein called           contre or

   The lecture commenced         observing the difficulty of
                                     by
treating anatomical and physiological subjects in        suffi      a

 by professing an endeavour to divest it of technical phrases
as much as possible.
   The lecturer was aware that
                                               it in

complicated an organ as the ear,       was utterly impossible
to avoid the use of the technical terms but in those he
endeavoured to explain.    For the difficulty was exceedingly

   The late professor Abiigaard, of Copenhagen, discovered
some years ago a combination of alumine and fluoric acid,
hitherto unknown to mineralogists.     M. Brunn Neergardt,
of the King of Denmark's household, published, a histo
rical notice of this very rare substance, which came from
Greenland : he describes pieces in which it is surrounded
by other minerals, a circumstance which may lead to the
discovery of the kind of soil in which it h found.
   M. Lelievre, member of the class, has published another
notice of a gray mineral which he discovered in some pieces
of granitic rock sent to him from Piedmont by M.
Muthuon, mining engineer.
   M. Brongniart has completed the mineralogicatl descrip
tion of the environs of Paris, which he undertook irt
concert with M. Cuvier, by taking the level of the principal
 eminences in the district which he describes.     The results
of their joint labours have been given to the world, and
will form a valuable addition to M. Cuvier'n researches on
fossil bones.
   M. Dauxier Lavaysse, formerly a colonist of Saint Lucia,
has presented to the class a geological description of Tri
nidad, and other islands adjoining the mouth of the
Oronooko. The latter are very low, and are frequently
inundated by the river, of which they seem to be mere alluvia.
In Trinidad there   is-   lake which produces abundance of
                          a
bitumen, and towards the southern shore the sea also
throws up the same substance at two places.      Two adjacent
hillocks have small craters, and give out sulphureous va
 pours.      We there find sulphur, alum, and crystallized
vitriol.    In another part of the island there isa   mine of
plumbago and coal.       To conclude, Trinidad resembles irt
such  a  striking manner the adjoining continent in the nature
of its rocks, that there    every reason to believe, according
                           is                                    >

  like drops of water;    and  at most in the proportion of  ohe
  to thirty with respect to the former.
     M. de Beauvois, who regards the opaque grains as the
  pollen, thinks that the transparent bodies which are mixed
  there are a species of buds or bulbs', calculated to send
  forth new plants, and that it was these which germinated
  when Hedwig and other observers obtained young plants
  by sowing the dust of the lycopodii and the mosses : these
  experiments can therefore no longer be opposed to him.
     With respect to the true grains, they are placed according
  to him in a different manner in the lycopodii and in the
  mosses : the axillae of the leaves of the lower part of the
  ear contain in some plants of the former family, small
  capsules, each containing some grains larger than the dust
  of the upper capsules, which have been considered as seeds
  by Dillenius, and by all those who, like him, regarded the
  dust as a pollen.
     M. VVilldenow regards them as a species of bulbs; and it
 is the common opinion of those who will not admit any
 sexes in the mosses, the lycopodii, and the other crypto
 gam i a.
     But M. de Beauvois finds that these grains have all the
 characters of organization      assigned to the seeds by the
 most accurate botanists, and that consequently we cannot
 hesitate to regard them as such, although they have not as
  yet been discovered in all the lycopodii : he admits, never
 theless, that he has not succeeded in raising them, but this
 he ascribes to their having been in too fresh a state.
     We briefly noticed in our two former reports, the discus
 sions between our associates, Mirbel and Richard, on the
 internal composition of the grain of certain vegetables. As
 these discussions had nothing less in view than the subver
 sion of all the present systems, they were conducted with a
 warmth proportionate to their importance, and it becomes
 necessary for us to give some account of the point at which
the dispute has arrived.      For this purpose we must take up
the subject a little earlier.
    When we immerse in water a bean, for example, it soon
splits, and at the junction of the two lobes which form
the greater part of its mass, we observe on one hand a small
fleshy-like body of a conical figure, and on the other two
small leaves equally distinct.       If we had made this bean
germinate, the conical part would have entered into the
ground and would have formed the root, the two small
leaves would have risen into the air, and from them the rest
f the plant would have been continued ; the two large
                                                          lobes

  body divided into two lobes ; at two-thirds of its height
  and between these lobes, there is a small membranous sac,
  from which proceed the first leaves, and it is only after the
  stalk which bears these leaves is a little lengthened, that it
  produces laterally some small roots.
     Messrs. Mirbel and Poiteau, in conformity to a resem
 blance at least apparent, have asserted that the two lobes
  are the two cotyledons ; that the first leaves form the plu
  mule, and the sac which envelops them is a kind of
 sheath : that the radicle remains inactive and without de
 velopment,    and that the fibres which arise from the small
 stalk are analogous to those roots which issue from rampant
 plants.
     M. de Mirbel, in particular, thinks that he has found in
 the interior of these lobes, a Set of vessels entirely similar
 to those of the cotyledons in the plants which have double
 cotyledons.    These two botanists have therefore ranged the
 nelnmbo among the dicotyledones.
     M. Kichard, on the contrary, maintains that it is the
 small sac which ought to be considered as the only cotyle
 don, and ti>at the two lobes belong to the extremity of the
 radicle : he compares these bodies with those observed in
 other embryos, and to which he has given the name of
 hypoblast, being the same which Gartner called vilellus j
 and this analogy appeared to him to be the clearer, because
 the lobes in question, as well as the other hvpoblasti, exhi.
 bit no growth at the time of germination, and the contrary
is the case with most of the cotyledons.        The lateral pro
duction of the roots is a natural and general consequence
 of the presence of a hypoblastus, which hinders the radicle
from shooting out in a straight line.        According to this
¦reasoning,  M.  Richard  has classed the  nelunibo  among the
mono-cotyiedones.
    The discussion afterwards turned upon the nature of these
hypoblasti     M. de Mirbel has compared what M. Richard
calls by this name among the grasses, and which is the scu-
tellum of Gseriner, with the cotyledon of the asparagus and
some other plants which have only one, and has concluded
from the comparison, that the hvpobLstus of the grasses is
precisely their cotyledon : this would "ive him the advan?
tage of all (he analogies cited by M. Kichard."
    M. Poiteau has also given in a memoir upon this question,
taking the same side vyilh M. Mirbel.
    M. Richard, in reply, maintains that there is a greater
difference than M. Mirbel is aware of; that the plumula of
the asparagus and of the other plants mentioned, is enve»

loped in the cotyledon ; that it pierces through it ingrowing,
and that this is a character essential to the plumula of all
the monocotyledonal plants : that in the grasses, on the
contrary, the plumula is enveloped in a tunic in the form of
a cone distinct from the hypoblastus,       and that it is this
tunic, which enveloping the plumula, ought to be the true
cotyledon ; but M. Mirbel has only shown in this small
cone an excrescence, resulting from the plumula assuming
in the grain an increment, proportionally       stronger in the
grasses than in the other monocotyledons.
   Arguments drawn from plants more or less resembling
the nelumbo have been adduced on both sides.
   M. Mirbel has shown, that there exists a great resemblance
between the grains of the pepper plant and some others
clearly distinguishable as dicotyledons, in the structure of
their suckers and the grains of the nelumbo.        In truth we
do not see in the nelumbo, nor in the nymphaea, the annual
ligneou? layers which distinguish the dicotyledons ; but it is to
their loose texture, according to M. Mirbel, that we ought
to ascribe this difference.
   M. Richard has produced in his favour the families of
the hydrocharideae and the hydropeltideae, which he thinks
the nelumbo and the nymphasa most resemble, and several
genera of which have thick hypoblasti,        in a hollow of
which is lodged the plumula, enveloped with a cotyledonal
purse, although these hypoblasti axe uot divided so deeply
as in the nelumbo.
   But at the same moment with this partial discussion
another arose : two or three years ago M. Richard, ascer
taining that the division of the plants, according to the
number of their cotyledons or seminal lobes, is in some
cases obscure or even insufficient,     proposed a new one,
taken from another part of the embryo, viz. from the
structure and envelope of the radicle.
   In the plants commonly called dicotyledonal, the radicle
or the small conical tubercle mentioned above, becomes of
itself, by shooting out, the root of ihe vegetable : in
others, it is only a small sac containing tubercles, which
become the roots.
   M. Richard denominates the plants of the first form
exorhizes, and those of the second endorhizes.
   M. Mirbel asserts that this new division is still less appli
cable than the ancient ; that, in truth, the radicle of the
grasses is couformed to this description of the endorhizest
But that in the other monocotyledons there is no appear
ance of sac, but a small node at the basis of the nascent

  root, and that this node is re-produced in plants analogous
  to the dicotyledons, such as this very pepper to which he
  had already had recourse in the dispute relating to the
  nelumbo.
     Here M. Richard affirms that the pepper ix wholly mono-
  cotyledonal,   as well as the nelumbo ; and it may happen,
  according to him, that we may overturn the structure
  of the stalks of the family of the pepper plants, or that we
  may be obliged to refer to the general rule of the structure
  of the stalks, new determinations calculated to render its
  application more precise, and to banish the semblance of
  exceptions.

                        INTERIOR OF AFRICA.
  A German       of   the  name of Roentgen has been recently
  prosecuting the same objects of discovery that excited the
  ardour of the celebrated though unfortunate Park ; and,
  penetrating into the central regions of Africa, to reach, if
  possible, the city of Tombuctoo, which has never vet been
  explored by any European traveller.          The following article
  on this subject has appeared in a German journal.
     " There has been lately published at Neuwied, an inte
  resting letter from the traveller Roentgen to his brother.
  It reached him through Professor Hagen, who received it
  from Mr. Nuncmann, of London.                Roentgen, it appears,
  after visiting Paris, Vienna, and London, had repaired to
  Mogadore, where he resided a considerable time ; and the
  letter in question, dated the 21-st of July 181 1, was written
  on the bank of the river Teusiflt, at the moment of his de
  parture for the interior of Africa.        The following is some
  of the most interesting information it contains :
     *
        During my residence at Mogadore, I was engaged day
  and night in studying the Arabic, and I have succeeded in
  making myself understood by the natives of the country.
  I will avail myself of that knowledge of the country, and
  of the maimers of the people, which I have acquired, in
, order to travel directly to Tombuctoo. I would not act with
  so much boldness, were I not convinced that Providence
  has destined me to make the discovery of the interior of
  Africa.    My good stars have furnished me with a com

inclination for roaming      ; he has never since lived six months
on the same spot, and is now 38 years of' ace.                    He
knows all the European languages,  the Slavonic excepted.
Fourteen years ago, when destitute of money or protection,
he was impressed by the English for a sailor, in an island
of the Mediterranean, where he happened to be; he was in
humanly treated by them, and reduced almost to despair. His             I
ship anchored before Tctuan, for the purpose of watering;
and there having struck an English officer, who had used
 him ill, in order to avoid punishment he escaped, and be
 came a Mussulman at Tetuan.              Since then, he has tra
 versed    the Barbary States in all directions, and has lately
 returned from a pilgrimage to Mecca.              He has lived at
 Jamba, in Africa, as a coffee-house keeper, and at Janoi
 as a physician.        At Constantinople he has superintended
 the gardens of a pacha.          I got acquainted with him at a
 merchant's in Mogadore, who had hired him as a gardener.
 I have taken him into my service, and I treat him rather as
 a friend than as a domestic : the benefits which I shall de
 rive from his experience are immense.
     "  About a month ago I travelled with a caravan of mer
 chants to Morocco, where I procured valuable information
  respecting the communications with the interior of Africa.
     " It is impossible to convey an idea of the violent hatred
  which animates the Moors against Christians. Even at
  Mogadore, I could hardly go abroad without being over
  whelmed with insults.         I was obliged, in order to view the
  city of Morocco, to get an escort of four soldier's, who, by
  order of the Government,         were to keep back the populace.
  Even then I was often assailed by stones, one of which hit
  me so severe a blow on the forehead, that for some time            I
  thought myself dangerously wounded.             This hatred of the
  Moors arises in a great degree from our dress.
      " I saw at Morocco preparations for the setting out of a
  caravan, which was to reach Tombuctoo by Tafilel and
  Tunt.      I immediately formed a resolution to join this ca
   ravan, and I returned to Mogadore. My companion was
   delighted with the plan, which I did not communicate to
   any one else but to one Christian.         I caused it to be re
   ported   at Mogadore,    that,  disgusted  with the bad treatment
   I  had received at Morocco, I meant to repair to Tangier,
   and from thence embark for Gibraltar.             This pretended
   project furnished me with a pretext for purchasing a mule
   and every other necessary for my journey.           I secretly pro
   cured some Moorish garments.            Having finished my pre
   parations^   I invited some Christians at Mogadore to a panv

of  pleasure on a mountain about six English miles off,
whither they were often in the habit of going.             I have
there spent one day with them, and declared that I meant
to proceed directly for Tangier. They will accompany me
to a certain distance, and will give out at Mogadore that I
am on my way to Tangier.           As noon as I am left alone
with my fellow- traveller, I mean to clothe myself in my
Moorish garb, and to enter the great road which leads from.
Tafilet to Morocco.        From thence I shall reach Deminit,
a town     situated at the foot of Mount Atlas, where I
shall he safe from any searches which the Governor of
Mogadone^might make, should he learn that I have not
gone to Tangier. At Deminit I shall join a caravan which
will pass there about that lime, and with it I shall cross
Mount Atlas covered with snow, and next enter the burn
ing plains of Tafilet. I shall remain at Tafilet with a Ger
man renegado : there are in that city a number of Germans.
There are some Germans in Morocco, and to one of them
I  am indebted for some valuable information.         I expect to
rind a German in Tombuctoo, and there I mean to remain
six months, making it the centre of my observations on the
interior of Africa.     I shall pass for a physician ; I have
laid in a supply of medicines, of which I know the appli
cation.    It is my w ish to penetrate towards the south, and
to be able to reach Wescmb, or the Cape.           Should I find
this too difficult, 1 mean to return to Europe, to publish
the Journal of my travels ; and shall again return to Africa,
where I am destined to make some discoveries."
