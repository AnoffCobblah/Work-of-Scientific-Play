I.  Observations on the Crag, and on the Fallacies involved
   in the present System of Classification of Tertiary Deposits.
   By Edward CHARLEsworth, Esq., F.G.S., &c.”
I   DID not venture to propose a separation of the marine
    deposits above the London Clay in Suffolk, until I con
sidered myself in possession of something more than merely
conjectural evidence to justify my division of these fossiliferous
strata. That the immense accumulation of testaceous reli
quiae forming the Crag might in some places be seen to be
separated from the subjacent beds of clay by a deposit the
characters of which did not accord with the general aspect of
either of these formations, was a statement involving mere
personal observation, and which could therefore at any time
be readily refuted or confirmed.       But that this coralliferous
stratum should be looked upon as holding an intermediate
place not only in geological position, but in age, when consi
dered in relation to the beds above and beneath            was sug     it,
gesting    notion which
             a             appeared     me       to

                                                   admissible,  that
its adoption     rejection would entirely depend upon the results
                  or
attending continued investigation.       Anticipating the nature
of  the objections   which    thought
                                    I  might   probably       urged          be
against my views, endeavoured,

2      Mr. Charlesworth               on the    Crag, and on ascertaining
and the superior beds, depended upon the abrasion or natural
degradation of one deposit during the formation of the other.
I  then referred to the large proportion of Red Crag fossils
which M. Deshayes had identified with species now known to
inhabit the German Ocean (40 per cent.): consequently, if my
idea of the removal of the fossils from an older to a more recent
bed were disputed altogether, the number common to the two
crag series would at any rate indicate no nearer approxima
tion of the periods during which these Testacea existed than
that established by M. Deshayes between those of the red crag
and the Mollusca of our present seas.              Under these circum
stances, it was certainly with some degree of surprise that
I  found Mr. Lyell opposing the opinion I had advanced, upon
no other ground than that of this very occurrence of analogous
species in the two deposits”.
    To say nothing of those Sicilian strata, which contain
ninety-five percent. of existing species, it is palpably evident that
if a per centage of analogous forms, to the amount of thirty or
forty, place in one and the same geological period the races
of organized beings occurring in rocks naturally separated by
superposition and mineral character, by the same line of rea
soning must the red crag, in common with                    the other plio
                                                                     all
cene deposits,           be
                        looked upon, geologically speaking,             part             as
and    parcel    of the formations now       going  forward        the adja         in
cent seas, although these very deposits have been referred
                                                                                                  of to

a  distinct epoch          Mr. Lyell from the very circumstance
 their   containing        per  cent.           of
                                          existing species. Paradoxical
as      may appear, the facts which
it                                                one instance are made

 use of   to prove the wide interval which has elapsed between the
 deposition      ofcertain marine strata, are                   on

 whether we are comparing the present deposits with the newer

     Such then was the condition of the inquiry up to the time
of a small series of shells from Ramsholt being placed by Mr.
Lyell in the hands of M.Deshayes, and the result attending his

historic aera, the comparative duration of species, and the wide
geographical range which some extinct organisms enjoyed,
having apparently existed at the same period over an immense
extent of surface. These and numerous other inferences of
a similar kind often depend in a great measure upon the ac
curacy with which we can refer individual beds or groups of
strata to particular deposits, and trace these separate forma

                       in                                            nearly            or               so
recent Mollusca, has led Mr. Lyell                attribute    tolonger dura       a
tion  of  species           to
                          the latter.     Applying this argument             the                   to
fossils of  the crag, we find conditions             another kind; for the
                                                                of
forms which are most widely removed from existing types
occur among the corals, while the majority                 the mammiferousof
animals either closely resemble such                    are now living,
                                                                     as                                 or
can be identified with those which are imbedded                         the                 in          al
luvial  or lacustrine     deposits  above the    crag.      Hence         might               we
infer the short duration                    of
                                      the species        corals when com of
pared with the Mammalia, and consequently the still shorter

                    the relative Age        of Tertiary Deposits.                              5
period assigned to their existence if the comparison be drawn
between them and Mollusca. In this way erroneous inferences
with regard to the comparative duration of species, and other de
ductions of an equally important nature, might originate solely
in an improper identification of the crag beds with one another.
     I
     have made use of the above example as a means of showing
how desirable it is that there should, if possible, be a right
understanding as to the age of the coralline crag: but at the
same time I would observe that Mr. Lyell's line of reasoning
is one which should be applied with the utmost caution; for
though it may be quite true that the remains of the mammoth
have been found, as at Northcliff in Yorkshire, in conjunction
with recent species of Testacea, yet before we can with justice
found any argument upon the fact of their occurrence in the
same deposit, it is absolutely requisite to show that association
is a tolerably conclusive proof of contemporaneous existence :
and having settled this point, (which is often no very easy mat
ter, as will be seen in another part of this paper,) we must next
inquire whether there be evidence of anterior coexistence du
ring periods of equal duration.     The fossil elephant of York
shire is found in the red crag, one of the older pliocene de
posits; but the recent species of Mollusca with which in one
case it was associated are not to be traced back to a period of
 corresponding antiquity.        The duration which we are war
 ranted in assigning to these latter is the time which has
 elapsed since the formation of the Yorkshire deposit, while
 we can date the existence of the elephant from the deposition
of the red crag up to the period of                      its
                                              subsequent occurrence
in  the above-mentioned      locality.

6       Mr. Charlesworth on               the Crag, and on ascertaining
    When Professor Agassiz was on a late visit to this country,
I was  particularly anxious that that distinguished naturalist
 should have an opportunity of examining the ichthyological re
 mains of the crag.   With this view I endeavoured to obtain as
extensive a series of these fossils as possible, and in the course
 of the summer of 1835 I collected several thousand bones,                                            in
cluding vertebrae, teeth, and portions of palates, &c. A se
lection from these was submitted to the inspection of M. Agassiz
just before he quitted England, and the result of his examina
 tion was, that among them he could detect no recent species,
 and that there were some belonging even to genera extremely
remote from any with which he was acquainted. This was a
result which I was not prepared to anticipate, as the crag had
 been classed by M. Deshayes among the pliocene deposits, in
 consequence of the large proportion of        shells which     its
                                                                had                             he

with recent specimens, and that         has only found two       three                        or
shells which may perhaps                  be
                                  identified with living species.
      InProfessor Phillips's Guide          Geology, we find him

with organic remains.       I may however mention that there is
a large series of crag shells in the museum at York, from the
examination of which I believe his opinion has been formed.
In justice to M. Deshayes, I must now observe that there are
several individuals to whose judgement I should be disposed to
pay considerable deference, who think that in giving 40 per
cent. he has considerably underrated the proportion of recent
species, and that more than half, or perhaps three fourths of
the crag shells can undoubtedly be identified with species now
inhabiting the German Ocean.
    The Rev. Dr. Fleming, in a letter to Dr. Mitchell, F.G.S., of
London, in alluding to this subject, observes, “Many of the crag
species are deep-water species, but I would fearlessly say they
are of British origin, and I make the remark, having been an
observer and collector of British shells for more than a quarter
of a century.”
    In the annual address delivered by the President to the
Fellows of the Geological Society, Mr. Lyell particularly ad
verts to the discordance of opinion between two such eminent
naturalists as Dr. Beck and M. Deshayes, and suggests that it
may probably be attributed to their difference of opinion as to
the amount of variation necessary to constitute a distinct spe
cies. Thus, for instance, Dr. Beck would look upon those six
or eight forms which M. Deshayes includes under the name of
Lucina divaricata as six oreight distinct species of the genus     Lu
cina, while M. Deshayes would consider them as varieties only.
Now this explanation is only admissible upon the assumption
that M. Deshayes allows the existence of as much difference be
tween the crag fossils and what he now regards as their living
analogues as there is between the six or eight varieties of the
Lucina divaricata.       This is an important consideration; for if
 M. Deshayes should assert the identification to be complete
 between the crag fossils and living shells, it is evident that the ex
 planation offered affords no solution whatever of the difficulty.
    From these facts the following inference may, I think, be
 fairly drawn: that if a series of tertiary fossils be placed before
 the most eminent conchologists in different countries, for the
 purpose of ascertaining from the per-centage of extinct species
 what position in a geological series the formation should hold
 from which these fossils have been obtained, that position
 might be decided to be, eocene in Denmark, miocene in England,
 and pliocene in France; and had we fifty intermediate grada
 tions it is very possible that no two conchologists would refer
 the deposit in question to the same position.
    Greatly as the discordance of these results is to be lamented,
 as retarding the progress of geology, it must mainly be attri
 buted to the present imperfect condition of conchological sci

8        Mr. Charlesworth                    on the Crag, and on ascertaining
ence, and not be supposed to invalidate the general course of
induction pursued by Mr. Lyell.      Nevertheless it must be ad
mitted that the practical application of the principle advocated
by this eminent geologist in the classification of the supracre
taceous rocks will be extremely limited in operation; for even
if we suppose that conchologists universally admit the sound
ness of the principles upon which the present system of chro
nological    arrangement is founded, they cannot equally make
use of it as a means of obtaining numerical relations of affinity,
since the characters thought by one to constitute a distinction
of species are by another looked upon as mere modifications
of form.
   Now, if we entirely throw aside              reference    all per-cent              to   a
age     of
         species, and could substitute              place scale

  To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
    GENTLEMEN,
THE   anchor from which the accompanying drawings were
  taken, was found at Seaton, Devon, on the 25th of August
1836, nearly opposite to an opening on the coast called the
Chan, and at a distance of about 500 fathoms from the shore.
At this spot an obstacle had always occasioned damage to the
seins of the fishermen, although for a considerable distance
around this place the bottom was perfectly plain: many
attempts had been made to ascertain the nature of the hin
derance to fishing; but in vain until the time above stated,
when ropes having been attached to the subject of this com
munication, it was, by the efforts of thirty or forty persons
drawn ashore, very much, as may be supposed, to their amaze
ment.    I am told by my informant that the depth of the sea
where it was found is about 15 fathoms, and that the oldest
inhabitant does not remember that vessels have anchored
within a quarter of a mile from the spot. From the peculiarity
of   its
      form the anchor would appear            either     consider   to       be                     of
able antiquity,                  of
                       foreign make. The naval men who have
                            or
inspected            it,

to  correct some misapprehensions which               appears that gen
                                                                    it
tleman has fallen into with respect               my statementsto      the                  in
paper alluded to.
   Dr. Ritchie seems think that approve

this respect      greatly mistakes me; for distinctly stated that
                 he                                           I
was before trial      I believed the former              superior   to thebe                 to
latter; but that “after trial”              appeared
                                                   it       me that the    to
power    of all such instruments was very imperfectly developed;
which    impression   led      the inquiry and subsequent discovery
                                    to
already mentioned:            far from dissenting from Dr. Ritchie's
                                   so
opinion    as    tobar   magnets,        fully concur with him
                                              I                        be                   in

two    equal   portions,   and the other bent into the horseshoe
form, the latter will exhibit the greater power:                   far we             so
agree; but
                                                                                                  of of

hence his error. The arc and the bars should                      magnetized                     be

ITto mywith
      was   great pleasure that
        former remarks,
                                                         I
                                         read Mr. Hopkins's reply
                                         a discussion conducted in
                                          because
a proper spirit cannot fail to elicit truth, and may be the means
of stimulating geologists to investigate more carefully the im
portant question under consideration.
   The point at issue between us            Mr. Hopkins has justly
                                                     is,     as
remarked, “whether the      jointed  structure      disturbed masses    of
has been      great measure superinduced previously
              in                                               subse                         or
quently     to
           their elevation.”    Two other    topics  have been dwelt
       his reply,–the nature
 on
 in                                            of
                                     the elevatory force, and the
origin   ofveins,—both very interesting, but not, conceive,                       I                    so
easily determined             by
                        observation,      the question more imme
                                                         as
diately under discussion.
   Mr. Hopkins asserts,         that “       totally inadmissible
                                                     it      is                                        to
assume the earth's crust           have become jointed, before the
                                          to
action  ofthe dislocating force upon it.”             the other hand,  I,    on
contend that solid rocks not only existed previously               their                     to
having experienced elevatory movements, but also that such
rocks must necessarily have had jointed structure.   a         This                                    is,
I  think,   fair and plain statement
            a                                                 of
                                              the case sub judice,                                     di
vested of all its collateral intricacies: now then for the evi
dence.
    As regards the structure                   of
                                        rocks, how does the matter
stand   atthe  present  day?        we examine any formation from
                                          If
the oldest non-fossiliferous strata         the newest   tothe tertiary                of

               indeed           to

diluvial epoch, the evidence           invariably the same:
                                               is                    de                       all
monstrate that solid rocks, whether they have                 have not                  or
been subject        movements, possess
                      to                       concretional structure,

terminate masses.       And not only so, but granitic and trap
pean rocks, and even lavas, all, when solidified, are similarly
circumstanced.       Nor can this excite any wonder, since con

 there can be no doubt then that all future dislocations must
 affect a basis of solid rocks possessing lines of structure, and
 therefore would be subject to the modifying circumstances
 which Mr. Hopkins is desirous of evading.
    In opposition to this statement, can Mr. Hopkins adduce
                                              all his
 any evidence in support of             conjecture, that various degrees
of  solidification existed             the rocks subjected

were solid previously to their elevatory movements; and that
they also possessed lines of structure is more than probable,
since the fragments contained in the granite veins, in the                            el
vans, and in the two systems of mineral veins, exhibit the
same concretional forms as those into which the corresponding
rocks are now divided by weathering or mechanical action.
    Thus I have endeavoured to substantiate my former state
ment, that the elevatory force could not have acted on a solid
mass without the interference of lines of structure; a circum
stance which would produce, according to Mr. Hopkins, such
considerable modifications in the resulting phaenomena, that
“to a mass thus constituted these [his physical] investigations
must not be considered as generally applicable.”
    When        I
             commenced this reply, it was my intention to have
offered a few remarks on Mr. Hopkins's lengthened comments
on the hypothesis which I have advocated concerning the
origin of mineral veins in primary districts; but as it is im
 material, in the present case, whether the veins, granite, and
 slate are or are not                 all
                          contemporaneous,     think   best not     I            it
to have our attention diverted from the point          issue, which       at

 I    cannot, however, conclude without again acknowledg

        Interpretation                  of   Formulae        in Spherical Trigonometry.                                 19
to give some instances                         of this kind, and shall commence with
the formula
                        cos    A        = cos a -cos             b cos c
                                             Tsin b sinc                     3.
which enables us to solve the problem in which the three sides
are given, to find the angles. Now, since, if Q be any arc or
angle, cos Q = cos (2 ºr                           –
                             Q), it is plain, that if A' denote
one value of the angle A, there will be another value 2 ºr — A',
unless it can be shown that this value is excluded for some
reason not indicated by the foregoing formula.            Let the
former of these be less than two right angles; then, if the
latter, which we may denote by A", be admissible, it will be
greater than two right angles”.        In like manner the corre
sponding formulae would give two expressions, B' and B"
  = 2r         –
           B), for B; and two, C' and C" (= 2 * C'), for C.                                     –
Now the first of these, A, B, C, regarded as being each less
than two right angles, are those which are universally, and,
in a practical point of view, correctly employed. On consi
deration, however, we shall find that the latter values are just
as admissible as the former. When a great circle is described
through two points on the surface of a sphere which are not
the extremities of a diameter, the points may be regarded as
being joined by either of the arcs into which they divide the
circle: it is usual, however, to consider the smaller arc as the
one which joins them. Now, if we take on a spherical surface
three points which are not on the same great circle, and join
them in the way last mentioned, by three arcs, a, b, c, we shall
obviously divide the entire surface into two parts, each bounded
by three arcs of three great circles, and therefore each of them
a spherical triangle.    The smaller of these is that which is
usually alone considered, and         angles are A, B, C. The its
greater has for angles A", B", C"; and, having               sides,                         as a,         as
                                                                                               b,
it  answers the conditions      the problem just       of
                                                      well      the                            c              as

great circles to the horizon.   Then, if we regard these two,

the horizon they will form another triangle, which will an

Cases.
      10.   I
           shall conclude with some remarks which naturally
arise from what has been already said.
    (1.) Dr. Simson and others define a spherical triangle as
being “a figure upon the surface of a sphere comprehended
by three arcs of three great circles, each of which is less than
a semicircle.”    The words in italics should be omitted. Ana
lysis, as we have seen above, detects the error, and shows that
a side may be of any magnitude not exceeding a complete
circle.    An author, as the writers on trigonometry have done,
may properly confine his attention to triangles having each of
 their sides less than a semicircle, but he ought not to state
that there can be no others.
    (2.) The proposition is not true, in which it is asserted,
that “the three sides of a spherical triangle are together less
than a circle.” For a triangle understood in the ordinary
meaning, (as bounded by three arcs of great circles, without be
ing intersected by them,) the limit is two circles, instead of one.
To illustrate this familiarly,                      let
                                            take two points,

         APLACE      first gave a very simple, and elegant demon
          stration of the theorem generally known as Lagrange's,
by taking the partial differential coefficients of u relative to r
and a, from the equation y = a + r 4 (y), where u =                                            f(y);
and the simplicity of the process depends on the manner in
which r enters this equation, namely, as a multiplier of a
function of y.
     I
     have considered a more general equation where r enters
the function in any manner, viz. y = a + 4 (r, y) and u = f(y),
and have obtained the following theorem:
    When r is changed into r + h, in this equation y and
consequently u are also changed;        the latter become U,

two remarks.

we thus fall            on
                Lagrange's theorem.
   Secondly, that   the proposed equation were

the fundamental equation (1.) would remain the same, and
therefore this theorem admits of the same extension that
Laplace gave     Lagrange's.

                        Rev. PATRick KEITH, F.L.S.*
      LASSIFICATION               may be defined to be the arranging
        of the productions of nature in a system, so as either to
 show the mutual relation which the several subjects or groups
 of subjects bear to one another in the scale of being, or merely
 to facilitate our ascertaining of the names which have been im
 posed upon them by their discoverers or others.              In the for
 mer case the classification is        natural,  and is  exemplified,    as
 far as regards plants, in the arrangements of Jussieu. In the
 latter case the classification is artificial, and is exemplified, as
far as regards plants, in the arrangements of Linnaeus. After
all, this distinction, as M. Raspail well observes t, is more
trenchant in expression than in reality, as every good classifi
cation will have something in it both of the one quality and
of the other.
    Linnaeus, as every one knows, founded his classes chiefly
upon the number of the stamens, and his orders upon the
number of the styles. But as distinctions arising from num
ber merely are of themselves entirely artificial, so is the sy
stem that is founded upon them. They do not necessarily give
any indication of natural groups, and yet it is singular enough
that this artificial system has brought together several tribes
of plants that are perfectly natural, as the Grasses, the Papilio
naceae, the Cruciferae.        Still the study of it gives the disciple
but little knowledge of a plant beyond the name. He counts
his stamens and pistils, and becomes a perfect master of classes
and orders; but of the interior and more recondite parts and
properties, whether of stem or of flower, by which different
genera are allied and connected together, that                  the natu                is,   of

himself admitted,           the grand end and aim
                                    is                          botanical            of       all

     But in the system of Jussieu several important traits of affi

ceased, a quantity of water is to be introduced into the retort
equal in volume to that of the pyroxylic spirit employed. The
water replacing the spirit in the combination with chloride of
calcium, the latter fluid is set free and distils, perfectly free
from oil, but mixed with water, from which it can readily be se
parated by one or two distillations over recently ignited lime.
The substance thus obtained was employed in the following
 experiments:
   The boiling point at 0.744 met. barom. press, was 60° cent.

pour was determined by the method devised by Dumas:

     Temperature of air ..................            17-0 cent.
     Barometer     = 0.744 metre.
From these data follow:

XIII.        On Professor            Müllen's   Account      of the    Refler   Func
      tion of the Spinal Marrow”.               Communicated          by MARSHALL
      HALL, M.D., F.R.S., &c.
           the publication of my Memoir on the Reflex Func
SINCEtion of the Medulla Oblongata and Medulla Spinalis, in
serted in the Transactions of the Royal Society for 1833, I
have been greatly gratified to find that Prof. Müller, the justly
celebrated physiologist of Berlin, had been led, entirely inde
pendently of me, into the same path of investigation,-to
nearly similar results,-and even to the adoption of the same
designation       f
               for the special function of the spinal marrow
which is the  subject of my inquiries.
   Prof. Müller states, as will appear from the paragraph of
which, by the kindness of Mr. Paget, I am enabled to send a
translation, that the first part of his Handbuch, containing
the principles of the reflex function, was published in the
spring of 1833, the very year in which my paper was published
in the Philosophical Transactions. . I had, however, read a
short account of the same principle of action in the spinal mar
row, to the Zoological Society, the year previously, viz. 1832,
which was published in the “Proceedings of the Committee,”
and referred to in the Lond. & Edinb. Phil. Mag., vol.ii. p.477;
so that the question of priority of publication is decidedly in
my favour.   At the same time, the almost perfect coincidence
in our observations and experiments, and in our conclusions
from them, is at once most remarkable and satisfactory. The
name of Prof. Müller will not fail to give importance to the                     in
quiry; and, for my part, I recall to mind, with pleasure, the
remark of Sir Humphry Davy, that “we may generally dis
cover how our labours will be appreciated eventually, from
the opinion of contemporary foreigners, who being unbiassed
by circumstances of personality, will reduce every object to
itsjust proportions and value.”

They relate to phaenomena of the so-named sympathetic mo

the same ideas, with the same instances and observations
on narcotized animals, were propounded in the same year by
Dr. Marshall Hall, in the Philosophical Transactions of 1833.
Although these ideas were formed by us independently of each
other, yet the great correspondence in the observations and
explanations is not difficult to account for, if one considers,
that the physiology of the nerves has attained a condition, such
that in pursuing the subject the most remote observers may
at the same time be led to similar new observations and ex
planations.        I
                  shall in the following pages first communicate
my own observations, as they were originally formed, and
shall then compare them with the results of the English phy
sician and physiologist.
    “When perceptions, which are produced by external stimuli
on sensitive nerves, produce motions in other parts, this never
takes place by a reciprocal action of the sensitive and motor
filaments of the nerves, but by the sensorial excitement acting
on the brain and spinal marrow, and from these back to the
motor filaments. This extremely important principle in phy
siology and pathology requires a strong proof, which may be
very clearly attained empirically, and then explains a number
of physiological and pathological phaenomena.
  “I   shall first prove that the motor and sensitive filaments of
a  nerve, after the connexion of their two roots, do not enter into
any connexion with one another, but run separately to their
respective parts, and that therefore, even in cases where the
nervous sympathy is not in play, the sensitive and motor fila
ments of a nerve have no reciprocal action whatever.
    “The proof of this position may be shown clearly in the fol
lowing manner:          Ifa compound nerve be stimulated (after
being divided,) at      its
                         central portion, severe pain    produced,

and the animal      may   express   this pain     by

crying, &c.; but the muscular nerves connected with the                       sti
mulated portion are not excited            to
                                           action.   No twitchings
take  place   inthe muscles which receive nerves from the divi
ded trunk.

itself  to the whole spinal marrow and brain, and from thence
of  necessity excites          all
                             motor fibres.         But this irritable con
dition     excited
          is              by
                         the following causes:
   “1.     Inmany animals             by
                                     the mere division and injury                                    of
the spinal marrow.        Thus tortoises move after the head cut                               is
                                                                                                     all on
off, whenever they are touched; and young birds move
being touched immediately after decapitation,                           also  as    do
parts  of  the cut-off trunk         the lizard.
                                          in
    “2. Further, the spinal marrow                irritated
                                                          is       this degreeto

                          narcotic     poisoning         frogs,    inwell          as           as   in
mammalia, which move after poisoning with nux vomica,
whenever they are touched.              This stage excitable debility
                                                                    of
in  narcotization almost      always    precedes the stage             paralytic   of
debility.

 marrow by stimulation, produce the same phaenomenon.               In
men with excitable debility of the nervous system any unfore
seen sensation, sound, touch, or mechanical shock produces a
general start. So also in men who, by stimulation of the ge
nitals, and thereby of the spinal marrow, or by other causes,
 have acquired an excitable debility of the spinal marrow.
 We may here cast a glance at the nature of nervous irrita
tion.     All nervous stimuli may induce in succession three con
ditions.        First, excitement, in which the powers appear still
uninjured.          Second, in proportion as the excitement is re
 peated, excitable debility.          Third, atonic debility.
    “4.   A     local violent excitation of a sensitive nerve, may by
the violence of the centripetal excitation of the brain and spi
mal marrow, induce twitchings and tremblings, as after a se
vere local burn, in tooth-drawing, &c.
    “5. Local        stimulations of the nerves by inflammation or
tumours,         often also produce general spasms, or even epi
lepsy.
    “6. The irritation of the spinal marrow, originating from
local sensorial excitement, may in violent injuries be so great,
that the movements are constant, and continue even without
touching.         This irritation of the spinal marrow resulting from
severe local nervous injuries, is the tetanus traumaticus.
Every severe irritation of the spinal marrow generally is teta
nus, whether produced by narcotic poisoning or locally and
indirectly. I have here shown how the production of tetanus
traumaticus is to be explained by simple empirically deter
mined facts.
    “7. The severe irritation of the sympathetic nerves of the
intestinal canal also excites by acting back on the central
parts general spasms; and thus the cramps in sporadic cholera,
as well as the convulsions in the diseases of the viscera in
children, are to be explained.

XIV.      Reply to     Mr. Rainey's Communication in the Phil. Mag.
   for December 1836. By the Rev. WILLIAM RITCHIE, LL.D.,
    F.R.S., Professor of Natural Philosophy in the Royal Insti
   tution of Great Britain and in the University of London.
    To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
 ITsionis ofnotthewith  any wish of having the last word in the discus
                    principles at issue between Mr. Rainey and myself,
but simply with a desire of establishing scientific truth on a
    Third Scries. Vol. 10. No. 58. Jan. 1837.                 I

58                   Dr. Ritchie's Reply                      to     Mr. Rainey's
firm basis, that I again trouble you with the following re
marks.
   1st. Mr. Rainey's first false position          that “there              is,                          is   no
known limit         which soft iron ceases
                         at                     allow of further          to                                  in
duction        by    an
                  increase     the inducing power,” and
                                                 of             also                                he
takes for  granted,   that   magnet   havinga double the  power  will
induce       on
             the same armature twice the effect.      The following
experiments must convince every person that the lifter            ar                                   or
                limit       capability     its
                                          receiving  magnetism, of
                                   of to
mature has          a                                            and
                         receiving new increments diminishes ra
             its
that     capability
        a as
pidly     the inducing power increases.
    Roll covered wire about
the half     of     an
                electro-magnet
from   A to B.      Do the same
with     equal wire from
        an                                   C    to
 D. Connect the first helix
 with    anelementary battery,
and ascertain the lifting
power      the magnet. Con
            of

equal battery, and instead                        of
the lifting power being dou
bled, accCording
power may not
                     the principle assumed
                          be
                          a be to
                    increased   third                 a              or
                                                                          º,    by   Mr. Rainey,
                                                                                     or     even   a   tenth,
                                                                                                              its
if the battery      powerful one.
   2nd. The second false principle which Mr. Rainey assumes
is, that the li<U+017F>ter,                by     its
                             reaction, can induce         higher state                                         of
magnetism        the inducing magnet than what
                    in                                     naturally pos          it a
sesses.   The experiment from which                 deduces this novel     he
principle          by    no
                   means warrants the conclusion.            The experi
ment every person who knows anything                 the subject, knows     of
to     be
        correct; the reasoning                             by
                                        which the conclusion          de                               is
duced must               be
                      easily seen
                              as                              be
                                          fallacious. The experiment
                                                       to
 is,that   soft steel electro-magnet receives more powerful per
             a
manent   magnetism      when piece         soft iron
                                                 a       across of  poles         is               its
than   itdoes when the     poles  are not united.      Mr.     concludes                    R.
that “as the induction from the galvanic current was the same
in each stage        this experiment, the increase
                          of                                  permanent                  of
magnetism would appear             depend upon the reaction
                                                  to                  the                              of
keeper, which,                by
                      the converse      Dr. Ritchie's reasoning, must
                                                           of
then possess      higher state
                        a            magnetism than the magnet
                                                      of                                                       to
which     itapplied.”
               is         Here   again  Mr. Rainey takes for granted
that the induction from the galvanic current             the same     the         is                     in
steel magnet,    whether      form     closed

 itspoles are connected          soft iron,      by  interrupted circuit,
                                                                      or   an

The following experiment will set this point at rest: take a
bar of steel, A B, and bend
another of the same size and
                                                                     B

break the bar into four equal parts and the square at the corners,
and the bar CD will be stronger than either portion of the
straight bar.    I formerly stated, and again repeat the affirma
tion, that if Mr. Rainey's explanation be admitted, it will
 completely overthrow the Newtonian law of the perfect equa
lity of action and reaction.                          “I
                                       had always considered,” con
tinues Mr. Rainey, “that law as applicable only to mechanical
forces, and not extending in the least to those physical phaeno
mena, the acting cause of which is altogether unknown.
 Suppose a number of pieces of steel, properly tempered, and
for convenience made into the form of the common horseshoe
magnet, and one of them magnetized to saturation; now, by this

again pulls another to the same place and secures it in like
manner, and so on till he has secured the whole ra<U+017F>t, and it
will be found that if there be a hundred logs of wood, it will
require the strength of a hundred men to prevent their float
ing down the stream. This fact can scarcely be doubted, al
though it is at variance with the Newtonian law, as no force can
be supposed capable of generating, under the same circum
stances, a force greater than itself.

which little more scientific truth can be elicited.

         In that paper stated that “the attraction of an elec
 tro-magnet for pieces of soft iron at a distance was much less
 than that of a permanent magnet of equal lifting power. This
peculiar property rendered the electro-magnet not well suited
for magnetic induction at a distance; and hence after a few
                                             º
unsuccessful trials to substitute it for the permanent magnet in
my apparatus for continued rotation, it was long since aban
doned.” It was abandoned for this reason, not because it failed
in producing rotation, but            because it did not do it so
well as a permanent magnet.      The author in question gives the
following version of my statement: “Dr. Ritchie says that the
use of the electro-magnet in the apparatus for continued rota
tion was long since abandoned, because it was incapable of                                              in
ducing magnetism in an iron bar at a distance.” It is painful to
be forced to notice papers of this kind with which the journals
are constantly filled. It may appear to some that my asser
tions are too broad.    I appeal for the truth of them to every
person acquainted with the present state of the science.

 the one employed by Professor Daniell, and described by him in
 his paper recently presented to the Royal Society, and published
 in the Philosophical Transactions; namely, the interposition of a
 thin membrane between the two metals in the voltaic circuit, so as
 to allow of the separation of the different fluids applied respectively
 to each metal : the fluid in contact with the zinc being a mixture
of diluted sulphuric and nitric acids; and that in contact with the
copper being a solution of sulphate of copper.        The author re
serves for a future paper the details of the results he has obtained,
with regard to the relations between the intensity of effect, and the
extent and disposition of the metallic surfaces: but states that he
has obtained powerful electric action by bringing the membrane
into contact with the zinc: the latter having no acid applied to                                                       it,

putes the accuracy of Kepler's law respecting the description of
equal areas in equal times, and endeavours to confute the funda
mental doctrines of astronomy relating to the elliptical orbit of the
earth, the difference between solar and mean time, and the whole
theory of the motions of the moon and the planets.      In the second
part, the author enters into a detailed exposition of his own views
of the mechanism of the heavens; and devotes 215 closely written
pages to the development of a perfectly new hypothesis, which he
advances, founded on a supposed variation of the progressive mo
tion of the planets, in an orbit perfectly circular, and by which he
thinks he can explain                        all   the phaenomena they present                           to   observa

   Nov.  2, 1836.-A   paper was read, entitled “A general sketch of
the  Geology  of the western part of Asia Minor,” by Hugh Edwin
Strickland, Esq., F.G.S.
   This memoir embodies the observations made by the author during
a winter's residence at Smyrna, a tour into the valleys of the Meander
and Cayster, and a journey from Constantinople up the river Rhyn
dacus into Phrygia, and thence down the valley of the Hermus to
Smyrna.     In the latter excursion he was accompanied by Mr. Hamil
ton, one of the Secretaries of this Society, to whom he acknowledges
himself indebted for a zealous cooperation.
   The country, thus visited, is thickly beset with mountains, some
of which are arranged in five parallel chains having, on a great scale,
nearly an east and west bearing, but the remainder are variously
grouped and without any particular direction. Four of these parallel
chains bound the valleys of the Hermus, the Cayster, and the Mean
der; and the fifth, commencing with Mount Ida, extends eastward
to the Mysian Olympus, and probably is continued in the Bithynian
Olympus.      With respect to the theories which have been advanced
relative to the direction of a range being a mark of         comparative       its
antiquity, the author says that the whole      the mountains   of this part             of
         Minor,           parallel   not, appear
at of
   Asia          whether                       or                   to

                             of               composed, Mr. Strickland

terstratified with the slate, into which it frequently passes. The strike
of the beds commonly coincides with that of the mountain range, but
the amount and direction of the dip is said to vary greatly.
    3. Greenstone.—It is with some hesitation that the author gives a
distinct place to this rock, as he conceives that it may be of the age
of the trachytes. He observed it between Kesterlék and Adrianós,
associated, though not clearly, with the mica slate; and near the
village of Eshen he noticed a vein of greenstone traversing a tertiary
rock, and therefore believes that the extensive greenstone formation
around that village may be tertiary.
    4. Silurian rocks.-A formation of schist and limestone containing
many fossils resembling in general character those of the Silurian
rocks, was observed on both shores of the Bosphorus north of Con
stantinople.      Mr. Strickland stated that the formation would be de
scribed in a separate memoir.
    5. Hippurite limestone and schist.—This term is employed by the
author to designate the vast series of limestones, which covers a great
area in the South of Europe, and represents in Asia Minor the whole
of the secondary formations. On the south side of Lake Apollonia
the deposit consists of compact, yellowish, lithographic stone, iden
tical with that of Greece; at Mount Tartalí, on the east of Smyrna,
of compact, gray limestone, abounding with large Hippurites, and of
greenish schistose sandstone like some of the Italian macignos; on
 the eastern part of Mount Sipylus, above Magnesia, as well as in the
peninsula of Carabornou, and in the island of Scio, it also consists
of gray compact limestone; and at Mount Corax, west of Smyrna,
of schistose marls and sandstone apparently devoid of fossils.
     In addition to these localities, Mr. Strickland says, that on the
south side of the Hermus, between Ghiédiz and Hüshak, he and
 Mr. Hamilton observed a series of beds consisting chiefly of mica
ceous sandstone finely laminated, and containing occasionally beds
of rolled pebbles and soft white limestone; and though the deposit
 is unlike any other in Asia Minor, yet he is inclined to class it with
 the Hippurite limestone.
     6. Tertiary lacustrine limestone.—In the part of Asia Minor de
 scribed in this paper, every large valley, with the exception of the
 Cayster, contains remains of extensive lacustrine deposits, forming
 occasionally rounded hills several hundred feet high; but they are
 totally wanting in the narrow ravines. They consist generally of
 horizontal beds of calcareous marl, sandstone, and white limestone,
 which is often identical in composition with English chalk, inclosing
 layers and nodules of flint; but sometimes approaching in character
 to the Italian scaglia.     Near the skirts of the deposits the marls and
 limestones gradually become sandy and gravelly, resembling in some
 instances a shingle beach.      The fossils noticed in these beds belong
  to shells of the genera Unio, Cyclas, Lymnaea, Planorbis, Paludina,
 and Helix, and to leaves of dicotyledonous plants.
      As far as the author's observations extended, these testaceous re
  mains resemble more the existing freshwater shells of the North of
  Europe than those now inhabiting Asia Minor. Thus the genus Cy
  clas, common in the North of Europe, was not noticed by him in Asia

in his Mercurius Botanicus, published in 1634, record a species of
Euphorbia, as growing near Bath, which Mr. Forster has satisfac
torily proved to be the same with the plant published in the “Sup
plement to English Botany” under the name of pilosa.    It is also re
corded by Merrett in his Pinar, and in the Indiculus Plantarum
Dubiarum, inserted by Dillenius at the end of his edition of Ray's
Synopsis.   The station as given by those authors answers pretty
nearly to the locality in which the plant is now found.  Mr. Forster
regards the E palustris and pilosa as forming but one species; the
circumstance of the leaves being either glabrous or hairy he consi
ders as alone insufficient to constitute a specific difference.
   A paper by Mr. Robert H. Schomburgk was also read, On the tree
from which the Indians of the Oroonoko prepare the famous poison
called Wooraly or Ourary. The tree proves to be an undescribed spe
cies of Strychnos, and it is worthy of remark that Dr. von Martius found
that the Indians of the Amazon prepare a similar poison from a
nearly related species of the same genus. The mode of preparing
the poison appears to be confined to the Macoosies of Pirarira,
and the Warpeshanas of the Conocon mountains situated near the
equator, where the plant grows wild. The following are the name
and character of the species:

    Nov. 15.—A singular specimen of an Orchideous plant was pre
sented from Mr. Schomburgk, bearing on the same spike flowers of
Myanthus barbatus and Monachanthus viridis of Lindley, which ap
pear to be nothing more than conditions of the same species, arising
from sexual differences in the flowers. The spike has five flowers of
Monachanthus, and two of Myanthus barbatus.                 The former remain
in their normal position, but the latter are resupinate. The same
plant produced a second scape with                all

          on THE construction of oblique BRIDGEs.
   The following letter on this subject is extracted from the Newcastle
Journal of November 19th,         1836.
                           To Peter Nicholson, Esq.
SIR,--IN        reference to a lecture stated in the public prints to have
             been delivered by Charles Fox, at the Royal Institution, a
few months ago, on what he termed his “new mode of constructing the
Oblique Arch,” and stating that “formerly the stones were cut by no
general rule, but merely fitted to their particular place;" and further,
 in regard to what has been published by his desire in the “Philo
sophical Magazine” of April last, and, by “his permission”, in
 “Loudon's Architectural Magazine” of June last, —I think it an act
of justice to you, and I believe that every person who is acquainted
with the valuable instructions which you have frequently, during a
 long course of years, produced for the advancement of science, will
 concur in the propriety of setting the public right as to whom the
 merit is due, for a proper and certain rule for the construction of the
 oblique arch. I therefore deem it right to state, that in your book on
 “Masonry and Stone Cutting," published in 1828, there is an elabo
rate illustration for the working of the spiral or twist upon the stones;
 and the explanation is so clear that Mr. James Hogg, operative ma
 son, residing in Brandling Place, Newcastle, has certified that, in
  1834, he built an oblique arch entirely from the instructions which
 are given in your book; and so certain did I feel of the practicability of
your rule, that I have adopted it upon the river Coquet, at Felton,
 the chord of the arch being 33 feet, and the angle of obliquity 19°,
 and in which case the stones were cut, or dressed previously to the erec
 tion of the centre.      Having received your approval of the arch as
 being in accordance with your design, I think there can be no doubt
 that your claim to the rule for the proper formation of the stones is prior
 to that of Mr. Fox; and I have yet to learn that any rule exists by
 which the oblique arch can be so truly built as the one which you
 have published.      I am not aware, although I have endeavoured to
learn,-and shall be glad, for the sake of the profession of which I have
the honour to be a member, to discover the contrary,        that any of the
 oblique arches which have been erected upon any of the public or
 private works in the North of England, except those above mentioned,
 are constructed upon any general principle; and it is very remarkable,
 however much it is to be regretted, that up to the present time there

does not appear to have been any proper drawing prepared, nor the
necessary practical instructions given for the certain construction of
the oblique bridges, which have been built upon a very extensive pub
lic work since 1832; but that the contractors were suffered           exer                                          to

    Among these it will be seen that the entire series of Mel
loni’s important investigations are now first given to the
English public. In order to render the work useful and in
teresting, I have been advised to give a preference to subjects
which engage immediate attention in this country.                       Of this
kind are the labours of M. Becquerel upon the artificial pro
duction of crystallized minerals by means of voltaic action.
The communications of Mr. Fox and Mr. Crosse at the late
meeting of the British Association at Bristol have excited
much interest upon this subject, at the time and subsequently.
(See pp. 228 and 537 of our preceding volume.)                     What had
been done by Becquerel with regard to it appears, however,
to have been unknown both to those gentlemen and a great
part of their auditors, the only accounts of his experiments
that had appeared in this country being our short notice in
 1830, (Philosophical Magazine and Annals, vol. xii. p. 226,)
and that in Mr. Whewell's Report on Mineralogy.                        In pre
paring for publication M. Becquerel's paper I have been fa
voured with the valuable assistance of Mr. Brooke and Mr.
 Golding Bird: and for the highly important Memoir by
Mossotti I am indebted to Prof. Faraday, who kindly com
municated to me a copy which he had just received from the
author.      These occupy a portion of the Third Part; together
with the two entire Memoirs of Ehrenberg on his discoveries
of Fossil Infusoria, which are just now engaging much of
 the attention of naturalists. Two additional papers by Melloni
are now given, in one of which he describes his mode of se
parating the rays of light from those of heat. The insertion
of Von Wrede's Memoir on the absorption of light was oblig
ingly suggested to me by Professor Powell.

soda, and I now propose to continue the account of my investi
gations in this interesting department of organic chemistry.
   9. From the result of the experiments already detailed
(7.), it appeared probable that albumen after                 coagulation     its
by  alcohol was     capable        partly
                                        ofdecomposing      the carbonate
and bicarbonate         soda. An interesting inquiry instantly sug
                          of
gested itself       as whether the fluid albumen possessed
                         to                                                                      a   si
milar  property.    To ascertain how far this was actually the case,
I  mixed fresh serum          human blood, freed from fat (1.), with
                                   of
an                       of
                                                         of of

spec. grav. 1-030. On the addition              the first portion       the                  of
alkaline carbonate, the serum became slightly turbid, which
condition, however, ceased                   on
                                     agitation; the mixture was then
placed   in     flask furnished with
                a                             tube bent twice
                                                        a             right                 at
angles and dipping into lime-water; heat was then applied                                             to
the flask and continued until the mixture nearly attained the
boiling-point, when            suddenly swelled
                                   it                           nearlyup     so     as                to
reach the mouth           of
                         the vessel,    torrent
                                              a     bubbles      of

instant escaping through the lime-water, which became quite

                                                                                                      to be of
                                                                             a
diluted tincture         of
                       litmus substituted; the gas continuing                                    to
evolved,    quickly   converted the blue colour             the litmus     of

bonate nor      ofthe albumen separately evolved carbonic acid,                                       it
follows
            as
            a   necessary consequence that the albumen had been
a  sufficiently energetic electro-negative element             expel part         to
of the carbonic acid from the soda and unite with the alkali
thus set free, forming              an
                                albuminate                  of
                                                soda. The contents                                     of
the flask were     quite  transparent    after the experiment, and ex
erted   a  strong   alkaline reaction               on
                                             turmeric.       may observe     I
that, after repeating this experiment several times, constantly                   I
 found the evolution               of
                               the carbonic acid       occur only whento
 the mixture had attained the         boiling-point,   and then        take                  to
place suddenly, and almost immediately cease.

                                                    attempted,   I    using                 by
                                  albumen,

small portion        of
                     the carbonate; but         this failed altogether,
                                                                     I

 having never, under any circumstances which have yet fallen
 under my notice, been sufficiently energetic                expel all the   to
                                                             or of
 carbonic acid from any given portion            the alkaline carbonate.
    11. When the sesquicarbonate                  the bicarbonate was
    *This solution had been previously boiled for some minutes    decom                     to
 pose any bicarbonate   soda that might have accidentally been present.
                              of

 86            Mr. Golding Bird's Experimental                      Researches
 substituted for the neutral carbonate of soda, in the above
 experiments, a much more considerable evolution of the acid
 gas occurred, as might indeed have been expected d priori.
    12. I next repeated the experiment (10.), substituting for
 the carbonate of soda a (previously well-boiled) solution of
 carbonate of potash of nearly the same specific gravity, the
bent tube with which the flask was furnished dipping into
lime-water; but not the slightest opacity occurred, even after
the ebullition had been kept up so long as to cause a partial
decomposition of the albumen, evinced by the mixture assum
ing a deep-brown colour.       From the result of this experi
ment I think it  may be fairly  deduced, that although albumen
is capable of partly decomposing the carbonate of soda, yet
that it is by no means sufficiently energetic to exert a similar
action on the carbonate of potash.
   13. The result of the last experiment tends to throw a
considerable degree of obscurity over the nature of the sol
vent action exerted by carbonate of potash or albumen, for
that it does exert such an action there can be no doubt, as it
prevents the coagulation of albumen by heat; for while, in
the case of the solution of albumen in carbonate of soda, we
have sufficient data to prove that part of the carbonic acid
is expelled, and an alkaline albuminate formed; yet we are
unable to apply a similar explanation to the solution of albu
men in carbonate of potash, in consequence of our want of
evidence of         its
                  possessing sufficient energy      exert even        to                       a
partial decomposing action                      on
                                 the latter salt: we have there
fore only the alternative                  of
                               supposing that     either forms      it
ternary combination with the carbonate        potash,      thatof               or             it a
exists merely dissolved      the alkaline salt without (strictly

speaking) chemical combination.

    15. Mr. Brande was, I believe, the first who applied electro
chemical action to the detection of albumen (Phil. Trans.
1809; p. 373); and from the results of his experiments it ap
pears, that when a solution of albumen (of white of egg) was
submitted to the action of a battery of 120 four-inch double
plates excited by dilute nitro-muriatic acid, rapid coagulation
took place at the negative, whilst only a thin film of albu
men appeared at the positive electrode: the same results oc
cured when a battery of 24 four-inch plates, “highly charged,”
was substituted for the larger one, provided the wires forming
the electrodes were not more than half an inch distant from
each other; for when they were separated to eight inches,
or a smaller battery used, the albumen appeared only at the
positive electrode.    When albumen of pus was substituted for
the white of   egg, Mr. Brande found coagulation to take place
at both   electrodes;  but the size of the battery used in this
experiment is not mentioned.      Albuminate of soda (procured
by boiling white of egg in water), when submitted to the action
of a battery of 60 four-inch plates, deposited albumen co
piously at the negative electrode.       From the results of his
experiments Mr. Brande appears to have been induced to be
lieve that albumen, free or combined, always coagulated with
a strong electric current at the negative, and with a weak
current at the positive electrode.
    16. To obviate any error that might arise from the heat
evolved by the passage of electric currents of considerable
tension,   I  determined to employ small plates (2} inches
 square) excited only by weak brine; these plates were ar
 ranged in separate jars, precisely on the principle of the cou
 ronne des tasses. Thirty pairs of zinc and copper plates thus
 arranged and excited, developed a current sufficiently ener
 getic to decompose water and saline solutions with rapidity,
 and communicate a disagreeable shock extending beyond the
 wrists; but failed to heat perceptibly a piece of platina wire
 (rººm of an inch in diameter) sufficiently fine to be readily
 ignited by a single voltaic pair presenting 4 square inches of
 surface, excited by dilute sulphuric acid.
    17.I  first examined the action of an electric current on
 fluid albumen in as uncombined a state as it can readily be
 obtained: for this purpose some dilute and prepared serum of
 blood (1.) was placed in a glass cup, and by means of platinum
                                                                    byall

(17.) in two cups, connected by filaments of moistened cotton,
and placed, by means of platinum wires, in communication
with the battery of 30 pairs (16.) in the positive cup, which
I shall call A: a considerable deposit of albumen had appeared,
the contents being acid and smelling of chlorine, whilst the
contents of the negative cup, B, were limpid and alkaline. The
connexion with the battery was now reversed, so that B be
came the positive, and A the negative cup. In a quarter of
an hour the contents of A were found to be alkaline and
limpid, the albumen that had been deposited having been taken
up, whilst the fluid in B had in                              its
                                              turn become turbid (from
the coagulation         albumen) acid, and had acquired

obvious        require any explanation.

times, and always with the same results, we may safely de
duce from them the inference, that whenever albumen
coagulated under electric agency,                                    an

 the battery the positive wire oxidizes, and the oxide of copper

mechanical power of such currents, excited in liquid con
ductors by the passage of electricity, out of the positive tube ;
and hence by diminishing the tension of the electricity deve
loped (as in my experiments), such transfers may be pre
vented and the coagulated albumen constantly collected in
the positive cup.
    24. I was next desirous to examine the effects of electric
currents on an alkaline albuminate. In this combination the
albumen acts as a tolerably energetic electro-negative element,
and might consequently be expected to be coagulated at the
positive electrode.      To determine this, some albuminate of
soda was prepared as perfectly neutral as possible (2.), diluted
with water, and placed in two glass cups communicating by a
bent tube filled with the same fluid; the cups were connected
with the battery of 30 pairs of plates (16.) by means of platinum
wires: a copious and rapid coagulation ensued in the positive
cup as was expected. In this case the deposition of albumen
can very fairly be attributed to the action of the electric cur
rent; for being combined with a cation (soda) it must neces
sarily act as an anion, and hence like               anions all  deposited  be
at   the positive electrode (anode).             very weak current,

with equal rapidity, the albumen being deposited round the

manner to the negative side of the battery of 30 pairs” (16.).
In an hour a considerable cloud of albumen had appeared in
the negative cup; the fluid in the positive was, of course, acid:
to this an excess of caustic soda was added, and the whole
evaporated to dryness: on the addition of sulphuric acid to
the dry residue, an odour of acetic acid was evolved.       This
proves, I conceive, that albumen may play the part of an
electro-negative body; for whatever objections may be urged
against my deductions from this experiment, no one, I pre
 sume, would imagine acetic acid to be conveyed to the posi
 tive cup, unless it was combined as an anion with some basic
 body, which in this case could be nothing but albumen. I must
 confess, however, that albumen forms much more perfect com
 binations with bases than with acids, and appears to be more
 allied to the electro-negative than to the electro-positive bodies,
 in this respect bearing to the other products of organization
 a similar relation to that                   of silica to the inorganic bodies.

 9   k            Mr. Connell     on electrolyzing Iodic                Acid.
 though     of course always extremely happy to find the results
 obtained by others coincide with my own. In a memoir
 “On the action of voltaic electricity on alcohol, aether, and
 aqueous substances,” read to the Royal Society of Edinburgh
 in April 1835, and printed and distributed in May of that
 year amongst various individuals and societies in London
 and elsewhere, several principles of voltaic decomposition
 were examined, and amongst others the supposed general
 law, that electrolytes are composed of a like number of atoms
 of their constituent elements; and I ventured to state my
 doubts as to the universality of the application of that law;
 and as one argument in support of these doubts, I quoted the
 very experiment above set forth on fused iodic acid. After
 showing (printed Mem., p. 24.) by means of the volta-elec
 trometer that iodic acid in solution is not directly decom
 posed by voltaic agency, but that oxygen is liberated at the
 positive pole in the same definite proportion as from the elec
 tric decomposition of water by the same current, whilst iodine
 separates at the negative pole in virtue of the secondary ac
 tion of nascent hydrogen,         I
                                  observed, p. 26, that it was doubt
 ful whether “iodic acid, although it resists decomposition in
 solution, may not give way in the dry and fused state.” After
 wards, p. 35, comes the experiment itself on the fused acid
 in the following words:          “Imade some experiments on dry
 and fused iodic acid, which, from the slight affinity of                                  its
 constituents,    I  thought likely      throw light
                                                to          the subject.on
A     difficulty, however, presented itself, arising from the cir
 cumstance that when completely freed from water                  points        its
of   fusion and decomposition are extremely near one another.

was dry and hard, and was immediately transferred                   long        to    a

96       Mr. Brett on the Solubility of certain Metallic Orides
    2. The recently precipitated sulphate dissolves even in the
cold, less speedily, however, and perhaps less completely than
the carbonate or phosphate.
    3. The borate and tartrate dissolve even in the cold.
    4. The oxalate does not appear to dissolve either in the
 hot or cold solution.
    The nitrate of ammonia acts much in the same way as the
muriate, and a portion of these calcareous salts is retained in
the solution of the ammoniacal salts, even after the fluid has
been at rest for some time.
    Barytic Salts.-1. The carbonate, phosphate, and oxalate
undergo solution in a cold solution of muriate of ammonia.
    2. The sulphate does not dissolve.
    3. The borate and tartrate undergo solution in the cold
 salt. A solution of nitrate of ammonia appears to dissolve less
 of the phosphate of baryta than the muriate of ammonia: it
 acts much in the same way towards the other barytic salts.
    Strontian Salts.-1. The carbonate and phosphate are easily
 dissolved in a cold solution of muriate of ammonia.
    2. The oxalate dissolves in a hot solution of the ammonia
 cal salt.
    3. The sulphate does not undergo solution.
    4. The borate and tartrate readily dissolve.
    The solution of nitrate of ammonia appears to exert a
 greater solvent action over the oxalate of strontia than the
 muriate of ammonia does; in other respects it does not differ
 from the latter salt.
    Magnesian Salts.-1. The phosphate of magnesia and am
 moniaco-magnesian phosphate dissolve in a hot solution of
 muriate of ammonia.
    2. The carbonate and tartrate dissolve in a solution of
 muriate of ammonia.
    The nitrate of ammonia appears to exert a less energetic
solvent action than the muriate.
    Salts of Lead.—1. Carbonate of lead is dissolved in muriate
of ammonia, especially when the solution of the ammoniacal
salt is heated: when the carbonate is in small quantity it is
dissolved without heat.
    2. The oxide of the same metal is also dissolved, but it re
quires a longer continuance of the heat.
    3. The sulphate when in small quantity is dissolved with
out heat.
    4. The oxalate is dissolved, especially in the warm     ammo
niacal salt.
    5. The tartrate and phosphate are dissolved in the cold so
I ution.

            and Salts in Muriate and Nitrate       of Ammonia.           97
  6.  The ferro-cyanate and chromate are not dissolved.
  7.  The iodide is dissolved even in the cold.
  Salts of 2inc.—1. The carbonate is dissolved even in a cold
solution of muriate of ammonia.
  2. The phosphate undergoes solution in the hot salt, as
does also the oxide.
   3. The oxalate is soluble in a hot solution of muriate of
ammonia.
   4. The ferro-cyanate of zinc does not appear to dissolve.
   The nitrate of ammonia is a somewhat less perfect solvent
than the muriate.            -
   Per-salts of Mercury.—1. The oxide is dissolved by a so
lution of muriate of ammonia, especially when heat is applied.
   2. The triple salt produced by adding ammonia to a per
salt of mercury is dissolved in the hot solution of the an mo
niacal salt.
   3. The carbonate is dissolved by a hot solution of muriate
of ammonia.
   4. The phosphate and oxalate are dissolved in the cold so
lution of the ammoniacal salt.
   5. The periodide is speedily dissolved in a lukewarm so
lution of muriate of ammonia.
   6. The chromate is dissolved in the warm solution.
   The nitrate of ammonia acts in the same way as the muriate.
   Proto-salts of Mercury.—1. The sub-proto-nitrate does not
appear to undergo solution.
   2. The black oxide undergoes solution.
   3. The chloride, iodide, carbonate, phosphate, and tartrate
dissolve in hot or warm muriate of ammonia, less completely,
 however, than the persalts.
    Nitrate of ammonia is not so good a solvent as the muriate.
   Proto-salts of Iron.—1. Neither the oxide, carbonate, phos
 phate, nor prussiate seems to undergo solution in muriate of
 ammonia or in the nitrate.
  Per-salts of Iron.—1. The peroxide and       salts are its             si
milarly situated with the protosalts.
  Salis     Antimony.—1. The protoxide dissolves
              of                                        cold   in   a
solution of muriate of ammonia.
           The carbonate dissolves       in
                                     the hot solution.
   3. 2.
           The prussiate does not appear      to
                                             suffer solution.           The

      Nitrate of ammonia acts as a very imperfect solvent of the
above salts.

   The nitrate of ammonia appears        -
                                            to exert a solvent action
 only on the oxalate.
   Per-salts of Tin.—1. Do not appear to undergo solution
readily, if at all, either in the muriate or nitrate of ammonia.
   Salts of Bismuth.-1. The oxide and carbonate undergo
solution in muriate of ammonia.
   2. The phosphate and subnitrate readily dissolve.
   The nitrate of ammonia exerts no appreciable solvent ac
tion over the above bismuthic salts.
   Per-salts of Copper.—1. The oxide dissolves, as does also
the carbonate, forming a fine deep-blue-coloured solution;                                         if,

                             Genus,           Delctrir.
       YES six in number, unequal in size, aggregated in pairs on the anterior
  CA  part of the cephalothorax';   two pairs are placed laterally, their an
terior eyes being the largest, and their posterior ones the smallest of the
six; the third pair is intermediate, the eyes which constitute it being oval,
and contiguous; the entire group forms two triangles united by the apices
composed of the oval-shaped eyes.
   Maxillae enlarged at the base, externally, where the palpi are inserted,
and slightly so at the extremity; inclined towards the lip.
   Lip short, triangular, and pointed.
   Legs long, and moderately robust; the fourth pair is the longest, then
the first, which a little exceeds the second in length, the third pair is
the shortest. Tarsi triarticulate, the terminal joint being very short and
slender,
                                        Deletriz e.vilis.
   This minute spider has the cephalothorax oval, glossy, convex, pointed
before,    abruptly sloping behind.    Mandibles slender, conical, vertical.
Pectus broad, heart-shaped, convex, provided with some scattered hairs.
These parts, with the maxillae and lip, are pale red. Legs supplied with
hairs, and with two rows of spines on the inferior surface of the tibiae and
tarsi, directed down the joints, those on the first and second pairs being the
most conspicuous; they are of a pale yellowish brown colour, the thighs
having a tinge of red.     The palpi resemble the legs in colour, and are
abundantly supplied with long hairs, particularly at the extremity.      Tarsi
triarticulate; the terminal joint, which is very short and slender, has two
curved, pectinated claws at              its
                                     extremity, and      small brush beneath them.

applied at the origin in opposite directions, and perpendicular

substitution.    M.M. Desfontaines and Daubenton had         already
shown that Dicotyledonous plants are exogenous, and Mono
cotyledonous plants endogenous, and Jussieu was well enough
aware        of
            the fact.    The new terms, we admit, were not yet
imposed; but        exogenous and endogenous are respectively

identical    their extent, with Dicotyledonous plants

visions too much in the background, as well as of giving room
for the remark that the principles of the system are departed
from.    It is enough if the novel terms are introduced to the
aid and illustration of the terms of Jussieu, but not to their
entire exclusion.    Neither do the names imposed upon the
minor divisions seem to us to be any improvement.          In what
respect is thalamiflorae better than hypopetalae; or calyciflorae
than peripetalae or epipetalae?                        If
                                       neither one set of terms
nor the other is imposed in strict conformity to the anatomical
structure of flowers, why exclude one term that is faulty
merely to make room for the introduction of another term
that is faulty also? It may be true that the stamens and corolla
have always the same insertion; it may be true that, in strict
ness of anatomical speech, their real insertion is always on the
torus, but as botanical writers seem satisfied to describe them
by their apparent insertion, we are of opinion that, unless some
very obvious advantage were to follow from         the nomencla          it,

Angiospermae and Gymnospermae.                 The former seems to be

apetalous, and diclinous plants of Jussieu, in no less than 165

of the most profound adept is sufficient to qualify or to entitle
any one to do so; neither do we expect from our speculative
demonstrations a result subversive of their practical arrange
ments.      We merely claim the privilege of expressing and re
cording our sentiments, and of stating what seems to us to be
exceptionable in the above novel method; or, at the least, not
calculated to facilitate the study of the natural system, or to
improve the method of Jussieu, which stands in need of no
violent innovations to give it in appearance the preeminence
which it possesses in reality. . It requires merely a drawing
out of the resources which it has within itself, or the addition
of such supplementary distinctions as the progress of botanical
knowledge may have rendered necessary.            In defence of             in
novations, it has been said that the system, though altered, is
still but the system of Jussieu after all. True; for as there is
but one system that is natural, and that system. Jussieu's, bo
tanists cannot conjure up a new one at their pleasure. “Other
foundation can no man lay than that is laid,”—though he may
disguise the old one, and build upon it a totally different struc
ture, like Thunberg and Withering in their artificial arrange
ments. They counted stamens and pistils as did their great
master Linnaeus, but they mutilated his system and substituted
 one of their own in its room.
    But although we do not approve of the change of nomen
 clature, or of the innovations upon system introduced, whether
by M. DeCandolle or by Dr. Lindley, yet we are very far
 from wishing to depreciate the merit of their respective works;
 —works exhibiting such abundant proofs of extensive research,
 of accurate discrimination, and of just and logical deduction
 in the tracing of natural affinities, as will enable their respec

                                                        there should
 be a difficulty in unlocking Dr. Lindley's orders, even with
 the help of his analytical key, it is to be recollected that Dr.
 Lindley has never once attempted to disguise, or to palliate
 difficulties, but rather to impress upon the mind of his reader
 the absolute necessity of unremitted exertion.

  Thus the whole of the vegetable kingdom is divided into
two grand groups, without any sacrifice of the technical lan
guage of Jussieu. For although his system does not actually
exhibit a division into Cotyledonous and Acotyledonous plants,
yet it evidently and essentially involves that distinction.
Hence the introduction of the former term is only the com
pleting of the contrast which was already implied in the use of
the latter.   We have thought it right to put the group de
signated by the positive term first, because the student cannot
be supposed to know well what is meant by an acotyledonous
plant till he has already found out what is meant by a cotyle
donous one; and although the term acotyledonous is negative
in   its

spectively.
  The division of the Dicotyledons we subdivide into Dichla
mydeae and Monochlamydeae, terms invented by DeCandolle,
but not introducing any new principle that was not already to
be found in the system, and in full and actual operation. For
although the terms were not there, the things signified by them
were there, and were made available to the purposes of                                                   ar
rangement, though not designated by individual names. The
former term is equivalent to the double envelope of calyx and
corolla, and the latter to the single envelope or perianth. They
are    all
         exogenous.
    The division          of
                       the Monocotyledons Jussieu did not subdi
vide into any minor groups, and neither do we.                  We notice
merely the leading peculiarities          the        of
                                               perianth.      They   are                                  all
endogenous.
     In the whole             of
                         the above divisions,           subdivisions, the or

For although         novice might fancy that the principle                                          of   ar
rangement changes with the change                     termination  of     the                      in

corolla      uniformly and universally the same, and that what
             is

equally valid, by reducing the peculiarities to sections.   Be
yond this our remarks do not extend.      It is the part of the
experienced and practical botanist to reduce classes to orders,
or to suborders, if necessary, and to construct their diagnosis;
or rather, perhaps, by reversing the process and advancing in
the line of ascent, to reduce orders or suborders to classes;
and to the experienced and practical botanist we are content
to commit the task.                                P. KEITH.

   It is curious that the variation from theory in these deter
minations lies in the opposite direction from what is usual,
and the complete coincidence of the two experiments proves
that the deviation results not from manipulation but from the
nature of the fluid itself. The simultaneous though trivial
excess in carbon induces me to attribute both to the presence
of a trace of aldehyd, from the last portions of which, owing
to the great volatility of the formal, the latter can scarcely be
obtained free.

connexion of sensorial and motor fibres than through the spi
nal chord. In very many cases, however, after local excita
tion of the nerves, there ensue not general, but local twitch
ings, which, however, must also be constantly explained b
the spinal marrow being considered as the connecting
between the sensorial and motor fibres.                 The cases which
                                                                           i.
may be arranged here, are the following:
    “1. The simplest is the case, in which the local sensorial
stimulation, propagated to the spinal marrow or brain, excites
merely local movements, and these in the parts lying in the
neighbourhood, whose motor fibres proceed from the spinal
                                º
marrow near the sensorial.          To these belong the spasms and
tremblings of the limbs which are severely burnt, &c. Cer
tain very excitable parts of the organism, as the iris, con
tract extremely easily, when only slight stimuli excite other
sensorial nerves, and the excitement of the latter is propagated
to the brain, and from it through the oculo-motor nerve to the
short root of the ciliary                     the ciliary nerves, and the
iris. It has long been known that the iris is not excitable by
light, and that light acts on it only through the medium of the
optic nerve and the brain; this results from the experiments
                                      j.
of Lambert, Fontana, and Caldani. Rays of light passing
through a small cone of paper, or through a small hole in a
piece of paper, and thus transmitted through the pupil, and
falling on the retina, immediately induce motion in the iris,
but have no power when they                       the iris itself. The iris
 of an amaurotic eye moreover is immoveable, as long as the
 sound eye is closed, but contracts when the light excites the
 optic nerve of the latter.      The exceptions in which the optic
 nerve of the amaurotic eye still retains mobility”, may easily
 depend on an incomplete amaurosis, or if only one eye was
 amaurotic, the cause of the motion of the iris in the amaurotic
 eye was the open state of the sound eye.              The mobility or im
 mobility of the iris of an amaurotic eye can and is only to be
 investigated when the healthy one is closed.                Every observa
 tion in which this precaution has not been taken is valueless;
  Van Deen has therefore deceived himself in his otherwise very
 valuable workt, when having in a rabbit cut away one hemi
 sphere of the brain, and the optic nerve of the same side, he
 saw the iris contract on the application of a light, and therefore
 concluded, that the optic nerve had no influence on the iris.
  For as Van Deen brought the light before both eyes (ante
 oculos), the same result would follow as when the iris of an
  amaurotic eye is moved by the influence of light on the sound

 one.    Tiedemann's interesting discovery that the arteria cen
 tralis retinae is accompanied by a fine twig from the ciliary
 ganglion, cannot in this case explain anything.     For     vessels               ...           all
 are accompanied              by
                        nerves; but this twig     distributed with         is
 the arteria centralis, and        no proved connexion with the
                                         is
                                         in
 retina.    This reflex action from the brain to the iris takes
 place through the oculo-motor nerve, which according
 Mayo's experiments        every stimulus excites
                                   at                contraction                  a                         of to
 the iris”. We know from the same author that the cerebral
 end    of
         the divided optic nerve, when stimulated, still induces
 contraction.     Thus,       the contraction
                                   in               the iris there    pre
                                                                      of                               is
 sented  a  kind of “Statik” of the excitement between centri
 petal-sensorial and centrifugal-motor action through the me
 dium    of the brain.     Other nerves also may alter this equili
 brium,      as

tract by the stimulus of the excrement and urine, but these
substances act on the sensitive nerves of the mucous mem

that he has anticipated me in his inquiries on the subject, then
they are most unfortunate, since their results are perfectly at
variance with the truth. I shall quote his own words:                                                         “It

from many facts it appears, that a much stronger current is
required to change the inactive state into the active one,

fourth fact will be accounted for, if we consider that in this
case a current passes from C to F, which added to that pro
duced by F itself, becomes strong enough to call forth the
inactive state in F, though it is still too weak to render D
active; and probably only so on account of the absence of
two other opposite currents.         As to the fifth case, E becomes

Nov. 16,         Paper was first read “On indications of changes in
  1836.               relative level of Sea and Land in the West of
Scotland,” by James Smith, Esq., of Jordan Hill, F.G.S.
   In the West of Scotland are two superficial deposits. The lowest,
in some districts called “Till,” consists of stiff unstratified clay, con
fusedly mixed with boulders. It rarely contains organic remains, but
stags' horns, tusks, and bones of the elephant have been found in it
in the bed of the Union Canal at Kilmarnock, and remains of the
elephant associated with marine shells at Kilmaurs in Ayrshire.
   The upper deposit is composed of finely laminated clay, overlaid
by sand and gravel; and marine remains of existing species occur
in every part of             it,
                      but most abundantly        the clay.        has been    in                            It

Roseneath and Greenock,       points varying from 30
                                              at        40 feet above                                  to
the level of the sea. He has also observed sea-worn terraces on each
side     the Clyde below Dumbarton and between Cloch Light-house
         of
and   Largs.

analogous to that described by Mr. Lyell as now taking place on the
shores of the Baltic *.
  Of the period when the change was effected, Mr. Smith offers no
conjecture; but he states that it must have been anterior to the oc
cupation  of Britain by the Romans, because the terminations of their
wall on the shores of the Forth and the Clyde were constructed with
reference to the present level of the sea.     He also adds, that on the
banks of the Firth of Clyde there are vitrified forts and tumuli to which
the same observation applies;                        and that no human remains or works
of art have been found in the clay.
  At his first examination, the author concluded, judging from the
sea-worn terraces which skirt the coasts, that the change of level
could not exceed 40 feet, but he has since observed the clay at the
height of 50 feet; and Mr. Buchanan of Arden has found oyster
shells near Loch Lomond 70 feet above the sea.    Mr. Smith, how
ever, believes that at the period when the clay was accumulated and
the terraces formed, the relative level of sea and land was stationary,
and that, if we may judge from the comparative dimensions of the
ancient terraces with those now forming, the period during which the
level was thus stationary must have greatly exceeded 2000 years.
   The important question, if the Fauna and Flora of the period when
this deposit was accumulated were identical with those of the present
epoch, Mr. Smith says it would be premature now to determine. A
very great proportion of the species of shells, amounting in      about                           all   to
70, abound     the present seas; and

   The beds No. 1. contain, in their lower part, argillaceous nodules
resembling those of the Alum shale, and inclose great numbers of
Ammonites striatulus, Lingula Beanii, Orbicula reflera, and, in less
abundance, an Avicula, resembling A. echinata, and Terebratula bidens,
Above this nodular bed no fossils have been noticed till within 10 feet
of the top of No. 1, where another layer of similar concretions occurs,
inclosing portions of an Astacus resembling in some respects Astucus
rostratus, and a species agreeing with one found in the Cornbrash.
A little nearer the top of No. 1. is a thin seam containing great
numbers of Vermetus compressus, which is found also in the coral line
oolite of Yorkshire.

   He afterwards describes the upper beds of the Great Oolite at the
south point of Cayton Bay.             Immediately above the nodular iron
stone bed is a very thick series of sandstones and shales surmounted
by a seam of argillaceous oolite, containing Avicula Braamburiensis,

Nab (No. 6. of the section), with the exception that the nodular iron
stone is wanting.       This system of sandstone and shale, considered                                             is,

        GENTLEMEN,

                                                   two years from this                   of

 prospects of happiness, imposes upon me likewise heavy responsi
 bilities; and I can only express my fervent hope and prayer, that
 the same merciful Providence which has vouchsafed, through his
 appointed means, to restore me to sight, may enable me, like a
 willing and humble-minded scholar, to apply the lessons taught me
 by the experience of my past life, to the just and useful regulation
                                                                 I
 of that portion of my course which may be still permitted to run.
    It is my first and most pleasing duty, Gentlemen, to thank you
 for your congratulations upon my recovery, which have been con
 veyed to me in terms most grateful to my feelings.                  have on many               I
 occasions experienced both your kindness and forbearance, and                                                                I
 deeply regret that circumstances should so frequently have com
 pelled me to appeal to them: but at no moment could the expression
 of your good-will be more welcome to me than at the present, when                                                            I
 am enabled to reappear amongst you, upon being again entrusted
 with the possession of that blessing, the value of which                 have learnt                    I
 to appreciate     more    fully  by  my   experience    of     privation.           its

that the remembrance of your sympathy with my affliction whilst it
continued, and of your warm congratulations upon my happy re
covery, will ever tend to cement more closely the ties of affection
and friendship which subsist between me and the Fellows of the
Royal Society.
     My necessary absence from my duties amongst you will prevent
my entering in much detail upon the ordinary transactions of the
 Council, and of our weekly meetings during the last year; for a parti
 cular statement of which I must refer to the Report of the Council,
 which will be read to you by one of your Secretaries, Dr. Roget.
 There are only two topics connected with them to which I feel my
 self particularly called upon to allude:
     The first is the publication of the classed catalogue of our library;
 the second relates to the discussions which have been attempted to
 be raised upon the Minutes of your proceedings on the ordinary
 days of your assembling during the last year.
     It is well known to you, Gentlemen, that, after the transfer
 of the Arundelian MSS. to the British Museum, and the great
 additions which your library received from purchases and ex--
 changes of books, necessarily consequent upon that transaction, Mr.
 Panizzi was employed by the Council to draw up a classed cata
 logue of             its
                  contents.    Such     compilation        was considered would
                                                                         it

consideration the irregularities and personalities to which such de
bates would on some occasions give rise, unless very strictly                                              li
mited and very authoritatively controlled, as well as the indirect
influence which the premature expression of opinions upon the con
tents and merits of individual papers might exercise upon the deci
sion of the Council in selecting them for publication, you will be
disposed to agree with me, I trust, in thinking that such an experi
ment would be at least dangerous to the peace, as it very possibly
might prove ultimately injurious to the scientific character, of the
Royal Society.
    But let me not be misunderstood : the success that has attended
this practice in the institution which has contributed so powerfully
to the rapid advance of a highly popular science, might appear to
offer a practical refutation of such grounds of alarm as those which                                         I
have ventured to suggest; but the cases of the two Societies are
extremely different.        The science of geology is eminently a science
of observation, where facts, collected from                      all

 in which that important duty was discharged by him, or of the prin
 ciples which guided himself and his distinguished assessors, in the se
 lection either of subjects or of the authors; but a list which is headed
 by the name of Whewell and closed by that of Buckland, can hardly
 be considered as an unworthy representation of the science and lite
 rature   of this country.
    Amongst the     losses sustained by the Society during the last year,
 will be found    many  names of persons distinguished for their services
 both in literature and in science; and if we might be allowed to form
 a judgement from the very great proportion of these eminent men
 whose ages have approached the extreme limits of human life, we
 might conclude with great confidence that the most severe studies
 and the most trying climates, if pursued with temperance or guarded
 against with care, are not unfavourable either to health or longe
vity. The list which has been placed in my hands contains the names

 gret that the notice which I am enabled to take of some of the most
distinguished of their number should be necessarily so slight and im
pº  rfect.
          Pond succeeded Dr. Maskelyne as Astronomer Royal in 1810,
and retired from that important situation, under the pressure of many
infirmities, in the autumn of last year: he was formerly a member of
 Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was a pupil of Professor Lax,
whose name appears also in the list of deaths which has been just
read to you. After leaving the University, he travelled in many
parts of the East, and particularly in Egypt, partly urged by the
spirit of adventure which is natural to youth and partly with a view
 of making astronomical observations in climates more pure and more
regular than our own. After his return home in 1800, he settled at
 Westbury, in Somersetshire, and devoted himself, amidst other pur
suits, chiefly to astronomy, making use of a circular instrument of 2}
 feet diameter, which had been constructed and divided by Troughton
with more than ordinary care. With this instrument he observed
 by a peculiar method, the declinations of some of the principal fixed
stars, which were communicated to the Royal Society in 1806; and
it afterwards enabled him to establish the fact of a change of form
in the great quadrants at Greenwich, a discovery of great importance,
inasmuch as it not only led to the substitution of circular instru
ments for them in our national observatory, but subsequently like
wise to his own appointment as Astronomer Royal.
    After Mr. Pond's establishment at Greenwich, he communicated
to the Royal Society from time to time, not merely the general re
sults of his labours, but likewise his views of the theory of astrono
mical observations and of the grounds of judging of their relative
accuracy: his system was to observe differences of declination and
right ascension, making every star a point of departure for the rest,
and considering the pole as a point in the heavens whose position
was capable of a determination, equally, and not more accurate than
that of any given star. To such a view of the theory of observation,
circular instruments were particularly adapted, and there is no reason

 to doubt that the relative catalogues of the stars which were formed
 by Mr. Pond were more accurate and complete than those of any
 preceding or cotemporary observer.           Such a result, however, might
 have been reasonably expected from the great powers and resources
 of the establishment over which he presided and which he had him
 self been the chief means of calling into action.
    The method which was adopted by Mr. Pond to determine the
limits of the annual parallax of certain fixed stars by means of fixed
telescopes of great focal length, was singularly ingenious and com
plete. The existence and amount of such a parallax had been asserted
and assigned by Dr. Brinkley, in a Lyrae, a Aquilae, and a Cygni;
 but this opinion, although most ingeniously and even obstinately vin
dicated and maintained by him, was, in the judgement of most other
astronomers, most decisively negatived by Mr. Pond, who showed
that the parallax of those fixed stars, supposing                amount               its                   to    be
sensible, was confined within the limits           the errors     the most deli

cate and perfect observations which have been hitherto made. There
is no great question        astronomy, the present position and limits
                                    in                                                                            of
which are more     satisfactorily   settled.

pulation       of

plication to Physical Astronomy.       His successor, Gentlemen, is well
known to you, and needs no eulogium of mine; but I cannot omit
the opportunity which is now offered to me of congratulating the
friends of astronomy and of science on the appointment of a gen
tleman to this most important office, who is second to none in this
 country in his great attainments in almost every department of accu
 rate science, in his indefatigable and systematic industry, in his high
 sense of public duty, and in his profound knowledge both of physical
 and of practical astronomy.
    The names which I shall next bring before your notice are those
 of three men, venerable alike for their great age and public services,
 and who must always be regarded as entitled to hold a distinguished
 place amongst that illustrious body of great men, who have been pro
 duced or brought forward by the important trusts, the varied employ
 ments, and, let me add likewise, the great rewards of our Indian empire;

    Mr. William Blane was the author of a paper in our Transac
tions, written fifty years ago, on the production and preparation of
Borax, which is brought from Jumlat in Thibet, over the Himalaya
mountains into Hindostan.
   Dr. David Hosack, of New York, was the author of a paper in
our Transactions, published in the year 1794. It related to the ex
planation of the power which is possessed by the eye of adapting
itself to different distances, which he attributed to the action of the
external muscles of the eye, and not to the dilatation and contraction
of the iris, nor to the muscularity of the crystalline lens, by which its
convexity could be increased or diminished, a doctrine which had
been promulgated in a paper by Dr. Thomas Young, in the preced
ing year. This subject is one of great interest, and has been very
frequently agitated; and though an illustrious foreigner, M. Arago,
has recently defended the theory of Dr. Young with great ingenuity
and warmth, yet physiologists and anatomists are by no means agreed
on the adoption of this or any other single explanation.
  Mr. John Bell was Senior Wrangler at Cambridge in 1786,                                       and
a Fellow of Trinity College. Though labouring under physical                                    dis
advantages of no ordinary kind, and such as were apparently                                         the
most adverse to success in the public exercise of his profession                               as    a
lawyer, yet he conquered every difficulty and reached the highest
eminence by his great acuteness and strength of mind, his extensive
legal knowledge, and, not a little, likewise, by his sturdy integrity and
love of truth, which he respected,—a rare virtue—, even in advocating
the claims of a client.     Mr. Bell, with an uncommon exercise of
philosophy, retired from the active duties of his profession, whilst in
the receipt of a splendid income from                       on

thirty years of his life with studies and pursuits connected with the

     Sir John Sinclair devoted nearly the whole of a very long and
laborious life to pursuits and inquiries connected with the improve
ment of agriculture and the general benefit of his countrymen. He
was a very voluminous author; and though different opinions may
be entertained of the merit and usefulness of some of his later pro
ductions, the Statistical Account of Scotland which he originated,
and arranged, will be a durable monument to his memory, pre
senting as it does a more complete and comprehensive record of the
state of that kingdom at the period when it was compiled, than is
to be found in the literature of any other country.
     Dr. John Gillies, venerable alike for his great age and his amiable
character, was the successor of Dr. Robertson, as the king's histo
riographer for Scotland: he was the author of a History of Greece
and of the World from the conquests of Alexander to the age of
 Augustus, and he translated some of the Greek orators, the ethical,
political and rhetorical treatises of Aristotle, upon whose specu
lative works generally he wrote a very enlarged commentary.           He
was a pleasing and popular writer, though not very profoundly ac
quainted with the great advances which have been made of late
 years in Germany and elsewhere in our knowledge of archaeology
 and historical criticism.
     Sir William Gell was well known as a topographical antiquary,
and published works of great interest and research, some of them
 very splendidly embellished, on Pompeii, and on the modern, as
 illustrating the ancient topography of Troy, Ithaca, the Pelopon
 nesus, Attica and Rome. He was a very accomplished artist and a
 man of great liveliness of conversation, and of very attractive man
 ners. Sir William Gell was formerly Fellow of Emanuel College,
 Cambridge, and was attached, for some time, in the quality of Vice
 chamberlain, to the late Queen Caroline. He spent the later years
 of his life, a victim to the gout and other infirmities, at Naples, in
 the neighbourhood of those remarkable ruins which he had so care
 fully and so beautifully illustrated, and which continued to supply
  him, from day to day, with fresh objects of interesting inquiry.
     Dr. Warren, though one of the most distinguished physicians in
 this metropolis, contributed very little, by his writings, to medical or
 general literature: he was considered to be an accomplished classical
  scholar, and a man of very extensive acquirements:           he was a
  strenuous vindicator of the character and independence of his pro
  fession, and though his manners were somewhat abrupt, and some
  times apparently uncourteous, yet he was a man of very warm
  affections, and greatly beloved and respected by a large body of
  friends.
      Those to whom Dr.William Elford Leach was known in his happier
  days, when in the full enjoyment of health and reason, can best ap
  preciate the great loss which the natural sciences and our national
  museum sustained by that melancholy visitation, which, like the
  hand of death, terminated his scientific labours. His enthusiastic

 devotion to his favourite studies, his great knowledge of details,
 combined with no inconsiderable talents for classification, were
 eminently calculated to raise him to the very highest eminence as an
 original and philosophical naturalist. Though his career of research
 and discovery was prematurely cutshort, yet we are chiefly indebted
 to him for the first introduction into this country of the natural
 system of arrangement in conchology and entomology, and for the
 adoption of those more general and philosophical views of those
 sciences which originated with Latreille and Cuvier. Dr. Leach was
 the author of a paper in our Transactions on the genus Oeythoé,
 to prove that it is a parasitical inhabitant of the Argonaut. He wrote
 several memoirs in the Linnaean Transactions; an excellent treatise
 on British Malacostraca: and he also contributed largely to the
 Zoological Miscellany, to Brewster's Encyclopaedia and to the French
 Dictionnaire des Sciences Naturelles.          He died of an attack of
 cholera on the 25th of August last, at the Palazzo St. Sebastiano, in
 the province of Tortona in Italy.
    The last name which occurs in the melancholy list of our departed
 compatriot associates, is that of Dr. William Henry, to whom the
science of chemistry generally, and of gaseous chemistry in parti
 cular, is under great obligations.     He was the author of nine papers
in our  Transactions,  many   of them of great merit”; and his System of
Chemistry is one of the best written and best arranged compen
diums of that important and extensive science, which has been pub
lished of late years, whether in our own language or in any other.
 The Memoirs of the Manchester Society are chiefly indebted to
him, in conjunction with Dr. Dalton, for the high character which
they have so long maintained.        Dr. Henry, like Dr.Wollaston, made
the results of    science,  obtained by the most original and diffi
cult  researches, the foundation of a splendid fortune, and few persons
have contributed more effectually, by their discoveries and exertions
to the promotion of those arts and manufactures which form the
foundation of the prosperity of a great commercial nation.

that work, rendered necessary by new observations and by the vast
accession of new genera and orders, brought from the tropics,
South America, Australia, and elsewhere, he devoted the remainder
of his life. His later memoirs, many of which are of great value, are
chiefly contained in the Annales, and subsequently in the Mémoires
du Museum d'Histoire Naturelle.      M. de Jussieu was a man of very
simple manners and amiable character, of a social and affectionate tem
per, and a perfect stranger to scientific jealousies and intrigues. He
attained to an extreme old age, and had the happiness of witnessing
the almost universal adoption of that system of botanical arrange
ment, the establishment of which had formed the great object of the
labours of his life.

        oxy    THE REDUCTION OF METALS BY ELECTRICITY.
M       BECQUEREL,        on presenting some electro-chemical appa
      • ratus to the Académie Royale des Sciences of Paris, by the
aid of which he had been able to effect the immediate reduction of sil
ver, lead and copper,stated that, without the intervention of mercury,
by constructing an electro-chemical apparatus with iron, a saturated
solution of common salt, and an ore of silver, properly prepared, he
had extracted from the latter the silver which it contained, under the
form of crystals.    The minerals on which the experiments were
made were the ores raised in Columbia and the ore of Allemont.
 The same method has also been successfully employed to extract
 from the copper pyrites of Chessy, near Lyons, the silver which
it contains, without affecting the copper. It is only from the ar
gentiferous galenas that it is difficult to extract the silver. When
a mineral like that of Allemont contains many metals, as lead,
copper, &c., each of these metals is separately reduced and at dif
ferent times, so that the separation is easily effected. From this it
results that the ores of lead and copper may be treated in the same
manner as those of silver, but with much less facility, because of the
different degrees of oxidation which they acquire, and the com
pounds which they form during roasting.       M. Becquerel is at pre
sent occupied with further researches on the extraction of metals,
but deemed it proper, for the interests of science, to make known
to the Academy the principle by means of which he had been able
to extract some metals, particularly silver, from their respective
ores.—L'Institut, Mars 2, 1836.
  ON A SIMPLE           METHOD         OF OBTAIN ING SPONGY   PLATINA.
  To obtain spongy platina, M. Döbereiner fuses crude platina with
twice   its   weightzinc, and treats the alloys, when powdered, first
                       of
with dilute sulphuric  acid, and then with nitric acid also diluted,     to
oxidize and dissolve      the zinc, which, contrary
                            all                          theory, takes
                                                         to
place but slowly, even with heat: there       thus obtained
                                                is              an
                                                                insolu
ble greyish black residue    finely divided but impure platina, which,

when properly purified by a solution of potash and water, acts like
spongy platina, and possesses such remarkable oxidizing properties,
that it not only converts formic acid into carbonic acid, and alcohol
into acetic acid, but even the osmium which it contains into osmic
acid. This latter is soon formed when the powder of platina is dried,
and may be separately obtained by distilling the platina with a little
water.   It is immediately reduced by alcohol, and consequently is
not obtained amongst the products of the oxidation of this liquid.

   This method, recommended thirty years since by Descotils, is
an excellent one for the preparation of platina in a state of minute
division, and is chiefly applicable in working large masses of native
platina like those of the Oural, and also for the preparation of the
spongy platina employed for absorbing             and for the produc
tion of acetic acid.—Jour. de   Pharmacie, July 1836.
      ON THE DECOLORIZING COMBINATIONS OF CH LOR IN E.
   M. Martens, in a former memoir on this subject already published,
offered experiments and arguments which tended to show that the
decolorizing chlorides ought to be regarded as feeble combinations
of chlorine and basic oxides. Some short time after this M. Balard,
of Montpellier,  again raised a doubt on the question, and by his
discovery of hypochlorous acid and of decolorizing hypochlorites,
appeared to have proved that the opinion M. Martens had advo
cated was incorrect; that is to say, according to M. Balard, these
bleaching compounds ought to be considered as mixtures of hypo
chlorites and chlorides, agreeably to the hypothesis of Berzelius.
Returning to this first memoir and comparing the properties of
hypochlorites with the decolorizing chlorides, M. Martens has ar
rived at results which, in his opinion, do not permit us to confound
the two compounds, and which serve to confirm the former view
of their composition as chlorides of oxides. We now proceed to
the principal facts contained in the present memoir, and which
the author considers he has established by his experiments.
   1st. The binoxide of chlorine of some chemists must be consi
dered as an acid under the name of chlorous acid: it forms com
pounds with the compound alkaline oxides (oxides alcalins com
posés (alkalis P)), which may be called chlorites, and which are de
composed by almost           all
                            the acids, with effervescence and disen
gagement     of
              chlorous acid.
   2nd. The chlorites may          be
                                obtained             in      by
                                               the solid state    evapo
ration, without decomposing, taking care that they have excess       of
base,  or,rather, that they possess             an
                                          alkaline action.   When they
are saturated     so   as   to
                         indicate  neutrality  with litmus  paper, their
solutions, when they are concentrated                or
                                                evaporated, are decom
posed into chlorates and chlorides, like the chlorides       of  oxides,
with the difference         of
                         affording     proportion
                                         in        much more chlorate
than the latter.
   3rd. The chlorites possess     extremely powerful decolorizing and
                                    an
oxidizing action, like the chlorides       oxides and the hypochlorites
                                                of
of M. Balard. Those which are not saturated with chlorous acid

do not destroy colour, except by the intervention of an acid, but
the others decolorize instantly, like free chlorine.
   4th. The chlorites, even when mixed with metallic chlorides,
possess    all   the characteristicproperties which distinguish them from
the decolorizing chlorides         oxides; and, amongst others, that
                                             of                                                                            of
the disengagement         chlorous acid,
                                of             the addition      acids, instead
                                                                 on                             of
of   chlorine, which, under these circumstances,             evolved from the         is
chlorides of oxides.
    5th. The chlorites are analogous              the hypochlorites   to      M.                                    of
 Balard    as regards their  decolorizing    and oxidizing power, but are
much more stable.
     6th. Although the hypochlorites, mixed with metallic chlorides,
                                           it in by
 disengage only chlorine          the addition       acids,                of
                                                                M. Balard has                  as
 rightly observed, and are               respect  analogous       the decolor
                                    this                                                        be to
 izing chlorides         of
                      oxides,       need not necessarily          inferred that
 their chemical constitution           the same, since hypochlorous acid
                                                  is
 itself, acting     onmetallic
                        a      chloride,   evolves only chlorine. We may,

  ON THE ACTION                   OF AN HYDROUS SULPHURIC ACID ON SOME

   M. Itose, in the course of his memoir, notices the researches of
L. Gmelin, which         have shown that anhydrous sulphuric acid decom
poses common salt in a very different manner to what the hydrated
acid does, for although the first converts it into sulphate of soda
like the second, yet in the first case the sodium is oxidized at the
expense of the sulphuric acid, and during the decomposition sul
phurous acid is disengaged along with chlorine. M. L. Gmelin, and
after him MM. Sertürner and Döbereiner, made                            their experi    all

            Messrs. R. C. Taylor and    T. G.  Clemson on
                                argillaceous rock succeeds to the
  serpentine and alternates with the euphotides.
                Guanabacoa, and indeed throughout a large por
 tion of the island of Cuba, the prevailing course or strike of
  the rocks is about east and west; but in the vicinity of the
 coal we unexpectedly found that the direction changed to
 north and south.
     The coal vein of Casualidad is visible at opposite extremities
  of an excavation thirty feet deep, of a quadrangular form,
  descending on one side by steps cut in the soft rock or clay
  which bounds the coal on either side. This soft rock is fra
 gile, incoherent, distorted, of a yellowish green colour, like
  the prevailing euphotides, of which it is a variety.       A few
 feet to the eastward of the vein there occurs a hard blue sili
 ceous rock, containing small cavities that are partially filled
 with a leek-green mineral which we conceive to be a variety of
 serpentine.
     In close connection with the above, a beautiful diorite oc
 curs, the base of which is petrosiliceous, tinged with green,
 which colour is caused by a mixture of serpentine. This
 rock is very hard, and has a highly crystalline structure.       It
 crops out at several points
    The siliceous rock, the diorites, and the euphotides alter
 nate the one with the other.    The two first mentioned are in
 much less proportion than is the third, which is by far the
 most predominant rock of the country.
    All these are highly inclined, and frequently are vertical;
 their direction, as before stated, being north and south, in the
 neighbourhood of the mine.                       -
    Appearance of the Coal Pein. — The vein commences or
crops out immediately under the thin alluvial soil of the sur
face, and follows an irregular, but nearly perpendicular direc
tion downwards, so far as it has been traced, and as shown in
 fig. 1.
    It is visible to the depth of full thirty feet; but the bottom
of the excavation being covered with mud, which had been
washed in during the rainy season, we could not readily define
the breadth of the vein there; but it was stated by the over
seer to be nine feet thick.       From even this small opening
many tons of pure coal had been extracted, and were deposited
in a large building adjacent.
    On the north side of the excavation the vein is solid; having
a thickness gradually increasing to four feet at the depth of
twenty feet. The coal lies in parallel horizontal layers, of
from one to four inches in thickness, across the vein.      Some
times these layers appear to have their horizontal position par

          a Vein     of Bituminous Coal in                      the   Island of Cuba.               163
tially disturbed, particularly near the outer edges, in which
case they were slightly curved. Where an accidental derange
ment of the vein has taken place, this curving up of the outer
edges or extremities of the planes of stratified bituminous
matter is particularly observable.    Near the walls of the vein,
the laminae of the coal for a few inches in depth are deflected,
as if they had been pressed by the sides or walls.     Here the
structure becomes bacillary, and the coal on the slightest
effort divides into irregular polyhedrons.   The surface of this
coal, when detached from the walls, instead of being smooth
or covered with any kind of bituminous shale, is rough, and
presents a bacillo-fibrous appearance, similar to the structure
observed in arragonites and other fibrous minerals.      Two or
three small branches or <U+017F>ilons are seen passing from the main
vein at about the depth of twenty feet, occupying small fissures
in the surrounding rock. These branches         rise towards the           all
surface, but      at
                different angles.

any we have before witnessed in any part of the world. It is
distinguished from the ordinary deposits of coal, in as much

notice, is not the only one in the island of Cuba where this
remarkable variety of coal exists. Nearly contemporaneously
with the discovery of the coal of Casualidad, it has been ob
served about midway between the cities of Matansas and
Havana, not far from the sea-coast. If this be not a pro
longation, at the distance of six leagues, of that we have
here described, it is an additional evidence of the great pre
valence of bituminous matter in the serpentine and eupho
tides of Cuba.      The vein at this position has not yet been
 worked, nor have mining operations been arranged at either
position.     Some barrels of the coal from near Matansas have
been   lately received at Philadelphia as specimens.
    We are not aware that any other of the West India islands
contain coal in sufficient quantity to be worked.      In Jamaica,
it appears, on the authority of Mr. De la Beche, coal exists
in veins of an inch or two in thickness, occurring stratified
 with the usual coal-measures and carboniferous rocks; but
 these veins are too insignificant to be worth mining.
    Of the geology of St. Domingo we know very little, and
 shall probably remain ignorant for a long time to come.
    It were an interesting fact, if it be as we conceive, that this
 is the first discovery within the tropics, in this part of the
 globe, of workable veins of remarkably pure coal.

XXXIII.        On Mr. Peter Nicholson's Rule for the Construction
           of the Oblique Arch. By CHARLEs Fox, Esq.             -
  To the Editors of the Philosophical       Magazine and Journal.
     GENTLEMEN,
          seen in your last Number (p. 75) a letter extracted
 HAVING
   from the Newcastle Journal, addressed by Mr. Henry
Welch to Peter Nicholson, Esq., in which he states “the
propriety of setting the public right as to whom the merit is
due, for a proper and certain rule for the construction of the
oblique arch,” and subsequently says,       “I
                                          think that there can
be no doubt, that your claim to the rule for the proper forma
tion of the stones is prior to that of Mr. Fox, and I have
yet to learn that any rule exists by which the oblique arch
can be so truly built as the one which you have published;”
I feel, therefore, bound in justice to myself, briefly to notice
 it,and also because the principle laid down         my former
                                                       in

168         Mr. C. Fox on the Construction of the Oblique Arch.
pear to have been clearly understood by the writer of the letter
in question.
   The two points to be determined are, whether my rule is
identical with Mr. Nicholson's; and if not, which is the better
of the two.
   That they are not identical I hope will be evident from the
following facts; and which is the better of the two must be
left to the judgement of your readers.
    No one would for a moment hesitate to acknowledge the
obligations which practical men are under to that highly ta
lented individual Mr. Peter Nicholson; but on referring to
his Treatise on Masonry and Stone-cutting (plate 17), it
will at once appear that the intrado is the only surface de
veloped, and the approximate line being laid down upon                                                     it,
 all the courses are drawn       right angles     that line; the
                                                   at                               to
courses therefore are drawn with reference           the intrado                  to
only. Now my plan           make use     neither intrado nor ex
                                        is
                                        to                        of
trado for this   purpose, but   lay  down      the courses upon
                                                   to                       all
a  supposed intermediate surface: the two plans are therefore
not identical.
    Now the reasons why       conceive my plan I     possess ad                        to
vantages superior     Mr. Nicholson’s are these. On referring
                                   to
to  vol. viii.  this Magazine, Plate III. fig.
                         of                          will   seen                  6,   it          be
that the angles               of
                        the courses,         shown      as
                                                        the developed       in                             in
trado and     extrado,    differ   very  considerably,   even more than
 16°:    will therefore
        it                       obvious, that
                                         be         the angle      ifthe                      of           in
trado      adopted     for the rule (as                      by
                                                Mr. Nicholson) then the
angle       of is
            the extrado will                      be
                                        wrong; and again,          the angle                if
of the extrado were adopted for the rule, then the angle                 the                          of
intrado would be incorrect; for                  either case the thrust
                                                              in
                       be

                       in                          of
                                          the abutment, which          every                     in

   Now        use my own words (vol. viii.           302),             p.
                                                                     evident           “It    is

XXXV.    On the Results of Mr. For's Eaperiments on the               Pre
       duction of artificial Crystals by Voltaic Action.
WEJournal,
    have alluded in page 83 of the last Number of this
            in reference to a paper by M. Becquerel in
the Third Part of the “Scientific Memoirs,” to the commu
nications of Mr. Fox and Mr. Crosse at the Bristol meeting
of the British Association relative to the production of artifi
cial crystals by voltaic action. We are now enabled, by the
kindness of Mr. Fox in sending specimens of the altered
ores for examination, to give a more exact account of the re
sults of his experiments than we could otherwise have done.
    Mr. Fox's own statement is as follows: “The experiment
referred to was performed in the following manner:—An
earthenware trough was divided by a partition of moistened
clay into two cells, into one of which was put a piece of the
yellow sulphuret of copper, the cell being filled with a solution
 of the sulphate of copper, and into the other a piece of zinc,
 and the cell filled with water, either pure or slightly acidu
 lated by sulphuric acid.    The zinc was then connected with
 the  copper   ore  by means of a copper wire passing over the
 wall of clay. This simple voltaic arrangement soon rendered
 the surface of the copper ore highly iridescent, then purple,
 and in the course of a few days gray, the gray crust being
 covered with metallic copper, deposited in brilliant crystals,
 and with a slightly greenish soluble salt. This crust resembled
 gray sulphuret of copper, and increased in thickness after the
  operation had been continued several weeks.”
     The crust on the specimens received from Mr. Fox was
  thin, and the quantity so small that an exact analysis of it
  could not be made. But the result of the examination to which
  it was subjected approached so nearly to that of the Cornish
  sulphuret as to warrant the conclusion of          its
                                                  being the same
  chemical   compound.    The soluble salt was found          sul
                                                                to   be
                                                                     a
  phate of   copper and iron, which accounts for the iron that
  the yellow copper ore had lost during       conversion into sul
                                               its
  phuret.
     Mr. Fox considers that, assuming the gray crust           sul
                                                                 to   be

   that metal; and likewise why the former        generally found

 peculiar action of this metal is caused, first, by a thin layer
 of oxide which is formed round the iron wire under these cir
 cumstances; and, secondly, by the property of this oxide to
 be insoluble in nitric acid of a certain degree of concentration.
 According to Faraday, therefore, the real cause of the inac
 tivity of the iron would be purely mechanical; that              the                    is,          in

iron and nitric acid do not come into actual contact. In the

active and    passive.   Faraday   would   explain  this appearance
 by  the supposition that       one instantat   pellicle      oxide                          of

       DEAR SIR,
      AM     much obliged to you for a sight of M. Schoenbein’s
      paper, the experiments and observations in which are ex
 cellent.     The cause of the phaenomena he has so well distin
 guished is indeed exceedingly difficult to be distinguished
 at present, and I was in hopes that the doubt on my mind
 when I ventured the view referred to would be evident from
 my words, “My strong impression is,” &c."                          Moreover,
 M.     Schoenbein,      and also M. Alb. Mousson in an attempt
 which he has made to explain the causet, have not given
 my view clearly.             I have said, that my impression              that                                is,

This is going much further in the idea of association without
combination than I have done. I merely mention the fact for
the purpose of directing M. Schoenbein’s attention to the con
dition of the iron and steel plates in Nobili's experiments.
My own impression at present                              is,
                                              that Nobili's thin plates
consisted        of
                 peroxide             of
                                lead formed       the positive electrode
                                                                 at

                       acetate      lead used; ofand that      just pos            it    is
sible some of the differences between his tints and those of
Newton may depend upon, and some                     his conclusions of                             be
          by,                             peroxide     lead has power
                                                                          in of
affected       the circumstance that                                                      a
 ful specific action         light, and

Mr. Alan   Stevenson, the assistant-engineer, explained to be,
that since the divergence of the reflected beam is produced
by placing the lamp a little out of the focus of the mirror, the
central pencil of reflected light is much less scattered than the
lateral pencils, which in an azimuth [azimuths] exactly inter
mediate between the axes of two adjacent reflectors is [are]
very feeble indeed.    The evening of the 26th was neither re
markably clear, nor remarkably the reverse, and the members
of the Committee were satisfied that a slight increase of haze
would have rendered the old light wholly invisible at the
town of Dunbar, which appears to be placed (in the present
temporary position of the reflecting system) in the line of least
illumination.
  The number of mirrors in the old                        being twenty
                                                                   system

certain portion of light is thrown                           all

the   intensity     different directions varies (as has been said)

  But it is not to be inferred that the ratio of the intensities
of the two svstems will remain the same at all distances.
Were the refracted light in one plane (instead of having a
vertical divergence of 6°), and were the reflected light com
 prised within a cone uniformly illuminated (which is not the
case), the light from the first would vary inversely as the                                   di
stance, from the second inversely as the square of the sum of
the distance and a constant which depends upon the diver
gence; but neither of these conditions being fulfilled, the re
spective illuminations must vary with the distance, according
to two other distinct laws, each much more complicated.              It
is  clear, therefore,  that the  comparison    made at one    given                           di
stance will not apply to any other given distance.             But still
the effect of distance in modifying intensity, may be much
more accurately estimated in the case of the prismatic than of
the reflecting arrangement.
    The following conclusions seem to be warranted:
    1. That, at a distance of thirteen miles, the mean effect of
the new light is very much superior to the mean effect of the
old light (perhaps in the ratio of two to one).
   2. That at all distances the new light has a prodigious su
periority to the old, from the equality of          effects         azi
                                                                  its         in        all
muths.
    3. That the new light fulfils rigorously the conditions re
quired for the distribution        light      of
                                            the greatest advantage.
                                                        to
   4.  That       distances much exceeding thirteen miles, the
                        at
new light must still                 be
                                very effective one, though

extent the Committee have not observed. The             light   under             is

by the observations made at Copenhagen, Koenigsberg, &c.
   In comparing the observations made at places situated on
the borders of the Annulus, with the computation according
to the elements of the Nautical Almanac, I find a better act
cord by assuming for latitude correction —7"-63, and for
correction of the sun's semidiameter — 1".5, and for correction
of the moon's semidiameter + 0°-5.
   These corrections have been previously applied in the fol
lowing calculations.    B means beginning; BA, beginning of

1.
     Tostance
          exhibit Newton's rings a lens of a long focal di
              is generally considered necessary, which is both
expensive and difficult to obtain.         In a lecture which de                     I
livered nearly two years ago in the Royal Institution, I showed
a very simple mode of performing the experiment, which,                                    I
have no doubt, will be acceptable to many of your readers.
Take two circular pieces of thin plate glass (Dutch plate)
about six or eight inches diameter.
   Gild a ring of one of the plates about a quarter of an inch
broad from the circumference of the circle with gold-leaf,
place the plates over each other, and by means of a rectan
gular frame of iron or brass and a screw, bring the plates to
touch in the centre.        Let a b
                    º
represent the glass plates,               BC
the rectangular       frame, S a
screw, and A a projecting point. B
   By means of the screw the
plates will be             to touch
in the middle, whilst they are
separated at the circumference
by a single gold-leaf. When this is held so that light from
the sky or a lamp falls obliquely on the plates so as to be re
flected by the under plate to the eye, the rings will present
themselves in circles round the dark spot in the centre.
   2. Procure a prism of good flint glass, having one of
angles containing           70                                                            of its

                                 or
                                degrees.     Place two thin slips
metal with smooth edges              opening  an     window-shutter, in
through which the white light                  of
                                      the clouds     admitted. View
this film     light through the large angle
              of                                                of a

                                                      the prism kept
close    to
          the  eye, and the   principal  fixed lines     well   many      as    as
of the others will          be

   XLI.      On a Method of producing Achromatic Light in Solar
      and Ory-hydrogen Microscopes, and on the Effect of a Cur
      rent of Air upon the Rays that occasion Heat. By the Rev.
       J. B. READE, M.A.*
       T  will no doubt be admitted, that the experiments of Mel
        loni on radiant heat and light have not only given us much
  insight into the nature of these two agents, but have also
  tended to solve the important problem which had been raised
  as to their identity.        Henceforward, therefore, any new facts
  can    occupy   but a    secondary    place, and, however interesting
  in   themselves,    their real value must depend on their conform
  ing to a theory which has already been independently proved.
     "the received theory                    is,
                                    that the luminous and calorific rays
  are two      essentially  distinct modifications which the aethereal
  fluid suffers         in    its
                            mode                   of
                                       existence, and that they may                                              be

of  temperature is indicated by the thermometer at the foci of
these two lenses. It appears, however, upon trial, that the
crossing of the rays between the lenses so materially affects
the illuminating power, when a terrestrial source of light is
tused, that the applicability of this arrangement to the oxy
hydrogen microscope becomes extremely questionable. I have
therefore proposed two new methods, which appear both to
improve the light and to remove                     all

thing would be easier than to direct a continued current upon
a thin screen of glass placed just behind the object in the mi
 croscope, by which means the uniform and low temperature
 thus steadily maintained would ensure perfect safety even for
 the most delicate animalcules.
     Under the impression that some change would be indicated
 by the thermometer if a current of air were impinged upon
 it when it indicated the ordinary atmospheric temperature, I
I                 F.
 directed against the bulb about thirty blasts with the bellows.
    confess        not prepared to find, after just witnessing the
 rapid fall of the mercury, that a decidedly opposite effect would
be produced.       The mercury, however, now rose in different
 thermometers, placed both in the house and also in the open
air, between five and seven degrees. In each experiment the
 bellows, before they were used, had acquired the temperature
 of the surrounding air, and the first four or five blasts pro
 duced at least one third of the whole elevation.          We have,
 therefore, before us these two facts, that a current of common
 air is a powerful absorbent of the rays that occasion heat; and
 that in the blast of bellows by which this current is main
 tained there are equal and opposite forces tending to produce
 equilibrium. These two forces consist in a refrigerating and
 a calorific current, which have each a separate existence. The
 former is effective if the mercury be artificially raised, and the
 latter if it indicate the temperature of the air.       In the first
 case the calorific principle in the solar ray is imparted to the
 current of air and absorbed ; and in the second, the calorific
principle in the current of air is imparted to the thermometer
and retained.      And hence it must be admitted, however it may
appear to contradict our sensations, that the blast of a pair of
bellows is at least 5° warmer than the air they receive. To ac
count for this fact it is only necessary to refer to the general
law established by Clapeyron, whose memoir on the motive
power of heat has found a place in Part I. of Mr. Taylor's new
and very valuable quarterly publication entitled “Scientific
Memoirs.” The law at which Clapeyron has arrived, and

                 [Continued from p. 129, and concluded.]
     MARSHALL HALL distinguishes
“DR.muscular                                                       four kinds of
             contraction: 1st, The voluntary,                      which appears
to depend on the brain; 2nd, The respiratory", which appears to
depend on the medulla oblongata; 3rd, The involuntary, which
depends on the nerves and muscles, and requires the immediate
application of stimuli to the muscles provided with nerves, or
to their nerves; and 4th, The reflecting, which continues, in
part, after the voluntary and respiratory have ceased, and is
connected with the medulla spinalis. It ceases after removal of
the spinal marrow, though irritability does not diminish.       In
this fourth the motor stimulus does notoriginate in a central part
of the nervous    system, but at some distance from the centre;
it is neither  voluntary   nor direct in     course, but rather ex

  acting on the sensitive mucous membrane, and this per
  ception exciting the medulla oblongata to discharge in the
  motor nerves.         Dr. Marshall Hall regards the further act
 of    deglutition   in the oesophagus as the effect of the stimulus
 acting immediately on the muscular fibres of the oesophagus,
  and the result of the irritability of the latter, which may ap
  pear very doubtful*. Even in beheaded young animals we
  may, however, as already shown, observe the reflected mo
  torial excitement still following mechanical stimulation of the
 pharynx. Dr. Marshall Hall next shows the permanent                                      in
 fluence of this function in the sphincters.          The sphincter ani
 remains closed in a tortoise after decapitation, so long as the
  lower part of the spinal marrow is uninjured, but instantly
 becomes flaccid and opens, when the spinal marrow is re
 moved.
     “Dr. Marshall Hall divided the spinal marrow in a live Co
 luber matria between the 2nd and 3rd vertebrae.            The motions
 ceased at once, and when the animal was not stimulated it re
 mained quiet. But if it were stimulated, it continued moving for
 a long time; for at every altering position new parts of                                 its
 surface came          contact with the ground: gradually
                         in                                        again        it
 became     quiet,  but the   slightest touch  again   renewed the mo
 tion.
     “Dr. Marshall Hall shows very beautifully the relation                               of
 the voluntary, respiratory, and reflected motions, when             en              he

 deavours                that the reflected motions which take
 after loss        the brain are not dependent on true sensation,
 but only        the centripetal nervous actions which take place
      sensations. Sensation, will, motion, are the three links
of in the chain, when        motion

 the commencement of the narcotization of an animal, on the
 sensitive stimulus of the skin the muscles of the stimulated

                                           the morsels       food produce    of

in   other words, the easiest way for the current               vibration           or                   is

 these currents        vibrations takes the shortest way, acting from

   From this experiment Dr. Ritchie not only endeavours to
convince every person of the absurdity of my views, but so
deeply is he impressed with the correctness of      indications                        its
that conclusions are deduced from       even with arithmeticalit
precision.                                                                                                  :

other.      On extending this experiment to compound magnets,
I was at    first surprised to find that the attraction          of   the   or
dinary keeper exceeded that of the interrupted one by con
siderably more than double. These keepers were applied to
two compound magnets, the one having three plates, and the
other five, of about the same size. The interrupted keeper was
attracted nearly the same by each, but the common one was
held much more firmly by the magnet having the greater
number of plates. This brought to my recollection a fact
which had often appeared very surprising, and for which                      I
could find no explanation. After taking to pieces a compound
horseshoe magnet consisting of eight blades, and of consider
able sustaining power, I found that the quantity of magnetism
in each blade was very trifling, and apparently far too little to
account for the attractive power of the entire magnet. These
magnets were each remagnetized to saturation, but the same re
duction in their power took place on replacing them with their
similar poles in contact. They were made of very soft steel,
and after having their extremities hardened they lost much
Hess by the contact of their similar ends: this improvement was
not so perceptible on the application of the keeper to the whole
magnet as to the individual parts.        The explanation of these
facts appears   to be as follows: When magnets are placed with
their similar poles in contact, they lose a considerable quantit
of their magnetic influence. The absolute amount of loss                    .#
depend upon the temper of the steel; the harder it is the less
it will lose: and also upon the number of magnets; the more
there are the less will each magnet retain.        Now, if the inter
rupted keeper be applied to a compound magnet, it will be
attracted only with a force equal to the quantity of residual
magnetism, which being very small the attraction will be com
paratively feeble, though probably a correct measure of the
absolute strength of the magnet. When the common keeper is
applied, it will be obvious, from the double source of induction
by which it is influenced, that   itsstate   magnetism will exceed
                                              of
that   ofthe weakened magnet, and by reacting upon           increase
                                                                 it
 itspower.    The    magnet  having   thus  acquired        an
                                                          addition           of
magnetism will now react more forcibly upon the keeper, and
the keeper    in    its
                     turn upon the magnet, and             so
                                                        on, until the
resistance from the contact      of the similar poles, and the na
ture   of the steel, cease to allow     of
                                        any further induction from
                                  º
this source. The softness   of the steel and the number      magnets
                                                                 of

But after the experiments were finished this was by no means
the case, the error having become variable owing to the inter
fering action of a small spring employed to bring the index to
zero.   As this, however, only affects the absolute results (or,

     1. The external deposit.—Exposed         to the flame of a wax
candle, it blackens, and gives out the usual smell of burning
animal matter, the thin laminae of which it is composed sepa
rating and curling up like films of horn; appearances similar
to those exhibited by membranous shells when heated. When
the flame is urged by the blowpipe, the laminae separate still
more, and are changed into an extremely light and brittle
enamel, pure white, and having a pearly lustre.              A fragment
moistened on the back of the hand gives a sensation of heat, as
quicklime does when so treated. The substance, when thrown
into dilute muriatic acid, is entirely dissolved; the fluid is
tinged yellow, and the effervescence produces a froth, like beer.
When the acid is very much diluted, and a portion of the sub
stance is suspended in           the solution takes place gradually,

 the same effect        as   on
                          the external   deposit,  except  that the sepa
 rated laminae are thinner.       The action of muriatic acid          the                           is
 same, but the yellow tinge          deeper, and the froth

 204             Mr. Horner          and   Sir David Brewster         on
 Pinna and some other shells, a prismatic crystalline arrange
 ment      of the particles perpendicular to, and passing uninter
ruptedly through, the laminae; but I have not discovered such
an arrangement in any portion of the incrustation, even when
examined by the microscope.
     I
     felt very desirous that this singular deposit should be ex
amined by Sir David Brewster; the more especially as he had
long since directed his attention to the peculiar structure of
mother-of-pearl”.      On showing him the specimens in my pos
session he observed, that it was one of the most remarkable
artificial productions he had seen; and he readily undertook
to examine it carefully.    He shortly afterwards sent me the
particulars of that examination, which had afforded some cu
rious and interesting results. Having subsequently visited
Catrine, I procured more perfect specimens; and I sent these
to Sir David Brewster, in order to ascertain whether they
might not afford something new, in addition to the results he
had obtained from the fragments he had formerly examined.
They did so, and I now subjoin the very interesting account
which Sir David has given me of the properties he has disco
vered in this new substance.
           MY   DEAR     SIR,                               Belville, Jan. 1st, 1836.
     In the communication which I had the pleasure of address
 ing to you on the 20th of January, 1835,                         I
                                                       gave a brief ac
 count of the observations I had made on the        highly  interesting
 substance which     you  had   put  into  my  hands;  but as   the spe
 cimens which you sent me a few days ago are so much supe
 rior to those with which I made my former experiments, and
 have led me to some new and I think rather extraordinary re
 sults, I shall include in the present letter                   all
                                                     my former obser
 vations.
    The substance        question does not resemble             general      its
                                                                      I in

lac of the same thickness. The laminae of which                    com     is
posed are sometimes separated                  by
                                          vacant spaces,   other timesat
slightly coherent, but generally adhering           each other with

hering plates are separated, the separated surfaces are some
times colourless, especially when these surfaces are corrugated
or  uneven; but they are almost always covered with                                an   iri

 by   slightly inclining the plate the red light disappears, and the

 2O6                   Mr. Horner and Sir David               Brewster on
  distinct image becomes brighter and
                                                    whiter. All the three
  images, A A, B B, and C C,

  united into a mass round D, at
  a perpendicular incidence, but B
  they separate upon inclining
                                       the
  plate, and their distance
                                 increases
  with the inclination.
       Ifwe examine the nature of
  the light of which these images
  are composed, we shall find that
  the nebulous images, A A, B B,
  are wholly polarized in a plane
  passing through the
                             direction of
 their length, while C C and the
 greater part of D are polarized
 in an opposite plane. As the
 thickness of the plate increases,
 more and more of the distinct
 image, D, is polarized in the
                                     same
 plane, as in mother-of-pearl”,
 till at a certain thickness the
 whole of it is thus polarized.
 In this case               all
                       the doubly re
 fracted light which forms the ne
 bulous image,                A   A,
                                and the
 bright one,                D,               of
                       consists       two
 oppositely polarized pencils, the
                                          one forming the nebulous and
 the other the distinct image.

                                       these phaenomena,                we

 nate, both the reflected and the transmitted light would ex
 hibit that prevailing colour: but if their surfaces are undu
 lated as in mother-of-pearl, from the form of the shell and
 other causes, if the iridescent films vary in thickness, and
 consequently in colour, if they are wanting in some parts of
 the shell, and abound in others,     and if films of equal thick
 nesses occur in several laminae in succession, and films of
 other thicknesses in other laminae, which must necessarily
 take place from the varying and remitting action of the animal
 agent, then we shall have the very structure which is necessary
 for the production of the incommunicable colours of mother
  of-pearl.
          I
       have no doubt that this is the true cause of the phaeno
  mena which had so long perplexed me; and the results which
  I formerly obtained, though I could then attach no meaning
  to them, are in perfect unison with the preceding views. In
  order, however, to obtain something like an experimental
  confirmation of this opinion, I have examined the fracture of
  a mother-of-pearl shell where the laminae have been          de                   all
  posited with considerable regularity, and where their over
  lying edges are exhibited, and       find distinct and positive

   The Council have awarded a Copley Medal to Baron Berzelius for
his application of the Doctrine of Definite Proportions in Deter
mining the Constitution of Minerals. To the labours of this distin
guished chemist, science is indebted for many of the facts by which the
Laws of Definite Union were established. As early as 1807, soon after
Dalton and Gay-Lussac had made known their views on this vital
branch of modern chemistry, Berzelius commenced an elaborate ex
 amination on the proportions in which the elements of compound
 bodies are united, beginning with the salts, and subsequently extend
 ing his researches to                 all
                                   other departments           his science,                                     as               to

   The Royal Medal for                     which the Council had
                            the present year,
proposed to give to the most important paper in Animal Physiology
communicated to the Royal Society within the last three years, is
awarded to George Newport, Esq., for his series of investigations
on the Anatomy and Physiology of Insects, contained in his two pa
pers published in the Philosophical Transactions within that pe
riod.
    Mr. Newport, to whom the Society was indebted in 1832 for a
very valuable and elaborate anatomical investigation of the nervous
system of the Sphinx ligustri of Linnaeus, and of the successive
changes which that insect undergoes during the state of larva, and the
earlier stages of the pupa state, published in the Philosophical
Transactions of that year, has since prosecuted this arduous and      la
borious train of inquiry, under circumstances of peculiar difficulty,
with extraordinary zeal and indefatigable perseverance.      Within the
period of the last three years he has enriched the Transactions with
two papers, in the first of which, read to the Society in June 1834,
he has extended his researches into the structure and arrangement of
the different portions of the nervous system of the same insect, fol
lowing their successive changes through the remaining stages of de
velopment to the completion of the imago, or perfect state. He
devotes particular attention to the study of the periods at which
those several changes occur; for he has found that they vary consi
derably in the rapidity of their progress at different epochs, according
as the vital powers are called into action by external influences, or
as they become exhausted by their efforts in effecting the growth, or
modifying the form of different systems of organs. The labours of
Mr. Newport have determined, with great exactness, those periods,
which had not before been ascertained.
    Among the numerous original observations of Mr. Newport on the
arrangement and connexions of the several parts of the nervous
system, the description he gives of the origin and distribution of the
visceral nerve, which he shows to be analogous to the pneumo
gastric nerve of vertebrated animals, and also of the system of nerves
corresponding to those which have been considered as peculiarly
subservient to the supply of the respiratory organs, are particularly
deserving of notice.    In the course of this investigation many new
and important facts are brought to light, which had escaped the
observation of Lyonet, Müller, Brandt and Straus-Durkheim.           Mr.
Newport has also traced a remarkable analogy in the origin and dis
tribution of the two distinct classes of nerves, the one subservient
to sensation, and the other to volition, belonging to insects, with
those belonging to vertebrated animals, and has thus given greater
extension to our views of the uniformity existing in the plans of
animal organization than we before possessed, and which are thus
made to comprehend the more minute, as well as the larger tribes
of the animal creation.
  In a memoir    on the Respiration of Insects, more recently commu
nicated to the  Society, and of which, at  its
                                             last meeting   in June, the
title only could be  announced,  Mr. Newport   has, with great  diligence

and success, investigated the variations occurring   in this function in
the different periods  of insect development.   He has minutely traced
the several changes which the tracheae and spiracles undergo during
the transformations of the insect, and has particularly described the
successive development of the air-vesicles in connexion with the
power of flight.    He has given a minute and accurate description of
the system of muscles, both of inspiration and of expiration, of the
Sphina ligustri ; has investigated their various modes of action, with
reference more especially to the different classes of nerves appro
priated to these functions; and has established a distinction in the
offices of these nerves, corresponding to the sources from which they
derive their origin, and presenting remarkable analogies with similar
distinctions in the nerves of vertebrated animals.    He has given the
result of a series of original  experiments on the products   of respira
tion in this class of animals, and of their variations under different
circumstances of temperature, of submersion, and of confinement in
unrespirable and deleterious gases; and he has deduced important
conclusions relative to the circumstances which govern the proper
ties of oxygen consumed and of carbonic acid generated.           He has
also communicated various results to which he has arrived concerning
 the capabilities which insects possess of supporting life during
 longer or shorter periods, when immersed in different media.
    For the original views presented in these two papers, as well as
for the mass of valuable information they contain, the results of
much laborious and well-directed research in the more difficult de
partments of the Anatomy and Physiology of Insects, prosecuted
under circumstances which would have repressed the exertions of a
less ardent inquirer into truth, the Council have considered Mr.
Newport as highly deserving the distinction they have conferred
upon him by the award of the Royal Medal for Animal Physiology in
 the present year.
    The Council propose to give one of the Royal Medals in the year
 1839 to the most important unpublished paper in Astronomy com
municated to the Royal Society for insertion in their Transactions
 after the present date, and prior to the termination of the Sessions

   December 8, 1836.-A paper was read, entitled, “Inquiries re
specting the Constitution of Salts.   Of Oxalates, Nitrates, Phos
         Sulphates, and Chlorides." By Thomas Graham, Esq., F.R.S.
  2din., Professor of Chemistry in the Andersonian University of
Glasgow, Corresponding Member of the Royal Academy of Sciences
of Berlin, &c. Communicated by Richard Phillips, Esq., F.R.S.
   The results which the author had obtained from his former expe
riments, and of which he communicated an account to the Royal
Society", suggested to him the probability that the law with re
spect to water being a constituent of sulphates, would extend also
to any hydrated acid and the magnesian salt of that acid. ...As he
had already found that the sulphate of water is constituted like the
sulphate of magnesia, so he now finds the oxalate of water to re
semble the oxalate of magnesia, and the nitrate of water to resem
ble the nitrate of magnesia.       His researches render it probable that
the  correspondence      between water and the magnesian class of oxides
extends   beyond    their character as bases; and that in certain subsalts
of the  magnesian     class of oxides, the metallic oxide replaces the
water of   crystallization   of the neutral salt, and discharges a func
tion which was     thought    peculiar to water.   In the formation of a
double   sulphate,   the author finds that a certain degree of substitu
tion or displacement occurs; such as the displacement of an alom
of water pertaining to the sulphate of magnesia, by an atom of sul
phate of potash, to form the double sulphate of magnesia and pot
ash. The same kind of displacement appears to occur, likewise, in
the construction of double oxalates; and the application of this
principle enables us to understand the constitution both of the
double and super-oxalates, and to explain the mode of their deriva
tion.
   The author then proceeds to apply these principles to the analy
 sis   of                                                              hydrated

cludes, from his experiments on this subject, that there is no proof
of the existence of a single supernitrate.
    In the third section he discusses the constitution of the phos
phates.        Phosphoric acid, he observes, is quite peculiar in being
capable of combining with bases in three different proportions;
forming, besides the usual class of monobasic salts, containing one
atom of acid to one atom of protoxide as base, two other anormal
classes of salts, in which two or three atoms of base are united to
one atom of acid, namely, the pyrophosphates and the common
phosphates, as they are usually denominated, but which the author
proposes to designate by the terms, bibasic, and tribasic phosphates.
Arsenic acid forms only one class of salts; but that class is anormal;
every member of it containing three atoms of base to one atom of
acid, like the common, or tribasic, phosphates.                     These anormal
classes of phosphates and arseniates, with, perhaps, the phosphites,
are, the author believes, the only known salts to which the ordinary
idea of a subsalt is truly applicable:                 other reputed subsalts be
                                                             as all

   December 15, 1836.-A paper was read, entitled, “Further Ob
servations on the Optical Phenomena     of Crystals.” By Henry Fox
Talbot, Esq., F.R.S.
  The author had described, in a former paper*, the remarkable cir
cular mode of crystallization frequently occurring from a solution
of borax in phosphoric acid, and producing, when examined by the
polarizing microscope, the appearance of a black cross, with four
sectors of light, and occasionally coloured rings, upon each crystal.
In the present memoir, he describes some deviations from the usual
forms of crystalline circles; the most striking varieties consisting in
 the cross being itself highly coloured, instead of black, upon a
 white ground.       The author shows that these crystals consist of bo
 racic acid alone, resulting from the decomposition of the borax by
 the phosphoric acid.        He gives an explanation of the optical ap
 pearances they present on the hypothesis of their being constituted
by an aggregate of acicular crystals, radiating from a central point,
and the whole circle being of variable thickness at different distances
from    its centre, and acting with great energy               polarized light.
                                                                     on
 Other modes       ofcrystalline formation, dependent chiefly           the pre on
sence   or   absence     of combined     water,  are next described.      These
sometimes produce crystals composed                 two opposite sectors
                                                      of                                  of

 plumose appearance, accompanied with the same analytic proper
 ties, is obtained from the evaporation of a drop of a mixed solution

   January 19.—“Researches towards establishing a Theory of the
Dispersion of Light." By the Rev. Baden Powell, M.A., F.R.S.,
 Savilian Professor of Geometry in the University of Oxford.
    The author here prosecutes the inquiry on the dispersion of light
which was the subject of his former papers published in the Philo
sophical Transactions for 1835 and 1836, extending it to media of
higher dispersive powers, which afford a severer test of the accuracy
of M. Cauchy's theory. He explains his methods of calcula
tion and the formulae on which his computations are founded, and
which are different from those employed in his former investigations:
and then states the results in a tabular form. On the whole he con
cludes that the formula, as already deduced from the undulatory
theory, applies sufficiently well to the case of media whose disper
                                                                                                It of it,

species, besides many, that are identical with those found by Dr.
 Wallich in Nepal. The most interesting additions to the present
 genus consist of five species of the section Avicularia.       We sub

            Read, Some Observations on the Manna of Mount Sinai,
and the Dragon's Blood Tree and Aloe Plant of Socotra. By Lieut.
Wellsted.
   It is in Wady Hebron that the Manna is obtained by the Bedouins,
who collect it early in the morning, and after straining it through
cloths they put it into skins or gourds. The quantity collected
in the most favourable seasons does not exceed 700 pounds.        A
considerable quantity is consumed by the Bedouins themselves, but
a portion is sent to Cairo, and some is disposed of to the monks of
the convent at Mount Sinai, who retail it to the Russian pilgrims,
by whom it is received with much reverence as an incontestible proof
of the truth of the event recorded in Scripture. The substance is
only collected in seasons after heavy rains, for it has been known to
be wanting for a period of seven years.         When recent it has the
consistence and flavour of honey, and is of a deep amber colour.
   The Dragon's Blood Tree of Socotra appears to be identical with
that of the Canary Islands, which is the Dracana Draco of Linnaeus.
In Socotra it is rarely met with below the altitude of 800 feet, and
it is frequently seen growing on the granite peaks at an elevation of
4000 or 5000 feet above the level of the sea. The gum exudes spon
taneously, or from artificial incisions in the trunk. The season most
favourable for obtaining it is in June, immediately after the setting of
the   S.W. monsoon.
   The island of Socotra has been famous from the earliest period
for    Aloes; but that article
      its                       export has
                                   of        late years fallen into

neglect,    sothat not more than two tons were exported          in  1833.
The plant abounds     all over the island, and      most probably identi

Halley's Comet since January.
    The number of meridian observations thus obtained is upwards
of thirty. The reductions will be forwarded in a short time; the
delay arising from Mr. Maclear being employed in observing the
stars of the Brisbane list, in aid of Sir John Herschel, who, he states,
is now occupied in reducing his Catalogue of Southern Nebulae.

reduced mean places, from which the catalogue is formed.         As this

  }}  On the Projection of Maps and Charts. By Professor Littrow.
  Three kinds of projections are chiefly had recourse to in the
construction of maps, –the orthographic, the stereographic, and
the central. The object of Professor Littrow is to deduce the ge
neral properties of these three principal projections, which, though
they differ from each other in no other respect than in the situation
of the eye and perspective plane, with regard to the principal circles
of the sphere, have hitherto been always treated as distinct and                                 in
dependent problems.
   The concluding part of the memoir contains some general re
marks on the solutions of the general problem by Gauss and                                      La
grange; and a demonstration that Gauss's formulae (contained in a
memoir a translation of which appeared in Phil. Mag. and Annals,
N.S., for August and September 1828,) are comprehended in those
of Lagrange, the latter being only particular values of the former.

   Professor Struve hoped, in June last, to complete his extended
catalogue of double stars, containing           all
                                          the observations made since
those already published        his well-known Catalogus Stellarum
                                   in

tioned catalogue contained 3112 stars; from which the professor
has, for various reasons assigned, excluded 490, and has added                                    64

the southward of the town of Jedburgh, who afforded him every fa
cility for making the observations. The morning of the 15th of May
is described as being remarkably fine and clear; not a cloud to be
seen in any part of the heavens during the whole time of the eclipse.
The times of the beginning and ending of the eclipse, and of the
formation and dissolution of the annulus, have already been given
in the third volume of the monthly abstracts of the Society's pro
 ceedings, page 200. But Mr. Baily does not lay much stress on this
 part of his observations—more especially those connected with the
 annulus—since his attention was taken up with other more interest
 ing phaenomena.        He says he was in expectation of meeting with
 something extraordinary at the formation of the annulus; but ima
 gined that it would be only momentary, and consequently, that it
 would not interrupt the noting of the time of                  occurrence.             its                                 In

  the annulus consequently became wholly dissolved.                       This remark
  able and singular phanomenon was also observed by Mr. Veitch,
  and by Sir Thomas Brisbane, as well as by Mr. Henderson at
  Edinburgh; with some slight differences, however, in the detail.
  The appearance of the dark lines, or threads, was likewise noticed
  by Mr. Bell, at Alnwick, who sent an account of the same to the
  Philosophical and Literary Society at Newcastle.                       Mr. Baily de
  scribes them to have been as plain, as distinct, and as well defined,
  as the open fingers of the human hand held up to the light; and
  that there could not have been any doubt as to their form and ex
 istence, since they were seen by different observers, at different
 places, and with different telescopes.                 Several drawings accom
 panied the paper, showing the appearances at various stages of the

 to have been about eight : in which opinion he was confirmed by
 Mr. Veitch. Sir Thomas Brisbane, however, thinks there were not
 more than six; whilst Mr. Bell, who noticed four at the dissolution
 of the annulus, says that there were only two at                              its

   1st. A quantity of hydrosulphuric acid gas is formed during the
action of sulphurous acid upon steel, which is not disengaged, but
is decomposed as soon as formed, by the sulphurous acid, which
causes the separation of sulphur.
   2nd. Liquid sulphurous acid, which has been digested for a suffi
cient time upon steel, contains, besides the sulphite, a portion of
hyposulphite of protoxide of iron, and this solution,

 partially reduces the proto- and per-salts of mercury.
   3rd. Concentrated liquid sulphurous acid, digested in close ves
sels with excess of steel, forms small crystals of a greenish white
colour, which are insoluble in water, and act like a hyposulphite
                                                                     of
iron with excess of base.
   4th. The residuum which is left when steel is treated in close
vessels with a sufficient quantity of sulphurous acid, is not pure car
bon, but consists of carbon mixed, besides sulphur, with a
                                                              basic hy

pile of Volta or the trough of Cruickshanks, is the instru
ment which we habitually have recourse to for illustrating
chemical decompositions, and the other effects of voltaic elec
tricity requiring considerable tension. Various constructions
of this battery are in use, of which we are concerned only with
that originally suggested by Dr. Hare, but of the value of
which electricians were not aware till it was clearly demon
strated by Mr. Faradayt. The existence of a defect, however,
is fully admitted by Mr. Faraday, in the construction which he
recommends. To prevent metallic contact between contiguous
copper plates, cartridge paper is interposed between them.
The paper becomes saturated with the acid solution used as
the exciting liquor, and the acid cannot be washed out of the
paper, but is retained by it after the battery is laid aside, and
may then occasion the solution of the copper, seeing that zinc
no longer enters into a circle with the acid and copper, and

242      Mr.  J. Young's  Account    of a new Voltaic Battery,
 therefore the latter is unprotected.       These papers require
likewise to be renewed    occasionally,   and they give to the con
struction the character of a       temporary   arrangement.      It is
true that glass or porcelain plates may be placed between the
contiguous coppers; but these are inconvenient, and, in fact,
bring us back to the old construction of the trough partitioned
into cells. It is to be noticed too that these copper surfaces,
with the paper between them, are lost, and turned to no ac
 count in collecting electricity.
   After constructing several batteries with the interposed
papers, and becoming fully sensible of the annoyance which
the papers occasion, an arrangement of the plates suggested
itself which does not require interposed papers, and in which
both surfaces of the copper as well as of the zinc plates are
made available. Within the last eighteen months I have con
structed several dozens of instruments of the construction to
be described, and having compared them experimentally with
batteries of the same extent of copper and zinc on Dr. Hare's
construction, I am prepared to state that, from the same sur
faces of zinc, electricity the same in quantity and tension is
produced in both forms, but that in the new construction this
effect is produced with half the quantity of sheet copper, which
arises from both sides of the copper plates being presented to
surfaces of zinc.    The new construction has, I believe, all the
advantages of approximation of the plates and compactness of
Dr. Hare's battery, which have been pointed by Mr. Faraday,
without the great and acknowledged drawback of the inter
posed papers.
   The sheet copper and sheet zinc to be used in this battery
are first cut into long ribbons, of the breadth which it is        in
tended to give the plates. Suppose the ribbons two inches
broad; both the copper and zinc ribbons are then divided
into lengths of five inches, and a portion cut out as in fig. 1.
The slip is thus divided into two squares of two inches each,
which are connected at A, and a piece is left projecting at B.
The zinc and copper sheets are cut up exactly in the same
way.     Fig. I therefore represents either a single zinc or a
single copper plate. The plate is then bent at A, and pre
                                     .
sents the appearance represented in fig. 2.       In fig. 3, we have
two  plates, one of  copper   C,  and the other of zinc Z, which
are exactly alike in construction, but are placed differently,
as shown in the figure.      Thin projecting parts B B are sol
dered   together,  and this is the         metallic communication
between them which is allowed to exist.        Fig. 3, therefore, is
only one copper and one zinc plate, or it is one pair of plates.
Each pair is made up in the same way. In arranging a num

being a Modification                         of that         recommended by               Mr. Faraday. 243
ber of pairs to form a battery, they are interlaced so that a
copper square comes in between each couple of zinc squares,
and a zinc square between each couple of copper squarès.                          It
is easy to see how this arrangement can be made, when the
plates are in the hand, though it is difficult to describe                                                       it.     At

ing set at liberty; and as the hydrogen assumes the gaseous
form, it annuls or carries off a large portion of the electri
city”.
    If sulphate    of copper be used in charging            the battery    in
stead    of acid, oxygen is supplied to the zinc by the oxide of
copper; no evolution of gas, therefore, takes placet; and the
action is thus rendered continuous, the effect being fully equal
to that momentarily produced by immersion in acids. The
fusion of metallic points of very large dimensions, the decom
position of fixed alkalis, &c. &c., cited in my former commu
nication as the effects of a voltaic battery of 100 pairs on
Cruickshanks's construction, cannot be produced by the same
battery when charged with acid, the momentary power being
exhausted before the battery can possibly be brought into ac
tion f.
    The following is an experiment to ascertain the effect on the
 battery produced by the deposition of copper on the zinc plate.
 Fig. 10 represents one of the zinc plates of the battery: round
it at (a) are placed four copper wires one tenth of an inch in
diameter; these are each attached to the plates by a drop of
solder. Fig.11 shows the zinc plate surrounded by the copper as
 in Wollaston's plan: the battery consists of twelve such series.
 It is clear that there are four small local currents in each cell;
yet the power of the main current is increased, and not dimi
nished as I conceived it would have been.                  From the proxi
 mity of the copper wires to the zinc plate, there is no deposi
 tion of copper on the zinc plate; it adheres to the copper wires
 so firmly that it is exceedingly difficult to remove.
     I  find that amalgamating the zinc greatly increases the
 power of the battery, and prevents the strong adherence of the
 copper to the zinc plates, which are therefore cleaned with
 facility S. I have a battery of 30 pairs of four-inch plates
    * A similar effect takes place in the formation of steam, which causes the
 gold leaves of an electrometer to diverge with negative electricity.
    Professor Faraday has shown that a voltaic current ceases to affect a
 magnetic needle if employed in the decomposition of a solution of iodide of
 potassium : hydrogen is given off in this case. Again, if a battery be     en
 ployed in decomposing a solution of a metallic salt, an atom of it will be
 decomposed for the solution of every atom of zinc ; but this does not de
 stroy the current, for an atom of water is at the same time resolved into
 its elements.
    + The exceedingly small quantity produced by the local action cannot
  be taken into account.
    t This fact I am ready to prove by actual experiment to any scientific
  gentleman who will do me the favour to call for that purpose.

    §. The zinc plates are amalgamated by rubbing them
 acid and mercury; the mercury is allowed to be absorbed by the zinc plate,
  and the operation must then be repcated, which is a requisite condition.

248    J. C. Marquart's        Report         of the Progress of Phytochemistry
even at 0°; it is even capable at —5–12° of rendering the
paste of starch liquid without at the same time forming sugar.
The conversion of starch into sugar takes place very rapidly,
as well in the air as in vacuo, and without the absorption or
disengagement of gas.
   M. Guerin examined the starch under the microscope, and
appears, as is often the case with the French, to have had no
knowledge of the experiments made by the Germans on the
same subject.     He observed, like M. Fritsche, the concentric
rings and the nucleus of the granules, and very improperly
names the latter the umbilical point; he also found the mon
strous gramules of M. Fritsche, and describes them as a con
nection of one or two granules which, on account of want of
space in the mother cell, had forced themselves on one another
so that the formation of hexagonal cells by the aggregation
of the original round cells could plainly be observed. The
umbilical point of each granule was always directed outwards.
M. Guerin, after having in this manner studied the form of the
granules, made experiments on the action of water on them at
various temperatures, sometimes using pure water, sometimes
water and diastase; from which it appears in general, that at
50–53° C. the water with or without diastase had no effect
on the granules; at 54–55°he perceived some torn granules,
and at 59–60° several granules quite torn, and many already
empty; at 62°          all
                     the granules torn and empty, yet so, that                             in
diastase the husks were only split, but                     in
                                                 water broken down
into shreds, (gefranzt).

   M. Du Menil found in his examination of the bark of Pinus
sylvestris, in 1000 parts, 60 parts starch”.  According to Du
Menil the bark was separated from the alburnum; as however
non-botanists possess in general erroneous conceptions of bark,
liber and alburnum, we do not know what Du Menil has
examined; very likely what he separated from the bark was
the young wood.      M. Nardo, who examined the bark of Pi—
nus  maritimat,    found in it no starch, and the question                                                      is,

and isolated specks, and by leaving unfilled furrows, which
cross each other, and give it the appearance of a vascular net.
   Next to the intestinal canal, the generative organs of this
worm are the most striking. In the male is perceived a dirty
white very thin vessel, which begins by an unattached slender
extremity near the middle of the aesophagus, and winds itself
down the intestine. The vessel becomes larger and larger as it
descends; and, with the last bend which it makes at the lower
end of the branch, it suddenly contracts and runs down as a
very slender canal to the above-mentioned slit.     I could not
properly follow the end of this canal, as it was very indistinct
before the slit, and partly covered by two small long and
thin bodies. These long bodies, which lay in the hinder ex
tremity of the male branch, bent near the slit, consisted of a
horny substance, and touched one another at an acute angle,
directed downwards.      A fine white granular matter formed
the contents of this receptacle.     The vessel could easily be
taken out entire  by cutting  off the branch.
   A much more compound vessel, with the intestinal canal,
occupied the female branch and the other parts of the body.
There were here two vessels with blind ends which began in
the lower part of the cavity of the body, ascending the gut as
two very thin milk-white canals, with irregular windings and
twistings, and forming, chiefly at the beginning of the female
branch, several convolutions, one of which reached a great way
up the female branch and then returned. On their passage, both
receptacles decreased towards the middle of the body for a
short space, but soon changed into two thick dirty-white tubes,
which in breadth nearly equalled the circumference of the      in
testinal canal.    Near the end of the gut these tubes bend, and
then turn upwards and reach the place where the male and fe
male branches join, after both having formed some few and
small windings: here they are united into one vessel, and
send a very thin tortuous canal to the above-mentioned slit.
From the construction, order, and contents, I supposed this
double receptacle to be nothing less than the female generative
organs, such as we find in most of the Nematoidea. One could
easily distinguish the following parts on   in it,
                                                namely, 1st, The
two thin and milk-white vessels, situated      the back part, are
certainly the ovaries. They contained     in their posterior con
volutions     afine granular white substance; while        the an

on   the ovarium being injured, escape adhering together        in

258        Dr. Von Siebold on a Double-bodied Intestinal Worm,
none of these heaps of granules possessed a distinct mem
brane or a clear partition.       A bright spot appeared in some
heaps, which may probably be the germ *. 2nd, The small
narrow pieces of the two vessels which succeed the ovaria
may be compared with the fallopian tubes.               Both vessels
were here so narrow, that never more than one grain at a
time could pass through the canal, while at the same time
four to five such granules were contained in the calibre of
the oviducts.    By the extension of the two vessels the heaps
of  granules  take at once the form of oval eggs, and we can
suppose these two wide canals to be, 3rd, The oviducts or
uterus. Each egg was enveloped in two delicate colourless
tunics.   The last egg contained a granular matter, equally
divided, which filled out the greatest part of the tunics. . I
could perceive here no germ; it had, perhaps, retired to the
middle of the yolk. If you examined the eggs in the uterus
which are situated more in the upper part, you find that the
granules of yolk matter come nearer to one another, and that
they at present do not occupy the whole space of the coverings.
Still more anteriorly the granular matter in the eggs begins
to separate into several round heaps, which hang closely
together under one another, and give the form of the yolk a
somewhat ragged appearance.          In the interior of each of these
granular heaps a clear bright spot was to be seen. Such was
the state of the eggs to the uppermost end of the two horns of
the uterus. After both horns had united into one canal, this had
become, 4th, The vagina, and so narrow that no more than one
egg at a time could slide through           This vagina ended after

~        has been long pretty generally known that the same ex
       pense of muscular energy will carry a person through
  nearly the same vertical height in a given time, at                angles        all

of the guidesat Chamouni.     My own experience would give
results somewhat greater, and the constant must of course be

respond to the most moderate sustained muscular effort, and
which might be long kept up; the only kind of observation of

vertical ascent than might be expected. The reliefs being
more frequent when the velocity is great, the work done varies
in summer and winter, but may generally be stated at from
1400 feet per hour.
   The most remarkable circumstance is the high angle of
elevation at which this effort is performed, and which I doubt
not might be advantageously modified if oeconomy of the la
bour of prisoners should ever become an object. I have ex
amined the operation of the tread-wheel in Edinburgh, and
find that the angle of ascent is about 80°, and sometimes                                                       al
most vertical.      It is not to be supposed that this angle is as
favourable as a smaller one, though the work done is greater
than in some cases already considered; this being a punish
ment and considered as hard labour, the other (the ascent of
mountains) being only equivalent to an active man's common
daily work.      The view in making the angle of ascent of tread
wheels so    great               is,

   The tread-wheel observations are the most satisfactory                                                       at

when the inclination is nearly vertical.               Should this diminu

be at a vertical inclination (which however is most impro

THINKING
   in a subject which is becoming of much importance in
meteorology,          I
                am induced to forward,  for insertion in the
Philosophical Magazine,  the following account of some ob
servations which I made during the occurrence of the most
splendid aurora borealis which I have ever witnessed.

    At 16" past 7 (mean time), in the evening of the 18th of Fe
 bruary (Saturday), I observed the commencement of an aurora
 borealis of the most vivid pink hue, occasionally approaching
 to scarlet. At this time the centre of the brightest part of the
 aurora bore, by compass, about 6° north of west, allowance
 being made for variation.          At 27" past 7 the bearing con
 tinued  nearly  the same. The altitude of the upper edge (which
 was not well defined), taken, as near as might be, at the time
 with a Gunter's quadrant, and verified afterwards with a re
 flecting sextant, was about 55°. At 32" past 7 the former bear
 ing of the main body continued the same, but the tint had
 now spread round to the N.E. The altitude of the brightest
 part was from 35° to 36°, the altitude of the edge remaining
 much as before. The stars in Cassiopeia shone through the
 aurora (though not the most brilliant part of                        it)
                                                               somewhat

LIV.   Erperimental Researches on a peculiar Action of Iron
  upon Solutions of some Metallic Salts. By Dr. C. F. SchoeN
  BEIN.”
       time ago I published several papers+, in which I
SOME
  made known some very remarkable facts regarding the
action   of iron  upon oxygen.       According to the notions ge
nerally adopted by philosophers respecting the action of metals
performing the function of the positive electrode upon oxy
gen set free by voltaic action, iron, as one of the more readily
oxidable metals, chemically combines with that element.               In
one of the papers alluded to, I have shown that these notions
with regard to iron do not hold good in               cases, and that     all
this metal acquires under certain circumstances the property
of  platina     gold, that
               or                 say, that whilst constituting the
                                   is
                                   to

                              is
cally affected       oxyacid solutions, which usually act upon
iron with more           it
                     less violence.       have further observed, that
                                                  I
this inactivity    iron depends upon the manner

 268    Dr. Schoenbein’s Erperimental                           Researches on a            peculiar
 inclined to infer that the affinity of iron for oxygen is de
 stroyed by a current moving through the metal in a certain
 direction, and that the affinity lost in this way by the iron is
  revived by an opposite current.            To ascertain whether this
   view holds     good   generally   with  regard   to iron, I have made
  a series of    experiments,     the results of which are as follows.
 I    introduced an iron wire which had previously been con
  nected with the positive pole of a small battery, into an aqueous
  solution of the common sulphate of copper, by means of which
  the circuit was closed.         According to my hypothesis no ac
  tion whatever is to take place on the part of the iron upon the
  solution, under the circumstances here stated. My expectations
  were fully realized, for after many hours' action of the pile
  not the smallest particle of copper was deposited on the iron
  wire,   its surface had not undergone the least change, and du
  ring the whole time               of
                               action oxygen was evolved            the iron.          at

                                                                                                 a or

 of   copper. (The same result was obtained               joining momen
  tarily the two polar wires within the solution,                   touching     or    by

speak in favour of the idea already suggested that the che
mical affinity of iron for oxygen is destroyed by one kind of
current, and called forth again by the other.                It is true, one
of the most      sagacious    philosophers     of the   age,  Mr. Faraday,
has started an idea which seems to account very satisfactorily
for the phaenomena in question.               According to his view the
peculiar condition of iron depends either upon a film of oxide
covering the metal, or upon a relation of oxygen to iron equi
valent to oxidation, so that the particles forming the surface
of the inactive iron have satisfied in one way or other their affi
nity for oxygen.        Applying the same hypothesis to account
for the   bearing     of iron in the solution of blue vitriol which
Mr. Faraday has made use of for explaining the singular ac
tion of iron upon nitric acid, we must say, an inactive iron
wire does not act upon the solution of the copper salt, because
there is no immediate contact between the truly metallic par
ticles of the wire and the said solution, on account of the                                           in
terposing film of oxide, or something similar to                        But              it.           if
now another metal            put into the solution, which
                                     be                          chemically         is

ceeding from the active metal, and passing through the solu
tion into the inactive iron. By this current water                   decom               is
posed, hydrogen evolved              the iron; the film,

contrary should take place, the affinity            copper for oxygen        of

Another fact worthy           remark  of                    is,
                                            that iron acts quite differ
ently upon the neutral nitrates                              of

paper, if I produce a new case bearing evidence in favour of
the theory”, according to which voltaic electricity is due to
chemical action.        It is true that the beautiful researches of
Mr. Faraday, as well as those of Mr. De la Rive, have led to
results which remove from an unbiassed mind even the shadow
of a doubt on the subject, and which prove in the most satis
factory manner, that mere contact of heterogeneous metals is
not capable of disturbing their electric equilibrium.                     Still,
as the number of       philosophers       is as  yet   rather considerable
who maintain the hypothesis of Volta,                    think it not quite     I
useless to increase the       body  of evidence     against                                   it.

then rose from the iron and continued to do so, but the metal
was not thrown into action.
   When two glasses were filled with acid and connected by
a compound   platina and iron wire, the platina or inactive iron
in one glass exerted a protecting influence on the iron in the
other, provided the communication was first made through
the galvanometer: a touch, however, with a common iron wire
threw the metal into action, producing a strong electrical cur
rent. The same was the case when three or four glasses con
nected by a compound platina and iron wire were employed.
    But the most curious fact that I observed was this: the
                                                       it bytill

In   this acid iron was not   protected      platina  even when coiled

idation took place with increased rapidity when the platina
was     inconnection. Neither was the iron protected when the
connection between the metals was made through the medium
of the galvanometer, provided that the iron was dipped into the
acid first; but      the metal was first connected with the galva
                       if
nometer and then put into the acid,                         no

                       it of
in  any length      time, even after the platina was removed: but
once touching         with another piece         iron always threw

age for the current, and the needle was strongly deflected.
From this it appears that when iron is in the peculiar state it
is incapable of conducting a current of voltaic electricity.

       that the
                  science it is well known and universally admit
                prime  mover can never produce a greater power
than that which it possesses; and that action and reaction are
perfectly equal and opposite in their effects: but these great
principles are too often lost sight of when we enter on the inves
tigation of the actions of those agents we term imponderable.

electric state and loses a part of       own power.         its

spark will appear at the points of

the wire, or if connected with the
human body a shock will be re
ceived.    It is obvious, therefore,
that the  electricity in this circle, at
the moment of fracture, is in rapid
motion towards a perfectly new
state of stable equilibrium.      From
this new state then the electricity
may be easily put in motion by an
inducing or reacting cause till it
approach or finally gain the state of tension which it had be
fore the ring was                Hence from what is called a per
manent     magnet   we  may   obtain as powerful a shock and as
brilliant a spark as from a soft iron electro-magnet. If in the
common magneto-electric machine a continuous wire be coiled
round the ends of the permanent magnet, and a simple flat
lifter, without a coil, be made to revolve opposite the poles, an
exceedingly brilliant spark, and a shock too powerful to be
endured, may be easily produced.                 If
                                            the revolving keeper
have also a coil, by joining the ends to form a continuous coil
with that on the magnet the effect may be much increased.
    Instead of the revolving lifter of soft iron, another perma
nent horseshoe magnet may be employed with equal or per
haps greater advantage.         The result of these arrangements
may form the subject of another short communication,

      taic               whether in the production of quantity or

faces of zinc and copper ? This question has been frequently
answered, by some in the affirmative, by others in the nega

equal quantities of the two metals; and in the various forms
of batteries in general use we see such arrangements as give

282               Mr. Mullins     on the Development              and Action
lic, in the belief that the results of a series of experiments,
conducted with care and frequently repeated, fully justify me
in asserting that every battery in present use, which contains
equal surfaces of zinc and copper, is constructed on a wrong
principle, and that in such batteries an enormous quantity of
zinc is consumed without the slightest advantage.      was first             I
struck by this fact while experimenting with the Wollaston
battery, for I always remarked that the zinc plates were un
equally corroded,           the action being much greater within       an
inch of the lower edge of the plates than higher up.                 also            I
found that after using these plates for some time, when of
course the original extent of surface was much diminished,
the power of the battery was quite as great as at first, as
suming that the plates were clean and the battery fresh
charged.      In consequence of these observations I reduced the
size of the zinc plates to a fourth of what they had previously
been, and could not perceive the least diminution in effect;
so that without any greater action in a given time on that part
                                                                  ‘.
of the zinc which I retained, I was enabled to develop the
same power, thereby avoiding the waste caused by the action
of the solution on the remaining parts of the larger plates.
Having thus satisfied myself that a large quantity of zinc ab
solutely went for nothing in the common                         I entered
upon a new series of experiments on the same subject with
my sustaining battery, which, in consequence of                    power       its
not diminishing, gave me          certainty

inspection of any scientific person. The “superior longitudinal
commissure" is also new to us. But the most important addition
to our knowledge resulting from the labours of Mr. Solly consists
in his discovery of some distinct fibres of medullary matter con
necting the cerebellum with the anterior columns of the medulla
spinalis: this connection is most satisfactorily proved, and the solu
tion it affords to the understanding of many hitherto anomalous
facts in pathology renders this a point of high interest.      An ac
curate description of the origin of the motor nerves from, and the
 termination of the nerves of sensation in, the central organ of the
nervous system next follows; and here again some new features are
apparent.    The last part of the work is dedicated to the physiology
of the brain as elucidated by pathological facts; but we forbear to
enter upon this subject, as it is one of such immense extent.     The
work is illustrated by twelve beautiful engravings, and the whole is

of the lamented decease of the Secretary, E. T. Bennett, Esq., the
usual routine of scientific business was suspended.
    September 13, 1836.-A communication was read from J. B.
Harvey, Esq., of Teignmouth, a Corresponding Member of the So
ciety, on the occurrence of four specimens of the Welella limbosa of
Lamarck, which were found on the beach at Teignmouth after a
continuation of southerly winds and smooth water.
   A specimen was forwarded for the Society, and representations of
it in four different points of view accompanied the communication.
    Mr. Vigors called the attention of the meeting to a Bird, present
ing a singular form among the Tinamous, which he had exhibited at
one of the evening meetings in the year 1832, but which, from ac
cidental circumstances, had not been characterized in the Proceed
ings.    The birds of this group, which forms an immediate connect
ing link between the Tinamous and the Bustards, were first observed
by Mr. Pentland on a high elevation in the Andes, and the specimen
before the meeting was brought by that gentleman to this country
and presented to the Society.       Mr. Vigors described in detail the
characters of the genus, to which he assigned the name of Tinamotis,
and also pointed out the specific characters of the bird, to which he
had on a former occasion given the name of Pentlandii, in honour of
the distinguished traveller who first discovered the group.

    Mr. Vigors took the same opportunity of describing and naming
 two Parrots in the Society's Collection, one of which, now alive in
 the Menagerie, distinguished by a brilliant purple plumage over the
 head, nape, and breast, and which came from South America, he
 characterized under the name of Psittacus augustus; the second, of
 which two specimens had been procured from the late Rev. Lans
 down Guilding's collection, received from the Island of St. Vincent,
 but the precise locality of which was not known, he described by
 the name of Psittacus Guildingii.
     Mr. Gould, at the request of. the Chairman, exhibited to the
 Third Series. Vol. 10. No. 61. April 1837.                2 P

Meeting two tribes of Birds, viz. the Tamatias, from the warmer
parts of America, and the Coursers, from the arid regions of Africa
and India. Mr. Gould observed, that of the first group, only five
 species appear to have been known to Linnaeus; eleven others had
 since been added, making sixteen: the Society's collection contained
 thirteen species. Mr. Gould exhibited a series of drawings in illus
 tration of the group, and characterized one new species under the
 name of Tamatia bicincta.
    Mr. Gould stated in conclusion, that this formerly limited group
now constitutes a considerable family, or subfamily, whose members
 appear naturally to form themselves into at least three or four genera:
thus divided, the genus Tamatia, Cuv. (Capito, Vieill.) contains 9
species, that of Lypornia, Wagl., 3 species; that of Monasa, Vieill., 3
species; and that of Chelidoptera, Gould, l; the latter being a generic
title provisionally instituted by Mr. Gould for the Lypornia tenebrosa,
Wagl., a species which differs in many essential characters from all
the other members of the group, possessing as it does a very length
ened wing, and being in every way adapted for powerful flight.                 He
observed, that he had consulted with M. Natterer on the propriety
of separating this bird from the other members of the group, in which
opinion that eminent naturalist had coincided, and at the same time
stated, that it usually resorted to the topmost branches of the trees,
whence it sallied forth over the forest in search after its insect food,
while, on the other hand,                         all
                                    the other members          the group kept       of                         to

    September 27, 1836.-A communication from Edward Fuller, Esq.,
of Carleton Hall, near Saxmundham, was read, which stated that
his gamekeeper had succeeded last year in rearing two birds from a
barn-door Hen, having a cross from the Pheasant, and a Pheasant
cock; that the birds partook equally of the two species in their ha
bits, manners, and appearance; and concluded by presenting them
to the Society.
   The gamekeeper of Edward Fuller, Esq., in a short note which
accompanied the birds, stated that he had bred them, and that they
were three-quarter-bred Pheasants.
    The living birds were exhibited at the Meeting, as was also a
living hybrid, between the Pheasant and common Fowl, which was
one of several that had been some years in the Menagerie of the
Society.
    Several specimens of hybrids, from the preserved collection in the
Museum of the Society, were placed on the table for exhibition and
comparison. These had been bred between the Pheasant and common
Fowl, the common Pheasant and the silver Pheasant, and the common
Pheasant with the gold Pheasant.
    The specimens of the three-quarter-bred Pheasants were consider
ed interesting, the opinion of the older physiologists having been
that animals bred between parents of two distinct species were un
productive.
    Mr. Yarrell stated, that although generally such an opinion pre
vailed there were still exceptions.       The Proceedings of the Society
for 1831 exhibited one       already recorded in Phil. Mag. and Annals,
N.S., vol. xi. p. 138. This communication was received from the
 Honourable Twiselton Fiennes, who having succeeded in rearing a
brood between the common Duck and the Pintail, found in the fol
lowing season these hybrids were productive. Other instances are
 also on record which were adverted to. Mr. Yarrell stated, that he
had had opportunities of examining the bodies of hybrids, both of
 Gallinaceous Birds and Ducks, and found that the sexual organs of
 the males were of large size, those of the females deficient in size,
 and not without some appearance of imperfection.               The crosses
 produced by the breeders of Canaries were mentioned, and the
 objects of obtaining them explained. Mr. Yarrell expressed his belief
that the attempt to breed from a hybrid was most likely to be suc
 cessful when a male hybrid was put to a female of a true species.
    Mr. Vigors said this was the first instance that had come to his
knowledge of a female hybrid being productive, and he had hitherto

                               Žoological Society.                                   293
considered that they were not so; he expressed his desire to see the
female hybrid that had produced the three-quarter Pheasants then
in the room, and hoped that the opportunities which the Menagerie
of the Society afforded of obtaining additional evidence on this                         in
teresting subject would not be lost sight of.
    The Chairman (Mr. Owen) stated, that it was the opinion of John
Hunter that hybrids were not productive except in cases where the
generative organs were in a state of perfection, which might be re
garded as unnatural in hybrids, as in the rare cases recorded of fertile
Mules, between the Horse and Ass. Constant fertility in the hy
brid proved, in the opinion of Hunter, that the parents were varie
ties of the same species, not distinct species.          But the Chairman
stated, that the experiments recorded by Hunter in the ‘Animal
CEconomy' relative to the fecundity of the hybrids from the Dog
and Wolf and Dog and Jackal were incomplete, from the cir
cumstances of the hybrids having always bred from a perfect
species and not having propagated the intermediate variety inter
se.     He trusted that in a short time this test would be applied in
 experiments now in progress at the Society's Menagerie, and thus
an additional element be gained towards the solution of this inter
 esting question.
    A small collection of Birds from Swan River, presented to the
 Society by Lieut. Breton and Capt. Brete, were on the table. Mr.
 Gould, at the request of the Chairman, observed upon the collection
 generally, and selected two species which he considered as unde
 scribed, a Gallinule and a species of Duck, the latter strictly refer
 rible to the genus Oryura of L. Bonaparte, Prince of Musignano,
 (genus Undina of Gould). Mr. Gould named the Gallinule, Gallinula
 ventralis, and the Duck, Oryura Australis, this being the only                          in
 stance he had seen of this limited group from Australia. Of this spe
 cies the collection contained both male and female, the latter of
 which, in the general distribution of                      its
                                                  markings and colouring,

whole of the soles of their feet to the ground, have this part entirely
covered with hair, as the Wolverine, the Panda, the Seals, and the
Polar Bear; but that this was not universally the case, for the Ben
turing, which inhabited the same country as the Panda, has the
soles bald and papillary.        He further observed, that the nakedness
of the soles did not      appear  to be permanent even in the specimens
of the same     species    in the Squirrel and other Glirine animals; for
he had observed that the specimens of the grey Squirrels, in the
Northern part of the United States, had this part covered with hair,
whilst those of the Southern parts, had the soles entirely bald; and
he also observed, that the various species of the Spermophile differed
greatly amongst themselves in the extent of the nakedness of this
part.
    Mr. Gray then proceeded to make some remarks on the alteration
in the situation of the teeth, and on the change which takes place
in the form of the carnivorous tooth, in the milk and permanent
teeth of the Carnivora; and stated, that the milk carnivorous tooth
of the Cat, Dog, Vison, Skunk, Viverra, and indeed of all the genera
which he had been able to examine, had a small central internal
 lobe, whilst the same tooth in the permanent set always had a large
 anterior lobe; he also stated, that he had observed that the tuber
cular grinders of the Mustelae often vary considerably in size in the
various specimens of the same species, showing that implicit re
liance cannot be placed in the size of these teeth as a specific cha
racter, which several persons have been inclined to do, as it is well
known that the size of such teeth does not depend upon the age of
the animal, as they never alter their size after they are once com
pletely developed. Mr. Gray then proceeded to point out the cha
racters by which the new species exhibited were distinguished: two
were said to have formed part of the collection of the late Sir Stam
ford Raffles, and were therefore supposed to have come from Sumatra;
one of them was a new species of Paradorurus, called P. leucomy

                strong white whiskers, and the other Mr. Gray regard

skin, including the cranium,          immature Orang-Utan
                                                of              Sumatra,                     of
were exhibited.     They were transmitted           England      Dr. W.
                                                                      to                      by
Montgomerie         Singapore, with
                          of             statement that the young Su
                                                             a
matran Orang had died           that gentleman's possession soon after
                                           in
having acquired additional grinders.
  Mr. Owen availed himself    the occasion      of                      to    make the following
observations each         on
                      the above specimens.
                                      of

296                                      Zoological Society.
   He stated that the skin of the young Sumatran Orang agreed in
the rufous colour, texture, disposition, and direction of the hair, with
the adult female Sumatran Orang, presented to the Zoological So
ciety by Sir Stamford Raffles; like that specimen also, it had no
nail on the hallur or thumb of the hinder hands”. The posterior
molares on each side of each jaw correspond to the first permanent
molares of the adult; the rest of the teeth consisted of the 8 deci
duous bicuspides, the 4 small deciduous canini, and the 8 decidu
ous incisores. This state of the dentition was similar to that of the
human child at the 7th year; but it would be unsafe to infer from
this circumstance that the age of the Orang corresponded : it being
more probable, from the characteristic duration of the immature
state in the human species, that the shedding of the teeth takes
place at a later period than in the Orang.
    Of the two crania of the Bornean Orangs, one differed materially
from the other in size and in the development of the cranial ridges.
The larger specimen before the Society, closely resembled the cra
nium of the Bornean Pongo or adult Orang in the Museum of the
College of Surgeons, and differed, in precisely the same respects as
that specimen, from the cranium of the Pongo (supposed to be Su
matran) in the possession of Mr. Cross, described and figured in the
 1st volume of the Society's Transactions, (p. 380. Pl. 53, and noticed
in our report of Mr. Owen's paper, in Lond, and Edinb. Phil. Mag.,
vol.    vi.   p.
             457), which induced Mr. Owen              entertain more strongly
                                                                      to
his   original   suspicion,    that that cranium      belonged              Oran           to   an
specifically distinct from the great Bornean species (Simia Wurmbii,
Fischer). With respect             the differences alluded to, he stated that
                                           to
the cranium          theofgreat  Bornean Orang was characterized                the

                       the skull between the forehead            glabella and the    or
incisor teeth; the external boundaries                           of
                                                   the orbit were broad and
had   a  rough irregular surface, probably          consequence  in      the deve              of

      Mr. Owen      on the specific distinctions  of the Orangs.    297
equally distinct from the great Pongo of Borneo (Simia Wurmbii,
Fischer, Synopsis Mammalium,        p. 32, No. 43), and from the Orang
of Sumatra (Simia Abelii, Fischer, ibid. p. 10, No. 2*); and whilst
regretting that his conclusion as to the specific distinction of the
smaller Orang, (which, catteris paribus, must be at least one third less
than either of the two preceding Orangs) necessarily reposed on a
comparison of the cranium alone, he at the same time observed that,
as the cranium in question was in every respect entire, and with
the series of teeth complete, it served to establish that deduction on
the sound basis of dental and osteological characters.
    Mr. Owen therefore proposed to designate the lesser Orang of
Borneo, Simia Morio, and proceeded to describe the cranium as fol
lows:
    “The size and form of the       cranium of the Simia Morio at first
suggests the idea of its being an intermediate stage of growth be
tween the young and adult Simia Satyrus, or Pongo; but this is dis
proved by comparison of the teeth of S. Morio, with the permanent
teeth in the adult Pongo, and with the deciduous ones in the
young Simia Satyrus, as well as with the germs of the permanent
teeth concealed in the jaws of the latter.        For while the teeth of .
S. Morio are much larger than the deciduous teeth of the young
S. Satyrus, they have different relative sizes one to another from those
which are observed in the permanent teeth of the full-grown: the
molares and bicuspides of the S. Morio being smaller, the canini much
smaller, while the upper incisores have nearly, and the lower in
cisores fully, the same dimensions as those of the great Pongo.
    “The teeth in the jaws of a quadrumanous cranium may be known
to belong to the permanent series, by the absence of the foramina,
which, in an immature cranium, are situated behind the deciduous
teeth, and which lead to the cavities containing the crowns of the
permanent teeth. This character is very conspicuous on comparing
the cranium of Simia Morio with that of a young Simia Satyrus, in
which the deciduous series are present, together with the first per
manent molares.       The deciduous teeth in the young Orang, besides
their smaller   size, are more or less protruded from their sockets, and
thrust   apart from one another by the vis à tergo of their huge suc
cessors, while the teeth of S. Morio are lodged firmly in the jaws;
 and, with the exception of the characteristic interval between the
 canines and incisors, are compactly arranged in close contiguity with
 each other.
    “I  have re-examined with much interest several crania of imma

        Mr.   Owen on the specific distinctions     of the Orangs.      299
 in the S. Morio, and the beginning of the lambdoidal suture may be
 faintly traced, but the remainder is obliterated.
     Directing our attention to the base of the skull of S. Morio we
 observe the occipital foramen to be less posteriorly situated than in
 the Pongo, but more so than in the Chimpanzee.           The plane of the
foramen is also less    oblique  than in the Pongo.  The  occipital condyles
 are as far   apart  anteriorly as in the  Chimpanzee.   The anterior con
 dyloid foramina are double on each side as in the Pongo: the carotid
 and jugular foramina open within the same depression; they are rela
 tively further apart in the Chimpanzee : the petrous portion of the
 temporal bone, as in the Pongo, is relatively smaller than in the Chim
panzee, and the articular cavity, or surface for the lower jaw, forms
  a larger proportion of the base of the skull.
      The other characters of the basis cranii correspond with those
  of the Pongo; and the smaller size of the meatus auditorius erternus
 is probably associated in both species with a smaller auricle, as com
 pared with the Chimpanzee.
      On the bony palate the relative position of the foramen incisivum
 corresponds with the development of the incisive teeth, showing the in
 termaxillary bones to be of larger size in the S. Morio than in the Chim
 panzee : the situation of the sutures joining these bones to the max
 illaries is indicated by vascular grooves, but otherwise obliterated;
 while in the cranium of a young Pongo of nearly the same size as
 that of the Simia Morio, the intermaxillary sutures still remain, cor
 responding to the non-development of the permanent laniaries.             It
 will   be interesting to determine at what period these sutures are     ob
  literated in the more anthropoid Simia Morio.
     The os nasi is a single narrow long triangular bone, slightly di
 lated at its upper end or apex, with the basal margin entire, pre
 senting no indications of original separation into two parts, as has
  been observed in skulls of the Chimpanzee.
      In the contraction of the interorbital space, and the general
 form of the orbit and its boundaries, the Simia Morio resembles the
 Simia Satyrus, but the orbital cavity, as before observed, is smaller.
 In the plane of the orbit and straight contour of the upper jaw, the
 Simia Morio resembles the Bornean species of Pongo or Simia Wurmbii,
 rather than the Simia Abelii or Sumatran Pongo.
     The orbital process of the os mala is perforated in the S. Morio
 as in the Pongo, by several large foramina.         There is one principal
 and two very small infraorbital foramina on either side; the upper
 maxillary bones are relatively smaller, as compared with the other
 bones of the face, and especially the intermaxillaries, than in the Pongo;
a structure which coincides with the smaller proportional develop
 ment of the canine teeth. The nasal aperture has the same form as
in the adult Simia Wurmbii, being more elongated than in the imma
ture Orang.
     The main and characteristic difference then between the Simia
Morio and the Pongo, whether of Borneo or Sumatra, obtains in
the size of the laniary or canine teeth, to the smaller development of
which in the S. Morio, almost all the other differences in the cranium

 are subordinate or consequent. The laniary teeth, it may be ob
 served, have little relation to the kind of food habitual to the Orangs;
 had they been so related they would have been accompanied with a
 structure of the glenoid cavity fitting them, as in the true Carnivora, to
 retain a living prey in their gripe, till      life was extinguishedits     resist                                 or
 ance effectually quelled. But the flattened surfaces              which the con                  on
 dyles   ofthe lower jaw rotate are          subserviency   in   the flattened tu              to
 berculate molars, showing the mastication              vegetable substances    of                                            to

of  the Orangs, viz. the molars and incisors, show indisputably that
the Simia Morio derives its sustenance from the same kind of food as
the larger Orangs. The singular thickness                 antero-posterior dia       or
meter    ofthe incisors, which are worn down                   flattened surface,     to     a

inches; that of the ears, 4 inches; and the height may be about 1 foot
4 or 5 inches. The animal agrees with the common European and
American Fores, (C. Vulpes and C. fulvus,) in the black marks on
the backs of the ears, and in front of the hind and fore legs. The
coat consists of long close rich fur, as fine as that of any of the Ame
rican varieties, and of infinitely more brilliant and varied colours. It
consists of two sorts of hair, an interior of a very fine cottony tex
ture, and an external of a long silky nature, but perfectly pliant, and,
like the fur of the Sable, lying almost equally smooth in any direc
tion. The inner fur is of a smoky blue or brown colour along the
back, as is likewise the basal half of the outer silky hair, which, up to
this point, is of the same soft cottony texture as the interior fur; it

 which Mr. Gray had called at the British Museum Mulinia, of which
 he described five species; and he also stated the necessity for forming
 a new genus, of which Mactra Sprengleri may be regarded as the type.
    Mr. Harvey, of Teignmouth, exhibited various fossils from Devon
 shire. Of these, sections in different directions had been made, and
 the surfaces highly polished.     The structure was thus rendered
 beautifully apparent.
    Mr. Harvey also exhibited various specimens of Asterias and Ophiura
 from the Devonshire coast, and explained the mode by which they
 had been prepared.
    Mr. Gould brought under the notice of the Meeting several spe
 cies of Birds from New South Wales, which he considered to be
new to science, as they are not contained in the collection of the
Linnean Society; nor, as far as he is aware, described in any publica
tion. Mr. Gould embraced this opportunity to characterize and
name ten species, and stated that at subsequent meetings of the So
ciety he would bring forward the remainder of his collection.
    Mr. Gould more particularly pointed out a species of Petroica; a
new and interesting species of Ptilonorhynchus, allied to Ptil. nu
chalis, and which he proposed to make the type of a new genus; a
new species (belonging to the Society) of the genus Calyptorhynchus,
which he compared with              all
                              the other members      the group then      of                   on

  Anniversary Meeting, Feb. 17th, 1837.-On                              the occasion  of   pre
senting the Wollaston Medals, the President,                            Charles Lyell,     jun.,
Esq., F.R.S., addressed the Meeting                  in   the following manner:
       GENTLEMEN,
    You have just learnt from the Report                 of
                                            the Council that they have
this year awarded two Wollaston medals; one           Captain Proby         to
Cautley      the Bengal Artillery, and another
               of                                 Dr. Hugh Falconer to
of the Bengal Medical Service, for their geological researches and
their discoveries    fossil geology
                         in           the Sub-Himalayan mountains.
                                               in
I  shall now request one         our Secretaries, Dr. Royle,
                                        of                        take                to
charge    of
           these medals.
    The President then addressed Dr. Royle:
      Dr. Roy LE,
  It   will,am sure,     most gratifying
                              be             you          to        for
                                                       intrusted with         be
the care    of I
           these testimonials    our      of
                                      regard      two gentlemen with   to
whom you are connected               by
                              the ties                   of
                                           private friendship.   The
Seological Society awards these medals         Capt. Cautley and Dr.
                                                              to
Falconer       as   an
                 expression             of
                                the sympathy which they feel                                 for

                                   Geological Society.                                307
 those who are so zealously labouring in a distant country to pro
 Hlote a COmmon cause.
    In the Address which I am now about to deliver to this Meeting,
I  shall have an opportunity of enlarging on the discoveries which
 these gentlemen have made in a region previously unexplored, at
 the southern base of the Himalaya between the Sutledge and the
 Ganges.      I shahl then speak of their perseverance and industry in
examining the structure of the hills, and in collecting the remains
of extinct quadrupeds and reptiles, and the talent displayed in
their anatomical determination of new species and new types of or
ganization.        Ishall now merely request that in forwarding these
medals, the first which the Geological Society has sent to India,
you will express to Capt. Cautley and Dr. Falconer the lively in
terest which we continue to take in their researches, and our ardent
hopes for their future welfare and success.
   Dr. Royle in reply expressed the high satisfaction he felt on
being requested to take charge of the medals, which it would give
him great pleasure to forward immediately to India. When in that
country, he had had personal opportunities of witnessing the zeal
and enthusiasm with which his friends had laboured, and the great
difficulties which they had overcome when far separated from the
scientific world, and without museums, books, or skilful naturalists -
to consult.
   He was assured that these marks of attention so honourably
conferred by the Geological Society on Capt. Cautley and Dr. Fal
coner, would not only encourage and stimulate them to fresh exer
tions, but inspire others among our countrymen in India with a
desire to cultivate Geology and              its
                                          kindred sciences.
    It was afterwards resolved:—
    1. That the thanks       this Society

     President.
        GENTLEMEN,
     You will have learnt from the Treasurer's Report that the finances
of the Society are flourishing, and they would have appeared in a
still more prosperous condition, had we not expended above 500l.
within the year on our Transactions.   Part of this sum has already
been   repaid by  the sale of the volume just published, of which H
may safely say that it yields to no preceding number in the value
of    its
       contents            or
                     the extent and beauty          illustrations.of   its

nerals which must have been           into the rents in a state of
sublimation.
   In some places there are tufaceous marls, regularly alternating in
thin beds, with still thinner and countless layers of granular gypsum,
the whole mass being again run through everywhere by irregular
branching veins of silky fibrous gypsum.   These strata, thus inter
sected, present a perfect counterpart to some of the secondary
gypseous marls, both of the keuper-   and variegated sandstone for
mations in Germany”.
   When reading the Professor's description of these phaenomena,
we share in the pleasure and surprise which he felt on comparing
strata of high antiquity with others of so recent a date, and which,
moreover, owe a portion of that resemblance to changes now daily
in progress.
   The writings of Baron Daudebard de Férussac were not devoted
principally to Geology, but we are indebted to him for several me
moirs, and among others for an Essay, published in 1814, on fresh
water formations, with a catalogue of the species of land and fresh
water shells which were then known to enter into their composition.
Monsieur de Férussac contributed largely to the Geological section
of the Bulletin Universel des Sciences Naturelles, a journal, of which
he was the chief editor and original projector. This Bulletin had, for
 itsobject,    give monthly analysis

  The works of Baron Férussac on Natural History, and especially
Conchology, would deserve from me a fuller notice, if they were
not irrelevant to the subject    of this address.
                             HOMe   Geology.
   I  shall now commence my retrospect of the proceedings of the
 Society, during the last year, by considering those papers which
 have been devoted to the Geology of the British Isles. There is
 probably no space on the globe, of equal area, which has been so
 accurately surveyed as this kingdom; yet the most experienced
geologists are now exploring several parts of it with the feeling
 that they are entering upon terra incognita.        Not only do they find
it necessary to trace out more correctly the limits of formations
 previously known, but also to introduce new groups of fossiliferous
 strata and new divisions, in districts before supposed to have been
well investigated.
    The carboniferous deposits which are alike interesting, in a scien
tific and economical view, have deservedly occupied of late the par
ticular attention of many able geologists, and we have received com
munications on the subject from Mr. Murchison, Mr. Prestwich,
Professor Sedgwick, and Mr. Peile.             The observations of Mr.
Prestwich relate to the coal-measures of Coalbrook Dale, and the
formations immediately above and below them, together with the
accompanying trap-rocks”.
    There is perhaps no coal-field in the whole country of equal size
in which the strata have been so much dislocated and shattered.
Mr. Prestwich gives a detailed description both of the principal
and minor faults, their direction, extent, inclination, breadth, and
fall, and the difference of level produced by them in their opposite
sides, which is sometimes slight, but sometimes amounts to 600 or
700 feet.    In some instances the change of level is by steps or
hitches, which, it is truly said, may be owing either to unequal re
sistance, or to a series of small dislocations.          The walls of the
fissures in the disjointed strata are sometimes several yards apart,
the interval being filled with the debris of the strata. In other
places they are in contact.       In this last case it is particularly re
marked that the surface of the ends of the fractured beds of coal
and shale is shining and striated.       You are aware that this appear
ance has usually been attributed, and I believe rightly, to the
rubbing of the walls of the rent one against the other, the lines of
the polished and striated surfaces indicating the direction of the
motion, but I have lately seen it objected to this theory, that the striae
are not always parallel, but often curved and irregular, and that
the earthy contents of veins and faults often present the same glit
tering and striated faces, or slickensides as they have been called. I

were irregular and complicated, occasionally changing their direction,
and that even when uniform, they may have acted unequally on mate
rials varying in hardness and pliability. It is much to be desired that

observe with minute care                   all

                                    of
that the carboniferous strata                       of
                                        Coalbrook Dale must once have
been entirely concealed under            covering    a   new red sandstone,    of
and they owe their present exposure partly                  those movements     to
which have shattered and elevated the coal measures, and partly                                              to
extensive denudation.                       It     natural therefore  inquire how many
                                                                                to

of the adjoining district.

      relation    this point
                         to     great practical importance, Mr. Mur
                                              of

geologist now informs us that his conjectures have been verified,
and that at Christchurch, one mile beyond the superficial boundary
of the coal-field, the 10-yard and other seams have been reached by
borings carried down to the depth of nearly 300 yards. Adverting
to this discovery, he directs attention to the possible extension of
other carboniferous tracts beneath the surrounding new red sand
stone of Shropshire, Worcestershire, Staffordshire, and other cen
tral counties.
   It is clear that these geological considerations must be duly
weighed by those who speculate on the probable future duration of
British coal, according to the actual or any assumed rate of con
sumption.
  Mr. Murchison, in describing the Dudley and Wolverhampton
coal-fields*, informs us that he has not yet found any fossil remains
of decidedly marine origin, like those observed by Mr. Prestwich
in Coalbrook Dale.                      The shells             fresh-water ge

 the superincumbent mass, the resulting fissures in this mass may then
 become matters of calculation.      According to Mr. Hopkins, recti
 linear lines of dislocation will give rise to a set of longitudinal pa
 rallel fissures, and simultaneously to others precisely at right angles
 to them; whereas in conical elevations, the fissures will diverge
 from a centre.   If   the general axis of elevation be curvilinear, the
 longitudinal fissures preserving their parallelism with it will be also
 curvilinear, while the transverse fissures being perpendicular to the
 former at their points of intersection will no longer be parallel.

    To return from this digression, must now recall your attention
 to other papers relating to the carboniferous deposits of England.
 The coal-measures of the north-western coast of Cumberland have
 been examined by Prof. Sedgwick and Mr. Williamson Peile, who
have described the Whitehaven and other fields in great detail,       il
lustrating their account with a map and sections".        The recorded
observations in numerous sinkings and borings, both in relation to
the succession of the strata and to the complicated faults which in
tersect them, would have been involved in hopeless confusion, if
they had simply consisted of a statistical collection of facts attested
by miners; but in this paper, Professor Sedgwick, aided by Mr.
Peile's practical and scientific knowledge, has compared the different
sections and generalized the phaenomena, giving unity and con
sistency to the whole, throwing the strata into distinct groups, and
referring the several faults to different movements to which succes
sive periods of time may be assigned.
    In connection with these recent contributions to the history of
our carboniferous strata, I am happy to mention the excellent
volume lately published by Professor Phillips, forming the se
cond part of his Illustrations of the Geology of Yorkshire.           It
is almost entirely devoted to a description of the carboniferous
or mountain limestone of Yorkshire and the North of England,
a subject already admirably treated in some papers read before
this Society by Professor Sedgwick, particularly in his account
of the carboniferous chain from Penigent to Kirkby Stephenf.
As these geologists had separately explored the same ground, it
is satisfactory to perceive that the leading divisions which they
have proposed for the classification of the mountain limestone
and associated strata, agree in every essential point.     Mr. Phillips
has described the physical geography of the district occupied by
these rocks, their lithological character, stratification, jointed struc
 ture, and the most remarkable faults which affect them, especially
 those which have been called the great Penine and Craven faults.
 He also treats of the trap dykes which cut through the limestone,
 and discusses the probable epochs of the displacement of the strata,
judiciously pointing out the difficulties unavoidably opposed to the

and   very valuable  portion of the work is filled with descriptions  and
plates of organic remains, especially of the brachiopodous and
cephalopodous mollusca.       Most of the species of these classes were
probably inhabitants of the deeper parts of the sea, but there are
fossil shells in the mountain limestone, which the author supposes
to have lived near the shore, and belonging to genera formerly re
garded as foreign to the carboniferous limestone, such as Isocardia,
Nucula, Pecten, Patella, Turritella, and Buccinum.        Many species
of Zoophytes and Crinoidea are also described and figured in this
excellent monograph.

 Mr. C. Darwin exhibited various specimens of rocks, collected by
 him in a voyage round the world, made in His Majesty's ship
 Beagle, Capt. Fitzroy, and occupying five years. These specimens
 were—tubes of fused sand (produced by lightning 2) found near
 the Rio Plata; a white calcareous incrustation alternately formed
 and removed on the rocks of Ascension Island by a periodical change
 in the direction of the swell; a black incrustation formed by the
 spray on the tidal rocks at Ascension; a white hard calcareous
 rock formed rapidly at Ascension; a recent calcareous formation
 indurated by the contact of lava at St. Jago, one of the Cape de
 Verde islands.-Afterwards Mr. W. W. Fisher gave an account of a
 case of Spina Bifida, accompanied by some physiological and pa
 thological researches on the accumulation of fluid in the ventricles
 of the brain.     He came, from the facts he brought forward, to the
following conclusions:—That as there exists a correspondence be

   almost instantaneous ignition of the mass occurs; but it continues for
   a much shorter time than with the tartaric acid, because the oxalic
  acid contains less carbon. In order to obtain a pyrophorus with citric
  acid, 1 atom of citric acid, previously fused and kept some time in
  fusion, then dried and pulverized, must be promptly mixed with
  2 atoms of peroxyd of lead at the temperature of 73°Fahr.           The
  ignition of the whole mass is almost as vivid, and continues for as
  long a time as with tartaric acid. Minium, litharge, and carbonate
  of lead, mixed with tartaric acid, yield also, according to M. Boetli
  ger, pyrophori, but not so good as those yielded by the pure oxyd.—     .

  Notice of M. Mossotti's MATHEMATICAL               RESEARCHES    RELA
              TIVE TO THE LAWS OF MOLECULAR ACTION.
     A  translation   of the memoir by M. Mossotti “On the forces
  which regulate      the internal constitution of bodies,” in which
  he has embodied the results on this subject which he has             hi
  therto obtained, has already appeared in Part III. of the “Scien
  Tific MEMoIRs.” As, however, the principal result of his labours,
 —the mutual identification of the attractive forces of electricity,
 aggregation and gravitation,-constitutes one of the most remark
  able discoveries of the present aera in science, we think it desirable
  to notice it in the Philosophical Magazine, as a matter of reference.
     While reflecting on the Franklinian hypothesis for explaining the
 phaenomena of statical electricity, as reduced by Æpinus to the form
  of a mathematical theory, and with the addition subsequently made
 by Coulomb, proving that electrical attractions and repulsions are
 regulated by the law of the inverse ratio of the square of the di
 stance, M. Mossotti conceived the idea, that if the molecules of
 matter, surrounded by their atmospheres, attract each other when
 at a greater, and repel each other when at a less distance, there
 must be between those two distances an intermediate point at
 which a molecule would be neither attracted nor repelled, but would
 remain in steady equilibrium; and that it was very possible that this
 might be the distance at which it might be placed in the composition
 of bodies. Learning subsequently that the attention of geometers
 had recently been particularly directed to the molecular forces, as
 being those which may lead us more directly to the knowledge of the
intrinsic properties of bodies, he was thus led to recall his ideas on
the subject, and to set about subjecting them to analysis, and he has
submitted to the judgement of philosophers, in the memoir here re
ferred to, the results of his first investigations.    Of the contents of
this memoir the     following   extracts may be regarded  as a summary.
     “I have  supposed   that a number of material molecules are plunged
 into a boundless aether, and that these molecules and the atoms of the
ather are subject to the actions of the forces required by the theory
of AEpinus, and then endeavoured to ascertain the conditions of
equilibrium of the aether and the molecules.       Considering the aether
as a continuous mass, and the molecules as isolated bodies, I found
that if the latter be spherical, they are surrounded by an atmosphere,
the density of which decreases according to a function of the distance

which contains an exponential factor.                The differential equation
which determines the density being linear, is satisfied by any sum of
these functions answering to any number of molecules. Whence it
follows that their atmospheres may overlay or penetrate each other
without disturbing the equilibrium of the aether.               Proceeding in the
next   place   to the conditions of      equilibrium     of the molecules, I ob
served   that,  for a first  approximation     (which   may    be sufficient in al
most    allcases), the reciprocal action           two molecules and     of    their                                  of

   White Indigo.—M. Dumas analysed the white matter into which
indigo changes when exposed to the action of alkalis and disoxy
genizing bodies; he found the composition the same as indigo, with
the difference that the white indigo contains nearly two atoms more
hydrogen.    This makes it a hydruret of indigo, and not a deoxy
genized indigo as is generally admitted.
   Anilic acid.—This name was given by M. Dumas to an acid for
merly called indigotic, and obtained by acting on indigo with nitric
acid. This acid has not the same radical as indigo; it is represen

thrown down.
      If
     two bits of card be placed between the wires, instead of one as
in the last experiment, even then the separate bits of card will con
tinue to stand, although both will be perforated.

wire, cannot, I think, be reconciled with my experiment, which
seems to require two equal repulsive actions.

opake white, and generally not crystalline, has been observed
to exude in the liquid state, from cracks, and other accidental
outlets, around the tweers of the hot-blast furnaces for making
cast-iron, in the Clyde iron-works. The salt occurs in greater
quantity at one time than at another; but I have not yet been
able to ascertain the circumstance in the process upon which
the supply of the salt depends. The workmen say, that it
occurs most after what they call a scour of the furnace, that
is, after,  by   an

380     Dr. Clarke            on Cyanide     of Potassium, as produced
coal for fuel were employed; but owing to the rare use of coke
in Scotland now, I am, as yet, not aware whether the same
product has been observed where coke is the fuel con
sumed.
  The principal ingredient in the salt thus obtained, is cyanide
of potassium. In a quantity that was, about a year ago, sub
 mitted to an examination whereof the sequel will give an
account, the cyanide of potassium made up about 53 parts in
the 100, the rest being carbonate of potash, intermixed with
a small quantity of carbonate of soda; but another quantity
that was examined about a year previously, contained more than
two thirds of cyanide of potassium. One learns, not without
surprise, that so remarkable a product should occur from such
materials, and under such circumstances.               That potassium
should be there, from what source as yet I know not, will                                   in
dicate that the presence of that element, in even unpromising
materials of soils for vegetation, is more general than is usually
suspected. Nor will the iron-master fail, from this intimation,
to warn     allunder his charge whom              may concern,

   Potassium was proved to be present, and sodium too, by
crystallizing a portion of the same solution, examining the
successive crops of crystals that were formed, and persevering
in the crystallization until there did not remain a drop of the so
lution. At first the well-known crystals of nitre were obtained.
Towards the end, however, when the solution had become small
enough to be transferred to a watch-glass, little crystals of                                                      ni

334          Mr. Brett's furtner       warpernments on the
not the subject of my inquiry; to find fault with the expression
is therefore, I think, rather hypercritical, as it would be in the
common expression that certain metallic bodies, such as zinc
or silver, are soluble in nitric acid; for any one using such a
term in reference to those substances would doubtless know
that before such solution could take place, the acid must un
dergo decomposition.      The experiments which I performed,
as well as a repetition of those referred to in my last paper as
instituted by M. Vogel, and afterwards by Mr. Smith, could
not but have informed me of the fact that the ammoniacal salt
does under certain circumstances, if not in all cases, suffer de
composition.
   I shall now briefly mention the results of my late experi
ments on this subject.      The oxides and salts operated upon
were well washed on filters with distilled water, and allowed
to dry at the temperature of the room.
   BaryticSalts.-The carbonate and phosphate of baryta, when
digested in cold muriate of ammonia in solution (a saturated
solution), yield a fluid which, after filtration, contains the earth
in some form of combination, it being readily precipitated by
dilute sulphuric acid: ammonia in excess causes no precipitate.
   Strontian Salts.-Precisely the same results were obtained.
   Lime Salts.-The neutral phosphate of lime which possesses
a semi-crystalline appearance, and was obtained by adding a
neutral solution of phosphate of ammonia to a solution of
chloride of calcium in excess, as also the subphosphate,                       al
together devoid of crystalline structure, and obtained by add
ing an excess of the salt of lime to the phosphatic salt, con

         salt”, when digested in the cold with the saturated so
lution of muriate of ammonia, yielded by filtration a fluid
which was abundantly precipitated by oxalate of ammonia,
and therefore contained lime in some form of combination.
It   may be observed that ammonia added in excess to the                       fil
tered fluid obtained by digesting
barytic, strontian, or calcareous,
tate.

   Magnesian Salts.-The carbonate and ammoniaco-magne

   Oride and Salts of Cadmium.—The oxide, carbonate, phos

rated solution of muriate of ammonia, yielded a fluid by filtra
tion, abundantly precipitated of a yellow colour by hydrosul
phuret of ammonia.

gested    in a cold saturated solution of muriate of ammonia
yielded, by filtration, a fluid abundantly precipitated of a black
colour by hydro-sulphuret of ammonia.
     Oride and Salts of Manganese.—The brown coloured hy
drated deutoxide of manganese when digested in the ammo
niacal salt yielded, by filtration, a fluid which was precipitated
by hydrosulphuret of ammonia, of the peculiar pale flesh
colour characteristic of salts of manganese; it is not impro
bable, however, that the oxide operated upon, although ap
parently of a uniform brown colour, might have contained a
little protoxide which had not passed into the state of deut
oxide by aerial exposure.          Phosphate of manganese when
treated in the same manner      yielded, by filtration, a fluid which
was    similarly acted upon   by  hydrosulphuret    of ammonia.
     Oride and Salts of Copper.—The hydrated peroxide of cop
per, the black anhydrous peroxide, and the carbonate of cop
per, when digested in cold muriate of ammonia yield, by            fil
tration, a blue coloured fluid, evidently containing the metallic
oxide in some form of combination.
    Salts of Bismuth-The submitrate of bismuth of the shops,
when digested in a cold solution of muriate of ammonia or
boiled in the same salt did not yield, by filtration, a fluid which
yielded a black precipitate by hydrosulphuret of ammonia;
the same may be said of the salt when recently precipitated, well
 washed and dried at the prevailing atmospheric temperature.
     The same applies to the protoxide and certain protosalts of   -
 tin.
     Salts of Silver.—The chloride, carbonate, and phosphate
 when prepared without exposure to light, and digested in the
 ammoniacal salt, without exposure to light also, yielded, by
 filtration, a fluid which was precipitated black by hydrosul
 phuret of ammonia.
     Persalts and Oride of Mercury.—The peroxide, carbonate,
 phosphate and biniodide, when digested in a cold solution of
 muriate of ammonia yield a fluid, which is abundantly preci
 pitated of a black colour by hydrosulphuret of ammonia.
     Some other metallic oxides and salts still remain to be

     N.B. It will be observed that the results arrived at with
  the salts of bismuth are different from those mentioned in
 the former paper, p. 98; but it must be remembered that they
  were operated upon under different circumstances as then
  noticed.

LXV.       On the Laws of Transmission of Light and Heat in
     uncrystallized Media.  By P. KellAND, B.A., Fellow and
     Tutor of Queen's College, Cambridge, and Member of the
     Cambridge Philosophical Society.*
THE  difficulties under which a mechanical theory labours
  must necessarily be owing, in the outset, to a view of the
subject not sufficiently simple.     In the memoir f from which
the following  pages  are  extracted,  I have endeavoured to re
duce the equations of motion of a series of particles trans
mitting vibrations, to the most simple possible form; and from
that form to deduce, conversely, conclusions with respect to
the action of the particles themselves. Whether indeed a more
general form of the solution of the resulting equations may
not be the correct one, is another question, which I have dis
cussed in a memoir lately presented to the Cambridge Philo
sophical Society. . It would be out of place again to give a
historical view of the subject, as it has been ably done by Pro
fessor Powell, in his “Abstract of M. Cauchy's Viewsf.”                                                                  I
have satisfied myself with developing my views as briefly as
I    can.
     In order to reduce the investigation to the simplest possible
form, I will suppose the particles symmetrically arranged with
respect to the three coordinate axes, and conceive the trans
mission to take place along one of these axes, that of r. It
is clearly requisite that such an hypothesis should be made
when we treat of media not crystallized.

   And further, if the force vary according to an inverse power
of the distance, or to a function which can be expanded in
inverse powers, the terms introduced by the successive half

the velocity will then depend essentially on that term which

340          Mr. Kelland               on the Laws                 of Transmission
The same circumstance, therefore, which increases                                                         dimi

     Now if n-1 and n-3 had both the same sign, an increase
in    would increase or diminish both the above quantities at
      s
the same time; and a like effect would result from a diminu
tion of e.
   We must therefore have one positive and the other nega
tive; which can only be effected by supposing n to be either a
fraction, or equal to 2: the latter supposition is the more
probable, and we shall presently see additional reasons for
supposing it the true one.
   Again, since the velocity is greatest in vacuo where the va
riation of velocity is least; it follows that s must be less or the
density of the other greater in vacuo than in refracting media.
   By substituting this value of the law of force, we obtain

Let the system of particles in a vertical line have a vertical
motion, and the slightest consideration will show us that the
immediate consequence is the production of a vertical motion
in the particles immediately in advance of them; whilst, as
before, the reciprocal action of the latter particles tends to
impede the motion of the former.        Here, then, we have as
clear a case as  before,  and our  general conclusion from the

more complete and satisfactory explanation      the phaenomena      of
of  heat and light than the undulatory hypothesis. On the
present occasion propose, without entering into any contro

                                          in
nomena   of heat may            be
                          deduced from the action     two forces.          of
An attractive force between the   particles  heat and those     of                        of

themselves.
I    assume that the particles                  of
                                  heat are very small     com                    in

separated   from each other. The phaenomena also require
that the repulsive force should decrease more rapidly than
the attractive force. These premises being admitted, the fol
lowing consequences may, if I do not mistake, be deduced
from them. For brevity's sake I omit the demonstrations,
presuming that they will be readily supplied by those versed
in mathematics.
   1. If a particle of heat approach a particle of solid matter,
it will either fall to the surface and remain there, or it will
describe a curvilinear orbit thereabout. According to the
direction and velocity of                                 its
                                  approach, this orbit will either                                                        be
confined within       certain limit, like
                                      a         ellipse,     will      off         an                   or          go

       infinite distance,  like       hyperbola.              to an

                  I                  call these two classes       curves                                      of

                                 solid bodies are drawn towards each

             two    forces,  their mutual attraction, and their attrac

 unchanged, the balance              the opposing forces              balance               is
                                                                                            a                    of

                                                                                                  to
a   certain  quantity            of
                            sensible heat will                               be
                                                         converted into latent
heat. At the same time another portion                        sensible heat will  of
be   acquired from the surrounding bodies and the united re

                    of the principal            Phaenomena               of Heat.                          345
pulsive force of these two portions of heat will overbalance the
forces of attraction. Thus we have an explanation of the phae
nomena of vaporization.
     An account of                the causes    of this last              class     of   phaenomena
somewhat resembling the above has been given by Laplace
in the twelfth book of the Mécanique Céleste.                   Laplace how
ever   gives   no  explanation      of the difference between latent and
sensible heat: he attributes the phaenomena of expansion ex
clusively to sensible heat, but does not explain why heat when
it becomes latent should lose                        its
                                             repulsive force:          supposes              he

of           matter,                       rest unless disturbed; and

     7.   In the same chapter Laplace has given                     explanation         an
of   the phaenomena                 of
                                liquefaction, which appears                                       to

says, “is subjected                to

none, the second force predominates, and the body takes the
liquid form.”
 I     am unable          comprehend why the attractive force be
                              to

unequal expansion of crystallized bodies in different directions.
It was suggested that the particles of heat do not accumulate
equally round every part of a particle of solid matter if                                                          its
axes are         of

son a particle of heat attempting to escape from the surface of
a metallic body is more strongly drawn back by the attractive
force of the particles than at the surface of other bodies.
The metals have therefore less radiating power than any other
substances.
   11.   The particles of heat emerging from    the surfaces of solid
bodies at  angles   so small as to be drawn back again into their
substance, form collectively an atmosphere enveloping those
surfaces, and extending, there is reason to believe, to distances
considerably greater than the interval which separates the
solid particles from one another.         It is to this atmosphere
that we must attribute the repulsive power exerted at the sur
faces of bodies, metallic bodies especially, by virtue of which
mercury is depressed in a barometer tube, and a steel needle
floats on the surface of water. By strong pressure this en
veloping atmosphere may be expelled from between two me
tallic surfaces, and the attractive force of their particles then
coming into play, they adhere with considerable force. The
reflexion of heat at the surfaces of bodies also appears to be
due to the action of this enveloping atmosphere.

   P.S..  Ihave assumed,       conformity with the views
                                         in                                            of   La

  sique (tom. lxii. p. 225.) an interesting paper    on Kaolin
by Berthier, the conclusions of which, however, do not seem
to me to be perfectly satisfactory, I am induced to offer a few
remarks, together with an account of some experiments on
the Cornish kaolin, in hopes of calling attention to this cu
rious but complicated problem in “the chemistry of geo
logy.”
  $nier commences by observing                              that in a former analysis
he found the kaolin            of Limoges to be composed of

   The presence of the alkali he attributed to a mixture of un
decomposed felspar; and this being deducted, he considers
that the remaining pure plastic clay is a silicate of alumina, re
presented by the formula AS+Aq, as also given by For
chammer for the porcelain earth of Bornholm.          But by a re
cent set of  experiments   Berthier has found a considerable
portion of magnesia in kaolin from various localities, as shown
by the following analyses of the pure argillaceous parts, pre
viously separated from the intermixed                   by the suc
cessive application of sulphuric acid and of a solution of po

  This mineral Berthier regards as the peculiar felspar from
which the kaolin has been derived by decomposition.       He
has taken some pains to establish this point; and has at
tempted by calculation, founded on the above analyses, to give
the true atomic composition of this supposed felspar.
however, inclined to think that he is mistaken: for the unal

  Werner was the first to attribute it to the action of water
containing free carbonic acid, by which the alkali of the felspar
is gradually abstracted. This opinion prevailed among chemists
until Berthier showed that silica is also carried off dissolved
in the alkaline solution, leaving a silicate of alumina, the con
stituents of which are consequently not in the same proportion
as in felspar.
    The late Dr. Turner has illustrated this subject in a very
clear and pleasing manner, (Philosophical Magazine for July
 1833,) explaining the change by the following formula:
                                 Felspar.                 Porcelain-earth.
                  (Po-H.3            9 Si); (Al-H 83 Si).
                               Si)+(Al-
    The potassa is first set at liberty by the action of water and
carbonic acid, and the composition of the felspar being thus
subverted, the silica whilst in a nascent state is dissolved by
the alkaline solution with which it is in immediate contact.
“The formula,” says Dr. Turner, “showed that every two
equivalents of alumina present in porcelain clay along with
three and a half of silica, corresponded in the original felspar
from which it was derived, to twelve equivalents of silica and
one of potash. Hence the quantity of silica carried off was
enormous.”
     The process of decomposition from which kaolin results has
 also been well described by Fournet as quoted by Becquerel
 (Traité de l’Electricité et du Magnétisme, tom. i. p. 503), who
 has collected much interesting information on this subject.
     “‘Le feldspath, quand il est désagrégé et terreux, dit M.

     These   explanations   are consistent with our present know
  ledge of   chemistry; but they rest too much          induction, andon
  not on   actual experiment.      For,    the first place, before the

felspar) in which the protogine occurs is buts lightly altered?
    It appears more probable that a difference in composition
in the felspars of these rocks will afford the true solution of
this problem, and though the data on which we can at pre

that the presence of magnesia in the felspar of protogine may,
among other causes, contribute toward the extraordinary
change which this rock experiences. Thus, the magnesia may
absorb carbonic acid, as well as the alkali, from the percolat

  All   circumstances considered, I fear we can only regard
Mr. Marsh's very ingenious test for arsenic as furnishing good
collateral evidence, capable indeed, in scientific hands, of giving
very correct indications, but wholly unfit to be entrusted to those
unaccustomed to careful chemical manipulation.              say this                         I

neutral; the opposing forces of attraction and repulsion being
equal.”
 "ºnce as these         forces are obedient to the same law of di
stance, light, whether disengaged in the form of caloric, or
united in a more compressed state to the atmosphere of an
atom of matter, must be imponderable; the attraction of the
surrounding matter being everywhere counteracted by the re
pulsive force of the light attached to                           it.

    DEAR SIR,
   FEEL exceedingly indebted to you for pointing out to
    me the observations of M. Lassaigne on the coagulation of
albumen by electric currents, in the Annales de Chimie. From
this paper it appears that M. Lassaigne applied a similar ex
planation to the coagulating influence exerted by electric cur
rents on free albumen to that which I ventured to propose
in a late number of your Magazine”. The original paper in
the Annales de Chimie is very brief, and the author's hypothesis
is expressed in the following words:
   “(L'albumine) la plus pure qu'on puisse se procurer pro
vient de l'oeuf; encore celle-ci contient-elle une petite quantité
de chlorure de sodium.      Il doit nécessairement arriver, lors
qu'on soumet une pareille solution à l'action de la pile, que la

    The only experiment detailed by Lassaigne in direct sup
port of his hypothesis is by no means satisfactory, involving
as it does the necessity of the solubility of albumen after its
coagulation by alcohol in distilled water; still as the experi

stantly in view while studying the action of the electric forces.
     I have endeavoured to compare the electro-magnetic effects
of a current by means of weight. The following is a descrip
tion of the apparatus employ.        I        I take an assaying balance so
delicate that it will be turned          by a fraction of a milligramme”.
At each end of the beam there is suspended from a vertical
pin a scale pan with a magnet having                     north pole hangingits
downwards.             then fix
                        I           upon          apparatus  an  properly con

                 passed into them without touching their concave
surfaces. Around each                        of
                                      these tubes there          wound       cop         is               a

 that the beam will move              the same direction, when the wire

  spirals similar to those just mentioned, except that they con
  sisted of two sets of circumvolutions, have been employed.                                       I
  have employed them for the purpose of determining the tem
  peratures of the several layers of the flame of an alcohol lamp
 by means of two platina wires of different diameters joined
 at one end. The temperatures were found to be 1310°-98,
 913°-24, 743°50.
     The instances adduced in this memoir are decisive as to the
 facility with which, by means of weight, we may compare the
 intensities of currents produced by electricities of different
 tensions.
      Ifwe wish to measure the continuous action of a force, we
  must first endeavour to give it an unvarying intensity.                 But
  the electric current produced by the common piles, and even
  by a single pair, is liable to continual variations, which render
  it impossible to make             its
                                  mode        action the subject

a solution of potash, and the intermediate glass tube with clay
moistened with a solution of sea-salt.            The lower ends of the
platina tubes are closed with covers of the same metal pierced
with a great number of small holes. This end of the tube,
which is filled with the clay moistened with acid, is plunged into
nitric acid, and the same end of the other into a solution of
potash.     In order to facilitate the transmission of the

a certain quantity of finely divided platina, for the purpose of

362.       M. Becquerel             on an Electro-magnetic Balance,
the relations by which affinities are connected with the electric
forces. Since the discoveries made by Mr. Faraday on the
nature and extent of electro-chemical decomposition, we know
that the chemical power of a current is in the direct ratio of
the absolute quantity of electricity which is in motion.      It is
by resting on this principle that he succeeded in his endeavours
to determine the equivalents of bodies; but in his researches
he disregarded the absolute intensity of the force that is in ac
tion at each instant. This is the defect which have sought to             I
 supply by means of my apparatus.       It has long been remarked
 that the elements which are combined with the greatest energy
 are also decomposed with the greatest readiness by currents,
 and that the elements which are combined in consequence of
 feeble affinities are those which offer the most obstinate resist
 ance to the decomposing action of electricity in motion.        It
 seems to follow from this circumstance that             compound              all
bodies are dissolved under the influence                current propor
                                                                   of    a

tioned    to the force      theof
                                affinity      which their elements are
united.       Ifthen we could establish       relation between the                               in
tensity   of  this current and affinity, we should            enabled          be                to
measure the latter.        In researches of this kind due attention
must     be  paid      the following observations

(the atomic weight of the zinc,) instead of 32:5, found by Mr.
Faraday.    It is evident, then, that the apparatus with a con
stant current, and consisting only of two pairs, together with
the electro-magnetic balance, enables us to find the atomic
weights of metals, and to determine the quantities of reduced
metal that correspond to a given intensity of current.

                    By H. F. Talbot, Esq., F.R.S.*
      BELIEVE     the following experiment to be a new one, and
     it seems to afford a satisfactory illustration of the theory.
    Make a circular hole in a piece of card of the size of the pupil
of the eye. Cover one half of this opening with an extremely
 thin film of glass (probably mica would answer the purpose
as well, or better).     Then view through this aperture a per
fect spectrum formed by a prism of moderate dispersive power,
and the spectrum will appear covered throughout               length               its
with parallel obscure bands, resembling the absorptions pro
duced by iodine vapour.

and    then again        a    whole number, and                so     on    alternately    a
great number        of times.        Whenever             #. is   a   whole number,

carboniferous limestone thus appears to support not only
the bituminous coal measure series of the Alleghany and
Catskill mountains on the N. and the E., but also to inclose
and support on the E. the anthracitous deposits of Carbondale,
Lackawanna, and Wyoming; in fact, serving as a base to the
alternating series No. 3, which supports the more productive
coal-bearing measures No. 4*. The further continuity of the

.   This   leads me again to the consideration   of the alternating
series in  Pennsylvania,   composed     largely  of red sandstones
and red shales, with beds of sandstone conglomerate and of
limestone, and some bituminous coal, mostly arranged in
double anticlinal and synclinal order, as exposed to observa
tion between the bituminous coal ranges of the Alleghany
mountains on the west, and the anthracitous coal region of
Schuylkill, &c. on the east. Had not Mr. R. C. Taylor de
nominated this alternating series transition, and the red sand
stone immediately underlying the Alleghany bituminous range
old red sandstone, judging merely by the evidence produced,
and reasoning from analogy,                           I
                                    should have been induced to
consider them as the prototypes or representatives of the class
of beds which appear in the northern face of the Alleghany
mountains, and which                   I
                          have designated as No. 3; both in fact
appearing to form the immediate support of the more produc
tive coal-bearing measures No. 4. . No evidence is given by
the accompanying fossils to prove that this alternating series
belongs to the transition period. On the other hand, it is ad
mitted by the author               (p.
                           409.) that this alternating series com
prises four     five troughs
                     or           basins containing coal, which
                                                 or                                                     on

and   on approaching the S.W. contains upwards             per cent.                of        16
of bitumen and volatile matter; while some the anthracitous               of
beds pass into bituminous coals       certain places    408). This

LXXV.       On the Rev. J.          G. MacVicar's Experiment                     on    Vision.
                        By    J. T. GRAVEs,               Esq.,   A.M."
THE   ordinary laws of reflection and perspective are suffi
  cient to account for the radiated appearance described by
the Rev. Mr. MacVicar (anté, p. 234,) without the hypothesis
 of any hitherto unknown symmetrizing power in the eye.
    No radiation is observed when the particles are spread at
whatever distance over a non-reflecting surface, or are placed
 in immediate contact with a reflecting one. Now if a reflecting
 surface in the required position of contiguous parallelism to
 the plane of the dust contributes to the success of the experi
 ment, it is surely d priori likely that it does so rather by the
 addition it makes to the objects of vision than by any induced
 alteration in the mechanism of the eye, affecting the mode in
 which the former objects, if seen alone, would be viewed.                                  Ac
 cordingly we are led to consider the actual nature of the pic
 ture before us when the phaenomenon is observed.
    When we survey with one eye dust spread over a common
 looking-glass, we see not only the particles themselves but
 their images reflected by the mercury (wherever those images
 are not intercepted by the position of other particles on the
 glass), and both classes of objects, from their general similarity
 of appearance, are referred to the same plane. Upon further
 examination we shall perceive that every reflected image when
 referred to the external surface of the looking-glass, appears
 in a direct line between               its
                                   prototype and the point            that             of
external surface nearest the centre          the eye.     of making this  In

     1st. 72°13 grs, dissolved in dilute muriatic acid and               the
  gas made to pass over chloride of calcium, lost 21:18                 grs.
  = 29-363 per     cent. of carbonic acid.
     2ndly. 50.57 grs. dissolved in muriatic acid, precipitated
 by fluo-silicic acid and heated to redness, gave of fluoride of
  barium 29.18 grs. = 32.996 carbonate of baryta, or 65.248
  per cent.
     The filtered solution was poured into a large quantity of
 water saturated with sulphate of strontia, and precipitated by
 sulphuric acid. The precipitate weighed 1.81 gr., and be
                                       -
 sides strontia contained also the small quantity of baryta held
 in solution by the fluo-silicic acid.         If we neglect this small
 quantity of baryta, we have 1.456 or 2:87– per cent. of car
 bonate of strontia.
    A    specimen from Bromley Hill, Dr. Thomson's locality,
 when dissolved in muriatic acid, left 0-16 per cent. of insoluble
 matter, and gave 29-71 per cent. of carbonic acid.
    36-58 grs. precipitated by fluo-silicic acid gave 20:14 grs.
 of fluoride = 22:774 or 62.156 per cent. of carbonate of
 baryta.
    The sulphate of strontia obtained as before, and containing
 a little baryta, weighed 302 = 8.256 per cent. = 6641              –  car
 bonate of strontia.
    33-05 grs. dissolved in muriatic acid largely diluted and
 precipitated by sulphuric acid, gave of sulphates” 26.84 grs.
    The supernatant solution precipitated by oxalate of am
 monia gave 10:01 of carbonate of lime or 30:29 per cent.
    The doubly oblique baryto-calcite of Mr. Brooke treated
 in the same manner gave me of carbonic acid 30:05, of car
 bonate of baryta 65-97, and of carbonate of strontia 2:317–
per cent.
    The following table exhibits these results in connection with
      I
   * have said sulphates, as it is hardly possible to free the precipitate
thus obtained from a trace of lime. It also contained sulphate of strontia.
41-27 grs. of the Fallowfield mineral gave me a precipitate weighing 58.88
grs.(it should be in pure Ba C+Ca C, 5636). Boiled in nitric acid it lost
3.31 grs.; again boiled 45.94 grs. lost 1-82, and a third time 40.065 grs.
lost 0-51. Evaporated to dryness and the dry mass converted into chlo
rides, I obtained a deliquescent chloride of calcium, tabular crystals of
chloride of barium, and prismatic crystals giving the characteristic purple
flame of chloride of strontium.     Though the last portions of lime and
strontia therefore may be dissolved out by repeated boiling in dilute nitric
acid, it would appear that the sulphate of baryta itself is not wholly inso
luble in this menstruum.

      Dr. Thomson informs          me that his mode         of analysis was to
 convert the mixed earths into nitrates and digest in absolute
 alcohol, a method sufficiently simple yet requiring consider
 able precautions to secure accuracy.                   It is barely possible
 that a small      portion   of the matrix of carbonate of lime on
 which the mineral rests may have escaped his notice and been
 mixed with the quantity analysed.
      In my former account of this mineral                I  did not advert to
 the presence of carbonate of strontia, as I had not attempted to
  separate it quantitively.        It is interesting, however, to find as
  the above results     show,    that this substance is capable of re
  placing, indifferently, either one or both of the isomorphous
  carbonates of lime and baryta, and in variable quantity.                     In
  the oblique rhombic (Brooke's), column 6th, it replaces 2 per
  cent of the carbonate of lime, while in the right rhombic it re
  places a portion of both, and in the specimen analysed from
  Bromley Hill about 8 per cent. of each.
      Sulphato-carbonate of Baryta.-Among the interesting new
  barytic minerals described by Dr. Thomson (Mineralogy,
  vol. i. p.106,) from the same locality,+Bromley Hill minenear
  Alston, is one affecting the form of large six-sided prisms ter
  minated by hexagonal pyramids, consisting of 34’3 or one atom
  of sulphate, and 64.82 or 2:2 atoms of carbonate of baryta.
  This mineral is said by the dealers to be found abundantly at
  the above mine; I have not however been able to obtain a
   specimen of the true sulphato-carbonate.                 In the cabinet of
   the Natural History Society of Newcastle, are two specimens
   ticketed sulphato-carbonate, both from Bromley Hill. One
   of these is in large obscure prisms an inch in diameter com
   posed of a congeries of small ones resting on a matrix of sul
  phate of baryta. This specimen agrees with the description
      • After heating to redness, during which it decrepitates slightly and be.
   comes opake, it had a specific gravity = 3-639.

 of the mineral by Dr. Thomson, and is said to have been pre
 sented by him. I find these crystals to be carbonate of baryta
 nearly pure, dissolving readily in muriatic acid and leaving
 an insoluble residue of 0.3 per cent.
    The other specimen is in broad flat pyramids, composed
 also of a congeries of minute crystals; is grayish, has a pearly
 lustre, and rests on right rhombic baryto-calcite. These cry
 stals were obtained from a mineral-dealer, and are also car
 bonate of baryta with a little lime.     Lime indeed in this                                                   di
strict seems to be very generally associated with the barytic
minerals.     Carbonate of baryta is exceedingly abundant at
 Fallowfield lead-mine, is generally of a pure white, and was,
till lately, collected and exported in considerable quantity to
the potteries in Staffordshire.      The trade, however, has de
clined from       beingits
                         found                     to
                                  contain too much lime.

  current of low intensity from a single pair of plates: the metallic so
 lution, in which a copper-plate was immersed, being contained in a
 glass tube, closed at the bottom by a diaphragm of plaster of Paris,
 and itself plunged in a weak solution of brine contained in a larger
 vessel, in which a plate of zinc was immersed ; and a communication
 being established between the two metallic plates by connecting wires.
 By the feeble, but continuous current thus elicited, sulphate of copper
 is found to be slowly decomposed, affording beautiful crystals of me
 tallic copper. Iron, tin, zinc, bismuth, antimony, lead, and silver
may, in like manner, be reduced, by a similar and slightly modified
process; in general appearing with metallic lustre, and in a crystal
 line form, and presenting a remarkable contrast in their appearance
to the irregular, soft, and spongy masses obtained from the same so
lutions by means of large batteries. The crystals of copper rival in
hardness and malleability the finest specimens of native copper, which
they much resemble in appearance. The crystallization of bismuth,
lead, and silver, by this process, is very beautiful; that of bismuth
being lamellar, of a lustre approaching to that of iron, but with the
reddish tint peculiar to the former metal.      Silver may thus be pro
cured of the whiteness of snow, and usually in the form of needles.
                                                                         _r-
Some metals, such as nickel, which, when acted on by currents from
large batteries, are deposited from their solutions as oxides only, are
obtained, by means of the apparatus used by the author, in a brilliant
metallic form. He further found that he could in this way reduce even
the more refractory metallic oxides, such as silica, which resist the
action of powerful batteries, and which M. Becquerel could only ob
tain in alloy with iron.    By a slight modification of the apparatus he
was enabled to form amalgams both of potassium and of sodium with
mercury, by the decomposition of solutions of chlorides of those bases;
and in like manner ammonium was easily reduced, when in contact
with mercury, by the influence of a feeble voltaic current. In this last
experiment it was found that an interruption to the continuance of the
current, even for a few seconds, is sufficient to destroy the whole of
the product which had been the result of the previous long-continued
action; the spongy ammoniacal amalgam being instantly decomposed,
and the ammonia formed being dissolved in the surrounding fluid.
     February 9.—A paper was read, in part, entitled, “On the Ele
mentary Structure of Muscular Fibre of Animal and Organic Life.”
By Frederick Skey, Esq., Assistant Surgeon to St. Bartholomew's
Hospital.    Communicated by John Bostock, M.D., F.R.S.
    February 16.-The reading of Mr. Skey's paper was resumed and
 concluded.
    The author concludes, from his microscopic examinations of the
structure of muscular fibres, that those subservient to the functions of
animal life have, in man, an averagediameter of one 400dth of an inch,
and are surrounded by transverse circular striae varying in thickness,
and in the number contained in a given space.        He describes these
striae as constituted by actual elevations on the surface of the fibre,
with intermediate depressions, considerably narrower than the dia

Tides. Seventh Series. On the Diurnal Inequality of the Height of
the Tide, especially at Plymouth and at Sincapore : and on the Mean
Level of the Sea.” By the Rev. W. Whewell, A.M., F.R.S., Fellow
of Trinity College, Cambridge.
   The diurnal inequality which the author investigates in the present
paper, is that by which the height of the morning tide differs from that
of the evening of the same day; a difference which is often very con
siderable, and of great importance in practical navigation, naval offi
cers having frequently found that the preservation or destruction of
a ship depended on a correct knowledge of the amount of this varia
tion. In the first section of the paper he treats of the diurnal ine
quality in the height of the tides at Plymouth, at which port good tide
observations are regularly made at the Dock Yard; and these obser
vations clearly indicate the existence of this inequality.        As      the                                all
other inequalities             of
                        the tides have been found        follow the laws               to                          of
the equilibrium theory, the author has endeavoured            trace the laws                 to
of   the diurnal inequality      assuming        by
                                              similar kind      correspond

ence with the same theory; and the results have confirmed,                the                                in
most striking manner, the correctness         that assumption. By taking

fifth lunar transit preceding each tide.

the difference between mean      spring  and  neap  tides not exceeding two

at  some other places, and the general law             progress. The change of   its

   In section fourth, the author treats of certain extreme cases of diur
nal inequality; particularly those which produce the phaenomenon of
a single tide in the twenty-four hours: such as that noticed by Capt.
Fitzroy at King George's Sound, on the south coast of New Holland;
and that of Tonquin, referred by Newton to the interference of two
 tides arriving by different channels, but probably owing to the ope
ration of the same law as that which gives rise to the diurnal ine
quality.
    In section fifth, the author considers the subject of the mean height
of the sea; that         is,
                          the height midway between low water and high
water each day: and arrives                    at
                                       the result that         very nearly con   it     is
stant.

University of Dublin.        -
   The author observes that the theory of the action of metals upon
light is among the desiderata of physical optics, whatever informa
tion we possess upon this subject being derived from the experiments
of Sir David Brewster.      But, in the absence of a real theory, it is
important that we should be able to represent the phaenomena by
means of empirical formulae; and, accordingly, the author has en
deavoured to obtain such formulae by a method analogous to that
which Fresnel employed in the case of total reflexion at the surface
of a rarer medium, and which, as is well known, depends on a pecu
liar interpretation of the sign y — 1. For the case of metallic re
flexion, the author assumes that the velocity of propagation in the
metal, or the reciprocal of the refractive index, is of the form
                               m (cos   x   +    V   – I sin x);
without attaching to this form any physical signification, but using
it ratheras a means of introducing two constants (for there must be
two constants, m and X, for each metal) into Fresnel's formulae for
ordinary reflexion, which contain only one constant, namely, the
refractive index.
  Then if i be the angle of incidence                     on the metal, and i' the angle
of refraction, we have
                    sin   i'=m (cos     x   +

    which are observed when common light is incident, the intrusion of
    a new ring, &c. But there is one curious appearance which he
    does not find described by any former author. It is this.

    the last twenty or thirty degrees of incidence the first dark
    surrounding the central spot which is comparatively bright, remains
    constantly of the same magnitude; although the other rings, like
                                                            greatly with
    Newton's rings formed between two glass lenses, dilate
    the obliquity of incidence.  This  appearance   was observed  at the
    same time  by  Professor Lloyd.   The  explanation  is easy.  It de
    pends simply on this circumstance, (which is evident from the
    table,) that the angle 180°–3, at these oblique incidences, is nearly
    proportional to cos i.
       As to the index of refraction in metals, the author conjectures
    that it is equal to             COS

      Nov.  30, 1836.-Sir  William  Betham  exhibited to the Academy a
    specimen of the ancient brazen ring money, found in the county of
    Monaghan, and also a piece of cast iron, found with many others, in
    boxes, on board a vessel wrecked on the coast of Cork last summer.
    This vessel was bound to Africa, where it is stated the pieces in
    question pass for money.   They are so similar in shape and size to
    the ancient specimens, that there can be no reasonable doubt of the
    identity of their uses; and thus the theory advanced in the paper
    referred to is strongly confirmed.

quiries suggest themselves naturally.       Thus the axes of symmetry
of the medium are taken as the axes of coordinates, and the direc
tion of propagation is assumed to coincide with one of these axes.
By these suppositions the differential equations of motion are reduced
to a very simple form; and it is manifest that the assumptions
themselves involve no real limitation of the problem.          The well
known expressions for the component displacements are deduced by
the integration of these equations.      The following is that in the di
rection of the axis of a .
                        # =  a cos (ut — kz +   a);
in which
r being   the period of vibration, and A the length of the wave. These
 quantities are connected by a relation given by the method of        in
tegration.
    The preceding formula, however, is not the most general form of
the expression for the displacement.         It is found that in certain
cases the integral becomes
                      # = ae-* cos (ut   – gz + a).
 From this expression it follows that the amplitude of the displace
 ment, and therefore the intensity of the light, decreases in geome
 trical progression, as the distance increases in arithmetical progres
 sion; and as the constant his in general a function of u, or of the
 colour, the differently coloured rays will be differently absorbed.
                           :
 The complete value of being the sum of a series of terms similar to
 the preceding, it is manifest that we have here a satisfactory account
 of the apparently irregular distribution of light in the absorbed
 spectrum.     To explain the absolute deficiency of the light at cer
 tain points, it is only necessary to admit that the function h varies
 in certain cases rapidly with moderate changes in u, and becomes
 very great for certain definite values of that quantity.
     The preceding integral has been already obtained by M. Cauchy,
  in a valuable memoir recently printed in lithograph.        The method
 employed by the author seems, however, to be fundamentally dif
  ferent from that of M. Cauchy; and in fact he was led to this form
  of the integral by other considerations before he was aware that he
  had been preceded in the deduction.
     The remainder of the present communication is taken up with
  the discussion of the relation between the coefficients u and k, which
  expresses the law of dispersion.      Following M. Cauchy", the au
  thor has transformed this relation by converting the triple sums into
  triple integrals; and he has found that, by applying this transfor
  mation at an earlier stage of the investigation, the resulting relation
  is deduced with great simplicity.

                                         Royal Irish Academy.                                                  387
  The relation between                        u and k,         for the vibrations in the plane of
the wave, has already-yielded to M. Cauchy the probable result,
that the molecules of the aether repel one another according to the
inverse fourth power of the distance.    When this law of force is
substituted in the corresponding relation for the normal vibration,
                                                         -                      ºt                         -
the author finds that the resulting value of º, or of the velocity of
propagation, is infinite; so that the normal disturbance is propa
gated instantaneously, and gives rise to no wave.    Thus the hypo
thesis of transversal vibrations seems to be established on theore
tical grounds.
   The author finally gives reasons for concluding that the theory,
in    its
        present form,    insufficient    isexplain the phaenomena    to                                         of

into account the action of the material molecules.      This extension
of  the theory will   given         be

   We are indebted to Mr. Austen for a description of the South of
Devonshire between the river Ex and Berry Head, and between the
coast and Dartmoor, a district consisting of transition rocks, new
red sandstone, greenstone, and trap. His speculations on the origin
of the different formations and the causes which gave rise to the
existing features in the physical geography of the country display
much talent and are full of instruction”.
   The structure of Devonshire has also furnished a fertile field of                                            in
quiry to Messrs. Sedgwick and Murchison since our last Anniversary.
They have attempted the difficult task of establishing a classifica
tion of the older rocks so largely developed in that county. In every
geological map hitherto published of Devonshire,            the stratified             all
deposits      of
               higher antiquity than the new red sandstone had been
represented            by
                  one common colour, the limestones being                                        all

                                   Mr. Lyell's Address.                                                    389
contain thick beds of limestone, entirely dissimilar in structure and
fossil contents from any limestones of the underlying “grauwacke,”
in which they had previously been merged. The culm measures
consist of grit, sandstone, shale and limestone; and these rocks, it is
said, are never affected by a slaty cleavage like the lower Silurian
and Cambrian rocks on which they rest.         From this character, as
well as from their prevailing mineralogical structure and imbedded
fossil plants, the authors regard the culmiferous formation of Devon
as perfectly identical in age with other coal-fields, and as more par
ticularly analogous to the culm-bearing strata of Pembrokeshire;
a part of which also once passed for “grauwacke,” but Mr. Mur
chison has recently shown that it belongs to the South Welsh coal
field, which is known by      geologists  allrest upon mountain lime

  can only presume from analogy that since the shells, corals, and other

organic remains of that ancient group differ from those found above
the old red sandstone, the plants also, if ever discovered, will differ
as greatly.     Considerable surprise was therefore excited when,
during the Presidentship of my predecessor in this chair, a letter
was read, addressed to him from Mr. De la Beche, stating that he
had found, near Bideford in North Devon, many well known coal
plants in the lower greywacke, or far down in the transition series”.
Such of the plants as were determinable had been identified by
Professor Lindley with species characteristic of the true coal
measures, and which had never been found elsewhere below the
coal.    The anomaly, therefore, in the supposed position of these
fossils was so great, that between the ordinary geological site of
such remains, and that in which they were here inferred to present
themselves, there would be interposed if the series were complete
the whole of the old red sandstone, and at least the two upper forma
tions of the Silurian system. When this point was considered, I
expressed to the Society my opinion, in common with Mr. Mur
chison, as to the insufficiency of the proofs relied on by our
Foreign Secretary, and we felt that we had a right to call for more
conclusive evidence. The simple fact of shales having been found
charged with true coal plants, raised so strong a presumption in
 favour of their belonging to the regular carboniferous series, that
 the burthen of proof rested with him who wished to assign to them
either a higher or lower position.        Our scepticism was regarded
by Mr. Greenough as implying too marked a bias for a preconceived
 theory, and this he afterwards hinted in his Anniversary Addresst.
I  may affirm, however, that in the first place it implied on my part
 no distrust of Mr. De la Beche's skill or experience in geological sur
 veying, and that had Professor Sedgwick and Mr. Murchison ad
vanced a similar opinion on analogous proofs, I should equally have
withheld my assent.      Suppose, for example, they had announced to
us that they had found fossil fruits and leaves identical with those of
 Sheppey in strata of the age of the white chalk with flints. I should
have demanded from them, in corroboration, the most clear, un
equivocal, and overwhelming evidence.                  If
                                              it were a region of dis
turbed and vertical  strata, I should expect   them first to have re
sorted in vain to every hypothesis of inverted stratification with a
view of explaining away such an exception to the general rule.
     Imight perhaps be told that we are unacquainted with the flora
of the upper cretaceous period, and I admit that we are as ignorant
of it as of that which belonged to the transition period; but when
we consider the contrast of the shells and other fossils of the
chalk and London clay, we naturally anticipate that if plants are ever
found of the precise age of our chalk with flints, they will not prove
to be of the same species as those of the Sheppey clay. There
is a like presumption from analogy against the conclusion that the
same vegetation continued to flourish on the earth from the period
of the lower greywacke to that of the coal, because we know that

in the course of the intervening epochs the testacea, zoophytes, fish,
and other classes of organic beings were several times changed.
   In regard to the proofs relied on by Mr. De la Beche, should                                           I
observe that he never attempted to show that the plant-bearing
shales at Bideford were interstratified with rocks charged with
shells or other fossils known to belong to rocks older than the old
red sandstone.
   Since writing the above sketch of the different views recently
published of the structure of Devonshire, I have received a letter
from Mr. De la Beche, from which                            I
                                         am happy to learn, that it is
his intention before concluding his report on the Ordnance Map
of Devon, to reexamine Devonshire.           He is far, he says, from
pretending that his first views were perfect, and if he finds rea
son to modify any of them, he shall not hesitate to announce the
change of opinion.     In the mean time he no longer contends that
the culmiferous strata are referable to the lower graywacké, and
considers the point of difference to       within               lie

 implying    as great an anomaly as that which he had imagined to
occur in    Devonshire,  and by which he was himself once led into
error   during  an Alpine  excursion, about eighteen years since, when
 he met with coal     plants  in the schists of the Col de Balme, in
 Switzerland.     He then inferred that the beds belonged to the true
 coal  measures,  but M. Elie de Beaumont afterwards proved them
to belias; that is to say, he identified them with other rocks not far
 distant in the Alps, which were shown to be lias by containing Belem
nites and other fossils. Mr. De la Beche was at first sceptical on the
point, but after revisiting the Alps, he came round to the same opi
mion.    Having therefore been in one instance misled by relying on
the fossil vegetables of the coal as affording a good chronological
test, he naturally attached but small value to the same testimony as
a criterion of the age of another set of rocks in Devonshire.       Now
you will easily understand that a geologist, who is once persuaded
that the same plants flourished in European latitudes from the pe
riod of the true coal to that of the lias, will be ready to concede
without difficulty the probable existence of the same plants at an
era long antecedent to the coal. We know that between the depo
sition of the coal and the lias there were successive revolutions in
the races of animals which inhabited the waters, the zoophytes,
mollusca, fish, and, as far as we know them, the reptiles having been
changed again and again; so that the fossils of the mountain lime
stone differ from those of the magnesian limestone or zechstein,
these again from the organic remains of the muschelkalk, and these
last from those of the lias.       If we are to believe that the same
plants survived on the land, while such fluctuations in animal life
occurred in the waters, why should we not imagine the longevity of
the same species to have been still greater, so that they began to
exist even before the deposition of the old red sandstone 7 But let
me remind you that botanists have been led to very different con
clusions respecting the laws governing the distribution of fossil ve
getables from the study of undisturbed districts. You are not
ignorant that the strata of the Alps are involved in extreme confu
sion and complexity, mountain masses having been completely
overturned and twisted, so that the same set of strata have been
found at the top and bottom of the same section separated by seve
ral thousand feet of beds belonging to an older formation.           So
obscure is the order of position in Alpine geology, that the cretaceous
and greensand series have been classed by experienced geologists
as more ancient than the oolite, under which, in point of fact, they
occasionally lie.
    Professor Studer, in his work on the Bernese Highlands, after
years of personal investigation, has published a map in which he
has given a coloured ground plan without venturing to commit him
self by sections, or a table of the regular order of superposition.
    After devoting a summer to the investigation of the same portion
of Switzerland, with the advantage of Mr. Studer's map and work,
I  was unable to satisfy myself that I had found a key to the classi
fication or superposition of the formations, so enormous is the scale

Col de Balme, but I have not examined the precise localities further
to the west appealed to by M. de Beaumont.                  I am far, therefore,
from denying his facts or inferences, hoping at some future period
more carefully to inquire into the evidence on the spot.                 No one,                                           I
am aware, is more desirous that others should visit the southern
Alps and verify or criticise his facts than M. de Beaumont. Mean
while I am reminded of an expression of our mutual friend M. von
Buch. When I related to him some geological phaenomena which
surprised him ;                “I
                         believe it,” he said, “because you have seen
 it,but had      only seen

that the upper is characterized by a  mixture of marine and fresh
water shells, the freshwater genera    being Cyrena, Neritina, Me
lanopsis, and Planorbis. The lower     division contains exclusively
marine shells.   The author refers     this intermixture to the          in
flux of a river into the sea, in which the London clay was formed.
Mr. Morris considers the Bognor strata, which rest immediately
upon chalk, as the equivalents of the lower Woolwich deposit, ob
serving that the shells agree with those of the London clay. These
remarks seem to confirm the conclusion to which he had been pre
viously led by the grand section at Alum Bay in the Isle of Wight,
namely, that the beds usually styled plastic and London clays be
long to one zoological period.
                                 MINERAL WEINS,
 Your attention has been called to the origin of mineral veins by
Mr. Fox, who has endeavoured to explain why so large a propor
tion of the metalliferous veins in England and other parts of the
world should have an east and west direction.       He supposes fis
sures filled with water,  containing  sulphurets and muriates of cop
per, tin, iron, and zinc in solution, through which currents of voltaic
electricity are transmitted.    The metals separated from their sol
vents by this action are deposited in the veins, and most abundantly
in veins running at right angles to the direction of the earth's mag
netism; for as the magnetic currents of the earth pass from north
to south, they cause those of electricity to move east and west, al
though considerable deviations from this direction must be occa
sioned in the course of geological epochs by variations in the mag
netic meridian”.
   Since Mr. Fox first ascertained the existence of electric currents
 in some of the metalliferous veins in Cornwallt, Mr. Henwood has
 made many experiments on the same subject, together with obser
 vations on the distribution of metallic and earthy minerals in veins.
 He considers the results obtained by him to be in a great degree op
 posed to the theory of Mr. Foxt.
    Mr. Fox conceives the fissures in which metalliferous substances
 occur, to have been at firstsmalland narrow, and to have increased gra
 dually in their dimensions. This doctrine has also been propounded
 in a work with which you are probably familiar, and from which I
 have derived much instruction,            I
                                     mean M. Fournet's Essay on Me

 volume of M. Burat's continuation of D'Aubuisson's Treatise on
 Geology (1835), but it is now published separately, and gives the
 clearest general view which           I
                                  have seen of the application of geo

by one who has acquired much practical knowledge as a miner, and
who is well versed in chemistry and mineralogy*.
    Werner, when he published his justly celebrated Essay on Mine
ral Veins, had come to the conclusion that the same rent, after being
wholly or partially filled, has sometimes been reopened; and M.
Fournet has endeavoured more fully to explain the successive dila
tation of the same veins at distinct periods. He has given examples
in mines worked under his direction in Auvergne, in which the sul
phurets of iron, copper, lead, and zinc, besides quartz, barytes, and
other minerals, seem evidently to have been introduced at different
periods by chemical action accompanied by new fractures and dis
locations of the rocks, and the widening of preexisting fissurest.
    You will find in M. Fournet's treatise a copious analysis of a great
variety of books on mining, besides a detail of facts which have
fallen under his own observation.        He has described first those
veins which are    decidedly connected with rents produced in rocks
by mechanical movements, and which are supposed to have been
chiefly filled from below by sublimation, more or less obviously con
 nected with volcanic action.      He afterwards passes on to the con
 sideration of those masses which have been called stockwerks by
the Germans, which are imagined by some to have their origin in
the contraction of granite, porphyry, and other rocks as they cooled,
numerous rents being then formed, in which metallic particles were
concentrated.       In treating the subject in this order the author ap
pears to me to have followed the most philosophical course, begin
 ning with cases of undoubted rents of mechanical origin filled with
minerals and metals introduced by sublimation, and then carry
ing with him as far as possible the light derived from these
sources to dissipate a part of the obscurity in which          theories re       all
specting the nature       of
                           Plutonic rocks and their minerals must, fear,                   I
 be  for ever involved.       Much will still remain unexplained; but
those who     proceed     in   an
                              opposite direction often throw doubt and
confusion upon the simplest phaenomena,           has sometimes happened
                                                           as
in    ananalogous case, when geologists have begun with the exami
nation     of
            granite and granite veins, and have then endeavoured                                 to

pleasure in alluding to the labours of Mr. H. E. Strickland and
Mr. Hamilton in Asia Minor". These gentlemen first examined the
neighbourhood of Constantinople, and found on both sides of the
Thracian Bosphorus an ancient group of fossiliferous strata, con
sisting of schist, sandstone, and limestone.         From the character of
the fossils it is inferred that these rocks may probably be the equi
valents of the upper transition or Silurian strata of England. The
shells belong to the brachiopodous genera Spirifer, Producta, and
Terebratula, with which the remains of corals and Crinoidea were
associated, and fragments of a Trilobite.
    The rarity of any fossiliferous deposits of higher antiquity than
the old red sandstone in any of the countries bordering the Mediter
ranean, or indeed to the south of the Alps and Pyrenees, lends con
siderable interest to this observation. In their way through France,
our travellers examined the well-known region of extinct volcanos
in Auvergne, and afterwards found a counterpart to it in the Cata
cecaumene, a district in Asia known by that name in the time of
Strabo, from              its
                     burnt and arid appearance.        Some        the volcanos   of

forty feet in South Devon and Cornwall, nearly seventy feet in
North Devon, while in Lancashire, Cheshire, and Shropshire there
are marine deposits with recent shells at the height of from 300 to
                                                                                       A.

   It   is natural to inquire what changes the surface of the dry
land in England may have undergone during the occurrence of such
upward and downward movements.                  Perhaps some observations
lately made by Mr. Bowerbank in the south of the Isle of Wight
may elucidate this point. He has given us an account of a bed of
chalky detritus, containing recent land shells, at Gore Cliff.                This
bed is ten feet thick, and rests immediately upon chalk marl.
Many of the shells, which are plentifully scattered through                 retain                    it,
their colour.      As the deposit ranges           the foot      St. Catherine's

W.                                             the rise of land at
       youwill find   many
                         other facts      elucidating
alparaiso, and he has also treated of the general question of the
elevation of the whole coast     of the Pacific from Peru to Terra del
Fuego.       Beds of shells were traced by him at various heights above
the sea, some a few yards, others 500 or even 1300 feet high, the
shells being in a more advanced state of decomposition in propor
tion to their elevation.        Mr. Darwin also shows that parallel ter
races such as those of      Coquimbo,    described by Captain Basil Hall
and    others,   which rise to the   height of 300 feet and more, are of
marine     origin,  being  sometimes covered with sea-shells, and they
indicate successive elevations. There are also grounds for believing
that the modern upheaval of land has proceeded not only by sud
den starts during convulsions of the earth, but also by insensible
degrees in the intervals between earthquakes, as is now admitted to
                                                                -
be the case in parts of Norway and Sweden.
    This gradual and insensible rising is supposed to affect, not only
the region of the Andes, but also the opposite or eastern coast of
South America, where earthquakes are never experienced:                    for
the Pampas of Buenos Ayres bear marks of having risen to their
present height during a comparatively modern period, while the
coast line of the Pacific, or the region of earthquakes and volcanic
eruptions, has been the theatre of more violent movements.
     It is curious to reflect that if in one portion of a large area of the
 earth's surface a rise of land takes place at the rate of a few inches
 in a century, as around Stockholm, while in another portion of the
 same area land is uplifted about a yard during an equal period, there
 will be caused, if sufficient time be allowed, a group or chain of
 lofty mountains in one place, and in the other a low country like
 the Pampas of South America.
     Evidence of a sinking down of land, whether sudden or gradual,
 is usually more difficult to obtain than the signs of upheaval. I shall
 therefore mention some facts which have been lately communicated
 to me by Professor Nilsson, from which it appears that Scania, or
  the southernmost part of Sweden, has been slowly subsiding for se
 veral centuries, in the same manner as was lately shown to be the
  case with part of Greenland. In the first place there are no elevated
 beds of recent marine shells in Scania, like those near Stockholm and
  further to the north. Linnaeus, with a view of ascertaining whether
  the waters of the Baltic were retiring from the Scanian shore,
  measured in 1749 the distance between the sea and a large stone
  near Trelleborg.        Now Mr. Nilsson informs me that this same
  stone is a hundred feet nearer the water's edge than it was in Lin
  naeus's time, or eighty-seven years before. He also states that there
  is a submerged peat moss, consisting of land and freshwater plants,
  beneath the sea at a point to which no peat could have been drifted
  down by any river.        But, what is still more conclusive, it is found
  that in sea-port towns,  all  along the coast of   Scania, there are streets
  below the     high-water  level of  the Baltic,  and  in some cases below
  the level  of  the lowest tide. Thus when the wind          high
                                                             is    at Malmö

some excavations showed an ancient street in the same place eight
feet below, and it was then seen that there had evidently been an
artificial raising of the ground, doubtless in consequence of that sub
sidence.     There is also a street at Trelleborg and another at
Skanór a few inches below high-water mark; and a street at Ystad
is just on a level with the sea, at which it could not have been ori
ginally built. I trust that we shall soon receive more circumstantial
details of these curious phaenomena, which are the more interesting
because it has been shown that the elevatory movement in Sweden
diminishes in intensity as we proceed southward from the North
Cape to Stockholm, from which it seems probable that after passing
the line or axis of least movement, where the land is nearly stationary,
a movement may be continued in an opposite direction, and thus
 cause the gradual sinking of Scania.
     I cannot take leave of this subject without remarking that the
 occurrence in various parts of Ireland, Scotland, and England, of
recent shells in stratified gravel, sand, and loam, confirm the opi
 nion which I derived from an examination of part of Sweden,
 namely, that the formations usually called diluvial have not been
 produced by any violent flood or débacle, or transient passage
 of the sea over the land, but by a prolonged submersion of the
 land, the level of which has been greatly altered at periods very
 modern in our geological chronology.        I now believe that by far
 the greatest part of the dispersion of transported matter has been
 due to the ordinary moving power of water, often assisted by ice,
 and cooperating with the alternate upheaval and depression of land.
 I  do not mean wholly to deny that some sudden rushes of water
 and partial inundations of the sea have occurred, but we are enabled
 to dispense with their agency more and more in proportion as our
 knowledge increases.
                             ORGANIC REMAINS.
     Gentlemen, you have been already informed that the Council
 have this year awarded two Wollaston Medals, one to Captain
 Proby Cautley of the Bengal Artillery, and the other to Dr. Hugh
 Falconer, Superintendent of the Botanic Garden at Saharunpore,
 for their researches in the geology of India, and more particularly
 their discovery of many fossil remains of extinct quadrupeds at the
 southern foot of the Himalaya mountains.       At our last Anniversary
 I  took occasion to   acknowledge  a magnificent  present, consisting of
 duplicates of these fossils, which the Society had received from
 Captain Cautley, and since that time other donations of great value
 have been transmitted by him to our museum. These Indian fossil
 bones belong to extinct species of herbivorous and carnivorous
 mammalia, and to reptiles of the genera crocodile, gavial, emys, and
 trionyx, and to several species of fish, with which shells of fresh
 water genera are associated, the whole being entombed in a for
 mation of sandstone, conglomerate, marl, and clay, in inclined stra
 tification, composing a range of hills called the Siwalik, between
 the rivers Sutledge and Ganges. These hills rise to the height of

                                   Mr. Lyell's          Address.                                  403
from 500 to 1000 feet above the adjacent plains, some of the loftiest
peaks being 3000 feet above the level of the sea.
   When Captain Cautley and Dr. Falconer first discovered these
remarkable remains their curiosity was awakened, and they felt
convinced of their great scientific value; but they were not versed in
fossil osteology, and being stationed on the remote confines of our
Indian possessions, they were far distant from any living authorities
or books on comparative anatomy to which they could refer. The
manner in which they overcame these disadvantages, and the en
thusiasm with which they continued for years to prosecute their
 researches when thus isolated from the scientific world is truly ad
 mirable.      Dr. Royle has permitted me to read a part of their cor
 respondence with him when they were exploring the Siwalik moun
 tains, and I can bear witness to their extraordinary energy and per
 severance. From time to time they earnestly requested that Cuvier's
 works on osteology might be sent out to them, and expressed their
 disappointment when, from various accidents, these volumes failed
 to arrive.     The delay perhaps was fortunate, for being thrown en
 tirely upon their own resources, they soon found a museum of com
parative anatomy in the surrounding plains, hills, and jungles, where
 they slew the wild tigers, buffalos, antelopes, and other Indian qua
drupeds, of which they preserved the skeletons, besides obtaining
 specimens of           all
                       the genera        of
                                      reptiles which inhabited that region.
 They were compelled            see and think for themselves while com
                                   to
 paring and discriminating the different recent and fossil bones, and
 reasoning        on
                  the laws         of
                                comparative osteology, till       length they   at
 were fully prepared            appreciate the lessons which they were
             by                of to
 taught       the works       Cuvier.          In

vorous genera, besides several canine and feline carnivora. On some
of   these Dr. Falconer and Captain Cautley have each written sepa
rate and independent memoirs. Captain Cautley, for example,               the                is

long period, sufficient at least to allow of the extinction of many
large species of quadrupeds.    The family of the armadillos is now
exclusively confined to South America and here we have from the
same country the Megatherium, and two other gigantic represen
tatives of the same family.    So in the Camelidae, South America is
the sole province where the genus Auchenia or Llama occurs in a
living state, and now a much larger extinct species of Llama is dis
covered.     Lastly, among the rodents, the largest in stature now
living is the Capybara, which frequents the rivers and swamps of
South America and is of the size of a hog. Mr. Darwin now
brings home from the same continent the bones of a fossil rodent
 not inferior in dimensions to the rhinoceros.
    These facts elucidate a general law previously deduced from the
relations ascertained to exist between the recent and extinct qua
drupeds of Australia; for you are aware that to the westward of
Sydney on the Macquarie River, the bones of a large fossil kan
garoo and other lost marsupial species have been met with in the
ossiferous breccias of caves and fissures.
    A cavern has lately been examined at Yealm Bridge, six miles
south-east from Plymouth, by one of our members, Lieut. Col.
Mudge, R.E., from whose account it appears that the bones of hy
aenas are very numerous there.           They are associated with those of
the   elephant,   rhinoceros,   horse, and other animals usually found in
caves. The number of fossil       Carnivora,    such as the hyaena, wolf, fox,
and bear, which have now been met with in districts of cavernous
limestone in Great Britain, is so great that we are the more struck
with the rarity and general absence of such remains in surrounding
and intervening districts, over which the same beasts of prey must
have ranged. The Pachydermata, as the elephant, rhinoceros, and
hippopotamus, are often discovered in ancient alluvial or fluviatile
deposits; but had there been no caves and fissures we should
scarcely have obtained any information respecting the existence of
lions, tigers, hyaenas, and other beasts of prey which inhabited the
country at the same period.
    The remains of at least two distinct Saurian animals have been
 discovered by Dr. Riley and Mr. Samuel Stutchbury, in the dolo
 mitic conglomerate of Durdham Down near Bristol. They are
allied to the Iguana and Monitor, but the teeth, vertebrae, and other
bones exhibit characters by which they are seen to be generically
distinct from     all existing reptiles.    They are particularly deserving
of  your attention      asoccurring     in

 bones. They are supplementary to the atlas, axis, and third ver
 tebra of the neck, and seem to have escaped the - observation of
 Cuvier and other osteologists.
     Mr. Lewis Hunton has communicated to the Society an elaborate
 account of a section of the upper lias and marlstone in Yorkshire,
 showing that different beds in those formations are characterized
 by particular species of Ammonites and other Testacea, each species
 having a limited vertical range.         His observations are valuable not
 only as illustrating the distribution of fossils on the coast near
 Whitby, but also as furnishing a point of comparison between that
 district and many others in Great Britain. Mr. W. C. Williamson
 of Manchester has had the same object in view in studying the fos
 sils of the oolitic formations of the coast of Yorkshire, and informs
 us, as the result of his patient investigation, that although certain as
 semblages of fossils abound in particular subdivisions of the oolite,
 many species range from the lowermost to nearly the highest beds.
 This inference is confirmed when we compare the lists drawn u
 by Mr. Williamson, and those published by Professor Phillips and
 other competent authorities.          Thus some of the shells of the                               in
 ferior oolite, mentioned in Mr. Williamson's list (Trigonia gibbosa,
for example), occur also in the Portland-stone of Wiltshire; another,
as Ostrea Marshii, is characteristic of the cornbrash in the same
county; others pass downwards to the lias, as Orbicula réflera and
Ammonites striatulus.                    If
                                 you consult the tables of organic remains
 which Dr. Fitton has annexed to his excellent monograph on the
strata below the chalk, just published in our Transactions, (2nd Se
ries, vol.   iv. part 2.) you will see that        considerable number
                                                              a                                     of
shells pass from the upper oolitic groups into the green-sand. We
are not     toconclude from these facts that certain sets          fossils may         of
not serve        good chronological tests
                 as                                          of

chemist.       The first step towards their solution will probably be
made     by  carefully  examining vegetables in different stages of petri
faction; and with this view Mr. Stokes has procured several speci
mens of wood, partly mineralized and partly not.                 Among these is
a    piece  found in an ancient Roman             aqueduct    in Westphalia, in
which some         portions    are converted into        spindle-shaped      bodies
consisting of carbonate of lime: while the rest of the wood
remains in a comparatively unchanged state.                   The same author
has pointed out cases both of siliceous and calcareous fossils
where the lapidifying process must have commenced at a num
ber of separate points, so as to produce spherical or fusiform pe
trifactions, independent of each other, in which the woody struc
ture is apparent, while in the intervening spaces the wood has de
cayed, having after removal been replaced by mineral matter.                     In
 some petrifactions the most perishable, in others the most durable
 portions of plants are preserved, variations which doubtless depend
 on the time when the mineral matter was supplied.                             If
                                                                       introduced
 immediately on the first commencement of decomposition, then the
 most destructible parts are lapidified, while the more durable do
 not waste away till afterwards, when the supply has failed, and so
 never become petrified. The converse of these circumstances gives
 rise to exactly opposite results.             As to the manner in which the
 minutest     pores  and fibres discoverable by the microscope, even the
 spiral vessels themselves can be turned into stone, or have their
 forms faithfully represented by inorganic matter, no satisfactory
 explanation has ever yet been offered. In considering, however, this
 question, you will do well to consult the important suggestion which
 a celebrated chemist, our late lamented Secretary, Dr. Turner, has
  thrown out on the application of chemistry to geology.               He reminds
 us that whenever the        decomposition       of an organic   body   has begun,
  the elements into which it is resolved are set free in a state peculiarly
  adapting them to enter into new chemical combinations.                 They are
  in what is    technically  termed a nascent       state, the constituent mole
  cules being probably of extreme smallness and in a fluid or gaseous
  form, ready to obey the slightest impulse of chemical affinity, so
  that if the water percolating a stratum be charged with mineral in
  gredients, and come in contact with elements thus newly set free, a
  mutual action takes place, and new combinations result, in the course
  of which solid particles are precipitated so as to occupy the place
  left vacant by the decomposed organic matter. In a word,                       the     all
  phaenomena attendant            on

   ever we attempt      to reason           on

   stone; and     in regard        silicification, Dr. Turner has shown how

   In my last address, I alluded to Mr. Lonsdale's detection of vast
numbers of microscopic corallines and minute shells in the substance
of the white chalk of various counties in England, where this rock
had not been suspected of consisting of recognisable organic bodies.
I cannot deny myself the pleasure of mentioning the still more sin
gular and unexpected facts brought to light during the last year, by
Professor Ehrenberg of Berlin, respecting the origin of tripoli.       I
need scarcely remind you, that tripoli is a rock of homogeneous
appearance, very fragile and usually fissile, almost entirely formed
of flint, and which was called polir-schiefer, or polishing slate, by
Werner, being used in the arts for polishing stones or metals.
There have been many speculations in regard to           origin, but                     its                           it

   Gentlemen,-Although I have already extended this Address be
yond the usual limits, I cannot conclude without congratulating you
on the appearance of Dr. Buckland's Bridgewater Treatise, a work
in the execution of which the author has most skilfully combined
several distinct objects.     He has briefly explained the manner in
which the materials of the earth's crust are arranged, and the evi
dence which that arrangement affords of contrivance, wisdom, and
foresight. He has also given us a general view of the principal facts
brought to light by the study of organic remains; thus contributing
towards the filling up one of the greatest blanks which existed in
the literature of our science, while at the same time he has pointed
out the bearing of these phaenomena on natural theology.
    He has shown that geology affords one kind of testimony perfectly
distinct from natural history of the adaptation of particular means
and forces to the accomplishment of certain ends for which the habit
able globe has been framed.       These proofs are illustrated in the
author's chapters on the origin and mechanism of springs, on the
distribution of metallic and other minerals in the earth, and the
position of coal in stratified rocks.   In reference to these points it
is demonstrated that some even of the most irregular forces have
produced highly beneficial results, in modifying the subterranean
economy of the globe.       But I shall not dwell on this part of the
Treatise, but pass on at once to that which constitutes the body of
 the work, and which relates to palaeontology.
    In considering this department, the number and variety of objects
 which offer themselves to the naturalist are so great, that the choice
 was truly embarrassing.      Dr. Buckland has judiciously selected a
 few of the most  striking  examples from each of the great classes of
 organic remains, and when speaking of extinct animals, has ex
 plained the method by which the anatomist and physiologist have
been able to restore the organization of the entire individual, by
reasoning from the evidence afforded by a few bones or other relics
preserved in a fossil state.     He has described the parts of the
living animal or plant most nearly analogous to those which are
found buried in the earth, usually illustrating by figures the        di
stinctness and at the same time the resemblance of the recent and
extinct species, showing that     all
                                   are parts   one great scheme, and
                                                  of
that the lost species even supply links which are wanting        in  the
existing chain of  animal and vegetable creation.
  It     impossible    read the account given
                      to                            the Megatherium,

without being struck with the increased interest and instruction, and
the vast accession    of
                       power derived from viewing the whole mecha
mism of the skeleton       constant relation

                                                         -
which the different  organs  were contrived.
    The chapter  on saurian and other reptiles has afforded the Pro
fessor another beautiful field for exemplifying the infinite variety  of

                         Mr. Lyell's Address.                                    4.1.1
mechanical contrivances and combinations of form and structure
which the fossil representatives of that class exhibit.
    The account also of the Cephalopodous Mollusca, so many thou
sands of which are scattered through the strata, and which until
very recently have presented so obscure a problem to the naturalist,
is full of original observation.      The history of the animals which
formed the Belemnites, of which it appears that nearly one hun
dred species are now known, and the proofs adduced that they
were provided with ink-bags like the cuttle-fish, the description
also of the fossil pen-and-ink fish, or Loligo, and other sections of
this part of the Treatise, carry our information respecting the family
of naked Cephalopods much further than was ever attempted in any
previous work.        Nor should I omit to mention the exposition of an
ingenious theory for the use of the siphuncle and air-chambers of
the Ammonite, which, whether confirmed by future examination or
not, becomes in the author's hands the means of conveying to the
reader a clear and well-defined notion of the varied forms and
complicated structure of these shells, and of awakening a lively de
sire to understand their singular organization.
    I may also recall to your notice the just and striking manner in
which certain physical inferences are drawn from the conformation
of the eyes of extinct Crustacea, such as the Trilobite. The most
delicate parts of these organs are sometimes found petrified in
rocks of high antiquity, and it is justly observed, that such opti
cal instruments give information regarding the condition of the
ancient sea and ancient atmosphere, and the relations of both these
media to light.      The fluid in which these marine animals lived at
remote periods must have been pure and transparent to allow the
passage of light to organs of vision resembling those of living Cru
staceans; and this train of reasoning naturally leads us still further,
and to more important consequences, when we reflect on the general
adoption of the undulatory theory of light, and the connexion be
tween light, heat, electricity, and magnetism.
    I have heard it objected, that the zoologist and botanist had
already advanced such abundant proofs of design in the construc
 tion of living animals, and plants, that the auxiliary evidence of
 palaeontology was useless, and that to appeal to fossils in support of
 the same views was to add weaker to stronger arguments.                   In
 the living animal, it is said, we can study                   its
                                                       entire organization,

                                                in      applies each organ,
                                                                  it
 and  so  verify with certainty the ends for which any particular mem
 ber was formed and fashioned.          But    the case

 have first   to infer the greater part        of
                                             the organization from such
 parts  as alone remain, and then further          infer from analogy the

  supplied by palaeontology are less complete; but they are never
  theless abundantly sufficient to establish a very close analogy be
  tween extinct and recent species, so as to leave no doubt on the
  mind that the same harmony of parts and beauty of contrivance
 which we admire in the living creature has equally characterized
 the organic world at remote periods.                            If
                                                    this be granted, it is
  enough; the geologist can then bring new and original arguments
  from fossil remains to bear on that part of natural theology which
 seeks to extend and exalt our conceptions of the intelligence,
 power, wisdom, and unity of design manifested in the creation.
     It can now be shown that the configuration of the earth's surface
 has been remodelled again and again; mountain chains have been
 raised or sunk, valleys have been formed, again filled up, and
 then re-excavated, sea and land have changed places, yet through
 out   allthese revolutions, and the consequent alterations       local and           of
 general climate, animal and vegetable life has been sustained. This
appears      tohave been accomplished without violation         those laws       of
 now   governing   the organic creation,               by
                                              which limits are assigned                            to
 the variability        of
                     species. There are                 no
                                               grounds for assuming that
species had greater powers                of
                                     accommodating themselves           new                 to
circumstances         ancient periods than now. The succession
                        in                                                                         of

                                    the introduction into the earth from
time   to  time        of
                   new plants and animals.      That each assemblage                               of
new species was admirably adapted for successive states                  the                of

                  confidently inferred from the fact       the myriads      of                     of
fossil remains preserved          in
                                strata            of
                                              ages.    all

it  arose, they would not have increased and multiplied and endured
for indefinite periods       of

demonstrated the truth            of
                            conclusions scarcely less wonderful, the
existence     on
              our own planet              of

                   it                            multiplied is  the reflec       by

timony formed into a cylindrical bundle # of an inch in dia
meter and 13 inch in length; the poles of this pile were con
nected by means of two thick wires with a spiral of copper
ribbon 50 feet in length and 1% inch broad, the coils being
well insulated by brown paper and silk.              One face of the pile
was heated by means of a red-hot iron brought within a short
distance of           it,
                   and the other face was kept cool                 contact                    by
with ice.     Two stout wires formed the communication be
                              º
tween the poles               of
                         the pile and the spiral, and the contact
was broken, when required,                   mercury cup between one

                 the           and   one  of  these wires.      Whenever
contact was thus broken           small but distinct
                                            a            spark   was seen,
which was visible even          daylight. Professors Daniell, Henry,

   At another trial the spark was obtained from the same
spiral connected with          small pile
                                      a              elements,    of      50

occasion Dr.      Faraday    and Prof. Johnston were present, and
verified the fact.      On connecting two such piles together                                                    so

                                 each were connected with the same
wires, the same was seen still brighter*.

so considerable.   Prof. Botto's experiments were published in
the  Bibliothèque Universelle for September 1832, and I am not
aware that they have yet been published in any English Jour
nal.   The thermo-electric apparatus was a metallic wire, or
chain, consisting of 120 pieces of platinum wire, each one inch
in length and <U+017F>ºuth of an inch in diameter, alternating with
the same number of pieces of soft iron wire of the same                                                      di
mensions.    This wire was coiled as a helix round a wooden
rule 18 inches long, in such a manner that the joints were
placed alternately at each side of the rule, being removed from
the wood at one side to the distance of four lines. Employing
a spirit-lamp of the same length as the helix, and one of
Nobili's galvanometers, a very energetic current was shown to
exist; acidulated water was decomposed, and the decom
position was much more abundant when copper instead of
platinum poles were used : in this case hydrogen only was                                                    li
berated. The current and decomposition were augmented when
the joints were heated more highly.      Better effects were ob
tained with a pile of bismuth and antimony, consisting of 140
elements bound together into a parallelopiped, having for                                                    its

          PREPARATION OF BORON.                   BY DR. R. D. THOMSON.
  “In the process for obtaining boron by the action of potassium
on boracic acid, a considerable loss has been generally experienced
in consequence of an explosion which usually accompanies the
combination. A more oeconomical method has therefore been pro
posed, viz. to decompose an alkaline fluoborate by potassium.        It
appears to me that there can be only two causes which can produce
the explosion in the first mode of preparation—either    the presence
of water in the boracic acid (as suggested by Dr. Thomson of Glas
gow), or the existence of this fluid either in the potassium itself, or
in connexion with the same metal.              I believe [says Dr. R. D. T.]
the latter circumstance to be the cause of the failure of the
experiment in most cases.             I have succeeded [he continues] in
forming pure boron readily by the following plan;–A portion
of Tuscan boracic acid was fused in a red heat in a plati
num crucible till it became perfectly white; it was then taken out
of the crucible and reduced to a granular powder; two parts of
potassium were then introduced into a common test-tube. Care
should be taken to remove the white crust which usually covers
potassium, as it occurs in the country; this coating is hydrate of

    German naphtha is employed to preserve the potassium there
is little or no hydrate of potash formed. The quantity of water in
English naphtha is sometimes so considerable, that have actually            I

    MM. Dumas and Peligot have made the following statements as
 the results of their experiments on common camphor: Neutral and
 oxygenated organic bodies, when their vapour contains half a volume
of oxygen, approximate alcohol in general in the nature of their re
actions.     This is at any rate what happens with the spirit of wood,
  oil  potatoes, ethal, and pyroacetic spirit. This generalization
        of
 struck       long since, and we have subjected common camphor,

allow      of is
            procuring from them decisive products, admitting that
camphor would act like alcohol. We shall limit ourselves          stating                               to

acid, furnishes liquid volatile oily carburetted hydrogen composed
                             a

    In order    justify the conclusion which M. Lassaigne draws from

this fact he adds:

bichloride remains combined with the coagulated albumen.
    c.That even the most finely divided protochloride           mercury                          M.
does not combine with albumen dissolved           water.       Lassaigne         in                of
has made numerous other observations on the mutual action of
                he of
albumen,      bichloride     mercury, and      of
                                               chloride    sodium. For     of               of
example,      has found:
   (a.) That solution    a    two atoms        of
                                             bichloride     mercury and of                  of

mercury, is in the state of albumen which M. Chevreul has called
soluble, to distinguish from coagulated albumen (l'albumine cuite),
which is insoluble in water ;
   (c.) That a solution of precipitated albumen and bichloride of
mercury in a solution of chloride of sodium, is coagulated by heat,
like pure albumen, except that the coagulum retains some bichlo
ride, and that this solution evaporated in vacuo, separates from the
chloride of sodium in the state of albumen, combined with bichlo
ride of mercury insoluble in water.
   Admitting as exact the atomic constitution which Thomson has
calculated from the analyses of Thenard and Gay-Lussac, M. Las
saigne considers that the precipitate consists of one atom of bichlo
ride of mercury and ten atoms of albumen, which gives for 100
parts 6:67 of bichloride and 93:33 of albumen.
   M. Lassaigne concludes his memoir with an examination of the
action of bichloride of mercury upon the fibrin extracted from
blood.    He shows that a solution of bichloride of mercury in which
fibrin has been placed for several days does not contain any free
hydrochloric acid, as has been stated ; for mercury agitated with
the liquor separated from the fibrin, precipitates       the bichloride                  all
                      of
                 protochloride,         leaving  any hydrochloric  acid
of in in
   the state                    without
    the water.    M. Lassaigne has likewise determined the absence
   chlorine    the same liquor separated from fibrin.
                      in                                  He concludes
from this double experiment that fibrin, like albumen, combines
with bichloride               of
                      mercury without converting       into protochlo                    it

          DEAR SIR,
I       ONCE  more take the liberty to address to you by writing
     a short account of the results of my latest researches on
the peculiar condition of iron.        In my opinion, these results,
though they do not yet solve the riddle of the subject, are such
as to excite scientific curiosity, at least as much as the facts
did, a description of which                   I
                                   had the honour to communicate
to  you  last year.  The  space  allotted to a letter being so small,
I  am  obliged  to be as concise as possible in describing the
phaenomena recently observed by me; but if you should be
interested with the details of the subject, I take the liberty of
referring you to a paper of mine which will hereafter be
published in Poggendorff’s Annalen. In the first place I must
tell you, that the most powerful voltaic association into which
iron can be brought in order to excite                           its
                                                  peculiar condition,

into an aqueous solution of the common sulphate of copper,
in the same way as the two ends of the oxidized wire, &c. are
plunged into common nitric acid.       Under these circumstances
not the smallest  particle of copper  will be precipitated on any
part of the wire immersed in the said solution. This peculiar
state of the wire, however, lasts only so long as both ends of
it are in the solution; for no sooner is the protected one
removed from the liquid, than the other left immersed turns
active, that is to say, throws down copper.      In this respect,
therefore, there is a great difference between the action of the
wire in question upon the solution of blue vitriol, and that of
the oxidized one upon common nitric acid. This difference of
action implies another, namely, the impossibility of transferring,
within the copper solution, the peculiar state from wire to wire,
which it is so easy to do in nitric acid.    I must not omit here
to state the remarkable     fact, that  by  mixing    the solution
of the sulphate with a comparatively small quantity of chloride
of sodium (common salt) the calling forth of the peculiar con
dition is prevented, not only in the foregoing case, but in                                               all
that will         be
               mentioned hereafter. This fact                   means            is   by       no

this metal on nitric acid, the following conditions must be ful

that the   peculiar  condition      iron cannot of    called forth      be                  by
means        of
            voltaic associations, without exciting     the same time     at
a  current,     which the iron turned inactive bears the relation
                  to
of the anode. Now from such an invariable concurrence of
two phaenomena,      think  I               we
                                 may safely infer that one    them                     of
isthe cause     theofother;    and some facts render      probable            it
that the inactivity     iron     of
                                  the effectis                 of
                                                  current, though   a
we      do
       not  yet know        the least in  what manner the first
                                                          in                                is
occasioned          by
                the latter.        some very weighty reasons did
                                            If

                           as excited by Peroxide            of Lead.                         429
not militate against the correctness of the idea, it might be
imagined that the connexion between the two phaenomena in
question depends upon the fact, that the current issuing from
the inactive iron carries along with it or keeps at a certain                                  di
stance from the metal, those particles of the fluid which are
round the metallic substance, preventing by this means imme
diate contact, and consequently chemical action. This idea
receives some support from the fact, that an inactive iron wire
is to a solution of blue vitriol, as to capillary action, what a
solid body with a greasy surface is to water, whilst such is not
the case with active iron. But the single fact that this metal
can for any length of time remain inactive in nitric acid, under
circumstances which exclude the possibility of the existence
of a current, overthrows at once the above-mentioned hypo
thesis, not to mention many other facts, equally irreconcilable
with it.
    By the relation of iron associated with peroxide of lead to
nitric acid and to the solution of blue vitriol, as well as by the
 fact that iron in this combined state excites a very strong
 taste upon the tongue, a taste much stronger than that pro
 duced by any voltaic association known, I was led to suppose
 that a powerful battery might be constructed of pairs consist
 ing of iron and the said peroxide.          Experiments have proved
 the correctness of my supposition: an iron wire 0".5 thick,
 3" of length, one of                 its
                               ends coated with        thin film   a  per                of
 oxide, and each end put into         separate vessel filled with nitric
                                             a
 acid  a hundred times diluted, developed           current which was
                                                                a
 capable     decomposing water. For when the two vessels were
                of
 connected with       platina wire, hydrogen was evolved
                           a                                        one              at         of
 its ends, oxygen           at
                        the other.                At

LXXXIII.         On the Thermo-electric Currents developed be
    tween Metals and Fused Salts.          By THox1As ANDREws,
    M.D., Professor of Chemistry in the Royal Belfast Institu
    tion.*
      HE   interesting discovery made by Faraday of the high
       conducting power of certain fused salts for voltaic electri
city, led me to expect that electrical currents might be pro
duced by bringing them into contact with the metals, analo
gous to the thermo-electric currents observed by Seebeck.
 Having easily succeeded in verifying this conjecture, and
 having observed that the currents thus produced exhibited
some remarkable properties, I submitted them to a careful
examination, the result of which forms the subject of the pre
 sent paper.
     To detect the presence of the electrical current, a very de
 licate galvanometer, constructed for me by M. Gourjon of
 Paris, was employed, in which the copper wire made nearly
 3000 revolutions round the lower needle, and the system of
 needles was rendered as perfectly astatic as possible. A gal
 vanometer having 20 or 30 coils, with astatic needles, will be
 found, however, sufficiently sensible to give decided indications
                                                     I
of the passage of the principal currents which shall have oc
 casion to describe.
     Having taken two similar wires of platina (such as are used
 in experiments with the blowpipe), and connected them with
 the extremities of the copper wire of the galvanometer that has
just been described, I fused a small globule of borax in the
 flame of a spirit-lamp, on the free extremity of one of the
 platina wires, and introducing the free extremity of the other
 wire into the flame, I brought the latter, raised to a higher
 temperature than the former, into contact with the fused glo
 bule; the needle of the instrument was instantly driven with
 great violence to the limit of the scale.      The direction of the
 current, as indicated by the deflection of the needle, was from
 the hotter platina wire through the fused salt to the colder
 wire. A permanent electrical current in the same direction
 was obtained, by simply fusing the globule between the two
 wires, and applying the flame of the lamp in such a manner
 that, at the points of contact with the fused salt, the wires
 were at different temperatures.
     To discover whether the current had sufficient intensity to
 pass through acidulated water, a column of water (to which
 a few drops of sulphuric acid had been added), whose length
  was about half an inch, was interposed in the course of the
                      • Communicated  by the Author.

434          Prof. Andrews on the Thermo-electric Currents
circuit, the connecting poles in the water being formed of
platina wires. On fusing the globule as before, the needle of
the galvanometer was still deflected through an arc of 80° or
90°, but with less violence than when a complete metallic cir
cuit was employed.    When carbonate of soda was substituted
for borax in these experiments, similar but more powerful
currents were obtained.
   My first attempts to obtain chemical decompositions by
means of these currents were unsuccessful when the common
forms of apparatus were used; but by employing poles ex
posing unequal surfaces, this object was finally attained”. A
piece of bibulous paper, exposing on each side a surface of
one fourth of a square inch, was moistened with a solution of
   * The influence of the surface of the poles, in rendering perceptible the
separation of the elements of an electrolyte, is very remarkable.               Faraday
has observed that not a bubble of gas will appear on the surface of a pair
of platina plates, immersed in dilute sulphuric acid, when made the poles
of a voltaic combination, formed by a single pair of platina and zinc plates
charged with the same dilute acid; and hence that distinguished philosopher
has inferred, that the tension of such a current is too low to effect the de
composition of water.          On repeating and varying the conditions of this
experiment, I found that if two fine wires were substituted for the platina
plates the same negative result was obtained; but that if a platina plate
exposing an extensive surface to the liquid was used as one pole, and a fine
wire of the same metal as the other, then a minute stream of bubbles of
gas arose from the wire, which after continuing for some time finally ceased
to appear. An additional quantity of gas was, however, easily procured,
either by increasing the surface of the broad pole, or by removing it and
heating it to redness, or by reversing the direction of the current.                 The
following appears to be a satisfactory explanation of these results. When
the poles exposed on both sides equal surfaces, the gases were dissolved
in the nascent state by the surrounding liquid; but when the polar sur
faces were unequal, the solution of the gas being greatly facilitated by the
broader pole, the element of the water separated there was dissolved,
while the other element was disengaged, in the gaseous state, at the wire
which served as the opposite pole.              Indeed, Becquerel had already cor
rectly inferred, from the circumstance of the plates acquiring polarity, that
the water in this experiment of Faraday must have been decomposed.                     It
is from the obstacle presented to the passage of the current by the acquired
polarity of the platina plate, that the gas soon ceases to be formed in
greater abundance than it can be dissolved by the water; and                        reap    its
pearance under the circumstances stated before,                         an

the iodide of potassium, and laid on a platina plate, which
was in metallic connection with one of the platina wires used
in the previous experiments. The extremity of the other pla
tina wire in contact with the globule, was applied to the sur
face of the bibulous paper, and the flame of the lamp was so
directed, that the latter was the colder of the wires between
which the globule of borax or carbonate of soda was fused.
The platina plate in this arrangement therefore constituted
the negative pole, and the extremity of the wire applied to
the bibulous paper, the positive pole. Accordingly, when the
circuit was completed, an abundant deposition of iodine oc
curred beneath the platina wire.            When a similar wire of
platina was substituted for the plate on the negative side, the
effect was either none or scarcely perceptible.
    A compound arrangement was next formed by placing a
series of platina wires on supports, in the same horizontal line,
and fusing between their adjacent extremities small globules
of borax. The globules and wires were exactly similar to
those that are used in blowpipe experiments.              A spirit-lamp
was applied to each globule, so as to heat unequally the
wires in contact with       it;

436      Prof. Andrews on the Thermo-electric Currents
   The extremities of the platina wires which were introduced
into the globules of borax, after having been employed in
these experiments, did not exhibit any appearance of chemical
               iº
action; their lustre was untarnished, and their edges presented
a sharp and well-defined outline, without being in the least
degree rounded away. To render still more certain the abs
ence of any              action, a very fine wire of platina was
used as the hottest   wire, in contact with the fused borax, and
the circuit being completed by a metallic wire, a continuous
current was maintained for several hours; but there was no
apparent change either in the wires or the borax. With carbo
nate of soda instead of borax, the result was the same. When
it is remembered that this current, if transmitted through a
solution of the iodide of potassium, (in which case the greater
part of the current is even interrupted,) would have produced
in a few seconds a very perceptible deposition of iodine, it is
impossible to imagine that the same current could continue,
for a long space of time, to be produced from chemical action
in one of the platina wires without any sensible alteration of
the metallic surface.    Besides, it is well known that under or
dinary circumstances there is no chemical action exercised by
platina upon fused borax or carbonate of soda.
   It is certainly very interesting to see powerful chemical af
finities thus overcome by simply bringing two metallic wires,
at different temperatures, into contact with a fused salt, be
tween which and the wires no [chemical] action takes place.
The direction of the current is not influenced by the quantity
of surface in contact with the wires, but depends altogether on
the difference of temperature, as was ascertained by careful
experiments.
    Similar results were obtained when other fused salts were
substituted for borax, such as carbonate of potash, chlo
ride and iodide of potassium, sulphate of soda, chloride of
strontium, &c. Even with boracic acid, which Faraday has
observed to be a very imperfect conductor of voltaic electri
city, I succeeded in deflecting the needle of the galvanometer
through an arc of 40°, the circuit being closed by metallic
wires. The direction of the current was the same as with
 borax.
    To compare the intensity of these currents with those pro
duced by chemical action, the galvanometer and a hydro
electric couple were both interposed in the course of the cir
cuit, and the connections were so adjusted, that the currents
developed by the fused salt and in the voltaic cell should be:
in opposition to each other. In this case the deflection of the
needle would indicate the current of superior intensity.      On
comparing these currents with various hydro-electric com

             developed between Metals and fused Salts.                                       437
binations, they appeared, when fully developed, to have a
somewhat superior tension to the currents produced by a
couple of platina and silver plates immersed in dilute sul
phuric or nitric acid. If the nitric acid was so strong as to
dissolve rapidly the silver, then the voltaic current became su
perior.
   The effect of substituting other metals for one or both of
the platina wires still remained to be examined; but here con
siderable difficulties often arose, from the fusibility and ten
dency to oxidation of many of the metals.
    When the platina wires were replaced by wires of palladium,
currents in every respect similar were obtained.
    When platina was opposed to palladium, gold or silver,
fused soda or borax being interposed, the current was always
from the platina through the fused salt to the other metal,
provided the platina was at a higher temperature. When the
palladium was hotter than the platina, the current was re
versed, or from the palladium to the platina.             It was difficult
to  expose  the   gold  or silver wire to a    higher  temperature   than
the platina without fusing           when   it,globule     soda

                                         soda and potash, the current
was readily obtained from the silver              gold    the platina,
                                                                or                               so

the direction     of  the current, which          altogether determined

     Hitherto          I  only described the currents produced
                           have
when the interposed salt is in a state of perfect fusion, but
before the salt becomes actually fused, electrical currents are
developed, whose direction no longer follows the simple law,
that has been before enunciated, but varies in the most sin
gular and perplexing manner. After a long and tedious                                       in
vestigation, I have been completely baffled in my attempts to
discover the essential conditions upon which the directions of
these currents depend, and I shall therefore describe at pre
sent only one or two experiments which will show the com
plicated nature of the inquiry, and may, perhaps, draw the
attention of others to this curious part of electrical science.
In the investigation of these currents a very sensible galvano
meter must be employed.
   A small platina spoon was partly filled with fused carbo
nate of soda, and the end of a thick wire of the same metal
was introduced into the fused salt, metallic contact being care
fully avoided. When the salt had cooled, the wire and spoon
were connected with the galvanometer.             On applying a very
gentle heat to the bottom of the spoon, by means of a small
spirit-flame placed at a considerable distance, a current was
obtained from the spoon to the wire, or from the hot metal
to the cold; this current was very feeble and could rarely be
maintained beyond a few minutes. By increasing the tem
perature of the lower part of the spoon             the salt        till
                                                                contact           in
with   it entered into  fusion,  while the   portion  surrounding    the
cold wire was still         solid state,
                                 in         powerful current was ob
tained from the wire         the cup, to a              or a
                                           from the cold metal       the               to
hot. When the       temperature       the  cup     of
                                               was still further raised
so   as   to
           fuse the whole                    of
                                the salt, the current was         course          of
again reversed, being from the hot metal             the cold.       to
                                                                     was               It
interesting           to
                   observe the violent manner          which from this in
cause the needle                of
                        the instrument started from one extremity
of    its
        scale     the opposite,
                      to                           on

flame.
   To the class        partially fused salts belongs heated glass,

                                #.
which accordingly presented similar changes
of the current.             when                   a

a  very thin coating      glass, and another wire
                                 of                         higher tem      at

perature brought into contact with the glass, the current was
from the cold metal through the glass           the hot.       tothicker         If
                                                                                  a
piece       of
           glass was interposed, the first current was from the
hot wire       the cold, but
                 to                           on

                           in                      M. Becquerel had
already observed         means  by    sensible gold-leaf electroscope
                                                  of

 440           Mr. Westwood's Descriptions of some                 new
by means of heated glass, they exhibit signs of free electricity,
one of them being connected with the ground and the other
with the electroscope; but the general conclusion which he
attempts to deduce from the result of this single experiment
is certainly inaccurate, as it is founded on the assumption that
the colder wire will give always signs of positive electricity,
which we have seen is only true when the glass is thick and
at a certain temperature. The conditions however here stated
are not the only circumstances which influence the direction
of the electrical currents with heated glass, but as my expe
riments do not lead to any definite result, I refrain from de
scribing them.
    These currents may likewise be obtained by interposing
certain minerals between unequally heated wires; thus mica
placed between platina wires and heated very strongly caused
a deflection in the galvanometer needle of 7°, and the mineral
called stilbite of 25°; the current in both cases was from the
hot platina to the cold.

of the hardest crown glass; also the difficulty of obtaining it
of any size, and free from cloudiness or opacity.” These ob
jections,       I
              understand, apply equally to that which is made at
 the  present  time”; to which it may be added that the modern
 ruby glass is inferior to the ancient in this respect also, that
 while the latter, on being exposed to the heat of a glass kiln,
 preserves           its
                   colour unimpaired, that          the former suffers          of
 considerable    injury                  by
                            such exposure,       some cases becoming       in

 estimated when             considered
                                it   is    that,     consequence,    the        in
 modern ruby cannot                       be
                              painted upon,       the heat required            as                                  to
 fix the fresh colour would destroy the beauty                  original                      of   its
appearance. To meet this difficulty the modern artist has
recourse         the following ingenious expedient.
                 to                                          He paints
 upon  a   piece           of
                      plain glass the tints and shadows necessary
 for blending the rich ruby glow with the other parts                his                                  of
picture, leaving those parts untouched where                 wishes the                       he
 ruby      appear       undiminished brilliancy, and fixes the ruby
        in to
                               in
 glass     the picture behind the painted piece. Thus              such                                  in
 parts the window         “double-glazed.”

444   .                     Mr. A. Essex's              Account of the
fectly transparent glass.     When a small quantity of oxide
 either of gold, silver, cobalt, copper, or some few others
of the metals is added to this base it produces a coloured
transparent enamel.     This enamel is used on silver and gold,
and is applied to the ornamenting of snuff-boxes, watch-cases,
 and various articles of jewellery. Previously to the applica
tion of the enamel, various patterns and devices are bright
cut in the metal with the graver or the rose-engine, and the
cuts, reflecting the rays of light from their bright and nu
merous surfaces, exhibit through the richly coloured enamels
a beautiful and gorgeous play of colours sparkling in varied
forms with every change of aspect. Sometimes this enamelled
bijouterie is further adorned with paintings in enamel, execu
ted on rich transparent grounds, when, in some instances, a
sunlike splendour is imparted to the whole scene by the rays
of the engine-turned gold shooting from behind the moun
tains in a landscape, or diverging from the bosom of a lake.
The enamel which, when painted upon, produces the most
agreeable effect in these applications, is that which is opal
escent, and which by enamellers is called opal; the soft cream
coloured and fiery appearance of the gem being imparted in
this imitation by the oxide of arsenic.

property of easy fusion is obtained by the introduction of a
larger proportion of oxide of lead or of alkali, or of both, into
the composition of the colours; which superabundance renders
the flux of the colours an imperfect glass, and consequently
lays it open to decomposition, from the attacks of those gases,
which, being continually evolved from putrescent and other
substances, are ever floating in the atmosphere.
    The difficulty of working the colours with delicacy, and the
extreme care required in effecting this, render the process of
painting in enamel slow, and hence it has seldom been applied
with success to painting from life, but has usually been em
ployed in copying".           Indeed      permanency obviously points

the discoveries of modern chemistry have afforded the ma
terials to supply this long-sought desideratum.               From three
of the metals which till        lately were known but to chemists,
and which were     regarded    as curiosities only, namely, platinum,
uranium, and chromium, are already produced four of the
richest and most useful of the colours on the palette of the
painter in enamel. And doubtless we may look to this source
for the means for further improvement. Before the introduc
tion of oxide of platinum a positive rich brown was unknown in
enamel”: this colour when produced by the mixture of others,
as was previously the practice, was liable to alteration by re
peated fires, becoming more opake and meagre, and acquiring
somewhat the appearance of common brown clay.                        With
            . i.
such a material how was it possible for an artist to obtain that
deep, rich, and juicy transparency which is so highly and justly
valued by every             of painting, and which distinguishes the
works       the  great   masters both ancient and modern ? The
oxide of platinum on the contrary yields a beautiful, indestruc
tible, and richly transparent enamel brown, which no intensity
or frequent application of the furnace can injure.
    Mr. Cooper observes+ that with the black oxide of platinum
“we can now produce an enamel colour which preserves an
intense black in the lighter shades, and              moreover, capable    is,
    sustaining the most violent fire, without injury, which none
of of
    the former colours [blacks] will bear, without change.” On
this    must remark that

this in view throughout the experiments which I have made
for the purpose of obtaining a set of enamel colours which
should combine with the required richness of tone and bril
liancy of tint, the property of remaining unchanged during the
numerous exposures to the heat of the furnace to which a
painting in enamel is necessarily subjected. Of the necessity
for simplification, and also of the extent to which it is capable
of being carried, take the following example.
   In vol. xxxv. of the Transactions of the Society for the En
couragement of Arts, &c. p. 49, it is stated, that “Twenty
guineas were this session (1817) voted to Mr. R. Wynn for
receipts for enamel colours and for staining and gilding on
glass.” One of these receipts, for green, is given thus, at p. 60:
      “Afrit for transparent greens.

450                      Mr. A. Essex's Account of the
different instances, and oxide of lead in six, and except one
instance of introduction of the former substance, and two of
the latter, the artist must of necessity be ignorant of the pro
portions in which they exist in the artificial compounds which
he employs.     Foreign substances also are present, such as
iron, manganese, &c., which, although in minute quantities, are
injurious and create confusion.    These are not noticed in the
foregoing analysis, because their introduction or omission, as
likewise their proportions when introduced, are dependent
upon accident and the pleasure of the manufacturer.
    Let us now proceed to contrast this complex process with
the result which some attention to the progress of chemical
science has enabled the enameller of the present day to arrive
 at.  The following are     once the materials and substantially
                                    at

suitable for       an
                enamelling furnace.   The late Mr. Home held this opinion,
and the late Mr. Grimaldi frequently had fires made with charcoal alone
for his paintings, because,     was imagined, the colours “came out bet
                                     as

              I
with charcoal displayed any superiority over those which were fired with

    Painting in enamel having been reproached in the hearing
of Mr. Muss as a style of art in which neither texture nor
crispness was attainable, because, as was alleged, the colours

both of     oiland water, determined practically              vindicate his       to

“from 24 to 22 inches high by 16 to 18 wide.” He, however,
failed to produce the picture, after having received an ad
vance of 1700l., and having expended upwards of 800l. in
fruitless attempts to accomplish his object”. It appears, there
fore, that the largest works which have been executed in
enamel are, the Bacchus and Ariadne, after Titian, by Bone;
and the Holy Family, after Parmegiano, by Muss.
     Mr. Bone's picture measures 18 inches by 16}, and was paint
ed after the original by Titian, now in the National Gallery.
 It was purchased of the artist by the late George Bowles, Esq.,
for 2200 guineas, and was subsequently in the possession of
 the Hon. Miss Rushout.
     Mr. Muss's picture measures 20% inches by 15}+, and was
 painted after the original by Parmegiano, in the possession of
 Sir Thomas Baring, Bart. Upon the decease of the artist it
 was purchased by His late Majesty George IV., for the sum
 of 1500 guineas, and now forms part of the Royal Collection
 at Buckingham Palace.            This great work then, it would ap
 pear, is the largest painting in enamel that has hitherto been
 executed.
     It may be assumed that in general painting in enamel is
 best adapted for pictures of smaller size, yet in some cases cir
 cumstances may exist which render it desirable that a painting
 should be perpetuated in an enamel of even larger dimensions
 than those just noticed, and in the present state of the art no
 insuperable difficulty exists to the accomplishment of such an
  object.
      Whether, participating in the general fate of the produc
  tions of man, paintings in enamel will, in the lapse of ages, alter,
  fade, and resolve into their original elements, is a problem the
  solution of which must be left to future generations.             Never
  theless their power of extreme duration is established by the
  fact that some rude specimens of vitrified colours have been
  found in Egypt, which have existed between two and three
  thousand years, but which still appear as fresh as if they were
  but the productions of yesterday<U+017F>.           This power of resisting
  decay renders enamel a valuable medium for conveying down
   the stream of time the likenesses of celebrated individuals.

   It  has been supposed by some chemists that magnesia is
capable of uniting with water in several proportions, though
no analysis seems to have been made of the artificial hydrate
of that earth. The native hydrate of magnesia from America,
analysed by Dr. Bruce, yielded in 100 parts,
                     Magnesia............ 70
                     Water............ ... 30–100.
   A specimen of the same mineral from Unst, analysed by
 Dr. Fyffe, yielded in 100 parts,

                     Water...............    30°25      100.
   The results of two analyses made by myself of the artificial
hydrate agree very nearly with the proportions obtained by
 Dr. Fyffe from the native specimen. Thus in a first experi
ment 100 parts yielded,
                     Magnesia............    69.63
                     Water............... 30.37—100.
A second    experiment gave,
                     Magnesia............    69.41
                     Water...............    30°59——100.
These specimens were prepared by digesting recently cal
cined magnesia in cold distilled water and then drying the

mixture over a water-bath.     The first was digested in a well
closed vessel during  fourteen days; but no greater combining
proportion of water was observed than in the second speci
men, which was only digested for twenty-four hours.—I have
procured a similar result by merely moistening the earth, and
immediately drying it over the water-bath.     The combination
is immediate, and, as has been shown, admits of no increase in
the proportion of water by a prolonged digestion.         boiling                          If
water be used in forming the hydrate, no difference is ob
served in       its
               constitution.    may       remarked how nearly
                                               It              be
the first analysis approaches      the  proportions

  It    seems certain from these experiments, that magnesia                                             is
capable    of
           combining with water        one proportion only.

     Mr. Saxton's meaning                       2
    “Let now examine little more minutely into the real
                  us                            a
facts of the matter          connected with the construction of the

machines.       By Mr. Saxton's own showing (fig.                    the cy                      3)

of   the same size       the cylinders CD, round which the short
                                   as
wires for giving the spark are coiled.             My principle       totally                       is
different.     Different      regards     as
                                         the size     the  cylinders  (those    of

for quantity being double the diameter                        of the intensity cylin
ders); different as respects the relative thickness of the wires
(the intensity wire being ºr of an inch in diameter and 1500
yards long, the quantity wire being tº inch in diameter and
40 yards long); different also in my armatures being separate,
for were they to be in one piece, to develop the full effects of
both quantity and intensity the poles of the magnetic battery
should be separated more than three times the distance they
now are by my having the armatures unconnected. And yet
this is what Mr. Saxton would call “a slight variation in the
situation of the parts”
    “I  now come to speak of Mr. Saxton's statement respecting
the quantity and thickness of the wire he uses; for I confess
that    Ifor one, on referring to his figures 3 and 4, cannot ima
gine that he has ever constructed an instrument of the kind
he describes. It must be evident that the quantity of wire re
quired for CD, would be so disproportionate to that neces
sary for A B, as to render necessary a greater space between the
cylinders C D (containing the quantity of thick wire), and the
cylinders A B, having a smaller quantity of thin wire.
   “Again, Mr. Saxton speaks of insulation, saying that the
front end of the spindle is for that purpose, being made of
ivory or hard wood. Insulation of what?                            I
                                                  use nothing of the
kind; insulation being quite unnecessary. Will Mr. Saxton
still maintain that my machine does not differ in principle also
on this point? Next we come to his description of the ar
rangement for giving the spark. According to his description,
if the blade F leaves the surface of the mercury at the moment
when the cylinder CD is vertical, then A B being on the mag
nets, and the current in C D having been for some time neu
tralized, the proper point would be so far different from what
he states,         as,
                 instead      being vertical,
                                    of            form      angle to     an        of
nearly 45°.      ‘For obtaining the shock,” says Mr. Saxton,
‘the   points  should              be
                            removed,’ &c.      answer, Let any per

accused  of being disingenuous; but I have not proposed or                             at
tempted such a history.
   “In Paris I was told by Professor Pouillet that there was as
much difference between my machine and Newman's (meaning
Saxton's) as there was between the latter and Pixii's. The same
words nearly were used in London by Dr. D. B. Reid, Messrs.
Sturgeon, Leithead, and Bachhoffner; and in Dublin the same
remark was made by Professor Lloyd and Dr. Apjohn, the"
former of whom, although previously in possession of Mr.
 Saxton's machine, purchased one of mine, and the latter has
actually entrusted to me one of Mr. Saxton's to be altered ac
cording to my principle of construction for the Royal College
of Surgeons, Ireland. Mr. Saxton next proceeds to state
that until December 1835, he had not added the double arma
 ture, whereas I sold three of my machines with double arma
 tures in the April preceding.
    “Mr. Saxton goes on to state that his first idea of the double
armature suggested itself to him on his seeing Count di Pre
devalli's machine in November 1833.       From the same source
I  derived my idea, but certainly before Mr. Saxton, in as much
 as I had the machine in my hands before he had ever seen                                   it.

I  attended
              it
              at  the Gallery,  and can  assuredly   state that the
machine did not exhibit the effects stated         Mr. Saxton.by                        It
did not charge the Leyden jar.        The electrometer,      rather           or
the  electroscope, was   affected,  because the jar had been pre
viously charged with dry electricity, and the residual electri
city was the cause             of
                         the effect attributed      Mr. Saxton by                           to
the magnetic machine. Again,           the idea occurred
                                                 if           1833,           in

Why, according to this, a person unacquainted with the sci
ence would expect to obtain a spark from a single coil | “And
that,’ he continues, ‘the shock is best when the coil is long.’
My experiments do not bear out this assertion; my machine

depends upon the thickness of the wire for the spark, and
tenuity for the shock, within,          course, certain limits; and

460      The Rev. Prof. Callan in reply to Dr. Ritchie.
the battery described by me, though it contains but 20 pairs
of plates, is capable of producing in the space of one minute
3000 or 4000 electric currents, each equal in point of intensity
to that of a battery containing 1000 or 2000 voltaic circles.
That the helix of an electro-magnet is capable of giving a
shock at the moment when battery communication is broken,
was discovered only about two years ago (Phil. Mag. for No
vember 1834, p. 351); that the shock given by the magnetic
helix increases with the number of plates employed was not
known till discovered by me within the last year.              Surely,
then, Dr. Ritchie had not a battery six or seven years ago,
which, though containing only a small number of plates, was
capable of producing in the space of one minute 3000 or 4000
electric currents, each equal in point of intensity to that of a
battery containing 1000 or 2000 voltaic circles.
    Again, Dr. Ritchie says, “the author speaks of a shock as
if it were a quantity, and institutes a comparison between the
size of the shock and the number of plates.” That I speak
 of the shock as if it were a quantity, and that I institute a
 comparison between the size of the shock and the number of
 plates, Dr. Ritchie infers from my saying that “with one pair
 of plates the shock from the helix of the electro-magnet was
 equal to that of a battery containing 20 pairs of plates; when
 two pairs of plates were used, the shock appeared to be doubled;
 with three voltaic circles it appeared to be treble; and with
 every increase in the number of voltaic circles, there appeared
 to be a proportional increase of the shock.”         Had Dr. Ritchie
 read the remainder of the paragraph from which these words
 are taken, he could not but see that his inference is most un
just. For in the following line I speak of the shock as strong,
 and never speak of it as if it were large or had size.             The
 obvious meaning then of my words            is,
                                              that the shock increases
 with the number    of   plates, not    insize, but     strength
                                                           in                    or   in
 tensity.    My language may       be   inaccurate; but         the lan
                                                                it   is

         of of
 guage         Mr. Singer, who,     in    his treatise      galvanism,
 speaks       the shock        increasing:
                              as              it  also the language
                                                    is                                of
 Dr. Ritchie himself, who says that “the physiological effects
 (among which     he   of course includes the shock) continued                        to
 increase.” (Phil.    Mag.,  June 1836, 455.)p.
    Lastly, Dr. Ritchie says, that “the only thing new               my      in
 paper  is the affirmation that    an  electro-magnet, when        mag     its
 netism  is   induced    by a compound battery             of
                                                       200 small pairs
 of  plates, will have greater power

a   distance than any permanent magnet.”             Dr. Ritchie adds,
“   the  very  looseness    of

     Mr. MacGauley describes the results                                   stated in my paper
contained in the Phil. Mag. for June                                    1836, as “perfectly at
variance with the truth.” The following is his version of my
statement:              “It
                    is a well-known fact, that we receive a more
powerful shock when electricity is being induced on a body,
than when the induced electricity is returning to                    natural                    its
state.” The quotation        quite correct, except the substitution
                                          is
of  the indefinite article                 a,
                                for the definite article the, before
the word body.      This slight substitution makes “my talk very
egregious nonsense.”       My original statement             that the shock         is,
is most  powerful    when the    electricity      being    induced     is the                          on
(human) body, and         may further add, that this

    Dr. Faraday's investigations have completely established
the fact, that it is only magnetism (or the electricity which con
stitutes magnetism) in motion which can either induce electri

       Edward Turner Bennett, Esq., Sec. Zoological Society.—In allu
   ding to the death of Mr. Bennett I am strongly reminded of those
   painful feelings with which the intelligence was first received; for
   though his illness had excited alarm for a day or two in the minds of
   some of his friends, and especially of those who were immediately
   around him, it was generally unknown, so that the first intimation
   which most of us received of it was that it had terminated fatally.
   It was but a few days before that we had seen him in the enjoyment
  of his usual health; and notwithstanding the apparent delicacy of his
  constitution, from our having been accustomed to witness his un
  tiring devotion to his favourite pursuits, we had naturally been dis
  armed of           all
                    idea that his useful life was          soon         broughtso             to   be                        to  a
  close.
   I     had not the honour           knowing him intimately, but
                                               of                              was im                         it

  be   impressed with his intelligence, the gentleness             his manners, and          of
  the unobtrusiveness of his character.

stinguished the brighter years of his life.
    His principal work, “The Natural History of the Mollusca of Great
Britain,” in the possession of his friend Mr. Bell, is not yet pub

   “Malacostraca Podophthalma Britanniae,” 4to,                                    1815 and 1816,

   “On the Genera and    Species of Proboscideous Insects,”8vº, 1817.
   He described the animals taken by Cranch in the expedition of
Capt. Tuckey to the Congo; and was the author of valuable articles
in the Encyclopædia Britannica, Edinburgh Encyclopædia, Philoso
phical Transactions, Zoological Journal, Memoirs of the Wernerian
Society, Dictionnaire des Sciences Naturelles.
   Between 1810 and 1820 he contributed seven papers to the Trans
actions of the Linnaean Society: three on Insects; a general arrange
ment of the Crustacea, Myriapoda, and Arachnides, a very laborious
work; two descriptive of ten new genera of Bats; one on three new
species of Glareola.   He died in Italy last year of cholera.

   The regular order of our report of the proceedings of this Society
having necessarily been interrupted by the Anniversary Proceedings
of Feb. 17th, we now return to the papers which had been read pre
viously to that time, in continuation from p. 141.
   Nov.30, 1836.-A paper “On certain elevated Hills of Gravel con
taining MarineShells in the vicinity of Dublin,” by John Scouler, M.D.,
Professor of Mineralogy in the Royal Dublin Society, and communi
cated by Robert Hutton, Esq., F.G.S., was first read.
   The object of this communication is to give a brief account of phae
nomena which, although frequently described in other countries, have
been but recently observed in Ireland.        Before entering on the im
mediate   subject  of the paper,  Dr. Scouler gives a general description
of the formations    constituting the district under examination.    They
consist of   granite,   porphyry,  quartz  rock,  micaceous, talcose,  and
argillaceous schists, greywacké, which near Lyons is succeeded by a
very ferruginous conglomerate, and mountain limestone, called, near
 Dublin, calp.
   The principal points at which the author examined the shelly de
posits are, the promontory of Howth, Bray Head, and the valley of
 Glenismaule.     On the south side of the promontory of Howth, where
 the limestone or calp approaches the quartz rock, is a deep depression
occupied by an exceedingly tenacious and very ferruginous clay, which
also extends across the peninsula, filling up fissures in the limestone.
It is unstratified, and does not contain any transported fragments of
 rocks, but abounds with nodules of oxide of iron, iron pyrites, and
oxide of manganese; the last being extracted for occonomical pur
poses.     Resting upon this clay, the limestone and the quartz rock,
is a thick accumulation of shelly coarse gravel and fine sand, extend
ing about half a mile in length, but separated into two parts by the
hollow in which is situated the village of Howth. The highest portion
of the deposit is about eighty feet above the level of the sea. The
gravel consists chiefly of limestone, differing in no respect from
 the limestone of the district; pebbles of argillaceous schist are not
 uncommon; and rounded fragments of granite, the hard chalk of An

 trim, and flints occur, but rarely; and it is worthy of remark that
 though the gravel rests partly on quartz rock, fragments derived from
  it     are Scarce.
    The beds of sand are sometimes very thin, at others of considerable
 thickness, and though, for limited distances, there appears to be a
 regular stratification, yet the beds cannot be traced to any extent,
 thinning out in the same manner as on existing sea-beaches.                 The
 shells which have been found were, for the greater part, very imper
 fect, but Dr. Scouler has been enabled to determine, from well-defined
 specimens, the following species:            Turritella ungulina, Turbo lito
 reus, Nerita     litoralis,   Buccinum    undatum,   Cardium edule, Cyprina
 Islandica, and Pecten varians.
    On the opposite side of the Bay of Dublin, and to the south of the
 promontory of Bray Head, is a similar accumulation extending for
 upwards of a mile. At                       its
                                   northern extremity     presents     perpendi   it              a
 cular section about 200 feet        high, but gradually  declines towards the

 in the lowest,      clay and marl. The central beds
                        of                                    gravel are chiefly       of
composed        fragments
                  of              limestone  ofmoderate size, and imperfectly

     1st, That the coast around the Bay of Dublin has been elevated,
  though unequally, at a comparatively recent geological epoch; 2ndly,
  That the valley of Glenismaule, and other valleys containing similar
 accumulations of drift, were at one time under water, and then filled
  with calcareous gravel; and that they were afterwards elevated, and
 subsequently re-excavated by the action of running water.
     The memoir concluded with some theoretical observations respect

 the agents by which it was brought into               present position.             its

glomerates. The former are more or less compact, sometimes passing
into phonolite and basalt, and occasionally assume a columnar struc
ture. The conglomerates are composed of angular fragments of tra
chyte, imbedded in a tufaceous paste. The inclosed portions are some
times softer than the cement, when the rock assumes a honeycomb
appearance, but they are more often harder, and stand out in bold
relief. The conglomerates rest upon and alternate with the trachyte,
and in some places are intersected by basaltic dykes. Veins of car
nelian and chalcedony are stated to be contained in the igneous rocks,
and near Filbornou to pass through the conglomerate, traversing both
the basis and the included fragments.              These conglomerates are
considered by Mr. Strickland to have been accumulated by water, and
the contained fragments, though commonly angular, are sometimes
rounded, and included in finely laminated volcanic sand.                On the
Asiatic side of the Bosphorus the igneous rocks commence en masse
at Kavak, under the old Genoese Castle, and extend to Yoom-bornou
on the Black Sea, or perhaps further; and on the European side they
commence on the north of Buyukderé, and also extend to the Black
 Sea.    Besides these great masses of igneous products, trachytic and
trap dykes were observed by the authors traversing the Silurian rocks
at Baltalimani, in the hills above Bebek, at Kiretch-bornou, and the
 base of the Giant's Mountain.

                          Charles Babbage, Esq., and communicated                                     by
 the President, was first read.
     During     a recent visit      Dowlais, Mr. Guest mentioned
                                              to                             the                 to

                         in                  stream on the extensive moor
                                                      a
called Pwll   Duon, and about seven miles from Merthyr Tydvil,
                    y
there were  many  impressions considered       the country people
                                                                    by                                to
have been made
                              by
                    horses' hoofs. The stratum    sandstone    which       of               in
they occur   called the Farewell Rock, being the lowest bed
                    is                                            the                            of

                               Geological Society.                     475
   coal measures. At first sight they presented a strong resemblance to
   the marks which the hoof of a horse would leave on a soft surface, but
  on a closer examination Mr. Babbage found that the part which should
  have received an indentation from the frog was in relief, and resem
  bled rather a cast of the frog itself. The first mark examined by him
  proved to be the letter G, which had been carved on the rock by some
  person whose initials were G. H. This discovery made him inspect
  the others more minutely, and he ascertained satisfactorily that they
  were not artificial. Similar impressions were noticed by him at several
  places on the moor.
      The author then referred to analogous casts in the old red sandstone
  of Forfarshire, and there called Kelpies' feet.
      In attempting to account for the marks, Mr. Babbage described
 some observations recently made by Mr. Lyell on impressions left by
  Medusae on the rippled sand near Dundee.         On removing the gela
 tinous body of the animal, a circular space was exposed, not rippled,
 but having around half the border a depression of a horse-shoe form.
 These marks, however, were not considered by Mr. Lyell as identical
 with those called Kelpies' feet, but merely so far analogous as to in
 vite further observations, and to make it desirable to possess drawings
 of the impressions which different species of Medusae leave, when
 thrown by the tide upon a beach of soft mud or sand.
     A memoir “On the occurrence of silicified trunks of large trees in
 the new red sandstone formation or Poikilitic series, at Allesley, near
 Coventry,” by the Rev. Wm. Buckland, D.D., Professor of Geology
 and Mineralogy in the University of Oxford, was then read.
     In the great bed of gravel which overspreads the portion of War
wickshire referred to in this paper, specimens of silicified wood had
been long found, and from being slightly rolled, it was conjectured
that they could not have been drifted from a distance, though no in
dication of their original matrix had been observed.          In the spring
of last  year, however,  Dr. Buckland was informed     by  the Rev. W. T.
Bree of Allesley, that part of the silicified trunk of a tree, several feet
in length and a foot and a half in diameter, had been discovered in the
garden of the Rev. Mr. Gibson, at the bottom of Allesley Hill.          On
visiting the spot in October last, the author ascertained that the
tree was not imbedded in the gravel, but in that portion of the new
red sandstone series, which consists of indurated sandstone, alterna
ting with beds of conglomerate, chiefly       made up of sand and of peb
 bles of quartzite  and   compact    forms of trap.
    In the churchyard    of Allesley   Dr. Buckland found an angular frag
 ment of similar silicified wood which had been fresh cast up from the
 bottom of a grave, sunk to an unusual depth in the red sandstone;
 and in making a road from Allesley towards Coventry another large
 tree was discovered a short time ago, and the greater part of it used
in forming the foundation of the road. On comparing the fragments
found in the gravel with the tree in Mr. Gibson's garden, which is
carefully preserved in   its    matrix, Dr. Buckland found  so   perfect
                                                                       an
identity in  mineral character    as   toleave  nodoubt that the fragments
in  the surface gravel had been derived from denuded beds     of   the new
 red sandstone.                                -

and    its
        organic structure.   On the surface      many       the specimens             of                of

chiefly from the inside of the larger vessels, as if they were coated
with an extremely thin layer of carbonate of lime. This fact, connected
with the medullary rays remaining in some instances unchanged, or but
partially changed, presents, as stated by the author, the first ocular
demonstration of progressive steps in the process of petrifaction. The
communication concluded with some observations on the fossil wood
of Allesley described in Dr. Buckland's paper, in some of the specimens
of which there are spindle-shaped portions similar to those in the
partially petrified wood of Buckeberg.

forty feet, the phaenomena of depression, of which there are examples,
not being considered. That the greatest elevation in North Devon
seems to have been about 70 feet, while in Lancashire, Cheshire, and
Shropshire, there are marine deposits, containing also shells of existing
species, at various elevations of from 300 to 500 feet. The intensity
of elevatory force seems therefore to have increased towards the north,
and perhaps reached                  its
                             maximum among the Cumbrian mountains,

                            the Philosophical Society was held                                                       on

at Swaffham Bulbeck, was only 36°2, being the same as that of      Ja
nuary, and more than six degrees lower than the average mean for
March. The maximum was only 49°, and the minimum 11°; this
last, which was a lower temperature than any experienced since the
hard winter of 1829–30, having occurred on the morning of the
24th.
     Professor Willis exhibited and explained a machine which he
terms a Tabuloscriptive Engine. The object of this machine is to
transfer to paper any numerical series of magnitudes, so as to ex
hibit the curve which would be obtained by making those magni
 tudes a series of ordinates; a process of very frequent and impor
 tant use in comparing the results of observations of various kinds,
 as, for instance, meteorological, tidal, and statistical observations.
 The machine takes three places of figures, is capable of being worked
 with very slight attention, and with great rapidity, and produces a
 sheet very readily legible and intelligible.
     May 1.—A meeting of the Philosophical Society was held on
  Monday evening, Dr. Thackeray, V.P., in the chair.         A paper by
  A.   Moore,  Esq., of Trinity  College, was read, on the solution of a
  difficulty of analysis noticed by Sir W. R. Hamilton.—Mr. Whewell
  gave an account of the performance of a new Anemometer, invented
  by him, which has been erected at the top of the house of the So
  ciety, and also on the top of the Observatory, and of which the   in
  dications for the last four months have been recorded.— Mr. Kelland
  also read a paper on the effect of the elasticity of the aether in cry
      º
  stals as bearing on the undulatory theory.
      May 15.—A meeting of the Philosophical Society was held on
  Monday evening, Dr. Clark, the President, being in the chair.        A
  communication by Mr. G. Green was read, containing the solution
  of a           respecting the motion of a heavy fluid in a canal.—Mr.
  Hopkins gave an account of his mathematical researches on the re
  frigeration and the internal fluidity of the earth.-A paper of Mr.
  Moseley was read, on the theory of the equilibrium of bodies in
  contact.—Mr. W. W. Fisher presented another communication on
  the subject of spina bifida. The author has observed, in two cases
  of spina bifida, irregularities which he described; i. e. the union of
  two or more of the sacral ganglia; the passage of their respective
  nerves through the sheath in one fasciculus, and the adhesion of
  the extremity of the spinal marrow to the walls of the sac. By ap
  plying to the consideration of these anomalies the knowledge which
  we now possess of the formation of the different portions of the ner
  vous system in the embryon, and of the anatomy of that system in
   the lower order of animals, he is led, with regard to the two ex
      *
   amples he has seen, to adopt the following views.
      1. That the union of the sacral ganglia constituted the primary
   irregularity to which the anomalous distribution of their correspond
   ing          between the ganglia and the spinal cord might be re
   ferred.
    2. That, unacquainted with any circumstance connected with the
 formation of the spinal cord and    its
                                       sheath, which can account for

the upper jaw. The author related some anecdotes of the inter
esting and beautiful specimen now in the Zoological Gardens; con
trasted the species in structure and habits with the Halichaerus :
and expressed his dissent from the statement put forward in Mr.
Bell's British Quadrupeds, on the authority of Professor Nilsson,
that the oblique position of the molar teeth in P. Vitulina was a
specific character of unerring value. He has shown, in fact, that
the obliquity in question arose from the insufficient development of
the jaws in early life, which contracted the space for the teeth; and
that it disappeared long before the skull reached         maximum size,    its
and partially occurred       the young Halichaerus.

conclusion, observing that the Groenlandica was            large species,  a

impossible that this salt might exhibit phaenomena of decomposition
of the same class as the singular ones which M. Thenard observed
with binoxide of hydrogen.       In fact this is the case ; many sub
stances which   decompose   binoxide of hydrogen, without either ac
quiring or losing anything, also decompose the nitrosulphates.
Spongy platina, oxide of silver, metallic silver, powdered charcoal,
and oxide of manganese, produce this effect; the two first-men
tioned especially act with extreme rapidity upon the nitrosulphate
of ammonia.
  “I   convinced myself,” continues M. Pelouze, “that this remark
able phaenomenon was due, as in the case of binoxide of hydrogen,
to an action of presence [ä une action de présence], and that it never
produces more than a mere conversion of nitrosulphate of ammonia
into protoxide of azote and sulphate of ammonia.         Oxide of silver
is not reduced, for if it be washed after having caused it to decom
pose a large quantity of this salt, it afterwards dissolves in nitric
acid without the disengagement of red vapours.”
   M. Pelouze afterwards remarks that “it would be very difficult to
discover the probable cause of these singular phaenomena; but the
very circumstance of their being at present inexplicable, they appeared
to me the more to merit the attention of chemists.        What indeed
is more calculated to excite curiosity than to observe a salt, by the
mere contact of a body which neither yields anything to nor takes
anything from           it,
                    decompose with extreme rapidity into new forms,
among which the agent producing these violent actions remains
chemically passive?

till one in the morning. This letter contains the observations made
by M. Matteucci, while this phaenomenon lasted, on two magnetic
needles, the one of the length of 0"-05; the other shorter, which
in ordinary had 32 and 16 oscillations per minute. In ten succes
sive observations made during the aurora borealis, the constant num
ber of oscillations amounted to 30 and 13 only. The next morning,
the temperature remaining the same as in the preceding evening,
the needles had returned to their ordinary rate of 32 and 16 oscil
lations. M. Matteucci adds, that if similar facts should be observed
hereafter, they might serve to elucidate the theory of the aurora
borealis and of terrestrial magnetism.—Institut, March 22.
    Observations of this phaenomenon are also given in the Proceedings
 of the Astronomical Society for March 1837.
    In London, by F. Baily, Esq., the President of the Society.—
“The atmosphere had been very cloudy, with much rain and
wind during the whole of the evening.          But a little after ten
o'clock (mean time), or about three quarters of an hour before
the occultation of Mars by the moon took place, the clouds                 di
spersed and left a beautifully clear sky; at the same time disco
vering a most brilliant aurora, or rather stream of light, which ex
tended from the horizon in the west, through the zenith, almost
down to the horizon in the east.       This light was of a fine rose co
lour, being most vivid and brilliant in the western horizon; and, as
it approached the zenith, was evidently impaired by the strong light
of the moon, then near her full, and high on the meridian. The
aurora appeared very steady, and unaccompanied by any corusca
tions.   It lasted till about half-past eleven o'clock, and wholly dis
appeared before midnight.         By subsequent accounts which have
been   received,  it was seen in the western parts of Ireland, and in
Scotland.”

quitting the observatory, at about 10" 35", I was struck by a
most extraordinary red appearance in the sky, extending as far
west as the constellation of Orion, and as far east as that of Leo.
It was principally north of the moon—none of it very near her; and

                          PREPARATION OF IODIN E.      M. BUSSY.                    B.Y.
    The process of extracting iodine generally followed, and which
 consists in decomposing the mother-waters of kelp by means of con
 centrated sulphuric acid, is well known to be liable to variable re
 sults, on account of a portion of the iodine coming over in the state
 of hydriodic acid and chloride of iodine, so that in either case there
 is always a considerable loss.
    To avoid this inconvenience, M. Soubeiran proposed to preci
 pitate the iodine from the mother-waters by means of sulphate of
 copper, and afterwards to decompose the iodide of copper by per
 oxide of manganese at a high temperature".              But this process re
 quires minute attention and much precaution to separate the whole
 of the iodine existing in the mother-waters, and we do not believe
 that it has ever been employed in any manufactory.
    These circumstances induce me to publish a far more simple me
 thod, which has been lately employed by some manufacturers of
 iodine ; it was discovered                              (if

This excess of chlorine is especially to be apprehended, when it is
also intended to separate from the same mother-waters the bro
mine which they contain.
   In order to avoid adding excess of chlorine, the liquor which is
supposed to be near saturation, may be suffered to settle for a short
time, and the current of chlorine being interrupted it is to be di
rected on the surface of the liquid. If it contain any iodide in solu

passing a current of oxygen gas on phosphorus melted under hot
water, in which operation the phosphorus combines with this gas,
giving out light and heat. It is therefore proved that the red powder
is an oxide.
   Some time since I received some sticks of phosphorus which had
been kept for thirty years in the same bottle and exposed to
the light. Their surface was perfectly white, and covered with
a crust of this white matter to the thickness of about Tan of an inch.
I  removed these cylinders into another bottle filled with pure                                                    di
stilled water, and was surprised on finding the day after that they
had become entirely red : although they have been four years in
contact with light, they retain the same fine red colour.
    This observation is adverse to the opinions of Pelouze and Rose.
The only idea which I can form as to this sudden change of the
white crust into red oxide by distilled water             that the minute                is,
quantity        of
               oxygen      the distilled water had converted the white
                                    in
crust into oxide, and since this quantity           oxygen     very small, of                      is
