  I. On ike Constant of Dwlectricity and the Double Refraction
              ofInsulating Fluids. By G. Quincke*.
ACCORDING to the views of Faradayf, we must assume
         that in every point of an insulating fluid which is elec
trified like the glass of a Leyden jar there is a pulling force
in the direction of the lines of force, and a pushing force per
pendicular to those lines. According to MaxwellJ, these
pushing forces are given by the equation
if P denotes the difference of electric potentials, a the dis
tance between the plane metallic faces, or electrodes, between
which the fluid is situated. Kx would have for the forces
parallel and perpendicular to the lines of electric force the
same value and would be equal to the dielectricity-constant K,
or the number which represents the increase of the capacity
of a condenser when the plates are separated from one another
by another insulating substance instead of air. According to
the most recent theoretic investigations by Helmholtzfj, the
ratio between the amounts of the pressures and tensions per-

2       Prof. G. Quincke on the Constant of Dielectricity
pendicular and parallel to the lines of electric force may vary
according to the nature of the insulating substance.
   I have measured, for a series of insulating fluids, the value
of K and Kj for the pulling and pushing forces parallel and
perpendicular to the lines of electric force. I will denote K,
by Kp or K„ according to whether the action of the forces is
parallel or perpendicular to the lines of electric force.
    I employed in those measurements an electric balance with
plane horizontal condenser-plates of nickel-coated brass 8*530
centim. in diameter and distant 0'1597 fcentim., which stood
in a larger glass vessel filled with air or the insulating fluid.
The lower condenser-plate was connected with the inner coat
ing of a large Leyden battery of eight flint-glass jars, the outer
coating of which, as well as the upper plate of the condenser,
was conducted to earth.
    The plates of the condenser and the coatings of the battery
were charged by a Holtz machine, and were maintained at a
constant difference of potentials. The latter could be con
trolled by a reflecting electrometer described by M. Righi*,
or measured by a screw-electrometer (long-range electrometer)
 of Sir William Thomson f.
    A comparison of the indications of the screw-electrometer
with the measurements in an electric balance in air, with con
denser-plates of 85 millim. diameter and at from 1 to 2 millim.
distance, showed that to one turn of the screw of the electro
meter (of which O001 revolution could be determined by
estimation) corresponded an alteration of the electric potential
amounting to 1"1415 (J.G.S., or the electromotive force of a
Daniell battery of 305 cells.
    With the screw-electrometer I determined the difference of
electric potentials at which the condenser-plates in air attracted
each other with a force Gi of 20 or 10 grammes.
    I next sought to ascertain the weights which, with equal
difference of electrical potentials, exactly counterbalanced the
electric attraction of the condenser-plates (parallel to the lines
of electric force) when the plates were entirely surrounded by
the insulating fluid instead of air. These weights, Gn, varied
between 21 and 100 grammes, and could be determined with
precision to 0-01 grm. by a sensitive balance. The ratio of
the weights Gn and Gi found for the fluid and air, with equal
electric potential-difference, gives K„.
    When the condenser-plates of the electric balance were
charged up to the same difference of electric potentials, and

        and il\e Double Refraction of Insulating Fluids.           3
discharged while in the insulating fluid or in air by a sensitive
multiplier, the ratio of the deflections of the multiplier gave
the ratio of the capacities of the condenser, or the dielectricity-
constant K.
   Finally the upper condenser-plate was removed, and replaced
by a plate of equal dimensions with a short vertical metal tube
in the centre, which was connected with a sulphide-of-carbon
manometer and a long tube of caoutchouc furnished with a
cock.
   While both plates of the condenser were conducted to earth,
dry air was blown through the caoutchouc tube into the space
between the condenser-plates, and a flattened air-bubble pro
duced, touching the plates in two equal surfaces of from 2 to
5 centim. diameter. Then, with the cock closed, the separa
ting fluid showed in the two legs of the manometer a differ
ence of heights that was constantly less than 1 centim. and
depended on the hydrostatic and capillary pressure of the
fluid upon the air-bubble.
   If the two plates were now brought to the difference of
electric potentials for which the weights Gi and Gn had been
determined, the electrical transverse pressure in the interior
of the fluid counteracted the electrical transverse pressure in
the interior of the air-bubble, and the difference of heights of
the fluid in the manometer received an increment h. This
increase was independent of the diameter of the air-bubble,
and proportional to the square of the electric potential-differ
ence. It varied, with the different fluids, between 015 and
1 centim.
   If a denotes the specific gravity of the separating fluid, the
difference of the electric transverse pressures upon unit sur
face in the interior of the fluid and of the air-bubble is
                              K —1 P2
   For the same potential-difference P and the same distance

4      Prof. Gr. Quincke on the Constant of Dielectricity
   This determines K„ since Kp has been ascertained by means
of the electric balance.
    Special experiments showed that the amount of the surface-
tension of the insulating fluids did not change during pro
longed action of electric forces.
    With the same fluid and at the same temperature the refrac
tion-index for Fraunhofer's line D was measured by means of
a Steinheil hollow prism and an Oertling circle, permitting
readings of 2".
    According to Maxwell*, for light-waves of infinite length
the constant K would be equal to the square of the index of
refraction. This relation is not confirmed by my observations
collected in the opposite Table. On the contrary, Kp is nearly
equal to K„ and constantly greater than K. Colza oil forms
the only exception.
    All the fluids were as pure and free from dust and contained
as little water as possible, and insulated excellently. As, how
ever, the observations took some time, a portion of the fluid
evaporated, the temperature fell, and on opening the balance-
case some water condensed on the surface of the fluid, through
which the numbers found for the dielectricity-constants were
too high. This source of error was especially great in the
case of ether. Four successive determinations with ether
which had stood for a long time over calcined marble, and
was filtered as quickly as possible through a fan filter into the
glass vessel of the electric balance, gave
              Kp= 4-399 4-516 4-739 4-891.
The numbers in the Table therefore refer to ether which had
already absorbed a trace of water.
    In order to investigate the alteration of the optical proper
ties of fluids by electric forces, I employed condensers with
plane electrodes, or with electrodes consisting of two concen
tric cylinders. The electrodes or coatings, of nickel-covered
brass, were insulated by flint-glass rods from one another, and
 from the wider glass tubes closed by plane-parallel glass plates
 which contained the fluid as pure and free from dust as pos
 sible. The wires, insulated by flint glass, which connected
the electrodes with the earth or with the inner coating of a
 large battery of eight Leyden jars of flint glass, passed through
two side tubes. The coatings of the fluid condenser and the
 Leyden battery were charged, as in the experiments with the
electric balance, by a Holtz machine, and maintained at a con
stant difference of potentials, which was controlled by the
                   Electricity and Magnetism, ii. § 788.

    The quantity B diminishes as the wave-length increases,
and is in general found to be smaller in proportion as the
length of the electrized liquid is greater. Slight mixtures of
foreign substances, even water condensed from the air, have
a considerable influence on B.

        and the Double Refraction of Insulatina Fluids.          7
   In sulphide of carbon the electric double refraction remained
the same when the temperature varied 10°.
   When insulating fluids are examined between two concen
tric cylinders with a Babinet compensator, so that the dark
streak in the compensator appears parallel to the lines of elec
tric force, on the electrification of the fluid the dark streak is
the more displaced the nearer it lies to the inner cylinder. It
frequently at the same time forms a curve with a turning-
point, running to different sides according to whether the fluid
possesses positive or negative double refraction. I have some
times observed this turning-point even with strong electric
forces between plane electrodes.
   The difference of rate of light polarized parallel and that
polarized perpendicular to the lines of electric force, at the
surface of two cylinders with internal radius Rj and external
radius Ej, and length I, is given approximately by the equa

 was greater at the first moment after the sudden entrance of
 the electric forces than subsequently. At the same time the
 field appeared darkened for about half a minute. The phase-
 difference therefore consists of a variable and, on the action of
 the electric forces continuing, a constant portion. The former
 appears to arise from an electrical unequal expansion of the
 oil, in like manner as double refraction results from unequal
 heating.
    The phenomena of double refraction are very striking when
 from any cause the electric forces in the interior of the insu
 lating fluid undergo periodical variations and at the same time
 the dark streak in Babinet's compensator is displaced a little
 or starts. The greater the difference of the electric potentials
 of the electrodes the more frequent were these startings or
 pulsations. With cylindrical electrodes the dark streak in the
 Babinet compensator then appeared displaced to the same
 extent on the inner and outer faces of the cylinder. The
 constants Bj and B2 increased as the difference of potentials
 rose ; and only with high potential-differences did they reach
 the value ordinarily found for them without pulsations. At
 the same time numerous air-bubbles are evolved from the
 fluid, and a clicking sound is heard proceeding from the ap
 paratus, the pitch of which falls as the potential-difference
 diminishes.
     In order to examine whether the mean index of refraction
 of insulating fluids is altered by electric forces, the fluid con
 densers were inserted in an interference-apparatus*, in which
 two pencils of rays reflected from two plane-parallel glass
 plates of equal thickness interfere and form a pure spectrum
 with Fraunhofer's lines, which is traversed by dark inter
 ference-streaks. One of the pencils passed through the fluid
 inside, the other outside the electrodes.
     On the electrification of the fluid a displacement of the
 interference-streaks was observed, now in the direction of an
 increase, and now in the direction of a diminution of the re
 fraction-index by the electric forces. Outcurving6 or waves,
 as it were, rise above the interference-streaks. These wave
 like displacements appear to point to periodic discharges or

a periodic variation of the electric forces within the insulating
fluid between the electrodes.
    The displacement in the direction of a diminution of the
refraction-index corresponds to a raising of the temperature
of the insulating fluid from 0o-0001 to O0-l 0. ; it increases
with the1 difference of electric potentials of the electrodes and
 the viscosity of the fluid, and may be owing to a heating of
 the fluid by friction, since the fluid-particles are moved to and
 fro and stirred round by the electric forces between the elec
 trodes.
    The increase of the refraction-index occurs, in some fluids,
 only at the commencement of the electric action ; in others it
 alternates with a diminution at short intervals during the
 entire continuance of the electric action.
 II. Upon a Photo-chemical Method for the Determination of
     Organic Matter in Potable Water.            By Dr. Albert
     R. Leeds*.
  WITHOUT attempting to revive at this moment the dis
         cussion as to the sources of error inherent in the pre
 sent methods employed for the estimation of organic matter
 in potable waters, or as to the relative value of the inferences
 drawn from the results arrived at by the various analytical
  methods, I shall proceed to state the outlines of the new pro
  cess, and the experiments thus far made to test its accuracy
 and applicability. The process is founded on the fact of the
  ready decomposability of certain salts of silver when exposed,
  in the presence of organic matter and in the state of solution,
 to the action of light. As a preliminary step it was needful
 to determine whether these salts were likewise reduced, even
 when organic matter was not present ; and to this end the fol
  lowing experiments were tried :—
     1. To 100 cubic centiin. of ammonia-free distilled water,
 5 cubic centim. of a decinormal solution of nitrate of silver
 was added, and the liquid exposed to the sunlight for 48 hours
 in a well-stoppered comparison-tube.
     2. The same, but after addition of ammonia just sufficient
  to redissolve the precipitate first formed.
     3. Same as 1, but the silver first precipitated as chloride,
  and then redissolved by ammonia.
     4. Same as 1, but the silver precipitated as cyanide, and
  then redissolved in cyanide of potassium.
     5. Same as 1, but the precipitate first formed with sodium
  hyposulphite just redissolved in excess of reagent.
                   * Communicated by the Author.

10           Dr. A. R. Leeds on the Determination
   After two days' exposure, no precipitation of reduced silver
occurred in the neutral solution of argentic nitrate, nor in that
of the ammonio-argentic oxide, nor in the ammonio-argentic
chloride, nor in the sodio-argentic hyposulphite.
   Having thus established the fact that no reduction of silver
occurs in case organic matter is rigidly excluded, even after
prolonged exposure to sunlight, the next point of inquiry was
to determine which of these five solutions was most affected
by such organic matters as are ordinarily present in potable
water. The inquiry as to the relative energy of action of
different kinds of organic matter in general did not neces
sarily form a part of the present investigation.
   In the study of this point, a sample of potable water was
made use of from the river Schuylkill, the water-supply of the
city of Philadelphia. This drinking-water had been affected
by a sudden cachexy in the month of January, becoming
most offensive to taste and smell ; and the authorities of the
city had requested me to investigate the causes of its non-
potability. The scope of the inquiry being thus narrowed to
the finding of specific causes, I was necessitated to tax the
capabilities of the methods at present possessed by water-ana
lysts, and was furthermore led to test this new one. Now on
adding, to the five silver solutions prepared as in the first
series of experiments, 100 cubic centim. of this Schuylkill
water, it was found, after 5 hours' exposure to sunlight, that
the ammonio-argentic oxide was slightly changed, the potassio-
argentic cyanide was unaffected. Of the remaining three,
the sodio-argentic hyposulphite threw down the heaviest pre
cipitate, the ammonio-argentic chloride a precipitate nearly
as great, and the neutral solution of argentic nitrate the
least.
   From these experiments it would appear that the solution
of argentic hyposulphite in excess of sodium hyposulphite is
the reagent best adapted for use in this actinic method. But
subsequent experiments showed that the neutral solution of
argentic nitrate fulfilled all needed requirements, and that the
labour of preparing a special reagent was uncalled for. The
method finally adopted is as follows :—
    250 cubic centim. of the natural water is treated with 10
cubic centim. of decinormal silver solution in the tall glass-
stoppered cylinders or bottles. The waters become turbid and
 frequently coloured ; but after a moderate interval, usually
 less than two days, the turbidity entirely disappears and the
 entire precipitate collects at the bottom of the vessel. In case
 sufficient silver has been employed (and the amount recom
 mended is ordinarily a large excess), this clarification indicates

               of Organic Matter in Potable Water.                 11
an end-reaotion, and it is useless to expect a renewed precipi
tation in case the filtrate be submitted to second exposure.
The precipitates are collected on asbestos filters, similar to
those used in the determination of carbon in steel, washed
first with water, then with strong ammonia to redissolve co-
precipitated chloride, dissolved in nitric acid, evaporated to
dryness, redissolved in nitric acid, and the silver determined
by Pisani's method. All these washings are but the work of
a few minutes with the aid of a water-pump. The metallic
silver may be weighed directly ; but the method indicated is
more rapid and equally accurate.
   Six samples of the Philadelphia water (Nos. 230-235) were
so treated ; and duplicate determinations of the oxygen re
quired to oxidize the organic matters were made by potassium
permanganate. Finding that the results better accorded with
the information imparted by the other data of water-analysis
 than those obtained by the permanganate, the method was
 systematically applied to the examination of the Passaic
 water (water-supply of Newark and Jersey City).

 12       Determination of Organic Matter in Potable Water.
    It will be noted that whilst there is a close agreement in
 many cases between the results obtained by these utterly di
 verse methods, yet in others there is a striking difference—the
 higher result being uniformly obtained by the actinic method
with the Schuylkill waters, but generally by the permanga
 nate with the Passaic waters. Now investigation revealed
 that the non-potability of the former was connected with a
 state of retarded or arrested oxidation, the ice-covered stream
 having a striking deficiency of oxygen as compared with its
 normal percentage, and being laden with products of organic
 decomposition. In the Passaic, besides the sewage there is a
 great volume of trade pollution ; and it is in connexion with
 such samples (like Nos. 247 and 249, which show the points
 where the refuse of the great manufacturing city of Paterson
 is discharged into the Passaic) that the discrepancy is greatest,
 and the oxygen as determined by the permanganate most ex
 ceeds the amount as determined by reduction of silver. The
 general inference from these experiments was that, while po
tassium permanganate at the boiling-point (the determinations
were made at 98° C.) was decomposed to a greater or less
extent by most organic substances soluble in water, the re
duction of the silver was to be ascribed to easily decompo
sable organic bodies akin in their nature to sewage.
    To test this point some weak hay-infusion and highly di
lute urine were added to two portions of silver solution and
exposed to sunlight. A dense mirror quickly formed on
sides and bottom of vessels. Solutions of cane-sugar, moist
sugar, and clear starch were added. No darkening of the
liquid occurred in the first two cases, and after a short while
the slight grey precipitate ceased to increase. This faint
action was not due to the sugar, but to a minute amount of
foreign organic matter contained in it. Starch produced no
change, neither did nitrobenzol.        Urea caused a scarcely
perceptible precipitate. The powerful base aniline decom
posed the silver salt, forming aniline nitrate ; and afterwards
the liberated argentic oxide was decomposed, its silver forming
a beautiful mirror and the solution becoming dyed with
rosaniline. This reduction by organic bases might indeed be
employed for the silvering of mirrors and the interior of glass
ornaments. But such bodies would be rarely present, even in
trade-polluted streams ; and if they were, would be readily
detected, and their influence allowed for.
    Of course, the reduction of ammoniacal solution of silver in
presence of alcohol, naphtha, and essential oils like cassia,
caraway, cloves, &c, will occur to the reader ; so also will

tion of grape-sugar, or of milk- or cane-sugar, or by alde
hydes &c. But the reductions thus effected bear little analogy
to that occurring in a neutral solution, otherwise permanent,
under the influence of light. In conclusion, I desire to add
that this publication is in one sense premature; for while the
process has been constantly employed in my own laboratory
during the past four months, I have not as yet had the oppor
tunity to apply it to so great a variety of waters as I had in
tended. But finding that various chemists to whom I have
communicated it have always adopted the method, I publish
it in order to obtain the benefit of wider and more severe
criticism.
     III. On Mr. Ferrel's Theory of Atmospheric Currents.
                    By D. D. Heath, Esq *
IT has recently come to my knowledge that teachers of
      Physical Science who have not had a mathematical train
ing (and the specialism of the day must be increasing the
class) trust to Mr. Ferrel, of Cambridge in the United States,
as a sound and accepted authority for dynamical principles
and conclusions relating to atmospheric currents; and, not to
quote other confirmations of this fact from communications
to ' Nature ' and elsewhere, I find that Dr. Haughton, of
Dublin, thus speaks of him in some lectures on Physical Geo
graphy (1880):—
    " We are not able, in the present state of our knowledge, to
form a complete mathematical theory of atmospheric currents
caused by the unequal expansion of the air by solar heat. . . .
But we are able to satisfy the equations of motion by a special
arrangement of all the atmospheric currents and barometric
pressures, which gives us a solution of the problem that ex
plains every important fact. . . . This solution is due to Mr. W.
Ferrel, of the United-States Coast Survey, ' The Motions of
Fluids and Solids relative to the Earth's Surface ' (New York,
I860)."
    This is a cautiously worded passage;- and I suspect Dr.
 Haughton has not examined very carefully the connexion
 between Mr. Ferrel's premises and conclusions. I only quote
 it as a justification for my thinking it must be worth while
 to show the unsoundness of his work and the baselessness of
 his conclusions, if I am right in the estimate I have made of
 them. I may as well premise, however, that I possess no
 familiarity with the facts of meteorology, on which Mr. Ferrel
 may have every claim to speak ; I only address myself to his
 principles and methods of proof.
                    • Communicated by the Author.

14               Mr. D. D. Heath on Mr. Ferrel's
   If I were mainly writing for mathematicians, I should at
once begin on his treatise of 1860, on which Mr. Ferrel's
other papers and communications to 'Nature' are founded;
and my paper would not be long. But having rather in view
readers who are not generally familiar with partial differential
equations, and wishing to carry them along with me without
impediment as far as I can, I will begin with a communica
tion to ' Nature ' (March 14th, 1872), which is in fact what
was first brought to my notice and led me to further inquiry.
    It is headed " Ocean Currents," and forms part of a discus-
cussion on the Gulf-stream and similar phenomena, in which
Dr. Croll, Professor Everett, and a Dane, Professor Colding,
are concerned. But it includes atmospheric motions in its
scope.
    He begins with warnings against taking on trust " all the
principles and theories based upon hypothetical forces which
have come down to us from preceding generations, however
plausible and however much sanctioned by authority they
appear to be," with more in the same strain. But, after all,
he adduces no example of such hypothetical assumptions of
forces from older writers; and we shall see that it is he who
is rather obnoxious to such a charge.
    He goes on to lament that Professor Colding has been
"unsuspectingly led into error" by accepting from old text
books the statement that " if a particle of air at the equator,
relatively at rest and therefore having a linear velocity in
space of about 1000 miles an hour, is forced to move towards
 the pole, it will, on arriving at the parallel of latitude where the
 earth's surface has a velocity of only 900 miles, still have its
 velocity of 1000 miles in the case of no friction " (which, here
 and elsewhere, I understand to include pressure of the sur
 rounding air), " and consequently have a relative velocity of
 100 miles; and, on arriving at the parallel of 60°, will have a
 relative velocitj' of 500 miles."
     I should agree that a bare statement like this in a text-book
 would be objectionable as, at the least, misleading. Matter at
 the equator can no doubt be " forced " to move all the way to
 the pole. But the velocity and direction with and in which
 it arrives there will depend upon the means taken to force it.
 It would never get there by any natural impulse or pressure
 originating in the equatorial regions. For it is one of the
 plainest of fundamental facts in Dynamics (though we shall
 see that Mr. Ferrel denies it) that, taking gravity to be directed
 to the centre of the earth, as it is very nearly, a mass situated
 anywhere near the surface, but unconnected with it and un
 resisted by the air, if put in motion, will begin to move infixed

                  Theory of Atmospheric Currents.               15
space, in a straight line, in a direction and with a velocity
compounded of the velocity it had in common with the sur
face at that place and that of the impulse given to it, in ac
cordance with the principle of the Parallelogram of Veloci
ties, and will be drawn out of that line only downwards, by
the force of gravity at the centre of the earth; and therefore
it will never leave the plane of the great circle, fixed in space,
which comprises the original direction and this centre. From
this it will be seen that, if started due north from the equator
with a velocity of even 1000 miles an hour—the same as the
eastward velocity of the surface there—it will only reach the
latitude of 45°. Up to that culminating point it will gain
 apparent of relative velocity, compared with the surface
 it is passing over, as explained in Mr. Ferrel's "text
 book," and theft will begin its descent, losing relative velo
 city, cross the equator at the point opposite to the one it
 started from, and complete its circuit in the other hemisphere,
just as the moon does at a greater distance—that is, supposing
 gravity does not, long before then, pull it down to the earth's
 surface. This effect of equable motion combined with passage
 over different latitudes is precisely one part of the explanation
  of that variability of the sun's apparent motion which gives
 rise to the " Equation of Time/' or difference between solar and
  clock time.
    Sir J. Herschell, I may remark, in his ' Meteorology,' does
 not thus mislead his readers. He takes the lower current of
 cold air from the north, and traces it downwards towards the
 equator; and this, if unimpeded, it will reach with ever so
 little original impulse southward; and even with the actual
 resistance the impelling force arising from the difference of
 temperature will always be helping, and may prevail. When
 he comes to consider the upper northward current, he only
 conducts it " beyond the tropics," and there brings it down
 to earth.
     I have gone at length into this very elementary exposi
 tion, because a clear conception of the facts will prevent a
  great deal of confusion from Mr. Ferrel's papers. But this is
 by no means the objection which he in this place goes on to
  bring against the " mischievous " teaching of the text-books.
  What he says, after the passage I have quoted, is: — "But
  this is at variance with a fundamental and well-established
  principle in mechanics. The force in this case is a central
  force; or at least the compound perpendicular to the earth's
  axis \_sic, I do not understand what resolution of the force he
  has in his mind] can be neglected, since it can have nothing to
  do with any east or west motion. This being the case, the

 16            Mr. D. D. Heath on Mr. Ferrel's
principle of the conservation of areas must be satisfied; and
consequently, when it arrives at the parallel of 60°, where the
earth's surface has a velocity of 500 miles, it must have a
velocity of 2000 miles."
    My first impression on reading this was that Mr. Ferrel
could not mean to propound it as his own doctrine ; but must
have intended some aryumentum ad hominem against Professor
 Colding, though I could not see it. But it appears to be his
serious belief, stated in his treatise of 1860 (parag. 22), and
repeated and made the basis of calculation in a summary
of his doctrine, by himself, in Silliman's Journal (2nd ser.
vol. xxxi.). Now this " principle," as applicable to this case,
is that, when a body is moving subject only to the action of a
force directed to a fixed centre, the imaginary line which joins
it with that centre sweeps out equal areas round it in equal
times, however much the body may approach to or recede
from it in the course of its orbit. Here, the centre of force is
the centre of the earth; and the body moving over the surface
is always very nearly at the same distance from it; and so, to
preserve the equality of areas, it must preserve very nearly an
equable velocity. Mr. Ferrel seems to imagine that the force
shifts along the axis of the earth so as always to keep abreast
of the moving body, and so to give it a corkscrew motion round
the axis, but drawing it into continually narrower and nar
rower circles, and so giving it greater and greater velocities.
What gravity really does is to keep the moving body, together
with air and sea and all loose matter, from flying off into
space, leaving the solid part to spin by itself.
    Mr. Ferrel goes on with his charge against Professor Col
ding :—" Adopting, thoughtlessly and very naturally, the
erroneous principle which is usually taught" (that, namely,
which he impugned above, that a body will keep the velocity
and direction once given to it until interfered with) " he esti
mates the' amount of deflecting force due to the earth's rotation;
 and the result is that his force is just one half of what it really
is." I have not read Professor Colding's paper, and so can
not say whether he has made any mistake. And Mr. Ferrel
seems to me to have confused himself about these " deflecting
forces," and so not to be very intelligible to others. But 1
understand the charge to mean that the Professor has here
estimated the relative eastward or westward motion as due to
the earth's spinning under the moving body which keeps its
original velocity, instead of doubling the effect by the imagi
nary " conservation of areas " principle. If so, he has cer
tainly so far done the right thing.
   But then he adds that the Professor has " entirely neglected

                   Theory of Atmospheric Currents.                        17
0110 component of the force clue to the earth's rotation," which
Mr. Ferrel and Professor Everett have (independently as I
understand it) discovered. " If he had taken in this latter com
ponent also, and resolved it in the direction of the line of
motion and perpendicular to it, as he did the former he would
have found that the parts in the direction of the motion arising
from both components exactly cancel one another n all cases,
and that the resultant of both components is a force perpendi
cular to the direction of motion,"—which of course "tends only
to change the direction of the motion and never to accelerate or
retard it, in whatever direction it may be."
    So that, on Mr. Ferret's own showing, a body set in relative
motion, towards the pole or in any other direction, will, after
all, neither be accelerated nor retarded, in virtue of the " prin
ciple of conservation of areas," but will maintain its velocity
and be deflected from (that is, never come near to ) the pole.
 In truth it will, when supposed free in its motion, move
 equably in a great circle, as I have already explained, in oppo
sition to Mr. Ferrel, who, not here only but in Silliman's
Journal, explicitly denies it *. For these two forces which
combine to "deflect" the moving body (that is, to alter the
apparent direction of its motion) are the merely " hypothe
tical " forces which, I have above said, are introduced by Mr.
Ferrel himself—-justifiably enough, if he understood them to
be such. To explain—
    If a body moving uniformly in a straight line is viewed
from an observatory itself in motion, it. will appear to be
moving in some curve and with varying velocity. And the
 observer may express this fact by saying that, relatively to
 him, it moves as if acted on by such and such forces. And
 this is our case. We are carried along by the earth's rotation
 from west to east; and if a mass is set moving, in space,
 equably along a great circle, it moves, as we estimate it, away
 from our latitude and our longitude, and unequably. "Great-
circle sailing " is really straight sailing ; but I dare say that
many an uneducated steersman, when following the rules
given him for that operation, thinks he is altering the straight
 course. I should here add that Mr. Ferrel does, in Silliman's
 Journal, when speaking of the resultant " force," remark that
 it " is not an absolute force, but relative ; somewhat in the
 nature of centrifugal force." But this seems to have been a
 fleeting thought not duly followed out ; or he would not, a
 dozen years iater, have written what I have quoted.
     I do not know what Professor Everett has written, or
    * " If a body wero set in motion upon the surface of the earth, it would
 not in general move in the circumference of a great circle."

18                Mr. D. D. Heath on Mr. Forrel's
whether ho makes any claim to a discovery in this matter.
When the mathematical investigation of tho motions of a fluid
surrounding the rotating earth is made to commence, as by
Laplace and Airy, and by Mr. Ferrel in his paper of 18t>0,
with the most general equations, it is at once evident to in
spection that the terms which suggest these " deflecting forces"
 really express the effect of passing from formulas adapted to
a fixed to those adapted to a revolving observatory, as I will
point out more clearly below. But I have to confess that this
simple interpretation had not occurred to me till I had pon
dered for some time over Mr. Ferret's papers.
    I wrote a paper in the Philosophical Magazine (March
 1867) on Deep-Sea Tides, based on Airy's "Tides and Waves"
in the Encycl. Metrop., but intended to be less abstruse and
formidable. And I deduced these two terms in the way indi
cated by Airy (par. 87 and 88, where ho also calls them tho
representatives of " forces "), making one term the expression
of the alteration of relative motion by the mere passage north
or south, as explained in the passage first quoted from Mr.
Ferrel above, and the other the expression of the effect of the
impressed east or west velocity by virtue of which the mass is
carried outward or inward in the plane of the small circle of
latitude (a so-called " centrifugal force "), and so throwing it
southward or northward along the surface. And though I
had to prove in the course of the investigation that " these
forces counteract each other " as regards acceleration and
retardation, I did so without further reflection or inference.
    I hope I have made it sufficiently plain that the two points
Mr. Ferrel insists on in this communication—the positive one,
that the principle of tho conservation of areas requires an
accelerated spiral motion in bodies impelled northwards, and
the negative one, that an impulse given to a free body along
the surface of the earth will not generally send it along a great
circle—are utterly unfounded and erroneous. I now proceed
to the paper of 1860 referred to by Dr. Haughton; and, still
addressing myself mainly to the same class of readers, 1 will
first notice some prominent points in the treatment and results,
and then say a few words on the mathematical working*.
    1. His purpose is not to trace the course and effect of any
accidental disturbance in the atmosphere or ocean, but the
permanent and necessary motions, pressures, and shapes which
must arise and subsist in virtue of the causes of motion which
are permanently at work. In an ideally " perfect " fluid, and
   * It appears that the substance of this paper was distributed in pamphlet
form by the Smithsonian Institute in Europe and America ; which I
suppose has helped Mr. Ferrel's reputation.

                  Theory of Atmospheric Currents.               10
 with no surface friction, any motion once started might indeed
 alter its character, but would never cease, and would blend
 with and affect the permanent phenomena. But with fluids
 and surfaces as they are, each such accidental disturbance will
 sooner or later be exhausted; and we may reasonably endea
 vour to find what minimum of motion is consistent with the
 existence of the permanent forces, and assume that this will
 be the average state. This Mr. Ferrel himself states. Now,
 as he takes no notice of tides, these permanent causes of
 motion are gravity and the unequal action of the sun's heat,
 according to season, latitude, and longitude (as fixing the time
 of day and night at each place), and height above the surface.
 And gravity of itself requires no permanent relative motion;
 for the ' Theory of the Figure of the Earth ' shows that, where
there is no inequality of temperature, the fluids can arrange
 themselves in a permanent shape adapted to a uniform rota
 tion round the earth's axis. There will be relative motion of
 the parts until this shape be reached; afterwards, relative rest.
Mr. Ferrel accordingly begins with supposing the heat does
vary according to latitude, longitude, and height, though he
takes no notice of seasons. But he is quite entitled to say the
complete problem is too difficult, and to simplify it down as
 far as he thinks it necessary. If he could give us a satisfac
tory solution on the supposition that the localized and moving
sun was replaced by a uniform equatorial ring of heat, I
suppose he would have performed a great feat. But he does
not start in any such way. He at first supposes the tempe
rature to vary somehow: tor aught that appears in his formula,
the torrid zone might be the coolest, and the polar regions the
warmest portions of the earth, and the air hotter 7 miles high
than at the surface. But when he begins to get results
(Sect. II.), he first supposes temperature to vary only with
latitude, allowing no difference for height, and finally " sup
poses the density," and of course the temperature with it,
   to be independent of the ¦ latitude." But this supposition
amounts, as I have already pointed out, to supposing that
there is no force at all to sustain any motion, and that conse
 quently there are no permanent tendencies in the winds—that
the average state is one of relative rest, the air arranging
itself in conformity to the Theory of the Figure of the Earth.
Thus all his work should be all to no purpose !
    2. But he fancies he does get results. And this is the
principal one:—"The fluid, however deep it may he at the Equator,
cannot exist at the Poles." And he draws a picture of the atmo-
spuere as it should be, banked up from somewhere near the
arctic circle towards the middle latitudes, but with a depression
                                02

 20               Mr. D. D. Heath on Mr. Ferrel's
 about the equator. Is this one of the results which pleaso
  Dr. Haughton as conformable to facts ?
     Some other curious results might be deduced from his nu
 merical formulas; but I will not dwell on them. Mr. Ferrel
  himself is conscious that all this is not very like nature, and
  so suggests " the resistance of the earth's surface " may con
  siderably modify the state of things. And having once called
  in aid this agency, like the god on the Athenian stage, ho is
  free from all restraint from formulas, and rearranges all his
  shapes and currents—for aught I know in fair conformity
  with facts, but with hardly any resemblance to his first picture.
  One would think that friction would rather hinder than help
  the air's spreading towards the poles.
     3. Another (a minor) point to observe is that, on commen
  cing his investigations, he does not prove, but at once assumes
  that the upward and downward motions of the air, due to
  changes of temperature, which I suppose undoubtedly play a
 large part in these phenomena, are themselves everywhere
 insensible as wind.
    4. I should mention that in his Fourth Section, long after he
 has deduced these results from the supposition of absolute
 uniformity of temperature, he does make a supposition of its
 varying with latitude ; and from this, combined with deduc
 tions from barometrical observations, he draws some inferences
 as to the strength of the average east or west components of
 the wind at different places and different heights. How near
 they may be to actual fact I do not know ; but I must warn
 my readers (not to go into more abstruse criticisms) that, no
 doubt from mere inadvertence, he works on the supposition
 that the hotter the air the smaller the pressure for a given
 density*, and, moreover, will not allow that the variation of
 temperature with tho height of the strata can " produce any
 sensible effect" on the difference of velocity of the wind at
 different heights.
    I hope I have, so far, succeeded in showing to those I have
in view that they had better trust to the old text-books than
to Mr. Ferrel, as far as fundamental principles are concerned,
though I dare say his store of facts may be greater. I will
now say a few words about his use of his mathematical tools.
    Putting P for pressure, k for density, and fi for the gravity
potential, he begins, as Laplace and Airy do, with the equa
tions in fixed rectangular coordinates          + ^ + - 4— = 0,

   * He puts * (density) — aP. and then supposes a. to vary directly as
the "absolute temperature," usually written (-

and so on, making the trae remark that, "putting P = 0,
they are the equations to a projectile."
    And he might have observed that (assuming symmetry
round the axis of rotation) these equations are the same
whether the earth is revolving or not, and that, when we
put P = 0, we get the path of the projectile in fixed space the
same for a stone or for the moon.
   He then, as Laplace and Airy do, transforms the equations
for polar coordinates. And if he and they retained, for a
while, to for the fixed celestial longitude, we should have
equations equally independent of rotation. Writing —g for
j—, they would be

But when we put m=nt + <f>, we get equations adapted to a
terrestrial, revolving meridian. And when we make n = the
actual angular rotation, and suppose the figure of the earth,
with the undisturbed sea and atmosphere, such as are adapted
for keeping the whole system in relative rest (see Airy, para
graph 79), then we can separate what belongs to the undis
turbed system and what to the motions, shapes, and pressures
arising from the extraneous forces (here those due to change
of temperature). And then the terms in question make their
appearance. Mr. Ferrel makes, substantially, the same sim
plifications which Laplace and Airy make in the Tidal theory.
They do not seem quite so legitimate hero*, where there is no
a priori ground for supposing the motions very small ; but I
am not quarrelling with this. His next, his first original
step is to lay it down that " For a stratum of equal pressure
P is constant, and hence -rw =0 and -r-r =0 ;" and of course,
                             do            axp
                             c/P
by parity of reasoning, — = 0. And all his formulas, I be
lieve without exception, till he comes to those in the Fourth

as regards tidal motion near the poles.

Section, where he connects pressure and wind, are derived from
these equations ! He gives no equation of continuity. And
in truth ho does not want it. For his equations, as he had
himself begun with observing, are the equations to the motion
of a free projectile, not of a continuous fluid.
   Or, rather, this is what they would have been but for his
fantastic treatment of them. Taking the case of an elastic
fluid, he puts k=<xP (in connexion with which I have men
tioned the blunder he subsequently' makes); and then he
                                                      1 (IP

without attempting to prove that it is a complete differential ;
and then he asserts that P=H — ^gadr, or say H + K ; and
then he applies his proposition as to the consequence of making
 P constant, and gets his wonder-working equations
in which, moreover, we find that the r which maybe involved
in o, and so in K, is treated as a function of 6 and of $ in the
differentiation, though 6 and <j> are not treated as similarly
 interdependent.
    I think this is a sufficient specimen of Mr. Ferrel's way of
 dealing with symbols as soon as be leaves the beaten track,
 and that no one need attempt to follow him further.

    Postscript.—Just as I was about to send this communication
 to the Philosophical Magazine I became acquainted with Mr.
 Scott's 'Elementary- Meteorology;' and I find from a passage
 in it that my warning against the misleading phraseology of
 the "old text-book," as quoted from Mr. Ferrel, is by no
 means superfluous. After explaining how the heated surfaces
 in the equatorial regions must cause an overflow of rarefied
 air northward and southward, he goes on (p. 241):—"As the
 form oi the earth is spherical, the circumference of the equator,
 a great circle, exceeds that of the smaller circles of latitude,
 which gradually diminish to a point at the pole. The men

                 On Metal Microphones in vacuo.                 23
 dians therefore converge as the latitude increases ; and the air,
flowing polewards, is moving in a bed continually becoming
 narrower and narrower, and is finally forced down to the sur
face of the earth long before the pole is reached."
   I do not understand this process of " forcing down." But
this description of the air racing and crowding towards the
pole is entirely imaginary. A mass of air, or anything else,
pressed or impelled northwards in the equatorial regions is
not in the least tending towards the pole, but does begin to
move in a great circle slightly inclined to the equator. I am
no meteorologist ; but I presume that the northward motion is
reinforced while it still moves in hot regions ; and so the
great circle in which the motion is supposed to take place may
become more and more divergent ; and the northward motion
may be sensible up to the latitudes of 30° or 40° mentioned
by Mr. Scott. But a general flow of air in the upper regions
from west to east within a certain tropical belt is all that I can
infer from the data.
   I have also found that Professor Everett, in his latest edi
tion of the ' Natural Philosophy/ at p. 525 accepts Mr. Ferrel's
theory of the Conservation of Areas, and at p. 527 refers to
Mr. Ferrel's paper of 1860 as " the most complete exposition
we have seen of the general atmospheric circulation."
               IV. On Metal Microphones in vacuo.
                   By J. Munro, A.S.T.E.*
THE consideration that a metal microphone would not
       oxidize to any serious extent in a vacuum, and also a
desire to see how it would operate in exhausted air, led me to
construct the apparatus illustrated below.
                     T
   It consists of a tubular bulb of glass, M, into which the
                 • Communicated by the Author.

24                On Metal Microphones in vacuo.
microphone is sealed by means of electrodes of stout pla
tinum wire, g, g, g . The two wires g, g have a plate or strip
of iron-wire gauze, of about 80 meshes to the lineal inch,
stretched tightly between them. This gauze forms the fixed
contact of the microphone. The movable contact is formed of
a smaller square of similar gauze hung or hinged on the third
electrode, g', in such a manner that it rests lightly against the
fixed piece behind. This metal piece is so light that it forms
a microphonic contact with the fixed piece below ; and when
a circuit is made by a battery (B) and a telephone (T) through
the gauze, the ticking of a watch, 10, laid on the base-board is
heard in the telephone.
    The sensitiveness of the microphone is increased by bring
ing up the pole of a magnet in front 0/ the movable piece so
as to lighten the pressure of that piece on the fixed plate
 behind, and tend to draw, by the inductive attraction of the
 pole upon the iron, the movable piece away from the piece on
 which it rests. I have not been able to ascertain whether the
 movable piece is actually separated from the back piece by
 the approaching magnet, because in the case of metals, when
 the microphonic contacts are separated by an extremely minute
 space, the current is interrupted, whereas in the case of a car
 bon microphone Mr. Stroh has observed an actual separa
 tion of the contact-points by means of a microscope, whilst
 the current continued to flow and the microphone to act. It
 is certain, however, that as the pole of the magnet is gradually
 brought nearer to the movable gauze the ticking of the watch
 becomes gradually louder and better defined, as if the contact-
 points were able to vibrate in a freer manner and with a longer
 range. At last there comes a point at which the sonorous
 current, which had evidently increased till then, suddenly
 fails, and a sharp click in the telephone announces the fact that
 the electric flow is interrupted.
     If, on the other hand, the pole of the magnet be brought up
 behind the fixed gauze, the sound in the telephone dies off,
  apparently because the movable gauze is pulled by its attrac
  tion into closer contact with the fixed piece behind.
     On exhausting this bulb with a mercury-pump of the im
  proved kind used for making electric incandescence lamps,
  the ticking of the watch becomes singularly clear and metallic
  in quality, the very ring of the hair-spring seeming to be
  audible. In fact a vacuum microphone of this kind is pecu
  liarly sensitive; and the effect appears to be due, in part at
  least, to the rarity of the air within the bulb. Another form
  of the instrument, having loose iron grains contained in a
  vacuum-bulb between two electrodes of platinum, exhibits the

same clearness of tone which distinguishes the same arrange-
ment in air at the ordinary pressure from that in a vacuum.
The degree of vacuum existing in the hulbs is that of the usual
incandescence lamp, or about one millionth of an atmosphere.
   It might be thought from M. Edlund's researches, recently
referred to in the Philosophical Magazine, that polarization of
the metal contacts would prevent the microphonic action in
vacuo; but this is evidently not the case.

133. TN the course of the series of experiments partly de-
       JL scribed in Parts V. and VI. a large number of
observations have been made with various cells after Clark's
construction (Proc. Roy. Soc. xx. p. 444), in all cases com
pared with one another and with other cells by means of the
quadrant-electrometer only, so that they never generated any
current other than the minute leakage current through the
not mathematically absolutely insulating materials between
their poles.
    In some instances the mercurous sulphate was purchased
(from Messrs. Hopkin and Williams), and was well washed
before use by numerous boilings with distilled water and de-
cantations. In other cases the mercurous sulphate was pre
pared by heating twice-distilled mercury (previously purified
by nitric acid) with pure sulphuric acid at as low a tempera
ture as possible consistent with any action taking place, and
 thoroughly washing the resulting sulphate by repeatedly boil
 ing with distilled water and decantation. The action was
never allowed to go on until more than a fraction of the mer
cury used was converted into sulphate, in order to reduce the
amount of mercuric sulphate formed to a minimum.
    The cells were made out of pieces of ordinary combustion-
tubing (selected on account of the absence of lead in the glass)

  26 Messrs. Wright and Thompson on the Determination of
  drawn out before the blowpipe into the U-shape represented
  on about two thirds scale in the cut (fig. 1). The glass being
 perfectly dry and hot, pure recently-boiled
 still hot mercury was poured into them so
 as to form a layer about half an inch (10
 to 15 millimetres) deep, a; on the top of
 this was then poured a boiling paste of
 thoroughly well-washed mercurous-sulphate
 and zinc-sulphate solution, containing so
 much of the latter salt as to be slightly su
 persaturated when cold, so as to crystallize
 on standing. It was found convenient to
 make the paste not too thick, and to let the
 solid matter subside in the cell, the su
 pernatant comparatively clear fluid being
 sucked out by a clean pipette, so as
 finally to leave on the top of the mercury
 a layer of particles of mercurous sulphate wetted with zinc-
 sulphate solution some 15 to 20 millimetres deep, b. Pieces
 of zinc rod (cast in glass tubes from pure metal fused in a
 porcelain crucible), well brightened by a file that had never
touched any other metal, were then placed in the cells so as
 to clip into the paste some 4 or 5 millimetres, and project out
of it about twice as much, c. The zincs were kept from falling
by pieces of cork, d, cut as represented in fig. 2, and pre
viously immersed in hot paraffin-wax so as to expel -p^ 2
air and moisture ; to the ends projecting from the
paste were previously soldered copper wires, e.
Melted paraffin-wax was then poured into the cell
so that all air was expelled, rising through the
perforations in the edges of the cork disks, and so that
the upper two thirds of the zinc and the soldering were
completely covered,/. Finally, a piece of platinum wire, g, or
a strip of foil was passed down the narrow limb of the cell so as
to make contact with the mercury : it was found convenient
to amalgamate the tip of the platinum by moistening it and
immersing it in freshly made sodium amalgam, all sodium
being removed from the adherent film of mercury by subse
quent immersion in water for some hours. The cells thus
prepared, being wanted for use only and not being required
to be externally well finished, were not mounted in the neat
brass cases with ebonite tops and binding-screws usually em
ployed, but were simply fixed in a beaker, or any other
convenient holder, by pouring in melted paraffin-wax around
them. When used in connexion with the electrometer, the
copper wire soldered to the zinc and a similar wire soldered

       Chemical Affinity in terms of Electromotive Force.     27
to the strip of platinum (and secured by a turn round the
upper end of the narrow limb and a drop of sealing-wax)
were bent over so as to dip into mercury-cups, a number of
which were arranged in the arc of a circle round two others,
like those figured in Part V. ; so that any consecutive pair
of cups could at will be connected with the electrometer by
the double switch.
   Either through a natural repulsion between bright zinc and
the mercurous-sulphate paste, or through the formation of a
faint film of grease &c. on the zinc from the file used to
brighten it, it sometimes happened that the cell when finished
would not work, contact not existing between the zinc and
paste. It was found that this never occurred when the
brightened zincs were washed successivel}' with ether, alcohol,
and saturated zinc-sulphate solution just before immersion in
the paste.
    134. On comparing together a moderately large number of
 cells (upwards of fifty) thus prepared with different specimens
 of mercurous sulphate, readings being taken two or three
 times a week for some three months, the following results
 were obtained :—A slight rise in E.M.F. was often observed
 during the first few days after construction ; but at the end
 of a week at most the values became constant, and remained so
 (the temperature being constant) for long periods of time. The
 maximum variations observed between the average results of
 the series of observations for any two given cells were slightly
 less than that found to exist by Clark (whose highest and
 lowest values are respectively 1-4651 and 1*4517 volt, giving
 a difference of 0134 volt, or upwards of 09 percent.). Taking
 the average of the whole set as 10O00, the maximum variation
 between two single cells did not exceed '010 volt, or 0-7 per
 cent., each cell possessing a value lying between 1)9-G5 and
 10O35. Even amongst cells set up at the same time from
 absolutely the same materials, extreme differences of as much
 as O005 volt = 0-35 per cent, were sometimes observed,
 although usually the difference did not exceed "002 or *003
 volt and was frequently almost inappreciable.
     Much greater differences, however, were found to exist
 when the zinc-sulphate solution was not completely saturated
 with that salt, the variation produced being of this kind, that
 the weaker the solution the higher the E.M.F. of the cell, the
 difference being approximately proportionate to the amount
 of dilution, .and amounting to upwards of 2*0 per cent, of the
 value when considerably dilute zinc-sulphate solution was
 used. The details of these observations will be discussed in a
 future paper, along with those of similar experiments made

28 Messrs. Wright and Thompson on the Determination of
with other cells. It may, however, be here noticed that, so
long as a cell containing unsaturated zinc-sulphate solution was
protected against concentration by evaporation, and was only
used in connexion with a quadrant-electrometer, its indica
tions remained perfectly constant for many months (the tem
perature being the same), precisely as was found with cells
set up with saturated zinc-sulphate solution.
      Effect of Dissolved Air on the E.M.F. of Clark's Cell.
    135. Two series of experiments were made with the object
of finding out how far the boiling of the mercurous-sulphate
paste (as recommended by Clark) in order to remove dissolved
air is essential. In one series a number of cells were set up,
using fully aerated zinc-sulphate solution and unboiled mer
cury (exposed to the air under a glass shade for several days
since preparation and distillation respectively); in the other
the paste was boiled in a Sprengel vacuum produced in the
cell itself for some time, the • cell being then hermetically
sealed, so as to reduce the amount of residual air to a mini
mum. In each case the average E.M.F. of the combination was
 sewtibly identical with that of an average ordinary Clark- cell
 prepared as above described and containing zinc-sulphate solu
 tion of the same strength as that contained in the combination.
    In order to prepare these hermetically-sealed cells a rather
 troublesome process was employed. First a piece of glass
 tubing, about 10 or 12 niillim. in bore, was blown into a
 Y- shape, and the two limbs of the Y drawn out as represented
 in fig. 3; a zinc rod was then cast so that a thin platinum wire
 was imbedded in one end ; this zinc rod was brightened and
          Fig. 8.       Fig. 4.             Fig. 5.
 sealed up on the tube so that the platinum wire projected
 (fig. 4, a). By the aid of a glass funnel with a flexible capil

      Chemical Affinity in terms of Electromot ive Force.      2!)
 lary stem (made by drawing out a piece of tubing boforo the
 blowpipe) paraffin-wax was introduced into the sealod-up limb
 so as to cover up completely the platinum wire and lower half
 of the zinc, leaving the other half exposed, b. In a similar
 way, recently boiled mercury was run into the other limb,
 previously sealed up with a second platinum wire passing
 through the glass, c. The stem of the inverted Y-tube was
 then carefully drawn out before the blowpipe (fig. 5, in), and
 connected by means of a short piece of india-rubber tubing, «,
 with the end of a glass tubo projecting from the little flask, p,
 containing mercurous sulphate paste, and connected with the
 Sprengel pump. When a fairly good vacuum was obtained,
 the paste was made to boil by applying a very gentle heat ;
 after about half an hour's boiling (the pump being at work
 the whole time) the connexion between the pump and flask
 was suddenly severed, when the sudden access of atmospheric
 pressure drove the paste iuto the cell, completely filling it :
 the pump was then again connected, and the boiling carried
 out again in the cell itself, and so on as before. Finally, by
 means of a blowpipe the drawn-out stem was sealed at in. To
 prevent the paste blocking up this drawn-out part, it was found
necessary to use levigated particles of mercurous sulphate with
a large proportion of zinc-sulphate solution; so that ultimately
tho cell contained much moro fluid than solid matter. In
order to use the cell, copper wires were soldered to the plati
num wires projecting from the sealed ends of the inverted Y
and bent over so as to dip into mercury-cups, the Y being
either held by a clamp or imbedded in paraffin-wax, and of
course being never allowed to be upset or shaken up so that
the mercury could pass into the limb containing the zinc,
which is otherwise liable to occur and spoil tho cell.
   136. The following numbers may be quoted as illustrations
of the practical absence of any effect on the E.M.F. of the coll
caused by the presenco or otherwise of dissolved air. Tho
values cited aro the average readings, during a period of
several months, of a dozen cells set up with cold-saturated zinc-
sulphate solution well aerated, and not sealed up with melted
paraffin-wax, but only loosely corked to avoid entrance of
dust. Each cell during this period remained sensibly constant.
All the values are reduced to the average reading (taken as
10O00), during the same period, of a yet larger number of
cells prepared hot and sealed up precisely in accordance with
Clark's directions—this average reading being the standard
employed in the previous portions of these experiments, and
especially in Parts V. and VI.

   Precisely analogous figures were obtained with several
vacuum-prepared cells, no one of which gave a value outside
of the limits 99-7 and 10O3, L e. outside of the limits of fluc
tuation of tho ordinary Clark's cells compared with them.
On opening one of these vacuum-cells so as to admit air, a
distinct fall in E.M.F., amounting to 025 volt, was observed ;
this behaviour, however, was not shown by other similar cells
on opening.
   Influence of Mercuric Sulphate in the Mercurous Sulphate.
   137. However carefully the mercurous sulphate may be
prepared, it is almost impossible to obtain it without some
admixture of mercuric sulphate. During the boiling and wash
ing by decantation this latter becomes a basic salt, the so-called
" turpeth mineral," which possesses a bright yellow tint, and
communicates to the mercurous sulphate a more or less pro
nounced yellowish tinge. In order to see how far the presence
of varying quantities of this compound might possibly affect
the E.M.F. of Clark's cell, several cells were set up in tho
same way as the hot-prepared cells described above, but using
turpeth mineral only instead of mercurous sulphate. Two
samples of turpeth mineral were employed: —one purchased
(from Messrs. Hopkin and Williams), and well washed by
boiling up many times with water and decantation before use;
the otier prepared byr boiling mercury with a largo excess of
pure sulphuric acid, evaporating off most of tho acid (which
process converts all mercurous sulphate present into mercuric),
adding to a large bulk of boiling water and washing many
times the yellow heavy powder formed, by boiling up witli
water and decanting, so as to remove all traces of free sul
phuric acid, and of tho soluble acid mercuric sulphate also

formed. On taking a long series of readings of these cells, it
was found that whilst the B.M.F. was, when the cell was
newly set up, close to that of an average mercurous-sulphate
cell, on standing a few days a distinct fall was observable,
which went on progressively until, after some weeks, a dimi
nution in the E.M.F. of between 3 and 4 per cent, was
brought about, after which the fall ceased or became very
 languid. Thus the following average readings were obtained
as before, the average E.M.F. of the hot-prepared cells con
 taining saturated zinc-sulphate solution being taken as 100
 when at the same temperature as the cells examined: cells A,
 B, C, and D were set up simultaneously with turpeth mineral
 prepared by ourselves ; cells E and F simultaneously with
 the purchased substance. The zinc, zinc sulphate, and mer
 cury used were the same as those used for the hot-prepared
 cells. Notwithstanding, however, that all the cells wero as
 alike as possible, yet the rate of fall during the first few weeks
 was by no means identical.

     It is evident from these figures that the effect of the pre
  sence of turpeth mineral in the mercurous sulphate used for
  Clark's cells is in the direction of decreasing the value ; but
  inasmuch as the decrease is progressive, whilst no such altera
  tion was observed in the Clark's cells examined, at any rate
  during several months after construction, it appears doubtful
  whether the variations in the E.M.F. of different Clark's cells
  set up at various times can be attributed to this cause.
                       Permanence of Clark's Cells.
     138. A number of cells prepared in various ways (paste
  boiled and cells sealed with paraffin-wax; paste boiled in vacuo
  and cells hermetically sealed ; set up with saturated zinc-sul
  phate solution, or with weaker solutions ) were kept for periods
  of time ranging from a few months to two or three years, and

 32 Messrs. Wright and Thompson on the Determination of
 chocked against one another from time to time, or compared
 with Daniell cells set up as described in Part V., with amal
 gamated pure zinc and electro-copper plates, and pure zinc-
 and copper-sulphate solutions of the same molecular strength*.
 No permanent changes in the values were observed (outside
 of the limit of the errors of observation) in the case of those
 cells which were so well sealed that neither evaporation took
place, nor passage outwards of the fluid by capillary action
 through cracks in the sealing material. Vacuum-cells were
 thus kept unchanged for upwards of two years, as also were
 some normal Clark cells that were completely imbedded in
 paraffin-wax. In several cases, however, where the cells were
 not completely imbedded, but were only sealed up by a plug
 of paraffin-wax poured in at first round the zinc plate and the
 cork &c. supporting it, cracks formed sooner or later either in
 the paraffin-wax itself or between the glass and the wax, so
 that the fluid passed out through the cracks by capillary action
 and formed an efflorescence outside the cell. In some cases
 the action went on to such an extent as to leave the zinc
 wholly exposed, no contact finally existing between it and the
 paste : such cells were of course utterly spoilt. In other in
 stances the zinc was only partially bared : in these cases the
 E.M.F. of the cell remained almost unaltered when saturated
 zinc-sulphate solution was employed in the first instance, but
 was lessened when unsaturated solution was originally used,
 owing to the evaporation and concentration which went on
 simultaneously with the capillary action, or subsequently to
 the commencement thereof. For example, two ceils set up
    * A large number of observations on the E.M.F. of Daniell cells have
shown that, when proper precautions are taken in .setting' up the cells, a
 very considerable degree of constancy in value is attainable, so that such
 cells serve as good practical standards ; but that if these precautions are
 neglected, variations amounting to 5 per cent., and even more, may ensue.
 The essential precautions are :—lirst, that pure solutions of zinc and copper
 sulphates containing no free acid should be used, each being of the same
 molecular strength (j. e. practically of the same specific gravity ; conve
 niently the molecular strength may be near to MSO,, 5011,0) ; secondly,
 that the solutions should be in separate vessels, united when required by
an inverted U-tube, the mouths of which are covered with thin bladder
(Raoult's form of cell) ; thirdly, that the plates should be pure zinc amal
gamated with pure mercury, and copper recently electro-deposited from
pure sulphate solution—the wires serving as electrodes, and theirjunctions
with the plates beiug coated with gutta-percha, so that no part of the plate
or wire is simultaneously in contact with both fluid and atmosphere; and
fourthly, that, if used to generate a current, the current-density must not
exceed some 5 microamperes per square centimetre, so that with plates
exposing 20 square centimetres the total resistance in circuit must be at.
lead 10,000 ohms, if exposing 10 square centimetres 20,000 ohms, and
so on.

        Chemical Affinity in terms of Electromotive Force.    33
with zinc-sulphate solution about two thirds saturated gave
the values 10r07 and 10O92 during the first few weeks
after construction ; cracks then formed, and efflorescence and
evaporation took place, so that the zincs became partially
bared, during which time the electromotive forces gradually
sank. After some months the paste became covered with crys
tals of zinc sulphate, indicating that the residual solution
moistening the mercurous sulphate was saturated: the elec
tromotive forces were then 10O13 and 99'73 respectively,
which values were subsequently retained almost constant for
several months longer, notwithstanding that a considerable
portion of each zinc rod was out of the paste and exposed
to the air.
   A number of observations made with cells containing zinc
rods partlj- immersed in the paste and partly exposed to the
air, gave sensibly the same average result as another series of
observations made with the same cells when the zinc rods were
pushed down so as to be wholly immersed (the upper end and
the wire serving as electrode being protected from contact
with the paste by gutta-percha).
   It is specially to be noticed, in connexion with the question
of the permanence of Clark's cells, that the cells experimented
with were only used in connexion with the quadrant-electro
meter; so that from first to last they never generated any con
tinuous current, nor had any current (Jiowever small) sent
through in the inverse direction—conditions impossible com
pletely to realize in practice when working by the " method
of opposition " or with the potentiometer.
      Effect of Temperature on the E.M.F. of Clark's Cell.
    139. According to Clark (Proc. Boy. Soc. xx. p. 444), the
E.M.F. of a hot-prepared mercurous zinc-sulphate cell dimi
nishes at an approximately constant rate of O06 per cent, per
degree rise in temperature between 150,5 and 100° ; he states,
however, that this figure might be verified with advantage.
A number of observations having indicated, as a preliminary
result, that this value is considerably too high between the
temperature-range (10° to 25°) most frequently obtaining in
practice, and that fairly constant results are given with dif
 ferent cells, the following experiments were made in order to
 determine more exactly the mean coefficient of alteration per
 degree between these temperature-limits, with the result of
 showing that, instead of Clark's number (0*0006) being de
 duced, a value but little above two thirds of this figure was
 obtained, viz. '000411, as the average of ten experiments with
 five cells.
    Phil. Mag. S. 5. Vol. 16. No. 97. July 1883,           D

34    Messrs. Wright and Thompson on the Determination of
   Let the E.M.F. of a given cell, taken temporarily as a
standard, be 1 at temperature tj (near to 15°), and let the
E.M.F. of a second cell compared therewith be al when the
cell compared is at a temperature t^, the standard being still
at ti. In another experiment, when the standard is at a tem
perature t3 not far from t\, let the E.M.F. of the second cell
be cij, this cell being at the temperature t4. Now let x be the
mean coefficient of variation for 1° between <s and *4 for the
second cell, whilst a/ is the analogous coefficient between f,
and t3 for the temporary standard. Then, since the E.M.F. of
the standard at <j is unity, its E.M.F. at t3 is 1 — (<3 —
whence the E.M.F. of the second cell at tt is Oj -jl — (t3— t{)x>\ .
The E.M.F. of this second cell at <4, however, is also
                         a1\l—(t4—tt)x\ ;
so that
   Now, from Clark's experiments and certain preliminary ob
servations made by ourselves, it results that x is approximately
equal to x1 \ whilst if the temperatures are suitably chosen so
that the mean of tx and <3 is sensibly the same as the mean of
t2 and t4, it must result that the difference between x and at
is very small ; and, finally, if tx and t3 differ but little in com
parison with the difference between t3 and tA, any errors in
the valuation of a? will be but small relatively. Hence, taking
x=x'} it results that
                       _         a-i — aj
                      ~ ai(U—ti)—a2{t3-t1)'
In order, then, to determine x, it is only necessary to determine
the relative readings of two cells, first when one is at ti
and the other at t2 (say at 15° and 0° respectively), and
secondly when the first is at t3 and the second at <4 (say at
14° and 30° respectively), the temperatures being such that
ti + t3 approximately equals <2 + <4 (as in the case of the sup
posed numbers).
   To carry out this principle two water-jacketed metal cham
bers were constructed, furnished with delicate thermometers
reading to 0o,01 C, and containing respectively the sets of
cells to be compared, the poles of the cells being connected
with the mercury-cup arrangement applied to the electro
meter by means of covered wires passing through narrow
glass tubes fixed in the double lids of the chambers, so that
no conducting contact between the wires themselves or
between the wires and lids &c. was possible. One of the
water-jackets was filled with water at near 15°, the other

         Chemical Affinity in terms of Electromotive Force.    35
 with water either at or near 0° or at or near 30°, as the
 case might be ; the masses of fluid (agitated from time to
time with a peculiar stirrer) were so largo that the tempera
ture of the chamber-spaces varied but little during the pro
 gress of the series of readings ultimately made. The moan
temperatures indicated by the thermometers during the series
were taken as the mean temperatures of the cells (placed in
the chambers some time before the readings were commenced,
so as to attain sensibly the temperatures of the chamber-spaces).
The readings were carried out in systematic order; so that the
average reading for each cell should be exactly comparable
with that of any other, notwithstanding any possible running-
down of the electrometer-scale during the progress of the
readings. For instance, if in the first chamber two cells (A
and B) were placed, and in the second two others (C and D),
the readings were alternately taken in the orders A, B, C, D
and D, C, B, A, or C, D, A, B and B, A, D, C ; so that the
average reading for each cell was identical with that which
would have been observed had the electrometer-scale value
been absolutely constant throughout at its mean value (the
actual variation of the electrometer-scale during any set of
readings was considerably under 1 per cent.).
   Thus, for instance, the following numbers were obtained in
two experiments, in each of which the same two cells A and B
were placed in the first chamber, and the same two (C and D)
in the second:—

              On the Work done during Electrolysis.
   140. The experiments described in the previous portions of
these researches have shown that, when a current is passed
through an electrolytic cell, the amount of energy expended
(positively or negatively) during the passage in performing a
given amount of chemical work (apart from that transformed
into heat in consequence of the resistance proper of the cell in
accordance with Joule's law) is not constant, but increases
algebraically with the current-density, in such wise that when
the ce11 is an ordinary decomposing cell (e. g. a voltameter)
the " counter electromotive force " of the cell increases in
arithmetical value with the current-density, whilst when the
cells is an electromotor (i. e. such a cell as to yield a negative
 counter E.M.F.), the arithmetical value of the negative counter
 E.M.F. (i. e. the direct E.M.F. of the cell) decreases with the
 current-density. The extra work done by a stronger current
 as compared with a weaker one in the former case, and the
 deficiency of work corresponding with the fall in direct E.M.F.
 in the latter case, make their appearance in the form of sen
 sible heat in the cell.
    Experiments have been published by Favre (vide Part I.
 §§14 and 15) which appear to show that certain forms of
electromotor-cells can generate currents capable of doing more
 work externally to the cell than corresponds with the net che
 mical action taking place, this extra work being gained at

        Chemical Affinity in terms of Electromotive Force.             73
the expense of the sensible heat of the cell, which becomes
cooled by the passage of a current of too small magnitude to
generate, in accordance with Joule's law, sufficient heat in the
cell to overpower this cooling action. Inasmuch, however, as
the mercury-calorimeter was employed in these experiments
of Favre, whilst, from the nature of the case, but feeble cur
rents passed, so that the total amount of chemical action in a
given time could be but small, it seems not unlikely that an
excessively large probable error attends the numerical values
obtained. In point of fact, one of the cells found by Favre
to behave in this way was Grove's cell; and his results in this
repect are totally at variance with all other experiments on
the subject (compare H. F. Weber, Phil. Mag. 1878, v. p. 195),
leading to the conclusion that the supposed cooling action was
not a real effect, but simply the result of the accumulation of
experimental errors. In order to see whether this was also the
case with the other cells examined by Favre, the following
experiments were made.
    These other cells were simple voltaic couples of zinc and
platinum or cadmium and platinum immersed in dilute hydro
chloric acid ; the numbers obtained by Favre as the cooling
effects per gramme equivalent of metal dissolved were respec
tively 1051 and 1288 gramme-degrees, corresponding with
 •046 and "057 volt*. On the other hand, with dilute sulphuric
acid in lieu of hydrochloric, Favre found that no cooling action
 was traceable, but that the cells were always warmed by the
passage of a current. Now these results, if correct, must
imply that the E.M.F. of a zinc-platinum or a cadmium-
platinum cell, when generating only a minute current, is above
the value corresponding with the heat-development due to the
 net chemical action taking place when hydrochloric-acid solu
tion is the exciting fluid, and below that value when dilute
 sulphuric acid is used instead; i. e. the electromotive forces of
 cells containing dilute hydrochloric acid must be above '754
 and "388 volt respectively with zinc-platinum and cadmium-
 platinum couples, and the electromotive forces of cells con
 taining dilute sulphuric acid must be below "835 and "470 volt
 respectively with these same couples, these being the values
 in E.M.F. corresponding respectively with the heat-develop
 ments per gramme-equivalent in the reactions
    * For the sake of comparison .with the experiments described in the
 previous portions of these researches, the factor 4410 for converting
 gramme-degrees into volts is adhered to, notwithstanding that the balance
 of evidence now seems to indicate that the value of J hitherto assumed
 (42 megalergs) is somewhat too high, and that the B.A. unit of resistance
 is upwards of 1 percent, below its intended value, instead of being exact
 as hitherto assumed.

 ally developed by these four voltaic combinations are really
 above the calculated values in the first two cases and below in
 the second two instances, when the disturbing effects of dis
 solved air are eliminated, cells were set up like those described
 in § 85, and caused to generate feeble currents by employing
large external resistances. In all cases it was found that when
the errors due to dissolved air were eliminated and the read
 ings became constant, the E.M.F. actually developed invariably
fell short of the value corresponding with the net chemical action
 by an amount which increased with the current-density until
the reduction became a large fraction of the E.M.F. observed
 with the smallest possible densities. With hydrochloric-acid
 cells the deficiency was not so great in the first instance, and
    * These figures are deduced from Julius Thomsen's thermochemical
 data and the moan value for the heat of formation of water arrived at in
 § 31. Thomsen's values relate to the degree of dilution MC12, 400 HaO,
 and MSO„ 400 II, O. Some experiments made by us on the amounts of
 heat evolved on diluting stronger solutions of zinc and cadmium chlorides
 and sulphates indicate that these values require slight corrections for
 stronger solutions than those used by Thomsen; but the alterations thus
 produced in the net heat-development and in the E.M.F. corresponding
thereto is but small.

   In each of these experiments the plate-surface was con
stantly 8 square centimetres ; the hydrochloric-acid solution

40    Messrs. Wright and Thompson on the Determination of
was close to 2HCl,50H2O and 2HC1, 100 H20 in the first
and second experiments respectively, and the sulphuric-acid
H2 S04, 50 H2 0 and H2 S04, 100 H2 O in the third and fourth
experiments respectively. The zinc plates were amalgamated,
the cadmium ones not.
    142. The experiments described in Parts IV., V., and VI.
indicate that the amount of diminution brought about in the
E.M.F. of an electromotor (either a simple cell, or one after
Daniell's construction) by an increase in the current-density
may readily greatly exceed any possible effect due to the accu
mulation round the two plates of fluids of widely different
molecular strength, and, further, that, as a general rule, the
effect of diminishing the area of the plate on which the metal
is deposited is considerably greater than that of a similar
diminution in the area of the other plate, although this is not
invariably the case. It is hence evident that the chief source
of nonadjuvancy especially lies in the incomplete manifesta
tion as electricity of the energy due, after the elimination by
the action of the current of the deposited metal (or body
equivalent thereto) in the nascent form, to the subsequent
transformation thereof into the permanent form. Clearly the
 same kind of thing must be equally true for the other products
 of electrolysis evolved at the other electrode. Hence the reason
 why a less amount of non-adjuvancy is brought about at this
 side is presumably the greater amount of attraction exercised
 by the material of the electrode for the nascent product ("sul-
 phion" of Daniell in the case of cells containing sulphates) here
 evolved, owing to their opposite chemical characters, than is
 observable at the other electrode. Admitting this to bo so, it
 should result that the more oxidizable the metal dissolved (t. e.
 the greater the heat of formation of the compound produced
 by its solution), the less will be the amount of nonadjuvancy
 due to the incomplete conversion into electricity at this plate
 of the energy due to transformation of nascent into final
 products. The results of the experiments hitherto described,
 however, being complicated by the formation of solutions of
 different strengths around the two plates, are not sufficiently
 precise to show that, under given conditions, a zinc plate, for
 example, causes less nonadjuvancy than a cadmium one, and
  so on. Accordingly the following experiments on the point
 were made, the result of which is to show indisputably that
  the more oxidizable the metal the less the nonadjuvancy.
     An electrolytic cell was constructed, consisting of a wide
 glass tube closed by india-rubber bungs through which passed
 wires terminating interiorly in the plates to be experimented
 with, the opposed plate-surfaces being perpendicular to the

       Chemical Affinity in terms of Electromotive Force.       41
axis of the tube and therefore parallel to one another, and the
anterior portions of the plates and the wires being thickly-
coated with gutta-percha. The tube was then filled, for in
stance, with concentrated zinc-sulphate solution, with plates
of zinc at an accurately known distance apart, and was kept
at a temperature sensibly uniform. A series of currents of
varous strengths was then passed through the cell, and the
difference of potential subsisting between the plates deter
mined in each case. These values represented the numerical
values of e^ + CR, where «, is the counter E.M.F. set up during
the electrolysis, C the current, and Rthe resistance of the cell;
and from them the values of this expression for definite values
of C (50, 100, 200 microamperes, &c.) were readily calculated
by interpolation. The + zinc electrode was then removed,
and a copper plate exposing exactly the same area placed in
precisely the same position. The observations were then
repeated, the temperature being the same as before, and a
new series of values, e2 + CR, calculated, e2 being the counter
E.M.F. now set up for a given value of C. Since R is con
stant throughout, it is evident that the difference between the
two values for a given current obtained, first with a zinc, and
secondly with a copper + electrode, represents e2— ex. Now
necessarily both ex and e2 increase with the value of C in
accordance with the general law to that effect deduced from
all the previous observations (§ 133): but if it be true that a
less production of heat instead of electricity is brought about
when nascent sulphion is liberated in contact with zinc than
when in contact with copper, ex must increase less rapidly with
the current than e2, and hence the value of e2— «i must rise
with ilie current-strength. Precisely this result was observed
in every case: for example, the following numbers were ob
tained in a pair of sets of observations carried out as described,
the area of the plates being 0"50 square centim. throughout.

of e2—e1 with the current is afforded by the following series of
numbers obtained as the average results of several sets of
observations very carefully made—A with a bright zinc +
electrode, B with one of bright cadmium, C with one of
bright copper, and D with one of bright silver. In every case
the mean temperature was the sam« within two or three tenths
of a degree (varying from 170-55 to 170-9 throughout). In
the last case it was found that, whilst perfectly steady readings
could be obtained with current-strengths up to something like
"0007, with higher strengths this was no longer the case, silver
peroxide being apparently formed instead of silver sulphate.
In these experiments all the plates exposed an area of 1*5
square centim., the solution electrolyzed being a nearly satu
rated one of pure zinc sulphate, renewed for each series ; the
plates were about 5 centim. apart, the tube holding them being
3 centim. in internal diameter.

    Not only does the value of e2— e± increase with the current-
 density in every case, but, further, the rate of increase is
 greater when zinc is compared with silver than with copper,
and greater then than when compared with cadmium ; simi
larly the rate of increase with cadmium and silver is greater
 than with copper and silver, and so on. It is further notice
 able that in each case a value of e2—el with some particular
 current-strength is dedncible which is sensibly the same as
 the E.M.F. of a cell after Daniell's construction containing
the same metals and sulphate solutions of equal molecular
 strength ; so that in general it may be said that, for a current-
 density below a particular limit, the value of e2—e1 is less than
 that of the corresponding Daniell form of cell, whilst for a
 current-density above this limit it is greater.
    144. The following experiment seems to show that the sub
 stitution of dilute sulphuric acid for zinc-sulphate solution as
 the electrolyte makes no material difference in the end result,
 the — electrode being made of platinum, and the disturbing in
 fluence of dissolved air being eliminated. Two precisely similar
 U-tube cells (§ 85) were filled with recently boiled dilute sul
 phuric acid (11'5 grammes H2 S04 per 100 cubic centim.), and

44    Messrs. Wright and Thompson on the Determination oj
fitted with uniformly sized plates (8 square centim. total surface
in each case) at an equal distance asunder, so that the resistance
of the cell should be sensibly the same in each case. In the
first cell the plates were of zinc (amalgamated) and platinum,
and in the second of copper and platinum respectively; the
two were arranged in series with a couple of Leclanche cells,
so that the platinum plates were necessarily the — electrodes;
a large variable resistance being included in the circuit, the
current could be regulated at pleasure. A current of some
fifty microamperes being sent through for three days, the
readings became steady when all the dissolved air around the
platinum plates was eliminated; the current was then varied
from time to time, and a series of readings of the potential-
difference between each pair of plates taken. By interpola

the average values.

   The value of c2— ex consequently increases with the current-
 density as before. The numerical values observed in this expe
 riment are somewhat lower than those found in the experi
 ments above described, as might be expected, since the largest
 current-density employed in this case, being only 10 micro
 amperes per square centim., is considerably below the smallest
 cited in the previous observations, in the last of which a mini
 mum current of '00002 C.G.S. units (or 200 microamperes)
 was employed with plate-surfaces of 1"5 square centim., giving
 a density of 133'3 microamperes per square centim., in which
 case the value of e3— ex was 1'040; whilst in the former expe
 riments a minimum current of "000005 C.G-.S. unit (50 micro
 amperes) was employed with a plate-surface of '50 square
 centim., giving a density of 100 microamperes per square
 centim., when values of from 1*054 to 1'065 were observed.
    145. Some experiments were also made with analogous
 pairs of cells in which the + electrodes were made of metals
not attacked by the nascent products arising from the electro
lysis of sulphates, e. g. gold and platinum. In these instances
 it was found that platinum behaved in reference to gold just

as a more readily to a less readily oxidizable metal, this result
being evidently brought about by the superior surface con-

greater proportion of the energy due to the transformation
of the nascent into the firal products of electrolysis evolved
at the + electrode becomes adjuvant. For instance, the fol
lowing numbers were obtained with a pair of precisely similar
cells containing the same copper-sulphate solution and copper

    Even with the lowest current-density and with platinum as
 + electrode the total amount of nonadjuvancy was here con
siderable ; for the E.M.F. corresponding with the net che
mical action i<» only 1-234 volt (£[Cu, 0, S03aq] = 27,980
gramme-degrees = 1-234 volt); and the minimum difference of
potential set up, after correction for the resistance of the cell
 (i. e. the counter E.M.F. set up, or the value of the term e in
the expression E = e + CR), exceeds 1-490, since the term CR
 in this case was much ^ss than "010 volt.
    In just the same kind of way, when platinum and gold were
 respectively nade the — electrodes in similar pairs of cells
 containing dilute sulphuric acid and a constant oxidizable +
 electrode, the superior surface condensing-power possessed by
 platinum caused a less degree of nonadjuvancy during the
 transformation of nascent into free hydrogen. Thus, for
 example, the following numbers were obtained with a copper
  + electrode and acid containing 10 per cent, of H2 S04.

     Here again, even in the most favourable instance, with the
 smallest current-density and platinum as — electrode, a con-
 derable amount of nonadjuvancy subsisted ; for the value of
 CR in this case was not greater than *001; so that the mini
 mum counter E.M.F. set up was at least -448 volt, whilst the
  E.M.F. corresponding to the net chemical action is only '270
 volt, the heat-development being per gramme equivalent

    It is hence evident, a fortiori, that when acidulated water is
 decomposed with two gold electrodes, the counter E.M.F. set
 up must be much greater for a given current-density than
 when two platinum electrodes are used, the deficiency in
 condensing-power being then manifest at both electrodes simul
 taneously. The experiments described in Part IV. § 90 have
 shown that this is the case.
    146. In addition to the experiments above described as
 examples, a large number of analogous observations have been
 made with varying kinds of electrolytic solutions and elec
 trodes, and with varying strengths of' solutions. The general
results of these experiments, so far as at present completed,
may be thus summarized.
    (1) When an electrolytic cell is of such a nature that the
counter E.M.F. set up is negative (i. e. when the cell is an
electromotor), it is always found that the E.M.F developed is
less the greater the density of the current generated. With very
small current-densities the E.M.F. has a maximum value
which in certain cases (e. g. Danioll's cell and the analogous
zinc-cadmium and cadmium-copper cells described in Part VI.)
is substantially identical with the E.M.F. corresponding with
the heat-development due to the net chemical action taking
place in the cell, i. e. with the E.M.F. representing the alge
braic sum of the chemical affinities involved. In certain
other cases (e. g. the zinc-silver, cadmium-silver, and copper-
silver cells described in Part VI.) the maximum E.M.F. de
veloped is sensibly below that due to the net chemical action.
   (2) Some kinds of combinations have been found to be
capable of existing which can develop a greater E.M.F. than
that due to the net chemical action (although the particular
cells described by Favro as possessing this property are not
really cases in point, Favre's results being due to experi
mental errors); amongst such combinations may be mentioned
several where lead is the metal dissolved, t. e. lead-copper cells

        Chemical Affinity in terms of Electromotive Force.             47
charged with solutions of acetates. It is noticeable that in
such cases Volta's law of summation holds, the sum of the
electromotive forces of two cells, one containing zinc and lead
and the other lead and copper, being equal to the E.M.F. of a
zinc-copper cell, the E.M.F. of the first cell being just as much
below the amount calculated from the heat-development as
that of the second is above the amount similarly calculated.
This class of cells is now undergoing careful examination,
and will be dealt with in a subsequent paper. Unfortunately,
Erogress in this direction during the last fifteen months has
 een greatly retarded by the refusal of the Administrators of
the Government Fund of £4000 to continue the grants by the
aid of which the previous portions of these researches have
mainly been made, on account of which circumstance nume
rous other points of interest that have cropped up have neces
sarily remained uninvestigated*.
   (3) When the electrolytic cell is not an electromotor, the
counter E.M.F. set up (positive) always increases in amount
with the current-density. When the + electrode is of such a
nature as to combine with the products of electrolysis evolved
thereat, other things being the same, the rate ofincrease is slower
the greater the chemical affinity between the nascent products
of electrolysis evolved at the + electrode and the material of
which that electrode is composed; i. e. the greater the affinity,
the less the degree of nonadjuvancy brought about at the +
electrode.
   (4) Whether the cell be an electromotor or not, there is
always (with currents not so small as to be practically infini
tesimal) a greater or less degree of nonadjuvancy brought
about at the — electrode, owing to the development of heat in
lieu of electricity during the transformation of nascent into
ultimate permanent products of electrolysis. In many cases
this source of nonadjuvancy decidedly predominates over that
at the + electrode.
    (5) The particular extent to which the nonadjuvancy reaches
at either electrode appears to be a complex function not only
of the chemical nature of the electrode, the physical conditions
of its surface, and the character of the nascent products of
electrolysis evolved thereat, but also of the temperature, and
the degree of concentration of the solution electrolyzed, and
   • Since the presentation to the Physical Society of Part VL of these
researches, a paper has appeared by F. Braun (Annalen der 1'hys. u. Chem.
xvi. p. 561), in which the author shows that various combinations exa
mined by him give electromotive forces sensibly the same as those calcu
lated from thermochemical data, whilst others fall short of, and some
exceed, the calculated values.

48     Dr. J. A. Fleming on a Phenomenon of Molecular
possibly of other conditions besides. Other things being
equal, it appears to be a general rule that the weaker the solu
tion, the greater the degree of nonadjuvancy. When a gas is
one of the permanent products of electrolysis at either elec
trode, the greater the surface condensing-power of the material
of which the electrode is composed, the less is the degree of non
adjuvancy.
VI. On a Phenomenon of Molecular Radiation in Incandescence
          Lamps. By J. A. Fleming, B.A., D.Sc*
NOT long ago a curious phenomenon came under my
        notice in connexion with the burning of Edison incan
descence lamps, which presents sufficient interest to warrant
my drawing the attention of physicists to it.
   As is well known, the carbon filament in the Edison lamp
is of a horse-shoe form. The two extremities of the loop are
clamped into small copper clamps on the ends of the platinum
wires, which are sealed through the glass. The ends of the
carbon loop are electroplated over with copper at the place
where they are connected to the clamp in order to make a

Meeting on May 26, 1883.

good contact. If this precaution is omitted, a loose contact
may be formed, the result of which will be a generation of
heat at that point.
   In the ordinary working the life-history of a carbon fila
ment is something as follows:—
   At some point or other the filament is probably thinner
than at other places. At this place there will be a greater
generation of heat and a higher temperature; volatilization of
the carbon ensues, and the vapour condenses on the sides of
the glass bulb, as far as I have observed, uniformly. If, how
ever, the point of greatest resistance occurs on the copper
clamp, then it is found that copper volatilizes and deposits on
the inside of the glass.
   Bat what is most curious is, that in this case an examina
tion of the glass envelope shows that there is a narrow line
along which no copper has been deposited. This is seen best
by holding the lamp up before the light and slowly turning it
round. In one particular position, easily found, it is best
seen. Now, on examining carefully the position of the line
of no deposit as compared with the position of the carbon fila
ment, it will be seen that it lies in the plane of the loop, and
on the opposite side to that nearest to which the break of the
loop has occurred. It is in fact a shadow of the loop.
   The conclusion which must be arrived at, then, is that the
copper molecules are shot off in straight lines; otherwise it is
impossible that there should be this line of no deposit.
   The most noticeable thing is, that it occurs only when the
deposition of copper takes place; I have never noticed it in
an ordinary carbon deposit.
   Hence there must be some essential difference between the
vaporization of the carbon and that of the copper. The car
bon deposit resembles more the condensation of a vapour and
is uniformly distributed ; but the copper deposit exhibits the
character of a molecular radiation or shower taking place from
a certain point.
   The whole phenomenon calls at once to mind the beautiful
researches of Mr. Crookes with vacuum-tubes. Here, how
ever, we are dealing not with an induction-coil discharge, but
with a comparatively low potential.
   I have never failed to see the effect in any lamp which has
had a deposition of copper on its interior.
   It is interesting to note how nearly the colour of transpa
rent copper resembles that of transparent gold. The simi
larity of the surface-colour of pure unoxidized copper and of
gold is accompanied by a near resemblance in colour of the
two metals in thin films.

VII. On the Crispations of Fluid resting upon a Vibrating Sup
   port. By Lord Rayleigh, D.C.L., F.R.S., Cavendish Pro
   fessor of Physics in the University of Cambridge*'.
IF a glass plate, held horizontally, and made to vibrate as
      for the production of Chladni's figures, be covered with
a thin layer of water or other mobile liquid, the phenomena
in question may be readily observed. Over those parts of the
plate which vibrate sensibly the surface of the liquid is ruffled
by minute waves, the degree of fineness increasing with the
frequency of vibration. The same crispations are observed on
the surface of liquid in a large wine-glass or finger-glass
which is caused to vibrate in the usual manner by carrying
the moistened finger round the circumference. AH that is
essential to the production of crispations is that a body of
liquid with a free surface be constrained to execute a vertical
vibration. It is indifferent whether the origin of the motion
be at the bottom, as in the first case, or, as in the second, be due
to the alternate advance and retreat of a lateral boundary, to
 accommodate itself to which the neighbouring surface must.
rise and_ fall.
           oil
    More than fifty years ago the nature of these vibrations was
examined by Faraday w ith great ingenuity and success. His
 results are recorded in an Appendix to a paper on a Peculiar
 Class of Acoustical Figures')", headed " On tho Forms and
 States assumed by Fluids in Contact with vibrating Elastic
 Surfaces." In more recent times Dr. L. Matthiessen has
 travelled over the same ground %, and on one very important
point has recorded an opinion in opposition to that of Faraday.
 In order more completely to satisfy myself, I have lately
 repeated most of Faraday's experiments, in somo cases with
 improved appliances, and have been able to add some further
 observations in support of the views adopted.
    Tho phenomenon to be examined is evidently presented in
 its simplest form when the motion of the vibrating horizontal
 plate on which tho liquid is spread is a simple up-and-down
 motion without rotation. To secure this, Faraday attached
 the plate to the centre of a strip of glass or lath of deal, sup
 ported at the nodes, and caused to vibrate by friction. In
 my experiments an iron bar was used about I metre long and
 •0004 metre thick (in the plane of vibration). The bar was
 supported horizontally at the nodes ; and to its centre a glass
 plate was attached by gutta-percha and carefully levelled.

     Crispations of Fluid resting upon a Vibrating Support.      51
  Tho vibrations of tho bar were maintained eloctromagnetically,
 as in tuning-fork interrupters, with the aid of an electro
 magnet placed under the centre, the circuit being made and
 broken at a mercury-cup by a dipper carried at one end of the
 bar. By calculation from the dimensions*, and without
 allowance for the load at the centre, the frequency of (com
 plete) vibration is 33. Comparisons with a standard tuning-
 fork gave more accurately for the actually loaded bar a fre
 quency of 31.
    The vibrating liquid standing upon the plate presents ap
 pearances which at first are rather difficult to interpret, and
 which vary a good deal with the nature of tho liquid in
 respect of transparency or opacity, and with the incidence of
 the light. The vibrations of the liquid, whether at the rate of
 31 per second, or, as in fact, at the rate of 15£ per second, are
 too quick to be followed by the eye ; and thus the effect ob
served is an average, due to the superposition of an indefinite
number of components corresponding to the various phases of
vibration.
    The motion of tho liquid consists of two sets of stationary
vibrations superposed, tho ridges and furrows of the two sets
being perpendicular to one another, and usually parallel to tho
edges of the (rectangular) plate. Confining our attention for
 the moment to one set of stationary waves, let us consider
 what appearance it may be oxpectod to present. At one
moment the ridges form a set of parallel and equidistant lines,
the interval being the wave-length. Midway between these
are the lines which represent at that moment the position of
the furrows. After the lapse of \ period, the surface is flat;
after another \ period, the ridges and furrows are again at
their maximum development, but the positions are exchanged.
Now, since only an average effoct can be perceived, it is clear
that no distinction can be recognized between the ridges and
the furrows, and that the observed effect must be periodic
within a distance equal to half a wave-length of the real
motion. If the liquid on the plate be rendered moderately
opaque by addition of aniline blue, and be seen by diffused
transmitted light, the lines of ridge and furrow will appear
bright in comparison with tho intermediate nodal lines where
the normal depth is preserved throughout the vibration. Tho
gain of light when the thickness is small will, in accordance
with the law of absorption, outweigh the loss of light which
occurs half a period later when the furrow is replaced by a
ridge.
   The actual phenomenon is more complicated in consequence

lines represent the ridges, and the thin lines the furrows, of
the two systems at a moment of maximum excursion. . One
quarter period later the surface is flat, and one half a period
later the ridges and furrows arc interchanged. The places of
maximum elevation and depression are the intersections of the
 thick lines and of the thin lines, not distinguishable by ordi
 nary vision ; and these regions will appear like holes in the
 sheet of colour. The nodal lines, where the normal depth of
 colour is preserved, are shown dotted ; they are inclined at
 45°, and pass through the intersections of the thick lines with
 the thin lines. The pattern is recurrent in the directions of
 both sc and y, and in each case with an interval equal to tho
 real wave-length (X). Tho distance between the bright spots
 measured parallel to x or y is thus X ; but the shortest dis
tance between these spots is in directions inclined at 45°, and
is eqnal to \ V 2 . X.
    In order to determine the relation of the frequency of the
liquid vibrations to that of the bar, an apparatus was fitted up
capable of giving an intermittent view of the vibrating system.
 This consisted of a blackened paper disk pierced with three
sets of holes, mounted upon an axle, and maintained in rota
tion by a small electromagnetic engine of Apps's construction.
The whole was fastened to one base- board, and could be moved
about freely, the leading wires from the battery being flexible.

 The current was somewhat in excess; so that the desired speed
 could be attained by the application of moderate friction. At
 a certain speed of rotation the appearances were as follows.
 Through the set of four holes (giving four views for each
 rotation of the disk) the bar was seen double. Through the
  set of two holes the bar was seen single, and the water-waves
  were seen double. Through the single hole the bar was seen
  single, and the waves also were seen single. From this it
  follows that the water vibrations are not, as Matthiessen con
  tends, synchronous with those of the bar, but that there are
 two complete vibrations of the support for each complete vi
  bration of the water, in accordance with Faraday's original
  statement.
     An attempt was made to calculate the frequency of liquid
  vibration from measurements of the wave-length and of the
  depth. The depth (/t), deduced from the area of the plate and
  the whole quantity of liquid, was "0681 centim.; and by direct
  measurement \=-848 centim. Sir W. Thomson's formula
  connecting the velocity of propagation with the wave-length,
  when the effect of surface-tension is included, is

  where a = 2irh/\. With the above data we find for the fre
  quency of vibration (t_i) 20*8. This should have been 15*5;
  and the discrepancy is probably to be attributed to friction,
  whose influence must be to diminish the efficient depth, and
  may easily rise to importance when the total depth is so small.
     Another method by which I succeeded in determining the
  frequency of these waves requires a little preliminary expla
  nation. If «=27t/t, and k=2tt/X, the stationary waves
  parallel to y may be expressed as the resultant of opposite
  progressive waves in the form
          cos (icx + nt) + cos (kx— nt) = 2 cos Kxcosnt. . . (1)
     This represents the state of things referred to an origin
  fixed in space. But now let us refer it to an origin moving
  forward with the velocity («//e) of the progressive waves, so as
. to obtain the appearance that would be presented to the eye,
  or to the photographic camera, carried forward in this manner.
  "Writing kx1 + nt for icx, we get
                       cos {kx1 + 2nt) + cos kx1                 (2)
  Now the average effect of the first term is independent of x',
  so that what is seen is simply that set of progressive waves
  which moves with the eye. In this way a kind of resolution

54          Lord Bayleigh on the Crisjiations of Fluid
of the stationary wave into its progressive components may
be effected.
   In the actual experiment two sets of stationary waves are
combined; and the analytical expression is
cos(kx + nt) + cos (kx— nt) + cos (icy + nt) + cos (icy— nt), . (3)
which is equal to
               2 cos tcx cos nt + 2 cos icy cos nt, .  .   .  .   (4)
or to
              4 cos v ^ " - cos v 2 *' cos n<                     (5)
If, as before, we write kx1 + nt for kx, we get
              cos (icx' + 2nt) + cos kx1 2 cos Ky cos nt. . . (6)
The eye, travelling forward with the velocity n/ie, sees mainly
the corresponding progressive waves, whose appearance, how
ever, usually varies with y, i. c. along the length of a ridge or
furrow. If the effect could be supposed to depend upon the
mean elevation only, this complication would disappear, as we
should be left with the term cos kx' standing alone. With the
semi-opaque coloured water the variation along y is evident,
enough; but the experiment may be modified in such a manner
that the ridges and furrows appear sensibly uniform. For
this purpose the coloured water may be replaced by milk,
lighted from above, but very obliquely. The appearance of a
set of (uniform) ridges and furrows varies greatly with the
direc tion of the light. If the light fall upon the plate in a direc
tion nearly parallel to the ridges, the disturbance of the surface
becomes almost invisible ; but if, on the other hand, the inci
dence bo perpendicular to the line of ridges, the disturbance
is brought into strong relief. The application of this principle
to the case before us shows that, when the eye is travelling
parallel to x, the ridges and furrows will look nearly uniform
if the incidence of the light be also nearly parallel to x ; but
if the incidence of the light be nearly parallel to y, the ridges
will show marked variations along their length, and in fact be
resolved into a series of detached humps. The former con
dition of things is the simplest, and the most suitable as the
subject of measurement.
   In order to see the progressive waves it is not necessary to
move the head as a whole, but only to turn the eye as when
we look at an ordinary object in motion. To do this without
assistance is not at first very easy, especially if the area of the
plate be somewhat small. By moving a pointerat various speeds
until the right one is found, the eye may be guided to do what

                resting upon a Vibrating Support.             55
is required of it; and after a few successes repetition becomes
easy. If we wish not merely to see the progressive waves,
but to measure the velocity of propagation with some approach
to accuracy, further assistance is required. In my experi
ments an endless string, passing over pulleys and driven by a
small water-engine, travelled at a small distance above the
plate so that its length was in the direction of wave-propaga
tion. A piece of wire was held at one end by the fingers, and
at the other rested upon the travelling string and was carried
forward with it. In this way, by adjusting the water supply,
the speed of the string could be made equal to that of wave-
propagation; and the former could easily be determined from
the whole length of the string, and from the time required by a
knot upon it to make a complete circuit. Thus (on February 7)
the velocity of propagation was found to be 5'4 inches per
second. At the same time, by measurement of the pattern as
seen by ordinary vision, 14\=4J inches. Hence frequency
     5*4     „
= -^- =15-5 per second; exactly one half the observed fre-
quency of the bar, viz. 31.
    In addition to tho phantoms which may be considered to
represent the four component progressive waves, others may
be observed travelling in directions inclined at 45°. If we
take coordinates f, <q in these directions, (5) may be written
                    4 cos    cos -^j cos nt ;                (7)

(i. e. if wo suppose the eye to travel with velocity »/2 . n/tc),

The non-periodic part may be supposed roughly to represent
the phenomenon.
   In order if possible to settle the question beyond dispute, I
made yet another comparison of tho frequencies of vibration
of the fluid and of the support, using a plan not very different
from that originally employed by Faraday. A long plank
was supported on trestles at the nodes, and could be tuned
within pretty wide limits by shifting weights which rested
upon it near the middle and ends. At the centre was placed
a beaker 4£ inches in diameter, and containing a little mer
cury. The plank was set into vibration by properly timed

56          Lord Rayleigh on the Crispations of Fluid
 impulses with the hand^and the weights were adjusted until
 the period corresponded to one mode of free vibration of the
 pool of mercury. When the adjustment is complete, a very
 small vibration of the plank throws the mercury into great
 commotion, and unless the vessel is deep there is risk of the
 fluid being thrown out. The question now to be decided is
whether, or not, the vibrations of the mercury are executed in
 the same time as those of the plank.
     On March 18 the plank was adjusted so as to excite that
 mode of vibration of the mercury in which there are two nodal
 diameters. Two other diameters bisecting the angles between
 these give the places of maximum vertical motion. At one
 moment the mercury is elevated at both ends of one diameter
 and depressed at both ends of the perpendicular diameter ;
 half a period later the case is reversed. The frequency of the
fluid vibrations could be counted by inspection, and was found
 to be 30 (complete) vibrations in 15 seconds, or exactly two
vibrations per second. The vibrations of the plank were
 counted by allowing it to tap slightly against a pencil held in
the hand. In five seconds there were 21 complete vibrations,
 t. e. 4£ vibrations per second, almost exactly twice as many
 as was found for the mercury. The measurements were re
peated several times; and the general result is beyond question.
    On another occasion the mode of fluid vibration was that in
which there is but one nodal diameter, the fluid being most
raised at one end of the perpendicular diameter and most de
pressed at the other end. The frequency of fluid vibration
was 30 / 22 = 1-36; while that of the plank was 27 / 10 = 2-7.
Here again the fluid vibrations are proved to be only half as
quick as those of the support.
    The mechanics of the question are considered in a commu
nication to the Philosophical Magazine for April 1883, to
which reference must be made. Merely to observe the phe
nomenon, it is sufficient to take a porcelain evaporating-dish
containing a shallow pool of mercury 2 or 3 inches in dia
meter, and, holding it firmly with both hands, to impose upon
it a vertical vibratory motion. After a few trials of various
speeds it is possible to excite various modes of vibration, in
cluding those referred to in connexion with the plank. The
first (with two nodal diameters) is more interesting in itself,
and is more certainly due to a vertical as opposed to a hori
zontal vibration of the support. The gradually shelving bank
presented by the dish adds to the beauty of the experiment
by its tendency to prevent splashing.
    Dr. Matthiessen, in the papers referred to, records a long
series of measurements of the wave-lengths of crispations cor

                  resting upon a Vibrating Support.               57
responding to various frequencies of vibration, not only in the
case of water, but also of mercury, alcohol, and other liquids.
He remarks that the nature of the liquid affects the relation
in a marked manner, contrary to the theoretical ideas of the
time, which recognized gravity only as a " motive " for the
vibrations. In the following year Sir W. Thomson gave the
complete theory of wave-propagation*, in which it is shown
that in the case of wave-lengths so short as most of those ex
perimented upon by Matthiessen, the influence of cohesion, or
capillary tension, far outweighs that of gravity. In general,
if T be the tension, k=2tt /X, the velocity of propagation (»)
is given by

or, when X is small enough,
                       t>=>/(T*)                                 (9)
Since X=i'T, the relation between t and X is, by (9),
                          2ttTt2=X3;                            (10)
or, if N be the frequency of vibration,
                          N*X= constant                        (11)
Dr. Matthiessen's results agree pretty well with (11), much
better in fact than with the formula proposed by himself.
   There is another point of some interest on which the views
expressed by Matthiessen call for correction. It was observed
by Lissajous some years ago, that if two vibrating tuning-
forks of slightly different pitch are made to touch the surface
of water, the nearly stationary waves formed midway between
the sources of disturbance travel slowly towards the graver.
We may take as the expression for the two progressive waves
                     cos(/cz— nt) + cos (k/x + n't),
or, which is the same,
  2 cos { i(/e + k!)x + %(n'— n)t } x cob {%(K? — K)z + l(n' + n)t).
The position at any time of the crests of the nearly stationary
waves is given by
                  £ (k + id)x + ^ (rt' — n)t = 2»i7r,
where m is an integer. The velocity of displacement V is

 from which it appears that in every case the shifting is in the
 direction of propagation of waves of higher pitch, or towards
 the source of graver pitch.
    According to Matthiessen, the shifting takes place with a
 velocity equal to half the difference of velocities of the com
 ponent trains, t. e.

and in the direction of that component, train which moves with
greatest velocity. So far as regards the direction merely, the
 two rules come to the same thing for the range of pitch used
 by Lissajous and Matthiessen, since over this range the velo
 city increases with pitch. If, however, we have to deal with
waves longer than the critical value (1-7 centim. for water),
the two rules are at issue, since now the velocity increases as
 the pitch diminishes. The following are a few corresponding
values, in C.G.S. measure, of wave-length, velocity, and fre
quency of vibration calculated by Thomson's formula (A).

    I have examined the matter experimentally with the aid of
 vibrators making from 12 to 7 complete vibrations per second,
 and therefore well below the critical point, with the result that
 the transference is towards the source of graver pitch, although
 this is the direction of propagation of the component which
 travels with the smaller velocity. I reserve for the present a
 more detailed description of the apparatus, as 1 propose to
 apply it to the general verification of Thomson's law of ve
locities.
          VIII. An Illustration of the Crossing of Rays.

                             [Plate I.]
WHEN rays of light are passing through a point, the re-
          sulhint motion of the aathor is in general far too com
plicated to be conceived; but if the light is homogeneous, it
can readily be shown that the motion at each point is simply
harmonic motion in an ellipse ; so that in that case the

complication consists only of the change in this ellipse in pass
ing from one point to another. Hence a model might be con
structed to represent the crossing of homogeneous rajs by
placing a number of ellipses to represent the motion at a
number of separate points, through which the light might be
supposed to be passing. If we further simplify the case by
considering only rays parallel to one plane, and suppose them
to be plane-polarized so that the vibrations are parallel to the
 same plane, the whole motion will be parallel to that plane,
 and might be represented by means of diagrams.
    The case worked out in this paper is that of three rays of
 equal intensity parallel to one plane, plane-polarized so that
 the vibrations are parallel to that plane, and meeting one
another at equal angles.

p — 5'= const, are equations to lines parallel to P'O P, Q'O Q,
R'O R respectively. When the constant is zero, the lines pass
through 0.
   If we take any point in Q'Q and move perpendicularly to
Q'Q from this point, we can, without altering the phase of
the vibration of the ray Q, reach a point at which the
phase of the vibration of the ray R is the same. If we
now move from this latter point in a direction parallel to
P' P, we shall keep the phases of Q, R equal to one another,
and we can reach a point at which the phase of the ray P is
equal to either of them. Take this point as the origin, and let
the phases be zero at the initial time. Then at a time t the
displacements due to the three rays at the point T will be
sin 2ir(t —p), sm2tr{t—q), s\n 2tt (t — r) , the wave-length
being taken as the unit of length, and the period as the unit

Those lines intersect the triangles (fig. 1) at their angles, and
also at the bisection of their sides. At these points the mo
tion has been already determined. The motion is circular if
p is an even multiple of ^, at the points for which 1 — A= + B
—that is, where q—r = 2m+ $ (m being an integer); and if
p is an odd multiple of \, at the points for which L+A= + B
—that is, where <j—r — 2m + ^.
    These conditions are satisfied at the middle points of the
triangles. In fig. 2 are shown the nodes and the circular
points, the arrows indicating the phase when f = 0. It will be
noticed that at adjacent circular points the motion is in oppo
site directions.
    It would be possible to construct a piece of apparatus to
exhibit the motion approximately. A piece of elastic mem
brane, sufficiently stretched in all directions, should bo fastened
at a set of points corresponding to the points of rest, and the
middle points of the triangles should then bo displaced accord
ing to tho phase (see fig. 2), and carried round their original
positions in circles of equal size and period, the adjacent mo
tions being in opposite directions—an arrangement which
might easily be effected by a series of cogged wheels. We
should then have a number of points fixed, and the correct
motion given at other points where tho motion is greatest.
The motion of tho rest of the membrane except near the edges
would then bo approximately correct.
    In fig. 3 is given an enlarged view of one of the triangles,
showing some of the points where the motion is elliptic, and
tho displacement of the lines through the nodes parallel and
perpendicular to the rays.

 they differ from those already raised by others, and involve
 moreover questions of general interest. Mr. Cook proves
 that C02 is distributed uniformly throughout our atmosphere;
 and concludes that the power of gaseous diffusion is such that,
 admitting (as he does) a universal plenum, the same gaseous
 proportion must prevail throughout space—that, in short,
 there must be as large a proportion of C03 and X in space

and in the solar photosphere as in our atmosphere, and for
the same reason no more hydrogen in those rogions than we
can detect in the atmosphere.
    While admitting the uniform distribution of C02 in our
atmosphere, which is subject to powerful circulating currents,
I cannot agree with Mr. Cook in ascribing to gaseous diffu
sion any considerable influence upon the constitution of a
great solar inflow and outflow current. Mr. Cook points
out very property that the density of some of the metallic
vapours known to exist in the sun is either inferior to, or
does not materially exceed that of, carbon dioxide; and these,
he concludes, would mix rapidly by diffusive action with the
photospheric current, doing away with its distinctive character;
 regarding stellar material, he says, towards the end of his article,
 "any difference in composition would be rapidly removed
 by the. action of gaseous diffusion." Mr. Cook hero appears
 to fall into a common error of interpreting Dalton's expression,
 that " one gas diffuses into the space occupied by another as
 though the latter had no existence," into an action comparable
 to the rush of a gas into a vacuum; whereas in reality the rate
 of the diffusion of gases at equal pressures does not exceed a
 few feet per hour, and that of fluids not a few feet per annum,
 as proved by Sir William Thomson's experiments now going
 on at Glasgow University. The effect of such slow action
 must be inappreciable upon gaseous currents depending upon
 solar rotation, amounting to 23,7(50,000 feet per second, or
 4500 miles an hour. The metallic vapours in the photosphere
 must therefore be attributable chiefly to mechanical intermix
 ture, which no doubt is considerable, not indeed on the polar
 surfaces, where the tangential motion is not great, nor at the
 equator, where the photosphere has acquired the solar rotation,
 but in tho intermediate zones of great differential velocity,
 rendered visible to us by tho occurrence of sun-spots, the
 result, as is now largely admitted, of cyclonic action. Tho
 metal lie vapours thus introduced into the photospheric current
 will be burnt and projected outwards into space, not indeed
 in the vaporous condition as supposed by Mr. Cook, but as a
 metallic dust (several thousand times denser than the sur
  rounding medium), the greater portion of which will pro
  bably soon return to tho sun by virtue of solar gravitation,
  there to be dissociated on reaching the great gaseous metallic
  sea underlying the photosphere.
     It is of course important to consider to what extent the
 density of this metallic sea is likely to exceed that of the pho
  tosphere. Assuming the latter to contain, besides the light
  combustible gases, a large proportion of oxygen and nitrogen,

64                Sir William Siemens on the
we shall be safe in estimating its mean density as equal to that
of nitrogen, or equal to 14; and assuming the metallic sea
below to consist of both the heavy and light metallic vapours
in reasonable proportions, we shall probably be near the truth
in assuming its mean vapour-density as being equal to that of
iron, or equal to 56. The photospheric current would there
fore sweep over an ocean only four times denser than itself,
which, under terrestrial conditions, would give rise to ver}'
active mechanical admixture; but this tendency is counter
acted upon the solar surface by a force of gravity 27 times
greater, exercising a separating influence analogous to that
upon which the action of the ingenious cream- separator de
pends, in which the force of gravitation is replaced by cen
trifugal action. To get the parallel of terrestrial conditions,
we should have to assume the solar ocean to be 4 x 27 = 108
times denser than the atmospheric current sweeping over
it. The light metallic vapours will be held in suspension in
the vast metallic ocean in the same way as oxygen and car
bonic anhydride are retained in sea-water.
   Mr. Cook thinks that the preponderance of hydrogen and
CO in meteorites is inconsistent with the idea that the me
teoric gases have been absorbed in space; and he puts forward
a theory making them the result of decomposition of solid
hydrocarbon and oxides by heat while passing through our
atmosphere perhaps more than once. A shell of fused mag
netic oxide of iron is supposed to be formed, retaining these
gases bottled as it were ; but it may fairly be objected that
such a fused shell, if it were really formed, would crack in
cooling and allow the gas to escape through innumerable
fissures. It is sufficient for us to know, I think, that the me
teorites contain all the constituents of our atmosphere except
hydrogen, which latter occurs in our atmosphere combined
with oxygen, whereas in space and in the solar photosphere
we have evidence of its separate existence or in combination
with carbon—a difference which is to my mind the necessary
consequence of dissociation of carbonic acid and aqueous
vapour in space, and of ignition and slow combustion, effecting
their oxidation upon our earth.
   I cannot agree with Mr. Cook in supposing that a terrestrial
polar inflow current would be inconsistent with the direction
of the " return trade " winds, of which it would simply form
part, the direction of both being necessarily from the north
east, in the northern hemisphere.
   Mr. Cook has evidently not followed me in my description
of the equatorial outflow as a balanced current depending
upon solar gravitation only for its density and rate of flow ;

                   Conservation of Solar Energy.               65
he reintroduces the effect of projection into space by centri
fugal force, and makes the remarkable statement that "if
owing to centrifugal force H is projected x miles into space,
then sodium vapour, which is 23 times as heavy, will be pro-
jected      miles."    Surely a pound of one substance is as
good as another as regards vis inertia; and gravitation; and it
seems an unfair proceeding on the part of the latter force to
recall the one sooner than the other simply because it is the
denser of the two. Considering, however, that the force of
gravity is 46,800 times greater than centrifugal force upon the
solar equator, no substance could be projected outward a single
inch by centrifugal force, although that force is capable of de
termining the outflow of a gaseous column, balanced by an
inflowing polar current of nearly the same density, thus giving
rise to what I termed the solar " fan action."
    Mr. Cook remarks very properly, that my hypothesis, if
applicable to the Sun, must be equally applicable to Sirius
with its bluish-white and to Arcturus with its reddish light;
and he says " it is difficult to see how these differences uro
to be accounted for "on the principle of combustion, "the
same atmosphere supplying them all." But surely the tem
perature of terrestrial coal-furnaces is not always the same,
depending, as they do, upon the intensity of the draught and
 the density of the fuel employed. In the case of the photo
 sphere the richness of the gaseous fuel is determined by its
 density (that is, by the magnitude of the solar body), and the
 intensity of the combustion by the draught (that is, by its
 tangential velocity), both of which may vary between wide
limits ; and the latterjmay be slowly diminishing, thus giving
force to Dr. Huggins's suggestion of the effect of ago. The
brilliancy of a fixed star must depend moreover upon our rela
tive position towards it, being partially obscured perhaps, if
 seen equatorially, by planetary matter.
    In conclusion, allow me to refer Mr. Cook to the last issue
 of the Proceedings of the Berlin Academy. In it one of its
 members (my brother, Dr. Werner Siemens) gives a full
 investigation of the nature and causes of the electric potential
 supposed to exist between the Sun and our planet. After
 some hesitation, my brother has arrived at the conclusion that
 this electrical connexion cannot be satisfactorily explained
except by adopting my hypothesis of a material equatorial
 outflow, sweeping out from the Sun past our Earth, and car
 rying with it particles of dust. When writing this article,
my brother appears to have overlooked the most interesting
observations that have been made for some years at the Grreen-

 ¦*¦ 1. "The Age of the newer Gneissic Kocks of the Northern High
lands." By C. Callaway, Esq., D.Sc., F.G.S. With Notes on the
Lithology of the specimens collected by Prof. T. G. Bonney, M.A.,
F.R.S., Sec. G.S.
    The object of the author was to prove that the eastern Gneiss of
the Northern Highlands, usually regarded as of " Lower Silurian "
age, was to be placed in the Archaean. Whilo admitting that this
gneiss frequently overlies the quartzo-dolomitic group of Eribol and
Assynt, he held that this relation was due to dislocation accompanied
by powerful thrust from the east, which had squeezed both forma
tions into a series of folds thrown over towards the west, so as to
cause a general easterly dip. As a preliminary to his demonstra
tion, the author gave the following classification of the quartzo-
dolomitic series, which, in the absence of rlear proof of its age, he
called the "Assynt Group," the subdivisions being taken in ascend
ing order :—
    C,. Torridon Sandstone and Ben More Grit.
    Cr Qnartzite.
           C2 L Seamy.            C2 u. Annelidan.
    C3. Brown Flags.
    Ct. Salterella Grit and Quartzite.
    C5. Dolomite.
           C, 1. Dark.            C5 u. White.
    For the eastern gneiss the author proposed the term "Caledo
nian."
    Taking the country examined from south to north, Loch Broom
was first described. Here the author considered there was clear
proof of dislocation. Between the Torridon and the Caledonian
there were several subparallel faults, which increased in throw from
west to east, Torridon Sandstone being first brought up through the
qnartzite, then farther east through the dolomite, while still further
east the Hebridean was thrown up, the Caledonian appearing
east of the Hebridean. This Hebridean was the " porphyry " of
Nicol.
     In Assynt the " Upper Quartzite " was first discussed. The author
described several sections which he considered to prove that this
band was the ordinary quartzite repeated east of a great fault
which brought up the Hebridian, in one place (Glen Coul) the

                        Geological Society:—
quartzite being conformably succeeded by the brown flags and
dolomite.
   Tho " igneous rocks " of Nicol (" Logan Rock " of Dr. Heddle)
wore regarded as the old gneiss brought up by a fault and thrown
over onto the Assynt group to the maximum breadth of more than
a mile.
   The " Upper Limestone " of authors was described as either out
liers of the dolomite or a part of the Caledonian series.
   Tho Caledonian rocks wore seen in Glen Coul to be immediately
overlying the Hebridian, the Assynt group being caught in the
angle between the two gneisses, and bent back in overthrown
folds.
   Tho mountain-groups of Assynt wero described as usually consist
ing of cores of Hebridian gneiss swathed in or capped by sheets
of quartzite. In the former case the quartzite on the western
slojies was contorted into overthrown folds by the thrust from the
east.
   In the Loch-Eribol district, the "granulite" of Nicol was con
sidered to be a lower division of the Caledonian gneiss, though
bearing some resemblances to the Hebridian. In other respects,
the views of Nicol were regarded as substantially correct. Along
the entire length of Loch Eribol, a distance of about twelve miles,
tho thrust from the east had bent back the Assynt group into over
thrown folds, and pushed the Caledonian gneiss onto the top of the
inverted quartzite. This had produced the appearance of an
" upper " quartzite passing " conformably " below the eastern
gneiss. Tho superior antiquity of the Caledonian was confirmed by
the occurrence of outliers of quartzite upon the Arnabol (Lower
Caledonian) series, and by the fact that the granite, which sent
numberless veins into the gneiss, never penetrated the quartzite and
associated rocks.
   2. " On a Group of Minerals from Lilleshall, Salop." By C. J.
Woodward, Esq., B.Sc, F.G.8.
   The minerals noticed in this paper occur in a bed of grey lime
stone in the Carboniferous Limestone at Lilleshall. They occur in
vertical joints in the upper subdivisions of the bed. The following
list gives them arranged in order of frequency, the least common
being placed first :—quartz, bornite, towanite, iron-pyrites, hae
matite, barytes, calcite, dolomite (ankerite ?). Of the first, the
author has only met with a single minute crystal. Iron-pyrites is
by no means common ; haematite is more abundant. Analyses of two
specimens of the " dolomite," show that one agrees very nearly with
ankerite, while another, identical in aspect, exhibits considerable
differences, being only a ferriferous dolomite. The author suggests
that it is doubtful whether ankerite should be retained as a mineral
species.

    1. "On the Basalt-glass (Tachylyte) of the Western Isles of
Scotland." By Prof. J. W. Judd, F.R.S., Sec. G.S., and G. A. J.
Cole, Esq., F.G.S.
   Basalt-glass or tachylyte is a rare rock, although very widely
distributed.
   In the "Western Isles of Scotland it has, by the authors of the
paper, been detected in five localities only, namely Lamlash (Holy
Isle) near Arran, the Beal near Portree in Skyo, Gribun and Some
in Mull, and Screpidale in Raasay.
   Basalt-glass is always found in the Hebrides as a selvage to dykes,
though elsewhere it has been described as occurring under other
conditions, where rapid cooling of basaltic lava has taken place.
Some of the varieties of basalt-glass in the Hebrides differ from any
hitherto described by their high specific gravity (2*8 to 2-9) and by
their low percentage of silica (45 to 50).
   This basalt-glass is frequently traversed by numerous joints ; it
is occasionally finely columnar, and sometimes perlitic in structure.
   From the acid glasses (obsidian) it is distinguished by its density,
its opacity, its magnetic properties, and especially by its easy
fusibility, from which the name of tachylyte is derived. By its
greater hardness it is readily distinguished form its hydrated forms
(palagonite, &c).
   In its microscopic characters basalt-glass is found to resemble
other vitreous rocks ; thus it exhibits the porphyritic, the banded
and fluidal, the spherulitic, and the perlitic structures. In the
gradual transition of this rock into basalt, all the stages of devitri
fication can be well studied.
   The difference between these locally developed basalt-glasses and
the similar materials forming whole lava-streams in the Sandwich
Islands was pointed out in the paper, and the causes of this difference
were discussed.
   It was argued that the distinction between tachylyte and hyalome-
lane, founded on their respective behaviour when treated with acids,
must be abandoned, and that these substances must be classed as
rocks and not as mineral species ; the name basalt-glass was adopted
as best expressing their relations to ordinary basalt, the term
tachylyte being applied to all glasses of basic composition and being
used in contradistinction to obsidian.
    2. " On a Section recently exposed in Baron Hill Park, near
 Beaumaris." By Prof. T. G. Bonney, M.A., F.E.S., Sec. G.S.
    The author, about three years since, observed some imperfect ex
 posures of a felsitic grit in the immediate vicinity of the normal
 schists of the district in a road which leads from Beaumaris cemetery

70                         Geological Society.
to Llandegfan ; but last summer he had the opportunity, through the
courtesy of Sir R. B. Williams, of examining the cuttings made in
constructing a new drive, which runs through Baron Hill Park very
near the above outcrops. After tracing the normal schists along
the steep scarp of the hill, he came, after an interval of about 60
yards, covered by soil and vegetation, to a massive grey grit con
sisting of quartz, felspar, and minute fragments of compact felsite,
which now and then attain a larger size, being an inch or so across.
These grits, which pass occasionally into hard compact mudstones
(probably more or less of volcanic origin), can be traced for some
350 yards to the neighbourhood of tho above-mentioned road,
which is crossed by a bridge ; and a short distance on the other side
of this is a considerable outcrop of the grit, which in places becomes
coarsely conglomeratic, containing large fragments of the reddish
quartz felsite so common on tho other side of the straits in the beds
at or below the base of the Cambrian series. Tho schists appear to
dip about 20° E.S.E., the grits about 25° E.
    The author, after describing the microscopic structure of the
various rocks noticed, pointed out that this section, though the junc
tion of the two rocks is probably a faulted one, has an important
bearing on the question of the age of the Anglesey schists, mica
ceous and chloritic. The Survey regards them as altered Cambrian ;
it has even been suggested that they may be of Bala age ; others
havo regarded them as Pebidian. Now the felsitic grits and con
glomerates cannot be newer than the Cambrian conglomerate of the
mainland, regarded by Prof. Hughes as the base of the true Cam
brian, and are probably older, corresponding with some part of the
series between it and the great masses of quartz felsite which are
developed near Llyn Padarn and Port Dinorwig, which series litho-
logically and stratigraphically corresponds with tho typical Pebi
dian of Pembrokeshire. Hence, as the Anglesey schists are in the
full sense of the term metamorphic rocks, and the " Pebidian " but
slightly altered, this section shows that the former must be much
 older than the latter, and so be distinctly Archaean.
    3. " On the Bocks between the Quartz Felsite and the Cambrian
Series in the neighbourhood of Bangor.'' By Prof. T. G. Bonney,
M.A., F.R.S., Sec. G.S.
    This district has already been the subject of papers by the author
(Q. .1.0. S. vol. xxxiv. p. 137) and by Prof. Hughes (vol. xxxv.
 p. 682), who differs from him in restricting the series between the
 quartz felsite and Cambrian conglomerate to little more than the bas
 tard slates and green breccias of Bangor mountain. The author has
 traced on the S.E. side of the Bangor-Caernarvon road a well-murked
 breccia containing fragments of purple slate mixed with volcanic mate
rials below tho above-named Bangor series for more than a mile ; at
 a lower level he has traced another well-marked breccia, chiefly of
volcanic materials, for half a mile, and, lastly, a grit and conglo
merate, apparently resting on the quartz felsite named above, com

posed of materials derived from it. Thia has been traced on both
sides of the road mentioned above for nearly two miles. For these
and for other reasons given in the paper, the author is of opinion
that, as he formerly maintained, there is a continuous upward suc
cession on the S.E. side of the road, from the quartz felsito at
Brithdir to the Cambrian conglomerate on Bangor mountain. The
district on the N.W. side of the road is so faulted that he can come
to no satisfactory conclusions. The author is in favour of incorpo
rating the above-named quartz felsites with the overlying beds as
one series, corresponding generally with the Pebidian of South
Wales—older than the Cambrian, though probably not separated
from it by an immense interval of time. An analysis of the Brithdir
quartz felsite by Mr. J. S. Teall was given, from which it ap
peared that the rock corresponds very closely with the " devitrified
pitchstone " of Lea rock in the Wrekin district, described by Mr.
Allport, but differs considerably in composition from those in the
Ordovician rocks of North Wales.

         ON THE CRITICAL POINT OF LIQUEFIABLE GASES.
                            BY J. JAM1N.
    TTEjS'TIOJM having been called to the liquefaction of gases, I
       proceed to lay before the Academy the reflections which the
subject has suggested to me. The remarkable paper published by
Andrews in 1870 * demonstrated that, in order to liquefy carbonic
aeid, pressures increasing up to 78 atmospheres must be employed
when the temperature amounts to 31°. At that limit the phe
nomenon changes : certainly a rapid diminution of volume is still
seen, and undulating and moving striae are observed as in a
mixture of two liquids of different densities ; but there is no
longer any liquefaction, however great may be the pressure ex
erted. In short, below 31° the gas is liquefiable ; above, it is so
no longer. This is the critical point.
   These are incontestable facts ; and the notion of the critical
point has rendered great services ; but it is unexplained, and
perhaps inaccurately interpreted. 1 believe that gases are lique
fiable at any temperature when the pressure is sufficient, but that
an unperceivetl circumstance has prevented the liquefaction being
seen. To make this intelligible, let us take the experiments of
Cagniard-Latour.
   A thick glass tube was half or two-thirds filled with water
 under the pressure of its vapour only ; it was hermetically sealed,
and was then heated to 300° or 400°. According to known
laws the quantity of vapour superposed to the liquid increases
            * Ann. de L'himie et de Phyxitfue, [4] xxi. p. 208.

72            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
rapidly ; its density increases, in the same ratio as its weight,
without any known limit. On the other hand, the portion which
has remained liquid undergoes an expansion that increases until at
last it exceeds that of gases (Thilorier). It is clear that, by the
effect of these reverse changes, a limiting temperature is finally
attained, at which liquid and vapour have the same weight under
the same volume.
   At that moment they are no longer separate : the vapour does
not escape to the top ; the liquid does not sink to the bottom.
First of all the meniscus is seen to disappear, the surface of
separation ceases to be distinct (Drion) ; then the entire mass is
mingled, with undulating and moving streaks giving evidence of a
mixture of different densities ; and finally the whole assumes a
homogeneous state which is supposed to be gaseous. The critical
point is reached, which may be denned as the temperature at which
a liijuid and its saturated vapour have the same density. But, for
all that, the general law of vaporization is not suddenly inter
rupted ; the liquid continues to be at its boiling-point and maxi
mum tension. If it is no longer visible, that is because it is
mixed with the gas, in which it floats on account of the equa
lization of the densities ; and when the temperature continues to
be augmented, the tension continues to increase, remaining a
maximum, until the liquid is entirely volatilized ; after which, but
not till then, the space ceases to be saturated and the pressure to
be limited : there is no longer any thing but dry vapour, a gas far
from its liquefying-point.
   It is necessary to rightly account for this very peculiar state of
the liquid while it is thus invisible and floats in its vapour. In
general a saturated vapour is distinguished from the generating
liquid by two conditions—its less density, and its latent heat ;
here, as we have seen, the densities are equal, and there is no
latent heat, since the volume is unchanged and there is no work of
expansion. Hence comes it that in Cagniard-Latour's experi
ment the liquid is seen so suddenly to reappear or disappear
through the least depression or elevation of temperature. In
short, at its critical point nothing differentiates the liquid from its
vapour—neither tension, nor density, nor heat of constitution, nor
aspect, nor any property that could distinguish them.
    If instead of Cagnaird-Latour's experiment we follow in detail
those of Andrews, they can be summed up as follows :- - When a
gas confined in a closed space is gradually compressed,
   (1) Its pressure increases up to a fixed limit, the maximum
 tension ; if we try to go beyond that, the gas condenses : it is the
liquefaction-point ¦ it is the hoiling-point under that pressure.
    (2) The liquefaction-pressure augments rapidly with the tem
perature, without any known limit, but without ceasing to exist
and without changing its character at any critical point whatever.
    (3) At low temperatures the density of saturated vapour is less
than that of the generating liquid. Starting from a determined

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.             73
limit, it becomes and remains equal to the latter: this is the
critical point.
   (4) At the critical point and beyond it the liquid is mixed and
blended with its saturated vapour.
   (5) At the critical point and beyond it there is no longer any
latent heat.
   (6) At the critical point and beyond it the liquid and gaseous
states are blended.
   From my point of view it is seen that all the laws of the
formation and condensation of vapours are maintained, and that
the exception of the critical point is explained by the equalization
of the densities. We shall see that the same theory accounts for
facts hitherto incomprehensible, and enables us to predict others
which are not without interest. M. Cailletet in 1880 * made the
following experiment, which has not received the attention it
deserves, and has been forgotten because it was not understood :—
Having compressed in his apparatus a mixture of 1 part air and 5
parts carbonic acid, M. Cailletet first saw the latter gas assume the
liquid state under a moderate pressure ; then, without changing
the temperature, but raising the pressure to 150 or 200 at
mospheres, he saw the whole of the liquid which had been formed
disappear. One would say that the increase of pressure gives rise
to a critical point, like the elevation of the temperatures, which is
scarcely admissible. The theory which I have just established
accounts for this curious phenomenon very easily as follows :—
   By a moderate pressure carbonic acid is brought to its con-
densing-point and is at first partially liquefied. If the reduction
of volume is continued, the pressure of the carbonic acid is no
longer augmented, because it had already attained its maximum ;
but that of the air continues to increase indefinitely, and with it
the total density of the gaseous atmosphere. This density soon
becomes equal to that of the liquid already formed, which then
does not remain at the bottom of the vessel, but diffuses into the
whole space, having, according to the principle of Archimedes,
lost all its weight.
   It is by the accuracy of its previsions that the truth of a theory
is judged. Now, if it be true that the disappearance of the
liquefied acid is due to the equalization of the densities, it will be
retarded by substituting for the air of the mixture a gas of less
density, hydrogen.
   I forwarded this conclusion to M. Cailletet, who hastened to
submit it to experiment.         He made two mixtures, the first
containing 5 volumes of carbonic acid to 1 volume of air, and the
second containing 5 volumes of carbonic acid to 1 volume of
hydrogen. In both cases he obtained the liquefaction of the car
bonic acid under moderate, and its total disappearance with more
powerful pressures. In both cases, first the meniscus was effaced ;
this was at the moment when the densities of the liquid and
                    * Comptes Rendu*, Feb. 2, 1880.

the atmosphere became equal. Afterwards the liquid disappeared ;
and, in conformity with the theory, it disappeared at very different,
and more considerable pressures for the mixture of hydrogen than
for that of air.
   Here are M. Cailletet's results reduced, by a graphic con
struction, to the same temperature. It will be seen that at 20° it
requires about 200 atmospheres for hydrogen, and only 100 for
air.

   From these experiments, which shall certainly be continued, it
will be easy to institute a comparison between the densities of air
and hydrogen at different temperatures and under one and the
same pressure.
   When the mixture is less rich in carbonic acid, M. Cailletet has
remarked that the liquefaction of this gas is always retarded, and
sometimes impossible. In fact, when the total volume is reduced
by pressure to one tenth or one hundredth, both gases undergo the
came reduction but not the same increase of pressure : that of the
air is multiplied by 10 or 100 ; that of the carbonic acid increases
less quickly, since Mariotte's law is no longer applicable. Hence
results a retardation of liquefaction; and when at length the
carbonic acid has reached its maximum tension and passes into
the liquid state, its density may have become equal to, and
sometimes less than, that of the superposed atmosphere. In
this case it mixes with, floats in the latter, leading one to believe
that it has lost the property of liquefying under pressure, when it
has only lost the property of collecting at the bottom of the vessel
from excess of density.
   Is it not permissible to expect another ending to this experi
ment? If the total pressure were augmented indefinitely, the
carbonic acid would continue to liquefy, and its density would
change but little, while that of the gaseous atmosphere would be
indefinitely increased and would become superior to that of the
liquid, which would perhaps separate ; but then it would collect at
the top of the tube instead of sinking to the bottom. This second

not succeed ; but I do not despair.— Comptes Rendus de VAeademie

ON THE LIQUEFACTION OF OXYGEN AND THE CONGELATION OF
    CARBON DISULPHIDE AND ALCOHOL. BY PROFESSORS SIGM.
   VON WROBLEWSKI AND K. OLSZEWSKI.
   The results at which Cailletet and Baoul Pictet arrived in their
beautiful investigations on the liquefaction of gases permitted the
hope that the time was not distant when liquid oxygen would be
observed in a glass tube as easily as liquid carbonic acid now is.
The only condition for this was the attainment of a sufficiently
low temperature. In a memoir published twelve months since*,
Cailletet recommended liquid ethylene as a means for attaining a
 very low temperature ; for the liquefied gas boils at — 105° C. under
the pressure of the atmosphere, the temperature being measured
with a carbon-disulphide thermometer. Cailletet himself compressed
the oxygen in a very narrow glass tube which was cooled in that
liquid to —105° C. At the moment of the expansion he saw " a
tumultuous ebullition, which persists during an appreciable time
and resembles the projection of a liquid into the cooled portion of
the tube. This ebullition takes place at a certain distance from the
bottom of the tube. I have not been able to ascertain," he con
 tinues, " if this liquid preexists, or if it is formed at the moment of
 the expansion ; for I have not yet been able to see the plane of
 separation of the gas and liquid."
    As one of ust had recently constructed a new apparatus for high
 pressures, with which comparatively large quantities of gas can be
 subjected to the pressure of 200 atmospheres, we employed it to
 study the temperatures at the moment of the expansion. These
experiments soon led to the discovery of a temperature at which
carbon disulphide and alcohol congeal and oxygen is with great
facility completely liquefied. This temperature is readied when
liquid ethylene is permitted to boil in a vacuum. The boiling-tempe
 rature in this case depends on the goodness of the vacuum obtained.
 With the greatest rarefaction which it has hitherto been possible
 for us to attain, the temperature descended to — 136° C. This, as
 well as all the other temperatures, we measured with the hydrogen
thermometer.
    The critical temperature of oxygen is lower than that at which
 liquid ethylene boils under the pressure of one atmosphere. The
 latter is not — 105° C. (as has hitherto been assumed), but lies be
 tween —102° and — 103° C. (as we have found with our thermo
 meter).

 at about — 130°-5 C. Of these also we reserve the communication

 ON THE LIQUEFACTION OF NITROGEN AND CARBONIC OXIDE.
     BY PROFESSORS S. VON WROBLEWSKI AND K. OLSZEWSKI.
    Having succeeded in completely liquefying oxygen*, we tried in
the same manner to bring nitrogen and carbonic oxide into the
liquid state. The liquefaction of both these gases is considerably
more difficult than that of oxygen, and takes place under conditions
so similar that it is at present impossible for us to say which of the
two gases liquefies more readily.
    At the temperature of about — 136° C, and under the pressure
of about 150 atmospheres, neither nitrogen nor carbonic oxide
liquefies ; the glass tube containing the gas remains perfectly trans
parent, and not a trace of liquid can be perceived. If the gas is
suddenly released from the pressure, in the nitrogen-tube is seen a
violent effervescence of liquid, comparable only to the effervescence
of the liquid carbonic acid in Natterer's tube when the latter is put
into a glass containing hot water. "With the carbonic oxide the
ebullition is not so strong.
   But if the expansion is not effected too suddenly and the pressure
is not allowed to fall below 50 atmospheres, both nitrogen and car
bonic oxide are liquefied completely ; the liquid shows a distinct
meniscus, and evaporates very briskly. Therefore neither of the
two gases can be kept more than a few seconds as liquids in the
static condition; to retain them longer in that state a somewhat
lower temperature would be necessary than the minimum which up
to the present it has been possible for us to attain.
   Nitrogen and carbonic oxide in the liquid state are colourless and
transparent.—Anzeiger der kaiserliehen Akademie dtr Wissenschaften
in Wien, 1883, no. xi. pp. 91, 92.

 XIII. Improved Construction of the Movable-coil Galvanometer
   for determining Current-strength and Electromotive Force in
    Absolute Measure. By Dr. Eugen Obach*.
 SOME years ago I showed that the tangent-galvanometer of
        ordinary dimensions may be employed as a measuring
 instrument for very strong currents if the ring is made
 movable around its horizontal diameter t, a principle already
 adopted before that time by Prof. Trowbridge, of Harvard
 College, Massachusetts %; a little later I described a galvano
 meter based upon that principle, and constructed by Messrs.
 Siemens Brothers §.
    I now propose to give a brief account of several alterations
which have since been introduced by that firm, and which I
venture to think render the instrument more sensitive and
more convenient for use, besides creating for it a wider field.
As the galvanometer, in the complete form in which I shall
presently describe it, is not so much destined to meet the
daily want of the practical electrician, but is rather intended for
measurements where greater accuracy and trustworthiness than
usual is necessary, I thought myself justified in bringing the
subject before the Physical Society, particularly as the kindness

 78        Dr. E. Obach on an Improved Construction
 of Messrs. Siemens Bros. & Co. at the same time enables me
 to place the instruments before you for inspection.
    Ere proceeding further, allow me to say that I shall not on
 this occasion touch upon the theory of the instrument, which
 is already given elsewhere, but confine myself wholly to de
 scribing the recent improvements in its construction, adding
 a few series of measurements in order to prove the high degree
 of accuracy obtainable.
    I propose to deal with the different parts of the instrument
 under separate headings; and will first speak of
           The Magnetic Needle and its Pointer.
    The older instruments had a flat magnetic needle fixed to a
 light vertical axle, pivotted at both ends between jewels to
 prevent any dipping, which the needle would otherwise expe
 rience with great inclinations of the ring. This arrangement
 answered sufficiently well with ordinary care; but still the
 delicate pivots were likely to be damaged, thus impairing the
 sensitiveness of the needle. As now constructed, the dipping
 of the needle is completely avoided in the manner illustrated
 by the annexed figure. The needle, n s, is fixed to a thin
                                 r
                                w
                           Half nat. size.
vertical axle, a b, near its upper end, the lower end of the
axle being provided with a cylindrical brass weight, w. This
weight offers but little additional momentum to the whole
system round the vertical axis, whereas the movement round
the horizontal axis is completely prevented. The aluminium

                  of the Movable-coil Galvanometer.             79
  pointer, p q, is situated in the same plane as the scale; the
   ends are flattened and provided with a fine slit, which serves
  as an index for reading the deflections, the bottom of
  the needle-box being blackened. The reading can thus be
  taken without parallax, and therefore very accurately. The
  magnetic needle has a biconical shape, which entirely prevents
  the shifting of the magnetic axis from its original position,
  as was sometimes found to be the case with the old broad
  needles. Adjustments are provided by which the cocoon-
  fibre, /, serving to suspend the needle, can bo raised or
  lowered, as well as accurately centred.
                The Damping of the Oscillations.
     Numerous experiments were undertaken to ascertain a con
 venient method for damping the oscillations of the needle, and
 to arrive, if possible, at a perfectly aperiodical movement.
 After trying large masses of copper placed in the immediate
 neighbourhood of the swinging magnet, as well as liquid
 damping, without decided success, air-damping was resorted
 to, and finally adopted. It will be remembered that Sir Wil
 liam Thomson used air-damping for the light-mirror of his
 dead-beat galvanometer, and Prof. Topler* for other galvano-
 metric apparatus. In our case the air-chamber consists of a
 shallow cylindrical box, about 8 centim. in diameter, 1^ centira.
 high, provided with two radial partitions which can be slid in
 or out; the axle of the needle, passing through the centre of
 this box, carries a light and closely fitting vane. By sliding
the partitions more or less into the box various degrees of
damping can be obtained ; and if they are right in, the motion
is practically dead-beat.
                              The Scales.
    Declination-scale.—This scale, engraved on a horizontal ring,
was formerly divided into degrees, as usually done ; but now
one semicircle is provided with divisions corresponding to the
natural tangents. The interval between each two divisions
must of course vary for different parts of the scale, and is
arranged as follows:—
                               Table I.
            Values of tangent.                 Interval.

80         Dr. E. Obach on an Improved Construction
It will be noticed that the value of the interval only changes
at those places where the tangent is equal to a whole figure,
thus making a mistake in reading less likely. Looking at
this scale no gaps are conspicuous, and the divisions are
everywhere pretty evenly distributed. Tangent-scales have
been employed by Joule, Sir William Thomson, and others;
but the one now described seems well to satisfy all the re
quirements.
   Inclination-scale.—This scale, engraved on a vertical qua
drant divided into degrees, can accurately be read to one tenth
 by means of a vernier. The zero division was formerly that
to which the index pointed when the ring was horizontal. In
this case the tangent of the deflections had to be divided by
the sine of the angles. For convenience' sake, the places
were specially marked on the scale at which the sines corre
 sponded to whole figures. The new inclination-scale has the
 zero at the vertical or normal position of the ring; and instead
 of the sines, the secants are specially marked which are repre
sented by whole figures. With these secants the tangents of
the deflections must be multiplied; and they can therefore be
termed multiplying powers, analogous to the multiplying
power of shunts. The instruments intended only for the
measurement of current-strength have the quadrant bearing
the secant-scale fixed outside the ring, whilst the others, mea
suring also electromotive force, have it situated between the
needle-box and the ring, where it is better protected from injury.
   If the deflections of the needle are read on the tangent-
scale and the positions of the ring on the secant-scale, the aid
of trigonometrical tables may be entirely dispensed with, as
the product of the two figures represents the quantity to be
measured, irrespective of a constant.
                 The Solid King and the Coil.
   If the galvanometer has to serve only for the measurement
of currents, the gun-metal ring is of a rectangular cross
section; but if it is at the same time destined to measure dif
ference of potential, the cross section is V-shaped, the groove
being filled with numerous turns of G.S. wire. If the num
ber of convolutions is known, and if a simple relation exists
between that number and the resistance of the wire, a great
advantage may be derived therefrom. For instance, if there
are one thousand convolutions on the coil, offering a resistance
of exactly one thousand ohms, the current due to the difference
of potential of one volt at the ends of the coil would produce
the same deflection of the needle as the current of one ampere
flowing through the solid metal ring. That this must be so

                  of tlie Movable-coil Galvanometer.             81
   is evident, if it is remembered that the weak current of one
   thousandth of an ampere flows round the needle one thousand
   times, but the stronger current of one ampere only once. The
   solid ring and the convolutions are thus arranged that their
   cross sections have a common centre of gravity, thus both
   acting exactly in the same way upon the magnetic needle. If
   this simple plan is adopted, the calibration of the galvano
  meter for difference of potential in volts, which is readily per
  formed with a few cells of known E.M.F., at the same time
  gives the graduation of the instrument for strength of current
  in amperes. I have been using various modifications of the
  Daniell cell with solutions of copper and zinc sulphate
  of equal specific gravity. At present I am engaged in con
  structing a standard cell for such purposes, which is always
  at disposal; and, as far as the preliminary experiments show,
  the E.M.F. of the new cell will closely approach one volt.
  Further on I shall communicate some measurements, by which
  I intend to show how accurately the calibration of the fine-wire
  coil in volts can serve for that of the solid ring in amperes.
            The Constant Shunt and Leading Wires.
     With the size of the ring usually employed, viz. 30 centim.
  diameter, and our horizontal component of the earth's magne
 tism, currents of greater strength than about 50 amperes
 would require the ring to be at the multiplying powers 9 or
  10, t. e. near the horizontal position. If, as a rule, such cur
 rents have to be measured, it is desirable to raise the con
 stant of the galvanometer, say two or threefold, without a
 proportionate increase of the dimensions. This can be done
 by the use of a so-called " constant shunt" thereby allowing
 only half or one third of the current to flow round the needle.
 In our case the shunt is made of exactly the same metal as
 the solid ring itself ; it has no soldering-places, and consists
 in fact of three or four little bridge pieces left standing
instead of cutting the ring quite open where the terminals join.
By comparison with an instrument of the same description
having an open ring, the shunt can be adjusted to any power
desirable.
     However, by the introduction of the " constant shunt " the
accuracy of the measurements is somewhat impaired. Expe
riments in which the shunt-pieces were touched with a thin
stick of low-melting material during the passage of very strong
currents, proved that they did not become hot, on account of
their extremely low absolute resistance and their contact with
the large metallic mass of the ring conducting away the heat.
Variations of temperahire, to which both the ring and the

 82          Dr. E. Obach on an Improved Construction
 shunt are subjected, do not of course in the least disturb the
 ratio of their resistance, since they both consist of the very
 same alloy.
     As the current only passes round the needle once and, if
 powerful enough, produces deflections even if the ring is
 almost horizontal, it is hardly necessary to call attention to
  the fact that the wires leading the current to the instrument
  should be so arranged that they cannot act upon the needle;
  still I have seen instances where this simple and almost self-
  evident precaution has been strangely neglected. I thought
  it therefore best to have special leading wires provided which
  are absolutely inactive upon the needle, and may therefore be
  named " adynamic leads." These leads consist of a number
  of well-insulated copper wires stranded together in a peculiar
  manner, and covered with a cotton braiding, similar to the
  ordinary speaking-tubes. The cable thus formed is quite
  flexible, and without the slightest action upon a magnetic
  needle. I sent a strong current through several turns of such
  a cable, and held it close to a delicately suspended magnetic
  needle, but could not detect any effect whatever upon it.
  One half of the wires is covered with a differently coloured
  material to the other half ; and the wires of each colour are
  united at both ends of the cable, and there soldered to a stout
  piece of copper wire. The adynamic cable can be made in
  any length and for different current-strengths; and as it offers
  only a small resistance, it can be employed to convey the
  current to be measured to a locality where the needles are not
  disturbed by machines or wires.
     The Adjusting Parts and the Compensating Magnet.
     With regard to the adjustment of the instrument, it suffices
  to say that, besides the necessary levelling-arrangements, it is
  provided with clamp-rings for tightly holding the pillar as
  well as the movable coil without interfering with previous
  adjustments, and in the same manner as is often done with
  mathematical apparatus. The final adjustment of the axis of
  the coil into the meridian is performed by means of a fine
  screw, which proves very useful for correcting, during a series
  of measurements, the occasional variations of the zero position.
      As long as the galvanometer stands in the same position,
  the "constant," as a rule, changes but little even from day to
  day. If, however, the instrument is taken from one place to
  another, great changes in that respect will occur, amounting
  sometimes to many per cents. These changes do not of course
• interfere with the accuracy of the measurements, because the
  " constant " can easily be redetermined with a known E.M.F.

                  of the Movable-coil Galvanometer.             83
 at any place, as we have seen; but it would undoubtedly be
 very convenient to have the galvanometer of equal sensibility
 everywhere. For that purpose an auxiliary magnet is placed
 east or west from the needle in a plane parallel to the meri
 dian, which can turn round a horizontal axis passing through
 its neutral point and the centre of the needle, and being at
 right angles to the diameter on which the coil is turned.
 This magnet does not affect the zero position, and moreover,
 if placed exactly vertical with its magnetic axis, it does not
 alter the original constant, which then only depends upon the
 horizontal terrestrial component, more or less modified by the
 surroundings; but if it is dipped, the horizontal force acting
 on the needle is either augmented or diminished, according to
the direction in which the magnet is turned and to the amount
 of dip given. It is easily seen that the magnetic influence of
 the surroundings upon the needle may now greatly vary from
 one place to another and still be compensated by the magnet,
 thus keeping the so-called " constant " of the galvanometer
 actually at a constant value, adjusting it, for instance, always
 so that the unit deflection of 45° with the vertical ring
 corresponds to a round number of volts and amperes, say
 five or ten. Under such conditions the deflection-scale could
at once give the current or E.M.F. in amperes or volts. A
 gradual change of magnetism in the compensating magnet
does not affect the measurements. I shall not further enter
into this subject here, as I intend discussing it more fully on
a future occasion.
                   Methods of Measurement.
   For measuring current-strength or electromotive force
either of the following four methods can be employed accord
ing to circumstances, viz. :—
   I. The General Method.—Applicable under almost any
conditions. The coil is placed in such a position that the
deflection attains a proper value. If a is the deflection of the
needle, and <f) that of the coil from the meridian, the formula is
                     x = tan «x sec x const.;
or in case the multiplying powers P on the quadrant are used,
the formula becomes
                        #=tan a x P x const.
   II. Method of Equality.—With this method the coil is each
time placed in such a position that the needle is deflected
exactly to the same angle yfr to which the coil is inclined,
giving the formula
                    x= tan yfr x sec i/r x const.

84          Dr. E. Obach on an Improved Construction
Having then only to deal with a single angle for a particular
measurement, these products of tangents and secants may be
calculated beforehand. For this purpose the natural sines are
 sufficient, because tan x sec = ——».
                                   cos-1
    The following Table gives, for easy comparison, the values
of tangents, secants, and their products at ten and mul
 tiples of ten degrees. These products, like the tangents,
 range from nil to infinity, but increase more rapidly.

                                                                 ¦

    III. Method of Constant Defection.—Here the coil is each
 time inclined until the needle reaches a certain deflection, say
 26£°, 45°, or 63£°, of which the corresponding tangents are
 1, and 2 respectively. This figure then enters the constant,
 giving the simpler formula
                          x= sec <f>x const.,
 the instrument acting as a secant-galvanometer. For a given
 constant deflection the secant-measurements range between
 unity and infinity, as the above little table shows.           This
 method has the peculiarity that the needle occupies a fixed
 position in space during the measurements, which in some
 instances may be found of advantage.
    IV. Method of Constant Inclination.—In this case the coil
 is fixed at a given inclination, and sec <f> enters the constant;
 thus the formula is reduced to that of the ordinary tangent-
 galvanometer,
                          x = tan ax const.
    As compared with other galvanometers proposed for a similar
 purpose, the one here described offers the great advantage
 that the magnetic needle has not to be shifted from one
 measurement to another, whereby the magnetic field may
 sometimes considerably alter; furthermore it does not depend

                  of the Movable-coil Galvanometer.                  85
upon the constancy of permanent magnets, which, to say the
least, is rather precarious*.
             Numerical Results of Measurements.
   I shall now communicate some measurements and tests to
which the latest forms of instruments have been subjected, in
order to illustrate the degree of accuracy obtainable. The
first set was undertaken to ascertain the relation actually
existing between the solid ring for currents and the coil of
wire for E.M.F., which, it will be remembered, was intended
to be such that amperes with the solid ring should accurately
correspond to volts with the wire coil. The experiment was
conducted as follows:—A current, from my constant battery
with acid flowf, was sent through the solid ring and a copper
voltameter in circuit for a certain time, the deflections to the
right and left being observed every five minutes. The mean
of these deflections was taken as corresponding to the amount
of copper deposited. The copper-sulphate solution and the
electrodes consisted of pure materials. The mean of the gain
of the kathode and the loss of the anode was taken. The
amount corresponding to one ampere per hour is 1*164
gramme of copper or 3*96 grammes of silver, the latter figure
being that adopted by Messrs. Siemens and Halske, of BerlinJ.
The calibration of the fine-wire coil for volts was performed
by means of a number of Daniells, each compared with a
Raoult's standard cell filled with pure sulphate solutions
and having the E.M.F. 1*115 volt, according to Dr. Alder
Wright's experiments §. The figures obtained were as fol
lows:—
   a. With the solid Ring.
            Copper obtained            =11*435 grammes.
            Time of electrolysis =60 minutes.
            Mean deflection'          =47°*3.
            Position of ring P = 2.
Hence the current corresponding to the unit deflection of 45°
with the ring vertical =4*531 amperes.
   6. With the fine-wire Coil.
            Number of Daniells = 4.
            E.M.F. thereof             = 4 x 1*109.
            Deflection obtained =44°* 6.
            Position of coil P =1.
   • Another advantage undoubtedly is that the galvanometer requires
no variable shunt, by which errors may very easily be introduced,
   t Mep.f. exp. Phy». xviii. p. 633 (1882).

 86       Construction of the Movable-coil Galvanometer.
 Hence the E.M.F. corresponding to the deflection of 45° with
 the ring vertical =4-525 volts, the correction for the resistance
 of the cells being applied.
    These two results agree very closely indeed, showing only a
difference of 013 per cent. This is the more remarkable as
the two kinds of measurements have nothing in common,
being in fact based upon data quite independent of each other,
thus proving that it is admissible to substitute for such instru
ments the calibration in volts for that in amperes.
    A further series given in Tables III. and IV., and carried
out with great care, clearly show that, for any given current-
strength or E.M.F., the result of the measurement is almost
identical in whatever region the readings are taken.
   Table III. is obtained with currents trom my constant bat
ter}* passed through the solid ring. The six different current-
strengths were obtained by the insertion of suitable resist
ances, and were as nearly as possible in the proportion of the
whole figures 1 to 6.
    Table IV. contains measurements with the fine-wire coil,
thereby using the E.M.F. of ordinary Bunsen cells connected
in series, and varying in number from 2 to 12.
    From these Tables it will be seen that, on the one hand, the
deflections extend over the greater part of the tangent-scale,
t. e. from 30-4 till 78°'2, and, on the other, the position of the
coil varies from the multiplying power 1 to 10—the quantities
measurable being therefore in the proportion of 1 to 500, yet
the accuracy arrived at may be pronounced fully satisfactory.
Combining the results of all these measurements with the
solid ring and with the wire coil, the mean error of a single
reading becomes 0"35 per cent., and the probable error 0"24
per cent.
   The last set of measurements had for its object to show that
a compensating-magnet of the description proposed does not
affect the readings. The results are embodied in Table V.;
they were obtained with one of the older forms of solid-ring
galvanometers provided with a sine-scale. The curved con
trolling magnet of a mirror-galvanometer, 20 centim. long
and 2 centim. broad, was strongly magnetized and placed at
a distance of 24 centim. in the manner formerly specified,
and so arranged that it could bo turned on a horizontal axis.
Three different positions were given to the magnet—viz. one,
in which it assisted the earth's magnetism, another, in which
it did not act upon the needle, and a third, in which the earth's
magnetism was partly neutralized. By altering the resistance
in circuit, the deflections with the vertical ring were made
equal in all three cases, viz. 630,5.

   Table V. shows that the degree of accuracy did not mate
rially differ under the three varying conditions. The magnet
therefore does not appreciably interfere with the measure

0-22 per cent., which is very low.
   In conclusion, I may mention that a smaller model of the
galvanometer, intended for practical use, is now being made,
which will contain all the recent improvements, viz. the fine-
wire coil besides the solid ring, the tangent-scale, the secant-
marks, the air-damping, and the compensating-magnet. The
latter will be so arranged that the " constant " will be consi
derably increased as compared with that due to the earth's
magnetism alone ; thus the needle should be much less
influenced by outer disturbances than before.

 XIV. Tlie Influence of Current, Temperature, and Strength of
    Electrolyte on the Area of Electrification. By Alfred
    Tribe, F.Inst. C, Lecturer on Chemistry in Duhcich College.
 IN the study of the subject of this paper I have employed
       the " electro-chemical method " described by me in the
 Philosophical Magazine, 1881, xi. p. 446. It will be remem
 bered that by this method images of the electrifications pro
 duced on metallic plates are rendered evident to the eye, and
 also that I have almost invariably employed as analyzers plates
 of silver, and as the electrolyte a solution of copper sulphate.
 The areas of the electrifications were found by measuring the
 copper and peroxide of silver respectively deposited or formed
 on the analyzing plate, the copper giving the area of the
 — electrification, and the silver peroxide that of the + elec
 trification. The sum of the two electrifications subtracted
 from the total area of the plate, it will be seen, gives the area
 of non-electrification, i. e. the intermedial space, or that part
 of the plate which separates the + and — , and where the
 electromotive force is incapable of initiating electro-chemical
 action. These measurements are of course only relative.
    The following conditions were common to the several
 experiments to be described:—an electrolytic cell 120 millim.
 broad, 128 deep and 305 long, filled to within 8 millim. with
 copper-sulphate solution ; copper electrodes of the same area
 as the ends of the cell ; a plate (analyzer) of fine silver,
 67 x 7 millim., weighing 0'75 gram, placed lengthwise mid
 way between the electrodes, and between the surface of the
 liquid and the bottom of the cell. The time of each experi
 ment was six minutes. The diagram shows the general

                  on the Area of Electrification.                     91
arrangement—B being the battery; G, tangent-galvanometer;
E, rheostat; and S, switch.
   I. Influence of Current.—In this series of experiments a
5-per-cent. solution of copper sulphate was employed. The
results obtained and the current employed are set out in the
following table. The numbers refer to lengths in millimetres
of the several electrifications and intermedial spaces.

    The usual sign of + electrification was invisible on the
 analyzer in the first experiment, but the — was sufficiently
 marked to permit of measurement.
    The relation which I have already shown to exist between
 the magnitude of the intermedial space on an analyzer and
 the force required to separate an electrolyte into its consti
 tuent ions (Phil. Mag. Oct. 1881) naturally led me to look
 for some well-defined relation between the intermedial apace
 on the analyzers and the current. The electromotive force
 between the electrodes, and therefore, as it may be supposed,
 of the molecules of the electrolyte, varied of course with the

 92              Mr. Tribe on the Influence of Strength
 strength of the current; and the electromotive force set up
 on the analyzers might consequently also be supposed to vary
 in the same way. Now as the force required to overcome
 the affinity of the ions was constant, and as the electromotive
 force decreases from the ends of an analyzer in the position
 of the ones employed, it might be expected that the inter
 medial space would decrease in proportion as the electro
 motive force increased between the electrodes. That such a
 relation exists would appear to be fairly well established by
 the results of this series of experiments. In the annexed
 table the intermedial spaces are given in millimetres side by
 side with the numbers calculated on the supposition that the
 spaces vary inversely as the electromotive force of the elec
 trolytic molecules.

   There are two other points brought out by these experi
ments to which I would direct attention. The one is the
want of uniformity in the increase of the opposite electrifi
cations with the increase of current ; and the other is the
remarkable constancy of the + electrification from one to two
amperes.
   II. Influence of Strength of Electrolyte.—In this series of
experiments the current was constant, one ampere being
employed. The strengths of copper sulphate used for the
several experiments are given in the annexed table of results.

   As already mentioned, the same strength of current flowed
for equal times in the several experiments. It may therefore,
I think, be assumed that the same quantity of electrification
was set up on the analyzers, and, further, that the differences
in the magnitude of the electrifications were determined by
an influence or influences other than that of the quantity of
electricity which flowed into the electrolyte. The resistance of
a solution of copper sulphate increases, as is well known,
with its dilution; and as the current was constant throughout,
the electromotive force of the molecules of the several solu
tions necessarily increased in the same proportion as their
resistances. The variations in the electromotive force must
therefore again be regarded as the chief cause of the differ
ences in the magnitude of the electrifications, and consequently
also of the intermedial spaces. It is certain that the electro
lytic radicals of sulphate of copper were separated on the
analyzers in each of the experiments; but it by no means
follows that the molecular decompositions were identical in
each case; for it is known that the molecular constitution of
salts in solution varies within certain limits with variations in
the proportion of water. The relation already shown to obtain
between the intermedial space and the electromotive force of
similarly constituted molecules would lead to the conclusion
that the intermedial spaces in this series of experiments would
be inversely proportional to the resistances of the solutions,
supposing that their molecular constitutions were similar. I
have not the resistances for the exact strengths of the solu
tions ; but, taking approximations to these, I find the rela
tion referred to holds good in solutions varying from 6 to
12 per cent, of copper sulphate—i. e. where the viscosity on
the one hand, and the tendency to decomposition of the me
tallic salt on the other, perhaps differ so little as to be practi
cally inappreciable. The data &c. are set out in the annexed
table :—

   III. Influence of Temperature.—In this series of experiments
the current was also constant, an ampere being again em
ployed. The strength of electrolyte was likewise constant,

    As a rule, the boundaries of the electro-deposits are nearly
or quite straight; the peroxide-of-silver boundaries, however,
in the experiments above 32° 0. were concave. Thinking
that this concavity arose from the time being insufficient, I
repeated some of the experiments, prolonging .the time to
20 minutes ; but the results were practically the same. The
intermedial spaces in the higher-temperature experiments also
exhibited signs of slight oxidation, which I am inclined to
attribute to the disturbing influence of convection-currents.
    It will be observed that the intermedial space increased as
the temperature increased. This, again, agrees with the prin
 ciple connecting the area of the spaces with electromotive
 force ; for as the temperature increased, of course the resist
 ance of the solution decreased ; the electromotive force of the
 molecules necessarily also decreased; and the magnitude of the
 intermedial spaces increased, in accordance with the principle
 referred to. I have not the resistances of the solutions at the
 temperatures of my experiments, and cannot, therefore,institute
 a numerical comparison.
    The very small + electrifications at the high temperatures
 is very noticeable ; and I have thought tnat this may be not
 unconnected with differences in the action of heat itself on the
 opposite electricities.
     It will be noticed that ono feature common to the experi
  ments described is the inequality in the magnitude of the elec
  trifications of opposite sign on the several analyzing plates.
  This fact naturally attracted my attention some years ago
  (Proc. Eoy. Soc. no. 181, 1877); and the work of this paper
  was undertaken mainly in the hope of throwing light on the
  subject. I cannot say it has brought about the desired result.
  It has, however, cleared away one or two speculations, sug
  gested the direction of further inquiry, and shown, among

            ofElectrolyte on the Area ofElectrification.        95
other things, that the condition of the electrolytic field affects
not only the area of the electrifications, as this was to be fore
seen, but also the ratio of the — to the + electrification. The
numbers in the fifth columns in the above tables show the
great diversity in this respect ; and in my recent paper (Phil.
Mag. June 1883) I referred to more examples, under condi
tions, too, where it appeared very difficult to imagine the
nature of the difference in the condition of the surrounding
molecules. As to the meaning of this disparity in the ratio of
the electrifications, I am unable to form a conception satisfac
tory to myself.
    The work has moreover established the definite relation
already pointed out between intermedial space and electro
motive force. And on an examination into the effects of what
I have named " Dissymmetry in the Electrolytic Discharge,"
in the light of this relation, I believe I observe a difference of
electromotive force of the molecules where the dissymmetry
manifests itself, t. e. on the + and — sides of non-uniform
fields. The evidence consists in differences in the area of the
spaces on analyzers in corresponding parts of the field relative
to the electrodes, or sides of the trough. I find that the area
of the intermedial space on an analyzer on the + side is inva
riably smaller than that on the — side, from which it would
follow that the electromotive force of the molecules on the +
side is invariably the greater. This conclusion is supported
by another observation of a somewhat different character. On
the analyzers c and d, shown in fig. 1, p. 393 of my paper in
the Juae number of the Philosophical Magazine, it is evident
that a greater amount of electrochemical action was set up
on c ; and c, it will be observed, is on the + side of the trough,
 where it has been inferred that the electromotive force of the
molecules is the greater. I think it not improbable that this
difference in electromotive force is related to Faraday's obser
 vation (' Experimental Researches/ Series xii., xiii.) that
" Negative electricity discharges into air at a somewhat lower
tension than positive electricity." The molecules surrounding
the electrode discharging + electricity would, of course, be
differently affected electrically than when the electrode was
discharging — electricity ; and if this bo true of molecules of
air, why may it not bo equally true of the molecules of a solu
tion of copper sulphate or other electrolyte. A difference in
the electromotive force of molecules in corresponding posi
tions would appear, then, to be a feature of dissymmetry in
certain electrolytic fields ; but the more noteworthy effect of
 this dissymmetry is seen in the differences in the area of like
 electrifications on the correspondingly placed analyzers.

 XV. On the Change in the Double Refraction of Quartz pro
       duced by Electrical Force. By W. C. Roentgen*.
IN a previous paper f I have described the electro-optical
      behaviour of plates of quartz cut parallel to the optical
axis, through which the rays of light passed at right angles
to this axis; this I proposed to supplement by a descrip
tion of experiments with plates cut at right angles to the
optical axis. I had already observed most of the optical phe
nomena described in the following paper ; but the explanation
of them was not clear. This is now given by a piezoelectric
examination of the quartz which I have carried out. The
present paper therefore consists of two parts—the first descri
bing the piezoelectric, the second the electro-optical expe
riments.
   Two pieces of quartz were, for the most part, employed for
the piezoelectric experiments. The one is a circular plate cut
exactly at right angles to the optical axis, having a thickness of
0"58 centim. and a diameter of 1*8 centiin.; the other is a
sphere of 3 centim. diameter. Both are of good quality, as
shown by optical examination. It will be clearly seen, in
what follows, how advantageous it is to employ pieces of quartz
of this form, and not crystals with natural faces.
   The plate was employed to subject the piezoelectric beha
viour of quartz described in the first paper to a direct experi
mental proof. The result obtained was that there are in reality
three directions in quartz, all at right angles to the principal
axis, and making angles of 120° with each other, which possess
the property that pressure exerted upon the crystal in any one
of these directions produces no electricity at the points of
pressure: these are the three axes of no piezoelectricity. A
pressure exerted in any other direction at right angles to the
principal axis produces electricity at the points of pressure,
the greatest manifestation taking place in the lines bisecting
tho-angles between the axes named. These lines I called axes
of maximum piezoelectricity. The sign of the electricity pro
duced is in accordance with the previous description.
   In order to exert a pressure upon the plate in a definite
direction a compression-apparatus of ordinary construction
was employed, the opposing steel cheeks of which were faeod
with ebonite plates upon which pieces of silver wire 0*06
centim. thick were cemented. These silver wires were exaetly
opposite and parallel to each other, and the quartz plate was

 compressed between them. This arrangement ensured that
 the points of pressure formed a narrow line upon the plate,
 parallel to the axis of the disk, and that the pressure was
 exerted upon the disk exactly in the direction of a diameter.
     The disk was attached by means of a straw about 4 centim.
 long to a divided circle, so that its axis coincided with the
 axis of rotation of the divided circle. Consequently by
 rotating the circle the direction in which the pressure was
 exerted upon the disk could be changed and the angle of
 rotation read off on the divided circle.
    The frame of the compression-apparatus and the mounting
 in which the divided circle turned wore rigidly attached by
 means of clamps to a stand. To ensure that the pressure
 was always applied in the direction of a diameter the following
 plan was adopted. The quartz plate was covered with a thin
 layer of wax, in which, by means of a fine needle, a considerable
 number of diameters were traced. With the aid of these lines
 it was easy to ensure that the direction of pressure coincided
 with a diameter. One of the two silver wires was connected
 with the delicate electroscope previously mentioned; the other
 was put to earth. The experiment, then, consisted in deter
 mining the direction of no piezoelectricity. The results of a
  single series of experiments will serve as example :—

             Circle,                              increased pressure.

On releasing the compressing-screw electricity of the opposite
kind was obtained in every case.
    These experiments leave no doubt that the angle between
the three axes of no piezoelectricity is 120° ; the single devia
tion observed, which did not amount to 1°, may very well be
set down to experimental error.
    Pressures exerted upon the plate in directions lying
between the axes of no piezoelectricity produced a powerful
 evolution of electricity. Since the electroscope employed was
 not adapted for quantitative experiments, I was not able
 to determine how the quantity of piezoelectricity varied
 with the direction ; it is, however, certain that the largest
 quantity was produced in these intermediate directions. For
 an accurate quantitative determination it would be absolutely
 necessary to take account of the inductive action which the
 electricity excited on the surfaces near the points of pressure
 would exert upon tho electrode connected with the electro
 scope. This action will be considered later on.
     The experiments 'with tho sphere of quartz required a
 somewhat more complicated apparatus. Here also it was
 necessary that pressure should be exerted upon the sphere as
 nearly as possible along a diameter, and that the resulting
 piezoelectricity should bo observed. After numerous experi
 ments with different forms of apparatus, the following arrange
 ment was adopted as the most convenient. The sphere was
 placed upon the stage of an old and large microscope, and
  pressure exerted upon it by lowering the heavy body of the
  microscope down upon it.
     The stage is provided with the necessary screws for exact
  adjustment ; in the circular opening of the stage can be
  placed either a round thick disk of brass or a disk of ebonite
  which fits it exactly. The disk of brass is provided at its
  centre with a depression 0*25 centim. wide, which gives better
  support to the sphere laid upon it ; the sphere therefore does
  not touch the disk in one point only, but in a small circle. A
  small thick brass cylinder 1 centim. long, 0'4 centim. thick, is
  cemented on to the ebonite disk, which is also provided at the
  top with a small depression which lies exactly in the axis of the
  disk of rubber and upon which the sphere rests. The brass
  disk was used when the lower side of the sphere did not require
  to be insulated, and the rubber disk when insulation was
   necessary.
      The microscope-tube, which moved accurately in a solid
  stand by means of rack-work, was fitted at its lower end with
  a piece of brass rod rounded at the lower end and insulated
  by means of ebonite, by means of which the pressure upon

       Refraction of Quartz produced by Electrical Force.             99
the sphere is exerted. It is unnecessary to explain how the
adjustment is effected, and the means adopted to ensure that
the pressure was actually exerted along a diameter. The
tube of the microscope was weighted with 2 kilogrammes;
there was no perceptible friction in lowering it, between the
brass rod and the sphere; any such must be carefully avoided,
since it would cause an energetic excitement of electricity.
    As I designed to test other portions of the sphere for piezo
electricity besides those upon which the pressure was directly
exerted, the gold leaf of the electroscope was not always con
nected directly with the brass rod by means of which the
pressure was exerted, but often with a small metallic holder
fastened to an ebonite rod, in which could be placed at pleasure
either a simple brass wire, or a wire provided with a small
metallic disk*. The ebonite rod was held by a jointed stand,
so that the wire or metal disk which served as electrode could
 be placed in contact with any point of tho quartz sphere.
    The following experiments wore made with this sphere:—
    (1) Besides the three axes of no piezoelectricity, the prin
 cipal axis of the quartz also possesses the property that
 pressure exerted upon the crystal in this direction produces
 no electricity at the points of pressure. The question then
 arises whether there exist also other directions having the
 same property.
    Without having previously determined by optical means
 the position of the principal axis, I placed the sphere upon
 the previously described brass disk of the stage, connected the
 rod producing the pressure with the electroscope, and deter
 mined by experiment the points on the surface of the sphere
 which did not become piezoelectric when pressure was
 exerted upon them in the direction of a diameter. When
 such a point bad been found, it was marked upon the sphere
 by moistening the brass rod with india-ink and then gently
 lowering it upon the sphere. In this way the sphere was
 marked with 40 or 50 small dots. It is easily understood
 that in this examination a somewhat systematic method had
 to be adopted. We find, for example, very soon that certain
 portions of the surface of the sphere become only very feebly
 electric ; these, as seen afterwards, were the portions of the
 surface in the neighbourhood of the ends of a diameter parallel
  to the principal axis. It is difficult here to say exactly where
  no piezoelectricity at all results ; hence these places are not
    * These parte of the apparatus were so constructed as to have as small
 a capacity as possible. The chief advantage of Fechner's Electroscope
 over Thomson's Electrometer, apart from its better insulation, consists in
 its extremely small capacity. The instrument Ls thus well adapted for the
 present investigation.

100     Prof. W. 0. Bontgen on the Change in the Double
marked. On examining the quartz sphere marked with ink-
spots, the result obtained was that the position of these points
is simply determined by three planes which cut each other at
an angle of 120°, in the diameter parallel to the principal
axis, and contain the three axes of no piezoelectricity. The
direction of the principal axis determined in this way agreed
very well with that subsequently found by optical means.
    It hence follows that all straight lines lying in any of the
three planes specified are directions of no piezoelectricity ; a
pressure exerted upon the crystal in one of these directions
produces no electricity at the points of pressure. These planes
are therefore called planes of no piezoelectricity.
    The following values were obtained with the sphere de
scribed, by measurement of the six angles included between
 the three planes :—
                   58°, 61°, 60°, 60°, 59°, 62°.
 These angles ought to be exactly 60°. The deviations from
 this number may result in part from experimental errors ;
they are, however, probably also a consequence of small
 deformations and irregularities of the quartz, the presence
 of which could not be determined by optical methods in eon-
 sequence of the spherical form of the crystal. Such defor
 mations have considerable influence on the distribution of
 piezoelectricity, as Hankel has shown with crystals having
 natural faces. Thus, for example, with another sphere which
 plainly showed visible irregularities, I obtained the following
 angles :—
                   51°, 54°, 69°, 57°, 64°, 65°.
 The experiments with the first crystal were several times
 repeated—thus, for example, once at a temperature of about
 10° C, a second time at about 31°C. I found always the same
 position of the three planes.
    (2) After the position of the planes of piezoelectricity on
 the sphere had been determined and marked, I examined in
 what way the fields lying between these meridians were piezo
 electric. The result was that the electricity excited at all
 points of pressure lying in any one of the six fields was of the
 same kind, but that it changed on passing from one field into
 the next. The whole sphere may therefore be divided into
 six fields alternately positively and negatively piezoelectric.
 For the clearer understanding of what follows, it will bo well
 to designate them 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and to assume that at points
 of pressure lying in the first field positive electricity was pro
 duced : consequently the fields must be marked in order + ,
  -, +, -, +, -.

      Refraction of Quartz produced by Electrical Force.               101
   The further result was obtained that the most energetic
evolution of electricity took place when pressure was exerted
in directions at right angles to the principal axis, and bisecting
the angles between the planes of no piezoelectricity; these are
the directions already designated as axes of maximum piezo
electricity.
   I scarcely need remark that diminution of pressure produces
electricity opposite in kind to that produced by increase of pres
sure ; the same holds good for all the following experiments.
   (3) A pressure exerted in the direction of an axis of no
piezoelectricity produces no electricity at the points of
pressure. The question, however, arises whether under these
circumstances there is no piezoelectricity at other points of
the sphere*. To answer this question, the sphere was so
placed upon the metal disk that the principal axis was at right
angles to the direction of pressure, and so that the pressure
was exerted in the direction of an axis of no piezoelectricity.
The electroscope was connected with the insulated electrode
previously described, which was successively placed in contact
with different points of the sphere, the direction of pressure
remaining unaltered.
   The following results were obtained :—The plane of no piezo
electricity in which the pressure is exerted divides the sphere
into two halves, which both become electric all over, the one
half being positive, the other half negative. The sign of the
electricity produced upon each half is determined by the sign
of the electricity excited on that one of the two fields, divided
by the direction of pressure, which is situated on that half.
Thus, for example, if the pressure takes place in the plane
dividing the field 1 from 6, and 3 from 4, then the half upon
which the fields 1 and 3 lie becomes positive, and the other
half negative.
   Maximum electricity is evolved at the ends of an axis of
maximum piezoelectricity lying at right angles to the direc
tion of pressure—in the above example therefore in the
middle of fields 2 and 5. There is no electricity produced
upon the circle in which the plane of no piezoelectricity
containing the direction cuts the sphere.
   The same result was obtained when the sphere was placed
upon the insulating brass cylinder, or if the support and the
brass rod exerting the pressure were connected with the
earth.
  * Messrs. J. and P. Curie have found that a pressure exerted in the
direction of an axis of no piezoelectricity upon a parallelepiped of quartz
produces electricity at the ends of the axis of maximum piezoelectricity
at right angles to the direction of pressure.

102     Prof. W. C. Rontgen on the Change in the Double
   (4) The further question arises, how the free surface of the
sphere would bo affected if the pressure acted along an axis
of maximum piezoelectricity.
   The quartz sphere was placed in the proper position on the
insulated brass cylinder, the brass rod being also insulated.
The electrical examination of the surface showed then that
the sphere was again divided into two halves charged with
opposite electricities, separated by a plane of no piezo
electricity at right angles to the direction of pressure. The
sign of the electricity was determined by the sign of the fields
as found above in which the points of pressure lay. If, for
example, field 1 was above and consequently field 4 below,
the upper half became positive, and the lower half negative.
The maximum of electricity appeared at the points of pressure,
and no electricity at all along the -circle in which tbc plane of
no piezoelectricity at right angles to the direction of pressure
cuts the sphere.
   If the two points of pressure were connected with the earth,
essentially the same distribution of electricity was observed.
   (5) The sphere was subjected to pressure in a direction
intermediate between an axis of no piezoelectricity and the
nearest axis of maximum piezoelectricity, but still at right
angles to the principal axis; both points of pressure were
 insulated. The sphere was again found to be divided by a
plane passing through the principal axis into two halves
having opposite electricities ; but the plane was no longer
parallel or at right angles to the direction of pressure, but
 lay in the acute angle formed by the direction of pressure
 with the next but one axis of no piezoelectricity. The
 nearer the direction of pressure lay to the axis of no piezo
 electricity the smaller was the acute angle between the
 direction of pressure and the plane of bisection. If in passing
 from one experiment to another the direction of pressure was
 changed so that, to begin with, it coincided with a direction of
 maximum piezoelectricity, and, to end with, coincided with
 the next axis of no piezoelectricity, then the position of the
 plane of bisection also revolved through an angle of 90°
 about the principal axis.
    The sign of the electricity evolved was determined from the
 sign of the fields in which the points of pressure lay. If, for
 example, the point of pressure was situated in field 1, but
 nearer to field 2 than to field 6, then the half of the sphere
 which contained a part of field 2, the whole of fields 6 and 1,
 and a part of field 5 became positively, and the other half of
 the sphere became negatively electric.
    If the pressure acted in the line bisecting the angle between

      Refraction of Quartz produced by Electrical Force.       103
an axis of maximum and an axis of no piezoelectricity, then
the plane of bisection was inclined to the direction of pressure
at an angle which at any rate did not differ much from 45° ;
a more accurate determination of this angle was not possible
with the apparatus at my disposal.
   The maximum piezoelectricity was found at the ends of
the diameter at right angles to the plane of bisection—conse
quently, in the last mentioned case, at the ends of a diameter
at right angles to the axis and inclined at 45° to the direction
of pressure—that is, at the ends of an axis of no piezoelectricity.
   In the three following series of experiments the quan
tities of electricity produced were so small that I cannot
regard the results communicated as absolutely certain. I do
not, however, believe that any different result would bo ob
tained by the use of more delicate apparatus; but such a con
firmation would be desirable.
   (6) A direction lying between an axis of maximum piezo
electricity and the principal axis was chosen as the direction
of pressure. The sphere was divided into two oppositely
electrified halves by that plane of no piezoelectricity which
was at right angles to the plane passing through the direction
of pressure and the principal axis. The sign of the electricity
is determined by that of the fields in which the points of
pressure are situated. If, for example, they lay in fields 1
and 4, then fields G, 1, and 2 were positive, and fields 3, 4, and
5 were negative.
   (7) If the pressure was exerted in any direction different
from those already considered and not coincident with the
principal axis, the sphere was always divided into two oppo
sitely electrified halves by a plane which in all cases passed
through the principal axis.
    (8) Increase of pressure in the direction of the principal
axis produced small quantities of electricity in the six fields,
the sign of which corresponded to the sign of the fields as
given above : the points of pressure were not electrified.
    It follows from the above that, whatever the direction of
pressure, there is never any perceptible evolution of electricity at
the ends of a diameter parallel to the principal axis. It should
be mentioned, that in the dry air of a room the piezoelectric
experiments take place extremely regularly and with certainty.
    An objection may be raised to the results described on the
 ground that they are influenced by induction or possibly bv
 surface-conduction of electricity. It is not to be denied that
these causes, and in particular induction, had a part to play ; but
I have repeatedly convinced myself that these results remained
qualitatively the same when such disturbing causes were

104 Prof. W. C. Rontgen on the Change in the Double
removed. I will mention here only a few of the observations
leading to this conclusion, which will serve to show how
carefully it is necessary to proceed and how the results may
be confirmed.
   Two opposite fields of the sphere, e.g. 2 and 5, were com
pletely covered with tin-foil, but so that the two pieces of tin
foil did not. touch each other ; then the sphere was so placed
upon the insulated brass cylinder that the pressure took place
in the direction of an axis of no piezoelectricity joining the
bounding line between fields 1 and 6 with that between fields
3 and 4. The brass rod by which the pressure is exerted was
in connexion with the electroscope. If then all the fields
remained insulated, the electroscope showed no electricity
upon change of pressure ; but if field 2 were connected with
the ground, positive electricity was observed, produced by the
induction of field 5, which was strongly charged with positive
electricity. The electroscope showed a negative charge if
field 5 alone were connected with the ground.
   If, when fields 2 and 5 were connected with the ground,
field 1 was also put to earth by being touched with the finger,
I obtained a feeble negative deflection of the gold leaf due to
induction by the negative electricity produced on field (5.
   In order to show that in the position of the sphere indicated
it was actually the whole halves of the sphere, and not alone
the fields 2 and 5, which became electrified, these fields were
connected with the earth, and fields 1, 3, 4, and 5 in order
were tested with the electrode connected to the electroscope.
They were found to be, upon increase of pressure, feebly but
decidedly electrified, positively or negatively as the case
might be.
   If the sphere were placed upon the brass disk connected
with the earth, with the covered portions above and below,
and if pressure were exerted upon it in the direction of an
axis of maximum piezoelectricity, positive electricity was
obtained upon the whole sphere if the positive field 5 was
uppermost, but, on the other hand, negative electricity if the
negative field 2 was uppermost. In these cases the inductive
action of the piezoelectricity produced above overpowered
the feeble action of the opposite electricity present upon the
lower half of the sphere. Normal conditions resulted when
the lower field was also insulated. In this position of the
sphere it could be shown that electricity was present upon
the whole whole upper and lower halves, and not only at the
points of pressure.
   If the coated fields were connected with the earth, the
other fields showed qualitatively tho same distribution of
electricity as already described.

       Refraction of Quartz produced by Electrical Force.      105
   I pass on now to describe the electro-optic experiments. I
employed for these experiments the square quartz plate de
scribed in the first paper cut parallel to the side faces, as well
as the parallelepiped marked II. and a small quartz cylinder.
A fuller description of the two first mentioned crystals will
be found in my first paper. The plate was examined both
in parallel and in convergent light. For the experiments with
parallel light, the plate was placed in a horizontal position in
the flask filled with benzol; the lower electrode was the brass
disk provided with two glass strips; the upper electrode a
brass wire projecting into the depression in the plate (compare
the former arrangement of apparatus).
   Sodium-light linearly polarized at an angle of 45° to a
horizontal plane traversed the plate parallel to the principal
axis ; and the analyzer was turned so as to give a dark field.
When electrification took place, the centre of the field of view
—the place beneath the depression—became markedly bright;
the arrangement of the bright places being different according
as the upper or lower electrode was made positive.
   This result surprised mo, since electrical forces acting along
an axis of no piezoelectricity ought to produce no compression
or dilatation in this direction.
   The behaviour of the plate in convergent light was just as
surprising to me. It certainly brought me nearer to an expla
nation of the first experiment; but a complete explanation only
became clear after carrying out the piezoelectric experiments
described above.
   In order to examine the plate in convergent light, glass
tubes 0'7 centim. wide, bent upwards at right angles, were
cemented to the square faces of the plate, and were rilled with
mercury. Then the plate was so placed under a Steeg's
polarizing microscope that the axial image of concentric
circles could be observed, illumination being obtained from a
sodium-flame.
   The tubes containing mercury were severally connected
with the electrodes of the electrical machine. At the
moment that the electricity began to act upon the plate, the
circles became changed into ellipses, the major axis of which,
longer than the diameter of the corresponding circle, made an
angle of 45° with the lines of force (which were at right
 angles to the square faces of the plate); the minor axis was
 shorter than the diameter of the circle. If the plate was so
 gj*ced under the microscope that the side becoming positive
 under pressure was on the right hand, and consequently the
 side becoming negative under pressure was on the left, and if
 positive electricity was conducted to the side turned towards

  106 Prof. W. C. Rontgen on the Change in the Double
 the observer, and negative electricity to the side turned from
 him, then the major axis ran from above on the left, down
 towards the right.
    It is known * that a mechanical compression or dilatation of
 a quartz plate cut at right angles to the axis, in a direction at
 right angles to the axi3, produces a change in the system of
 rays which is similar to that just described. The diameters
 of the circles become lengthened in the direction of pressure
 and shortened in the direction at right angles to this; if, on
 the other hand, the plate is dilated, then the major axis of the
 ellipse is at right angles to the direction of expansion.
    The results of the two last experiments would be at once
 explained, if it were allowable to assume that electrical forces
 acting in the direction of an axis of no piezoelectricity
 produce indeed no change of form in the direction of this
 axis, but compression or dilatation, or both at the same time,
 in directions at right angles to the principal axis, and inclined
 at an angle of 45° to the corresponding axis of no piezoelec
 tricity. How far this assumption is justified could not be
 decided until the piezoelectric experiments which have been
 described had been made; and on that account I have delayed
 the publication of my electro-optical experiments with plates
 cut at right angles to the axis till now.
    The confirmation of the accuracy of this assumption follows
 from the piezoelectric experiments described under (5), and
 from the law of reciprocity of compression and electric charge
 enunciated by Lippmann, and with it the complete explanation
of the above experiments. He found, in the place referred to,
that a pressure exerted upon the quartz at an angle of 45° to
an axis of no piezoelectricity and at right angles to the prin
cipal axis produces piezoelectricity at the ends of that axis,
which is also greater in quantity than that produced at other
points. If, then, we communicate to the ends of the axis
electricity of the same kind as would be produced by pressure
in the given direction, a dilatation of the quartz in this direc
tion must take place ; and, conversely, if electricities are
communicated of the opposite kinds to those resulting from
pressure, compression in this direction must take place. There
are, now, two such directions (which are at right angles to the
principal axis and inclined at 45° to an axis of no piezoelec
tricity) for each of the axes of no piezoelectricity, viz. one on
each side of the axis. From what was said under (5), it
further follows that the electricities which are produced when
a pressure is exerted in one of these two directions are oppo
site to the electricities produced by a pressure in the other

 direction. If, then, positive electricity be communicated to
 one end of an axis of no piezoelectricity and negative elec
 tricity to the other, this electrification must produce a com
 pression in the one direction and simultaneously an expansion
in the other. If the electricities communicated are exchanged,
then there will be also an exchange of compression for dilata
tion. But what has just been said is nothing else than was as
sumed above in explanation of the electro-optical experiments.
    The parallelepiped of quartz designated II. in the first paper
was now examined in parallel as well as in convergent sodium-
light. At first it was placed in the flask filled with benzol
just as before, except that now the rays of light traversed it
parallel to the principal axis. If, then, the analyzer was ad
justed so as to give a dark field, then upon electrification the
place between the perforations became very bright; the distri
bution of the bright parts changed upon reversal. Both these
results were to bo expected, since the perforations were made
in the direction of an axis of maximum piezoelectricity.
In order to investigate the nature of the double refraction
produced, the method previously used of an interposed glass
plate which was compressed in a vertical or horizontal direc
tion could not be employed, since, in consequence of the rota
tion of the plane of polarization in the direction of the prin
cipal axis, the conditions were more complicated than before;
and therefore I made the experiments in convergent light.
    For this purpose glass tubes bent upwards at right angles
were cemented to the end surfaces of the parallelepiped, and
these, together with the communicating perforations, were
filled with mercury. The change in the system of rings lying
in the middle between the perforations produced by electrifi
cation consisted again in the transformation of circles into
ellipses having major axes longer and minor axes shorter
than the diameters of the corresponding circles. The major
axes lay in the direction of a line joining the perforations, and
therefore parallel to the direction of the corresponding axis of
maximum piezoelectricity, if the marked end of the crystal
was positively, and the unmarked end negatively electrified.
This axis, on the other hand, was at right angles to that
direction, if the marked end were negatively electrified and
the unmarked end positively. If we refer to the piezoelectric
behaviour of the crystal used, described in the first paper, we
easily find, by the aid of the piezoelectric experiments given
under 3 and 4, that the optical phenomena observed may be
completely explained by the simultaneous action of an elec
trical contraction in one direction, and an expansion in the
direction at right angles to it.

108    Electrical Effect on the Double Refraction of Quartz.
   I come now to the experiments with the small quartz cy
linder. The axis of the cylinder is parallel to the principal
axis. The cylinder is 0"5 centim. in height and 045 centim.
in diameter, and has an exactly centrical perforation in the
direction of the axis O08 centim, wide ; the end surfaces are
polished. I examined first the piezoelectric behaviour of
the cylinder, and marked the direction of the three axes of no
piezoelectricity. Then the cylinder was cemented by its end
faces with Canada balsam to two glass plates, each 4*5 centim.
long and 1"5 centim. wide, each of which was provided with a
perforation also 0-08 centim. wide. The perforation in the
one plate coincided exactly with the perforation in the cylinder;
the perforation in the other was at a distance of 2 centim. from
that in the cylinder. The edges of the glass plates, which were
parallel two and two, were then cemented together with strips
of glass so as to form a glass box, which was filled with mer-
curv through the bole in the one plate. This mercury, com
pletely surrounding the curved surface of the cylinder, formed
the outer coating of the cylinder, and during the experiments
was connected by means of a wire with the one electrode of
the Holtz machine. The inner coating was formed by a thin
wire passing through the hole in the other glass plate into the
perforation in the cylinder, and connected with the other elec
trode, which was put to earth.
   The apparatus described was placed under tho Steeg's
polarizing microscope, so that the first circle of the system of
rings was concentric with the perforation in the cylinder, and
could be distinctly observed with sodium-light; it is necessary
that the upper system of lenses of the apparatus should be
adjusted at a certain distance, easily found, from the cylinder.
   The electrification of the two coatings of the quartz cylinder
gave rise to the following phenomena. Only the six portions
of the circle which lay in the direction of the three axes of no
piezoelectricity passing through the centre retained their
position ; at all other points there was a displacement either
towards the centre or away from it : this was greatest in the di
rections of the three axes of maximum piezo-electricity passing
through the centre. In each of these directions there was upon
one side a displacement inwards, and on the opposite side a
displacement outwards, corresponding in each case to the piezo
electric and to tho previously observed electro-optic behaviour
of quartz in these three directions. These displacements give
to the ring a shape resembling an equilateral triangle with
 rounded corners. Exchange of electricities changes the posi
tion of the triangle, so that the new position would result by
turning the triangle round from its former position through

experiment described is further worth notice, since it shows
at one glance the changes which take place in the six direc
tions to which special attention has been directed. The result
obtained moreover gave occasion for further electrical experi
ments with quartz, the results of which I hope to describe in
a further communication*.
    It is, I think, unnecessary to detail further electro-optical
experiments with quartz, since all the phenomena I have
hitherto observed may be deduced from the piezoelectric
behaviour. How far the hypotheses which form the starting-
point of my investigation will hold good in all cases yet
remains to be tested by calculation.

                         By Lewis W eight.
   To tlie Editors of tlie Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       Gentlemen,
THE letter of Mr. H. G. Madan leads me to hope that some
        interest may be taken in the construction of mica
designs and combinations; and I therefore give a few hints
from an experience which has been rather tiresome. I also
have used the photographic films spoken of ; but, except for a
few special quarter-wave plates, these would soon be ex
pensive, and the carte-de-visite size are not large enough for
work which requires many squares of equal thickness. More
over it is very tedious to find and mark the " axis" on each
separate film ; I much prefer to select a fairly large slab, of
the best quality obtainable, which will provide a quantity at
a tithe of the cost of the films, and quite as clear. This
should first be split into moderately thick sheets, say two to
four waves in thickness, from which the films can be split
afterwards ; they do not split so evenly direct from the thick
slab. The process described for splitting would, by its tedium,
deter many from doing much with mica films ; and it is not
necessary. The edge being sprung with the point of a sharp
needle, the sheet is laid on a perfectly flat surface, and the
film separated by a thin and smooth paper-cutter of ivory or
tortoise-shell. This is pushed and " coaxed " in gently,
when, in most cases, the film will come evenly off. The main
secret is to have a flat surface to work upon, and to keep the
    * I have commissioned Messrs. Steeg and Reuter, in Homburg vor
der Hohe, to prepare quartz suitable for electro-optical experiments, which,
if desired, can be examined under my direction before delivery.

110            Mr. L. Wright on Mica Films and
 paper-cutter flat down to it. In this simpler way I have split
 many |-wave sheets, measuring, say, 13 inches by 5 or 7 inches
 wide, and plenty of smaller sheets, which by reflection only
 show nine or ten Talbot lines throughout the whole spectrum.
 Coloured films could probably only be obtained by Mr.
 Madan's method. Even the smooth paper-cutter will cause
 signs of bruising or scratching; but this is of no conse
 quence, as every mark totally disappears when cemented with
 balsam. At the same time I should much like to know how
 the trade splitters manage to get their sheets apart without
 this. The best mica I have found was Indian. Mica must
 sometimes occur perfectly colourless, as Mr. Fox gave me
a small sample ; but where more can be got no one seems
 able to say. Such mica would be a great boon in mica-
 selenite or crossed-mica combinations ; but what the trade
 call " white " mica is simply ordinary mica which, owing to
 countless air-bubbles, shows pearly iridescence. When the
original slab is split into sheets the mica " axis " can be most
carefully ascertained and marked on one of these, and then
transferred without further troublo to all the others.
    Since my paper was published I have devised designs
showing, even more beautifully than the " optical chromo-
trope," the rotational colours of circularly-polarized films.
In their startling kaleidoscopic changes on the screen they
almost baffle description, and would certainly puzzle any one
not thoroughly acquainted with the subject. To such it will
be sufficient to say that they consist practically of two or
more superposed circularly-polarized designs, planned to go
thus together, in appropriate positions. As design, polarizer,
or analyzer is rotated, the variety of effect is almost endless,
and beyond any thing I have seen yet in spectacular de
monstration.
    One word further as to prisms. In the note to his able
paper, Mr. Glazebrook apparently refers to a few remarks I
made at the Meeting of the Physical Society where it was
read. In those remarks I referred expressly to the paper by
Hartnack and Prazmowski, of which a translation had been
sent me by the Rev. P. It. Sleeman ; and I am glad to
see that this fine paper has at last been published in English
in the current number of the Journal of the Royal Micro
scopical Society. It seems strange that Hartnack should have
chosen the plane of section, and not direction of the ray, at
right angles to the optic axis, as the best theoretic position,
since, without Mr. Glazebrook's elegant demonstration, it
appears at once that the latter position must give even the
greatest difference in refractive indices—the main object Hart
nack had in view. Some years ago I asked Messrs. Darker

                    Prisms far Polarizing-Purposes.           Ill
 to cut me a prism with its axis at right angles to the optic
 axis, when they informed me that thoy believed their late
 father, so well known for polariscope apparatus, had cut some
 such prism to order many years before. They had an impres
 sion it was for Professor Stokes; but they had no clear
 recollection about it. If it did fail, as they implied, it was
 probably for want of a cementing medium which could take
 advantage of the full interval between the indices, as explained
 by Hartnack in his admirable essay. I trust that Professor
Thompson, in his forthcoming paper, will collect for English
readers wlxat has been done abroad, and describe in an acces
sible form the prisms of Senarmont, Rochon, Grlan, and others.
    Meantime I wish chiefly to point out that, if the full ad
vantage of these improved prisms is to be had, undue length
must be avoided. Most Nicol prisms are longer than they
need be ; and Hartnack by no means does justice to his own
prism in this respect, giving its length as over three times
the width. The Rev. P. R. Sleeman possesses a prism only
2' 75 times its width, cut as below, which performs admirably
in projection, transmitting a much larger pencil and covering
more field. Again, a polarizer can and ought to be made
shorter than an analyzer, since it only has to transmit rays ap
proximately parallel ; hence the reason we can use a Foucault
as polarizer but not as analyzer, owing to its small angle of 8°.
But a more important point still in getting field, especially
for microscope polarizers, is this :—A Nicol section is made
from the corner B of the spar to the
opposite corner, the end elevation
being the rhombus A B C D. For
this there are practical reasons, the
cut being made through a natural
piece of the spar. But in the
Hartnack, Glazebrook, or Thompson
prisms, where all the sides and cuts
are artificial, this reason does not
exist. Hence Prazmowski, in cutting his prisms from corner
to corner like a Nicol, threw away a great deal of field.
This is not theory only; it has been seen by Steeg and
Reuter, who make their Hartnack prism of the very same
length and angle, with the end elevation BFGH, the section
being from the edge E F to the opposite one. A glance will
show that a pencil of double the sectional area will thus
be passed through a prism of the same section-angle and
length. Apologizing for drawing attention to these practical
considerations,                            I am &c,

  XVII. On a General Theorem of the Stability of the Motion
      of a Viscous Fluid. By D. j. KoRTEWEG, Professor of
      Mathematics at tlie University of Amsterdam*.
  THE interesting experimental ' investigation of Prof. 0.
          Reynoldsf on sinuous fluid-motion and the origin of
  eddies induces me to communicate a very general theorem on
  the stability of fluid-motion, which I published some months
  ago in the Transactions of the Royal Academy of Amsterdam.
  Conceiving that the origin of eddies was to be explained by
  the existence of unstable solutions of the equations of motion,
  I endeavoured to find such solutions by means of the well-
  known equations for slow motion of viscous fluid, till I found
  out that in any simply connected region, when the velocities atony
 the boundary are given, there exists, as far as the squares and
 products of the velocities may be neglected, only one solution of
 the equations for the steady motion of an incompressible viscous
 fluid, and that this solution is ahcays stable.
     The first part of this theorem is due to Helmholtz %. He
 shows it to be a very simple consequence of another theorem,
 stating that " the motion be steady, the currents in a viscous
fluid are so distributed that the loss of energy due to viscosity
is a minimum, on the supposition that the velocities along the
boundaries of the fluid are given.'1''
     Though my demonstration of this theorem is somewhat less
general than that, of Helmholtz, I will write it down here, as it
 leads to a very simple and symmetrical expression for the dif
ference between the real dissipation of energy by internal
 friction with any motion and the minimum dissipation con
 sistent with the same velocities at the boundary, which expres
 sion may be useful in other cases.

but then the motion has become steady, and is necessarily
identical with the motion represented by M0."
   Theorem TV.— The mode of motion represented by M0 is
always stable as far as squares and products of velocities may be
neglected.
    Proof. " Let the mode of motion M0 be disturbed by any
cause whatever. Then the dissipation of energy by internal
friction is necessarily increased (Theorem II.) ; but as soon
 as the cause of disturbance ceases it must decrease again
 (Theorem III.) till it reaches the value A0, and then the mode
 of motion M0 is restored."
    From this theorem 1 draw the following conclusions:—
    1st. That the existence of unstable modes of fluid-motion
and the origin of eddies cannot be explained without taking
 into account squares and products of velocities ; for that the
 equations (1) for steady motion with low velocities cannot
 lead directly to eddying fluid-motion, whatever the velocities
 along the boundary be, is a consequence of the well-known
 relations
                   V'f=0, V^=0, v2f=o.
     According to these relations, f, rj, and f can have no maxi

118                Mr. W. Ramsay on the Critical
mum or minimum values in the interior of the fluid ; but then
the angular velocity fl cannot have there a maximum value,
which, taking the axis of x parallel to the direction of the
rotation-axis, would correspond obviously with a maximum
value of f.
   2nd. That though the idea of the possible existence of
unstable solutions of the equations of motion (alluded to, as
far as I know, for the first time by Prof. Stokes*) was very
just and fertile in itself, yet the case of motion which sug
gested it to him is not one of unstable motion, at least not so
unless the squares and products of velocities be taken into
account. It is perfectly true that, when a cylinder of infinite
length moves with uniform velocity through an incompressible
viscous fluid, the state of steady motion never can be reached,
and an ever increasing quantity of fluid will be carried on by
the cylinder. Yet as the dissipation of energy will be ever
decreasing, and even, as may be proved, tending to zero, as
the motion proceeds, such a change in the state of motion as
 Prof. Stokes alludes to, and by which the dissipation of energy
 could only be augmented, cannot occur.
   When, on the contrary, the squares and higher powers of
the velocities are taken into account, I have my reasons for
supposing that, even in the case of a sphere moving with uni
form velocity, no state of steady motion can be reached, and
the motion must finally become unstable.

        XVIII. On the Critical Point ofLiquefiw >le Gases.
                        By William Ramsay.
   To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       Gentlemen,
 IN the July number of this Magazine there is a translation
       of a memoir by M. J. Jainin, presented by him to the
 French Academy. As he has taken no notice of the views
 expressed by me in the ' Proceedings of the Royal Society' for
 1880, April 22nd and December Kith, I think it right to point
 out that the substance of this memoir has been anticipated ;
 and in support of this statement let me quote the following
 passages. M. Jamin states (1) that the critical point of a
 liquid is not to lie regarded, as hitherto, as the temperature at
   * Trans, of the Camb. Phil. Soc. vol. ix. 1849, "On the Effect of the
 Internal Friction of Fluids on the Motion of Pendulums," p. 56.

                    Point of Liquefiable Gases.                   119
which a liquid changes completely into gas, independently of
the extent to which the pressure to which it is exposed is
increased, but as the point at which the specific gravity
of a liquid becomes equal, through rise of temperature, to
that of the gas above and in contact with it. At the top
of p. 326 of the 'Proceedings of the Koyal Society1 I
remark :—" The critical point [of a liquid] is that point at
which the liquid, owing to expansion, and the gas, owing
to compression, acquire the same specific gravity, and con
sequently mix with one another. From the first expe
riment it is seen that on cooling the liquid contracts more
rapidly than the gas, and consequently separates as a mist
through the whole of the tube, and, from its gravity, sepa
 rates at the lower half." M. Jamin again states that if
 a gas be compressed in a closed space, the tension of the gas
 reaches a maximum, and the gas then liquefies at its boiling-
 point under the pressure at which liquefaction takes place.
 Again let me qtiote :—" If the deductions from the above
 experiments be correct, it follows that that form of matter
 which we call gas may be converted into liquid by pressure
 alone ; but the meniscus will never become visible, for the
 process of change is a gradual one. To render the meniscus
  visible it is necessary to take advantage of the fact that
 liquids under such circumstances have a much greater co
  efficient of expansion by heat, and, conversely, a much
  greater contraction on withdrawal of heat, than gases. It
  therefore becomes necessary to lower the temperature until
  the liquid by contraction acquires a specific gravity greater
  than that of its gas ; and then, and not till then, does
  the phenomenon of a meniscus become observable." Again
  (Dec. 16th, 1880), " When a mixture of liquid and gas is
  maintained at a certain volume, the expansion of the liquid,
  in raising the temperature, so long as it is possible to distinguish
  liquid from gas, points to the ultimate occupying of the space
  by liquid at temperatures above which the meniscus becomes
  invisible ; " and again, " Under such circumstances the liquid
  retains its solvent powers, while the gas is incapable of dissol
  ving a solid." For the experimental data on which these
  assertions are based, reference must be made to the original
  paper. M. Jamin next quotes experiments of Cailletet^ in
  which the latter shows that by decreasing the volume of car
  bonic anhydride in the liquid state in contact with gaseous
  matter, oxygen or hydrogen, the meniscus gradually disappears
  when the pressure is increased sufficiently to cause the
  mixture of unliquefied carbonic anhydride and " permanent "

120         On the Critical Point of Liquefiable Gases.
gas to have a density greater than that of the liquid anhydride.
Again M. Jamin has been anticipated. "But I venture to
think that the possession of surface-tension is not a criterion
of the existence of a liquid. And a most striking argument
in support of this theory has lately been furnished by M.
Cailletet (Compt. Rend. xc. 210). He found that carbonic
anhydride at a temperature of 5°'5, when the lower portion
of his experimental tube was filled with liquid, the upper
portion being filled with a mixture of gaseous carbonic
anhydride with air, mixed with the air when a pressure
of 130 atmospheres was applied. The question is a simple
one, Does the gas become liquid, or the liquid become gas ?
Or do they both enter a state to be called neither liquid nor
gas?" For the theory brought forward I must refer to the
original memoirs in the Royal Society's Proceedings ; but if
I have not already trespassed on your space, let me finish
with the last paragraph of my second memoir.
   "The views expressed in this paper are :—(1) That a gas
may be defined as a body whose molecules are composed of a
small number of atoms ; (2) a liquid may be regarded as
formed of aggregates of gaseous molecules forming a more
complex molecule; and (3) that above the critical point the
matter may consist wholly of gas, if a sufficient volume be
allowed ; wholly of liquid, if that volume bo diminished suffi
ciently; or of a mixture of both at intermediate volumes
When prevented from mixing by interposing a capillary
tube between the two, the liquid and gas retain their several
properties."
   I am much interested to find that the further experiments
made by M. Cailletet at the instance of M. Jamin appear to
substantiate these views; and I cannot refrain from expressing
my gratification that they are shared by such a distinguished
physicist as M. Jamin.
   It may be of interest to add that, in one or two experiments,
I have noticed that amyl alcohol near its critical point forms
globules which rise comparatively slowly in the tube in which
it is confined and then disappear. These globules appear to
float, and would present the phenomenon of a liquid lighter
than a gas.
                           I am, Gentlemen,
                                  Your obedient servant,
                                              William Ramsay.

 XIX. The Molecular Volumes of Salt-Solutions. By W.
   W. J. Nicol, M.A., B.Sc, F.R.S.E., 8fc, Lecturer on
    Chemistry, Mason College, Birmingham *.
HITHERTO but little attention has been paid to the
         molecular volumes of salt-solutions ; the phrase, so
far as I am aware, occurs only in the papers of Berthelot,
Thomsen, and Ostwald. The first of these examined the
relation of the heat evolved by the solution of the haloid
acids in water to the molecular volume of the resulting
solutions t; while Thomsen, in addition to experiments with
iodic acid similar to those of Berthelot, has pointed out the
close connexion existing between the molecular heat and
molecular volume of various salt-solutions % . The experi
ments of Ostwald §, quoted by Thomsen (loc. cit.) in support
of the theory of the " Avidity of Acids," are misleading, as
the solutions he employed contained two equivalents of the
salt or acid in every 1000 grms. ; as a consequence, they
contained different quantities of water, and therefore did not
 really admit of comparison.
    The molecular volume of a solution is a measure of the
 space occupied by the molecules of salt and water forming
 the unit of the solution, along with the intermolecular spaces
 separating them. It is obtained by dividing the molecular
 weight of the unit of the solution by its specific gravity ; or,
 generally,

                        Mol. vol. =          g   ,
 where M is the molecular weight of the salt, x and n the
 numbers respectively of salt and water molecules, and 8 the
 specific gravity of the solution.
     I hope in the following pages to be able to show that an
 exact and extended knowledge of the molecular volumes of
  salt-solutions will throw much light on the constitution of
  such solutions, and will probably prove a powerful instrument
  in investigating the constitution of the salts themselves.
  With this object in view, I give first the results of the more
  complete and important of my experiments in this direction,
  and shall then proceed to state the conclusions I feel warranted
  in drawing from them. My method of experiment is the
  same as that described in my former paper || ; but, inasmuch as

   When a salt is in the solid state, its molecular volume
evidently expresses the space occupied by its molecule along

                     Volumes of Salt-Solutions.                123
with that fraction of the intennolecular space that clearly
belongs to that molecule. Only, therefore, on the supposition
that the intermolecular spaces, in different salts in the solid
state, are coextensive, or nearly so, does the molecular volume
give any clue to the constitution of the salt ; but I venture to
submit that the molecular volumes of salt-solutions do more
than this, and that it is possible, by the comparison of similarly
constituted solutions, and the elfect of heat and concentration
on their molecular volumes, to determine, not only the mole
cular volumes of the salts themselves, but also that of each of
their constituents, as has, to some extent, been accomplished
in the case of organic liquids.
    If we compare the molecular volumes (Table I.) of the salts
of the same acid-radical with different metals, and also those
of the- same metal with different acid-radicals, we obtain the
following results :—

   Thus we find, in all the above cases, that the substitution
of one metal for another in combination with the same acid-
radical, or the replacement of one acid-radical by another
under the same conditions, is attended by an alteration in the
molecular volume of the solution, which, in each case, is nearly

126          Mr. W. W. J. Nicol on the Molecular
a constant quantity. The volumes, therefore, of the above
elements and groups of elements are independent of the
manner in which they may be combined together, provided
only they be determined in solution in water and under the
same conditions. Now such is not the case in the solid state.
Taking the molecular volumes of the above salts, calculated by
Schroder* from the most reliable determinations of the specific
gravity of the solid salts, we have the following :—
              (K-Na)Cl          =37-4-27-1 =10-3,
              (K-Na)NOs =48-5-37-6 =10-9,
              (K-Na,(^) = (5!^)=3-l.
              k(01-^) =37-4-16-4=21,
              Na(ci-^-4) = 27-1-13-3=13-8.
              K(NOs-Cl) =48-5 -37-4=11-1,
              Na(N03-Cl) = 37-6-27-1 = 10-5.
    All attempts to extend the experiments of Kopp on liquids
to the case of solid salts have, I believe, failed, or at the best
been attended by only partial success, owing doubtless to the
impossibility of obtaining these under such conditions that
their molecular interspaces are even approximately compa
rable. This, however, is not the case with some isomorphous
 salts examined by Thorpe t and others ; but I shall return to
 this point later on. Meanwhile I believe that I am justified
 in concluding, from my experiments above, that, wlien salts
 are dissolved in water, the molecular interspaces in various
 solutions are approximately coextensive. Hence it is possible
 to ascertain the relative molecular volumes of the salts them
 selves with a degree of accuracy equal, at least, to that with
 which the molecular volumes of liquids have been determined.
     I will now consider the causes which lead to the variations
 in the difference between the molecular volumes of two salt-
 solutions, and which thus affect the accuracy of the above
  determinations. Putting the errors of experiment on one side,
  we have the main cause in the effect of concentration on the
  volumes of the solutions compared, or, what is the same thing
  (as I hope to be able to show), in the different solubilities of the
  two salts. Among the best-marked instances given above, we
 find two cases in which A increases with the concentration,

the solution is most dilute. If we compare the most concen
trated and the most dilute solutions of the same salt, we can
ascertain what effect concentration has on the molecular
volume of the salt. This is done in Table VII., where the
volume of the water is assumed constant =1800.

    The numbers in the columns headed Mol. vol. are the
molecular volumes of one molecule of the salt in a solution
which contains x molecules to 100H3O ; the difference is the
increase of the molecular volume of each molecule produced
by the increase in concentration shown by the column
headed x.
   A glance at these differences will show the immediate
reason of the increase or the diminution, as the. case may be,
of the differences between the pairs of salts, when the solution
is concentrated. In the first two cases, (K— Na) CI and
K(N03— CI), the salt with the larger molecular volume has
it increased by concentration at a rate faster than that of the
other ; and the converse is true with regard to K fci—
           (SO \
            CI     a^J, for here it is the one with the smaller
molecular volume on which the effect of concentration is
more marked.
    To find, however, the real cause of this we must bear in
 mind that, in the first instances, it is the first member of each
pair of salts that is least soluble in water, while in the latter
it is the second member of each pair of which this is true.
 The solubilities in terms of salt-molecules to 100 water-mole
 cules are approximately:—                    V

                             All at 20° C.
   We have therefore arrived at the following :—
   In the case of salts when compared in pairs, the increase
of molecular volume by concentration is greatest with the less-
soluble salt. Why is this ? When viewed in the light of the
theory of solution which I recently stated in a paper* read
before the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the reason is evident.
In that paper I suggested that the solubility of a salt
in water was due to " the attraction of the molecules of water
for a molecule of salt exceeding the attraction of the mole
cules of salt for one another ;" and that " as the number of
dissolved salt-molecules increases, the attraction of the dis
similar molecules is more and more balanced by the attraction
of the similar molecules ;" and that this last increases until
the two forces balance, when saturation takes place. I also
showed that the rate of increase in the density of a salt-solution
is less than the rate at which it becomes more concentrated,
but that when a solution is sufficiently dilute no further
dilution affects its specific gravity ; as a consequence, the
molecular volume of the salt dissolved is constant. It is
evident from the above that the effect of concentration in
increasing the molecular volume of a solution is due to the
molecules of salt coming more and more within the sphere of
one another's attraction, and being thus brought nearer and,
nearer to the point at which crystallization takes place. Now
what is true of the same salt in solutions of different strengths
is equally true of solutions of the same strength of salts whose
solubilities are different ; and it follows that the less soluble
salt will have its molecular volume increased by concentration
faster than the more soluble salt. Such, I believe, is the
explanation of the variations in the differences above observed;
and, as a consequence, if the salt-solution be sufficiently dilute,
the differences between their molecular volumes are constant.
   The next point to be considered is the influence of rise
of temperature on the molecular volumes of salt-solutions.
Table V III. contains the requisite data. These are the results
of single experiments, and are therefore not of equal accuracy
with the data in Table I., nor, in consequence, do the values
at 20° correspond exactly with those given in that table ; but
they are accurate in general to + '00005 in the specific gravity.
   The column headed Difference contains the increase of
molecular volume due to heating from 20° to 40°. This refers
to the salt alone ; for water = 1 , both at 20° and 40°.

130           Mr. W. W. J. Nicol on the Molecular
    The last column (D) contains the difference divided by x,
and thus gives the increase of volume for each molecule of
salt present.
    A glance at the table will show that, in every case, the
increase of the molecular volume by heating from 20° to 40°
is inversely proportional to the strength of the solution. In
other words, the more dilute a solution is the greater the
increase of its molecular volume by heat per molecule of
dissolved salt. This is, I believe, inexplicable by the hydrate
theory of solution. It appears impossible that a solution
which contains only one molecule of salt to 100 molecules
of water should experience a greater change of molecular
volume per salt-molecule than a solution of the same salt
containing two salt-molecules.             This is, however, in ac
cordance with the theory * of expansion of salt-solutions
which I put forward at the end of my paper on the Nature
of Solution. At that time the only data at my disposal were
the results obtained by Kremers and others, whose experi
ments were made with non-molecular solutions. The above
table, however, fully bears out my previous statement that the
expansion of a solution is the result of the action of heat on
the resultant of the three forces—the attraction of water for
water, that of water for salt, and that of salt for salt, the
last two being inversely proportional to one another.
    In the cases considered in the first part of this paper, it is
 clear that a variation in the composition of the salt necessitates
 a corresponding change in the molecular volume of the
 solution containing that salt. This, however, holds true only
 of salts non-isomorphous in the strict sense of the term—that
 is, of heteromorphous and homeomorphous salts. When, how
 ever, two salts are strictly isomorphous, that is isotomous,
 they preserve their isotomy in solution. The last six salts
 given in Table I. come under this head ; they are the members
 of the so-called magnesian-sulphate group, which crystallize
 (except Cu804) with 7HsO, and then possess approximately
 identical molecular volumes t- This is also true to some
 extent of their solutions, which have nearly the same molecular
 volumes. What the slight variations may be due to I am not
 in a position at present to prove ; but enough has been said to
 show that the intermolecular spaces in isomorphous salts are
 comparable, and that true isomorphism is conditioned by the
 molecule itself ; while with salts which are isomorphous in the
 wider sense (homeomorphous), such as the chlorides, bromides,

 &c. of sodium and potassium, the apparent isomorphism is the
result, not of the isomorphism of the molecules themselves,
 but of the mutual relations of the molecules and intermolecular
 spaces being such as to produce the same crystalline form.
    In conclusion, I may be allowed to point out that this
method of investigating the molecular volumes of salts is, in
all probability, capable of extension to organic substances ;
and that, by comparing solutions of various organic bodies
which differ by one or more CH2-groups, or in other respects,
it may be possible to determine the volume of these differences.
Such solutions need not necessarily be aqueous. At present,
I have made only a few experiments in this direction ; these
were with formiate, acetate, and butyrate of sodium ; the
results are given in Table IX. Analysis showed that, while
the formiate and acetate of sodium were pure, the butyrate
contained 21*7 p. c. of sodium, theory requiring 20*9 p. c.
All attempts to purify the small quantity at my disposal were
vain ; the impurity was probably acetate ; this would tend
to reduce the molecular volume by increasing the specific
gravity.

XX. Note on the Measurement of the Electric Resistance of
   Liquids. By Professors W. E. Ayrton, F.R.S., and John
   Perry, M.E.*
                            [Plate II.]
SOME time back a paper was communicated by Prof.
       Eeinold to this Society on the Resistance of Liquid
Films, which had a double interest, arising from the great
value of the results arrived at and from the method employed
to obtain them. It is of course well known that the great
difficulty in measuring the resistance of a liquid arises from
the polarization of, or actual deposit of gases on, the anode
and cathode, which makes the apparent resistance of the liquid
far greater than the true value. To overcome this difficulty
Kohlrausch employed rapidly alternating currents; and Dr.
Guthrie, with Mr. Boys, dispensed altogether with the anode
and cathode by observing the amount of twist produced in a
fine steel wire supporting a vessel of liquid when a magnet
was rotated at a fixed speed in the neighbourhood.
   But there is another method of measuring the resistance of
a liquid independently of its polarization—the one so success
fully employed by Prof. Remold, and which consists in
measuring by means of an electrometer the potential-difference
at two fixed points in a column of the liquid when a current
of known strength is passing through it.
   At the time Prof. Reinold communicated his paper, we
mentioned that some years previously certain experiments had
been conducted in our laboratory in Japan for the purpose of
ascertaining how far the electrometer method of measuring
the resistance of a liquid was entirely independent of polari
zation; and as we have since come across the results of these
experiments in turning over some papers, we have thought
that the information may possess some interest for the Mem
bers of this Society. The experiments were made at the com
mencement of 1878 by some of our students; and the first
part of the investigation was for the purpose, of ascertaining
how the resistance of water varied with the electromotive force
employed and with the temperature of the water when, first,
the resistance was measured by the current which a known
electromotive force could send between platinum plates of
known size and at fixed distances apart in the water, and,
secondly, when the resistance was measured by a comparison
of the potential-differences of two platinum wires placed in
the water at fixed distances apart, with the potential-differ-

      Measurement of the Electric Resistance of Liquids.         133
ences when the same current was being sent through a known
resistance.
   Figs. 1 and 2, PI. II., show the arrangement of the apparatus
used in the experiments. B is the battery producing the cur
rent passing between the platinum plates P and P'. G is a
delicate reflecting galvanometer measuring the current. E is
a quadrant-electrometer which measures the difference of po
tentials between the two wires W and W. These two platinum
wires W and W were immersed in glass tubes ; and their ends
were above the bottom of the glass tubes as shown. Figure 1
shows the connexions when the differences of potentials be
tween W and W were being measured by the electrometer,
and figure 2 when the differences of potentials at the two ends of
the known resistance-coil, of 10,000 ohms, were being measured.
   The following Table gives the dimensions of the various
parts of the apparatus:—

    Before each experiment, when no current was passing, the
 difference of potentials between the plates and wires was
 reduced to 0, if not 0 already. The wires W and W were heated
 to redness before each experiment, and the platinum plates
 cleaned.
    At the beginning pure distilled water was used; and this
 water was not added to all the time : it therefore lost a little
 by evaporation during the course of the experiment, and may
 have become a little dusty ; but as the main object of the in
 vestigation was to examine the method of testing, and not for
 the purpose of measuring the specific resistance of water or of
 any other particular liquid, this result was of little consequence.
    The following is a sample of the experiments made:—
    January 25, 1878.— Battery-power employed                 of 23
 Daniell's cells, having an E.M.F. of 4-08 volts, and which
 gave a deflection of 468 divisions on the galvanometer when
 shunted with the y^-ir shunt, and when a resistance of
 10,000 ohms was introduced in the circuit.

     Only one number is given for the resistance as determined
by the electrometer in each case, because it was found not to
vary much during the time of electrification ; whereas the

              of the Electric Resistance of Liquids.          135
resistance as determined by the galvanometer, as will be seen,
increased in the earlier experiments 30 to 40 per cent, during
the three minutes' electrification.
   The total electromotive force in each case was determined
by making a comparison by means of the electrometer with
one of Clark's standard cells.
   From these observations the following conclusions may be
drawn:—First, the resistance measured by the galvanometer
is much greater when using about 1 volt than when using
nearly 2, at the same temperature (compare observations A
and B), whereas the electrometer-measurements altered very
little at all. Again, comparing C and D, we see that the
resistance measured by the galvanometer is much greater
when using 6 volts than when using 16. In this case, how
ever, the measurements of the electrometer are also consider
ably greater in the first case than in the second, the tempera
ture being the same. Secondly, if the electromotive force is
less than the decomposing electromotive force, then the smaller
it is the more does the resistance alter from one to two minutes'
electrification, and from two to three minutes'. Whenever,
however, the electromotive force is sufficiently high for decom
position to take place, the electrification seems to produce but
little change in the resistance. The resistance of the water
diminishes as the temperature rises, the electromotive force
being kept constant.
   The following experiments were made preliminarily to ex
plorations of the region between the two platinum plates in
the water, for determining what were the directions of the
lines of flow of current. We desired to see if there was any
chance of being able to use platinum wires in glass tubes con
nected with the electrometer, as previously described.
   In the following cases a long trough of water was used
instead of the beaker.
   The sensibility of the galvanometer was nearly the same
throughout all the experiments, and was such that ^ of
the whole electromotive force employed produced a deflection
of about 500 divisions when there was an external resistance
of 10,000 ohms and when the multiplying-power of the shunt
employed was 100*7, which shunt was used throughout all the
experiments.
   Four Menotti cells, having an electromotive force of 3'7
volts, were employed in each of the following experiments.
In A, B, C, D, E, F, and G the two platinum plates were
placed parallel to one another at a distance of 90 centimetres
apart. The two wires and their glass tubes were placed to
commence at a distance of 80 centim.—that is, each being
5 centim. from the platinum plate. The lower ends of the

136        Professors Ayrton and Perry on the Measurement
platinum wires were each 1£ centim. above the lower ends of
the glass tubes ; and the lower ends of the glass tubes were
1 centim. below the surface of the water. The two platinum
plates and one of the platinum wires were kept immovable,
while the other platinum wire was moved along the trough.

   The object, of course, of taking the galvanometer-readings
was to ensure that no material change was taking place in the
current through the weakening of the battery or otherwise
while the experiment was being made.
   The experiments E and F appear most satisfactory of this
set ; and from these it seems that the resistance of the upper
layer of water-column is nearly proportional to the distance
between the platinum wires, except for the nearest distance,

                of the Electric Resistance of Liquids.          137
in which case the column seems to have a slightly larger
resistance than it ought to have. This perhaps arose from the
fact that, although the platinum plates nearly filled up the
entire section of the trough, still the lines of flow at the
platinum wire, which was kept stationary at a distance of
5 centimetres from one of the plates, were not quite parallel
to the edge of the trough.
   The two following sets of experiments, H and I, differ from
the preceding only in that the lower end of the glass tube was
one centimetre above the bottom of the trough ; and from
these two sets of experiments we see that the resistance of the
lower layer of water-column, as measured by the electrometer,
is nearly proportional to the distance between the wires, except,
again, for the shortest distance.

    The next experiments were for the purpose of seeing whether
 the potential, as measured by the electrometer, would come

    " Up " means that the lower end of the glass tube was

 that it was about 1 centim. above the bottom of the glass

above the bottom of the glass tube when the glass tube was
down and the electromotive force was unaltered. The poten
tial therefore, at all points in a vertical transverse section as

138       Professors Ayrton and Perry on the Measurement
well as at all points in the glass tube, is the same as measured
by the electrometer.
   The next set of experiments, K and L, were made under
exactly the same conditions as A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, with
the exception that the terminal platinum plates were now per
pendicular to each other, the plate towards which the wire was
moved being parallel to the long side of the trough.

   The resistance of the longer column of the water as mea
sured by the electrometer is about the same as before, whereas
that of the shorter is even greater ; so that the resistance for
the 80-centimetre column is even still less than four times
that for the 20-centimetre one. But since the platinum plate
near the stationary platinum wire was in these last two sets of
experiments K and L kept parallel to the trough (that is,
parallel to the mean direction of the lines of flow), it follows
that any want of parallelism of the lines of flow to the edge
of the trough at the point where was the stationary wire
would be exaggerated by this mode of placing the plate ; and
since we observe that the error in the proportional law for
distance is also increased, we may conclude that the explana
tion given above of the want of perfect accuracy in the pro
portional law being due to want of perfect parallelism in the
lines of flow is the correct one.
   In all the previous experiments the distance between the
electrometer-wires only was altered ; but in the next set
the distance between the platinum plates as well as that be
tween the platinum wires was altered, the distance between
each plate and wire being kept constant. Further, the resist
ance determined from the electrometer was calculated, not, as
before, by comparing the electrometer-deflection when its
electrodes were attached to the platinum wires with the deflec
tion obtained when its ends were attached to a known resist
ance traversed by the same current, but by first determining
the absolute value, in volts, of the electrometer-scale with the

   The resistance, therefore, as measured by the galvanometer,
does not increase as rapidly as the distance separating the
plates, while that as measured by the electrometer is fairly in
proportion to the distance. The explanation of the former is
probably due to the fact that, since the electromotive force
employed in all these four sets of experiments was constant, a
greater current flowed when the plates were nearer than when
they were far apart, hence that the resistance due to the layer
of gas was greater when the plates were near than when they
were far.
   And this leads to a simple method of accurately measuring
the resistance of liquids by using a galvanometer. The
method, which was independently arrived at by one of our
assistants (Mr. Mather), is now employed in our laboratory,
and is so simple that we feel it can hardly be novel. It is as
follows :—In a long vertical glass tube containing the liquid
there are two metallic disks, not necessarily of platinum, and
of about the same diameter as the tube. One of these can
slide up and down the tube, so as to be able to be set at any
fixed distance from the other. The disks are first put tolerably
far apart, and a certain convenient current made to flow,
which is measured on a galvanometer in the circuit. The
plates are now made to approach and the current kept exactly
the same by the insertion of an external resistance; whence it
follows that the resistance of the column of liquid which has
been subtracted from that originally separating the plates is
equal exactly to the external resistance necessary to be inserted
to keep the current constant.
                       February 28, 1878.
   The next set of experiments was made to determine the
alteration in resistance of a long trough of water when the
distance between the centres of the platinum plates was kept
constant at 90 centimetres, and the positions of the platinum
plates varied as shown in the figures.

   Two sets of experiments in the reverse order were taken to
eliminate any change that might take place in the deflection
 from weakening of the battery, or from polarization of the
plates, or from set of the galvanometer-fibre. The constant
distance between the centres of the plates was now diminished
to 20 centimetres, when the following results were obtained,

   Both therefore at the greater and at the less distance the
resistance is least when the platinum plates are edge on ; a
result that could hardly have been expected for the longer
distance, considering that the width of each plate was only
about 6 centimetres.

   In the following experiments one plate only was turned.
The galvanometer nad about the same sensibility as before.
The^y shant was used when the distance between the
centre of the plates was 90 centimetres, and the               shunt
when it was 20 centimetres. An electromotive force of 3"8

     Here again, then, the resistance is least with the plate end
 on, even when the distance between the centres of the plates
 is as much as 80 centimetres.
     This apparent anomaly of the smaller resistance obtained
 when one or both plates is put end on is, as was pointed out
  by Mr. Boys, probably due to the smaller density of the gas
  which is deposited on a plate when it is put end on (in conse
  quence of the current flowing from both sides of the plate into
  the liquid under these circumstances) more than compensating
  for the want of parallelism of the lines of flow when one or
  both of the plates are put end on.

about this line, its rotation (its surface being supposed fric-
tionless) will not affect the motion.
   This result is not in contradiction (as Mr. Heath maintains)
to the fact that the particle moves uniformly in a great circle;
as the following proof shows.
   Take the particular case discussed by Mr. Heath—that of a
particle projected from the equator along a meridian towards
the north. The relative initial velocity here is northward, and
must be compounded with the westward velocity of the equator
to get the absolute initial velocity. Let (f> denote the angle
which this resultant velocity makes with west, and fl the con
stant angular velocity with which the particle moves in its own
great circle—a circle which cuts the equator at the angle <f>.
Also let X, / denote the absolute latitude and longitude of the
particle, measured from the starting-point. Then the particle
in time t describes an arc ilt which is the hypotenuse of a
spherical right-angled triangle having X and / for sides, and <f>
is the angle opposite to the side X.
   Hence, by spherical trigonometry,

This is the angular velocity round the earth's axis. Let R

    In the meteorological application which is under discussion,
the moving air receives not merely an initial impulse but a
 steadily applied force directed towards the north, as it travels
 from lower to higher latitudes. Mr. Heath's argument to
show that it can never reach the polar regions is therefore
beside the mark.
    In spite of the very bitter tone which Mr. Heath has chosen
to adopt towards Mr. Ferrel, he is thus clearly wrong in the

XXII. On the Determination in Absolute Units of the Inten
   sities of Powerful Magnetic Fields. By A. Gray, M.A.,
   F.R.S.E., Chief Assistant to the Professor of Natural
   Philosophy in the University of Glasgow*.
SO far as I know, no method has yet been published by
       which the intensity of a powerful magnetic field, such as
that in the space in which the armature-coils of a dynamo
move between the poles of the field-magnets, can be deter
mined in absolute measure ; and inventors of dynamos and
other experimenters in practical electricity have hitherto, at
a great expense of time and money, had to construct their
actual apparatus, and find by the results obtained in actual
practice the efficiency or non-efficiency of their arrangements.
So much so has this been the case that it has even been
held that the absolute value of the intensity of a mag
netic field is a thing with which practical electricians have
no concern, that, although theoretically it may have some
importance, it has no application in practice. That all
measurements, whether of electric or of magnetic quanti
ties, should be expressed in absolute units—that is, in units
altogether independent of the locality, surroundings, and
apparatus of the experimenter—is, I think, of very great im
portance, if these results are to be of any service to others.
And it would, I feel sure, be a great benefit to all engaged in
practical electrical work, if the intensities of the magnetic
fields obtainable with various forms of electromagnets, made
with different kinds of iron, were determined in absolute
units and published with full particulars of the apparatus.
But failing the knowledge which would be derived from ex
periments such as these, a very great saving of time and
money might be made if the inventor of a dynamo, for
example, were to first make models of his magnets on a small
scale, and determine the mngnetic-field intensities obtainable
in them with different current-strengths, and then to reason
from the results in the model to those in the full-sized machine.
The object of the present paper is to describe some methods
by which the intensity of a powerful magnetic field may be
determined in absolute units. The methods are wholly due
to Sir William Thomson ; but for the sketch of theory given
                     * Communicated by the Author.

               Intensities ofPowerful Magnetic Fields.          145
  below for each, the details of the experimental arrangements,
  and the results I am alone responsible.
      (a) The first method, which is somewhat interesting theo
  retically, is one which was used in the
  determination of the magnetic field-in
  tensities in the space in which the
  signal-coil is suspended in some of Sir
  William Thomson's Siphon Recorders
  made with permanent magnets. In it
  advantage is taken of the signal-coil,
  which consists of a rectangular coil a
  little more than 5 centim. long and
  2 centim. broad, made of thin wire and
 supported by a silk thread above, so
  as to hang in a vertical plane round
 a rectangular core of iron, which
  nearly fills, but nowhere touches, the
 coil. To the lower end of the coil two
 silk threads are attached, as shown in
 the diagram, and are stretched against
 a bridge B by two weights resting on
 the inclined plane W. This bifilar
 arrangement gives a directive force,
 tending to bring the plane of the coil
 into parallelism with that of the bifilar
 threads ; so that when the coil is dis
 turbed from that position, which is one
 of stable equilibrium, and then left to
 itself, it will, if the circuit be not
 closed, vibrate about the position of
 equilibrium with a determinate period
 of oscillation, with slowly diminishing
 range, until at last it comes to rest.
 But if the circuit be closed through a high resistance, the
 coil will come more rapidly to rest; and if we gradually
 diminish this resistance, deflecting the coil through the same
 angle and noting its subsidence at each diminution, we
 shall find it come more and more quickly to rest, until a
resistance is obtained with which in circuit it just returns to
 the position of equilibrium without passing that position.
 When this resistance has been determined, the strength of the
field can be calculated.
    Let 8 be the deflection of the coil from the position of equi
librium at time /, and T its period of oscillation when the
circuit is not closed. We have then, neglecting the resist
ance of the air and other disturbances, for the equation of
motion,                     #q 47r2
                                     ¦0=0.

146         Mr. A. Gray on the Determination of the
    Let now the circuit of the coil be closed ; a retarding force
due to the current induced in the wire, and, if the effect of
self-induction be neglected, proportional to the angular velo
city, will act on the coil ; and the equation of motion for this
case will be of the form
                       d(>+kdi+vd-°                               (2)
   For let I be the mean intensity of the magnetic field over
the space occupied by the coil at time t, M the electromag
netic inertia (coefficient of self-induction) of the circuit for that
position of the coil, E the total resistance in the circuit, /*
the moment of inertia of the coil round a vertical axis passing
through its centre, L the effective length of wire in the coil
(that is, the length of wire in its two vertical sides), and b
the mean half-breadth of the coil. If we call N the number
of lines of force which pass through the coil at time t, and
y the strength of the induced current in the coil at that in
stant, we have plainly
              N = MLsin0-My.
The rate at which N increases per unit of time is therefore
and if 8 be small, and I be therefore supposed the same for
 every position of the coil, we have approximately
              -dJ = bILdt-dt^-
 But -3- is the electromotive force due to the inductive action ;
 hence the current 7 is by Ohm's law given by the equation
                          ML d6
    It was assumed that the second term of this expression for
 7 would prove negligible in comparison with the first ; and
 this assumption was so far justified by the results of the expe
 riments, which agreed fairly well with results obtained, for
 other instruments of the same pattern, by a modification of
 the second method described below.
    The couple due to the action of the field on the current
 is ML7 ; and therefore, on the supposition of negligible self-
 induction, the retardation of the angular velocity of the coil
 at time t is

When L and l> are expressed in centimetres, /i in grammes
and centimetres, T in seconds, and E, in centims. per second,
 I is given by this equation in absolute C.G.S. units of mag
netic field-intensity.
    The method of experimenting consisted in first finding the
value of T, the free period of vibration of the coil with
its circuit uncompleted, then finding the resistance which,
being placed in circuit with the coil, just brought the needle
to rest without oscillation. This resistance was conveniently
obtained by means of a resistance-box included in the circuit,
and therefore added no self-induction to that in the coil. An
aluminium arm attached to the coil, and carrying the siphon,
served as an index to render the motions of the coil visible.
The resistance R was first made much too great, so as to give
a slow subsidence, then gradually diminished until the value
which just prevented oscillation was reached; and it was
found that this value could be determined easily within 50
ohms, and, with great care, to 20 ohms. As the experiments
on the recorders had to be made somewhat hurriedly, and, on
account of the disturbances, neglected, and, further, as fi was
taken as equal to W62, where W is the mass of the coil,
the results could not be taken as giving more than a rough
approximation to I ; but those for two instruments are given
below in illustration of the method. For both instruments
the values of TV, L, and b were the same, and were respec
tively taken as 3-343 grammes, 3338 centim., and -95 centim.
Each coil had a mean vertical length of 5'3 centim., a mean
breadth of 1*9 centim., and contained 45"72 metres of fine wire
arranged in 290 turns, and had a resistance of about 500 ohms.

tromagnets, and it depends on the action between a magnetic
field and a conductor in the field carrying a constant current.
The ends of the cores of the electromagnets were long straight
surfaces of iron, separated from the surface of iron placed
opposite to them by only a narrow space at each pole. In
the experiments, of which I give some results below, the
intensity of the field was found, in a space about 2 millim.
wide, between one end of the iron core of an electromagnet
and the surface of a thick piece of iron. The length of the
pole-face was 30 centim. The magnet and corresponding
iron were placed with their faces vertical ; and a copper wire
was suspended vertically in the space between them, and in
sulated from their surfaces. The lower end of the wire dipped
into a mercury-cup, and its upper end into a second mercury-
cup on the top of the electromagnet, without touching the sides
or bottoms of the cups. By means of these cups the wire
could either be put in series with the coil of the electromagnet
or in circuit with an independent battery or generator. The
wire was hung in a vertical position (as shown in the diagram)
from the lower end of a cord about two metres long, attached
to a firm support above, and was kept taut by two half-pound
weights (represented by the single weight W in the diagram)
hung at the ends of a cross bar firmly attached to the wire.
The position of the wire was adjusted by shifting the point of

attachment of the cord above until the wire was exactly oppo
 site two marks, one at the upper end and one at the lower
 end of the vertical central line of the pole-face. A thin
 thread, tlf was attached to the wire just above the electro
 magnet, and carried out to one side nearly horizontally, and
attached by its other end at a point near the lower end of
 the cord of the pendulum, P,. A second thread, t3, was
 attached to the lower end of the wire, and carried out parallel
 to the thread ti, and attached to a second pendulum, P2, at a
 somewhat greater distance from the wire. The pendulums,
 Pj, Ps, were simply weights, in some cases of half a pound
each, and in other cases 100 grammes each, hung by fine
cords from one to two metres long from blocks, pi, plf
which could be moved along a horizontal scale, S1} placed
nearly in a vertical plane passing through the wire at right
angles to the coil of the electromagnet, and therefore parallel
to the pole-face. A second scale, S2, placed just above the
point of attachment of the upper thread, and nearly in the
same vertical plane as S1; gave the position at any time of a
point in each of the pendulum-cords at the same distance
below the point of suspension.
    The method of performing an experiment was as follows :—
The vertical positions of the cords of the pendulums when the
threads fj, t2 were quite slack and the wire was in position were
read off from the scales. A current was then sent through the
wire and coil in series. The electromagnetic action between the
current in the wire and the magnetic field caused the wire to
move bodily to one side across the lines of force; and the direc
tion of the current in the wire was so arranged that the side
towards which the wire moved was that remote from the pen
dulums. By moving out the blocks, pu p2, pull (in conse
quence of the deviation of the pendulums from the vertical)
was brought to bear through the threads f„ t2 on the upper
and lower ends of the wire; and this was gradually increased
until the wire was brought back as nearly as possible to
its former vertical position. The readings given by the
pendulums on the two scales were then taken, and at the same
time a reading of the current-strength on the current-galvano
meter. The difference between the two motions on Si and S2
for either pendulum, divided by the distance between the
scales, gave the tangent of the inclination of the pendulum to
the vertical.
    Let, now, I be the mean intensity for the position of the
wire of the magnetic field in C.Gr.S. units, 7 the current flow
ing on the wire also in C.Gr.S., L the length of the wire in
the field in centims., F the force per unit of length on the wire
in dynes, we have               Ly=F.

   The same method was applied to find the value of I for
different parts of the field on the two sides of the middle
position. With two operators (one to move the pendulums,
the other to watch the wire and take the galvanometer-
readings) the experiments were quickly and satisfactorily
performed.
   The following modification of the same method has been used
for the determination of I for several recorder magnets, with
results agreeing well with thoseobtained (for other instruments)
by the first method described above. A horizontal bar, carrying
a divided scale, was fixed parallel to the equilibrium position
of the plane of the coil, in a vertical plane passing through
the glass siphon a little beyond the point of the aluminium
arm supporting it. A single block, to which the upper end
of a pendulum-thread was attached, was made movable along
the horizontal bar, so that any displacement of the point of
suspension could be observed by means of the divided scale.
The pendulum was made of a brass weight, generally of one
gramme, as bob, hung by a very fine silk thread long enough
to allow the bob to hang a few centimetres below the siphon.
When the coil was in the position of equilibrium, the pen
dulum was moved until the thread just rested against the
siphon without deflecting it, and the reading on the scale was
noted. A current from one or two Daniell's cells was then
sent through the coil so as to deflect it from the equilibrium
     * This column is given, as y was also the magnetizing current.

             Intensities of Powerful Magnetic Fields.         151
position in the direction to cause the siphon to press against
the thread. The point of suspension of the pendulum was
then moved so as to restore the coil to its initial position, and
the distance through which it was moved noted. This dis
tance, divided by the vertical height of the point of suspension
above the point at which the thread touched the siphon, gave
the tangent of the inclination of the thread to the vertical; and
this multiplied by the downward pull in dynes on the weight
gave the horizontal force restoring the coil to its equilibrium
position.
   When equilibrium had been obtained, the difference of
potentials between the terminals of the coil was immediately
measured in volts by means of a potential-galvanometer pre
viously arranged in readiness; and from the result and the
known resistance of the coil the current flowing was deduced
in C.G.S. units. The mean intensity I of the field over the
space occupied by the coil in the equilibrium position was then
easily calculated. For let y be the current in the coil, 6 the
inclination of the pendulum-thread above the siphon to the
vertical, I the distance in centimetres of the point at which
the thread touched the siphon from the vertical axis round
which the coil turned, and W the pendulum-weight in
 grammes. Using L and b with the same meaning as hefore,
 we have plainly the equation of equilibrium

    The method of determining a magnetic field-intensity by
 measuring the electromagnetic action on a conductor carrying
 a current in the field, may be very conveniently applied to the
 space between the opposite poles of a field magnet in which
 the armature-coils of a dynamo are made to revolve. A rect
 angular frame of stout copper wire or narrow copper strip,
 containing one or more turns (insulated from one another if
 there are more than one), is constructed of such a size that
 two opposite sides are at a distance apart equal to the dia
 meter of the armature, and of length equal to the length of
 the pole-faces. The rectangle should begin a id end near the
 middle of the two other sides; and the two ends of the wire
 should be brought out side by side, insulated from one another,
 at right angles to the side, a distance of two or three inches.
 A pair of knife-edges, which may be made for ease of a piece
 of hardened copper or brass wire filed so as to have a nearly
 triangular section, are soldered, one at the centre of the side
 where the ends of the wire are brought out, the other at the
 centre of the opposite side ; so that the rectangle is symme

152          Mr. A. Gray on the Determination of the
trical on the two sides of the knife-edges, and is horizontal
when the knife-edges are turned downwards. The sides on
which the knife-edges are placed may conveniently be slightly
bent so as to have an upward convexity, in order that the
line of knife-edges may, when the wire frame is made to rest
on them, be a little above the centre of inertia of the system,
in order that the frame may rest stably in the horizontal posi
tion ; or the frame may be loaded so as to have sufficient sta
bility by pieces attached below the knife-edges. The ends of
the wire are to be bent first a little up, then downwards so
that the point of one is about an inch nearer to the frame
than the other, and both points are nearly in the line through
the knife-edges.
    The field-magnets are set up so that the plane cutting their
pole-faces in which the field-intensity is to be measured is
horizontal ; and two supports, carrying metal V-shaped rests
for the knife-edges, are arranged so that the frame when rest
ing on its knife-edges has the two sides lying along the pole-
 faces in the horizontal plane through the two parts of these
 faces near which the field is to be determined. Two cups
containing mercury are arranged on a support so placed that
the ends of the wire of the frame dip into the mercury, with
 out touching the sides or bottoms of the cups. One terminal
 of a convenient battery is connected to one of the cups ; and
 the other terminal is so arranged that the circuit can be com
pleted by depressing the terminal into the other cup, or broken
by raising it, when required.
    When an experiment is made, the magnets are excited by a
 current of the required amount, and a measured current is sent
 round the frame, which is made to turn on its knife-edges by
 the electromagnetic action. A weight which can be slided
 along the frame is hung on one of the sides which carry the
 knife-edges, and moved to such a distance from the line of
 knife-edges that the frame is brought back to its initial posi
 tion. This distance in centimetres and the mass of the weight
 in grammes are carefully determined, with the strength of the
 current flowing in the frame ; and the mean intensity of the
 field over the space occupied by the part of the frame in the
 field calculated from the results. Let I be this mean intensity,
 L the length of wire of the frame in the field, b the horizontal
 distance in centimetres of each side from the line of knife-
 edges, W the mass of the equilibrating weight in grammes,
 and r its distance from the line of knife-edges, g the accelera
 tion produced by gravity (= 981 centim. per second per
 second), and 7 the strength of the current in C.G.S. units ; we
 have by equating moments,

    Another modification of this method may be convenient in
 some cases.                           may be so placed that the
 plane cutting the poles in which the intensity is to be deter
 mined is vertical, and a rectangle made of the proper dimen
sions and hung by a torsion-thread or wire, or by means of a
 bifilar, so that it is in equilibrium in the required position, and
 turns when deflected round a vertical axis bisecting it. The
ends of the wire forming the rectangle are carried down, in
sulated from one another, from the middle of the lower side,
and bent so that their points are in the vertical line bisecting
the rectangle, and dip, like the terminals of an Ampere frame,
into two mercury-cups placed one above the other on supports
arranged below. Two pendulums are arranged so that their
 points of suspension can be moved along horizontal bars at
 right angles to the equilibrium position of the frame, one in
 the vertical plane through each side of the rectangle. These
pendulums carry at the ends of light but strong threads equal
known weights ; and each pulls horizontally on the correspond
ing side of the rectangle by means of a thread attached at one
end to the middle point of the side, at the other to the pen
dulum-cord. The pendulums and threads are so arranged that
the pulls are applied in opposite directions ; and thus when
the pulls are equal they give a couple tending to turn the
frame round a vertical axis. Corresponding to each pendulum
are a pair of horizontal scales, arranged like those shown in
the second diagram above, by means of which, in the manner
already described, the tangent of the inclination of the pen
dulum to the vertical is at once read off.
    The method of experimenting is similar to that last de
scribed. The magnets are excited, and a measured current
sent round the suspended rectangle, from a battery connected
with the mercury-cups, in the direction to cause the rectangle
to turn round in the direction opposite to the motion which
the pendulums are arranged to produce. The points of sus
pension of the pendulums are then moved so as to restore the
frame to the initial position, and the tangents of the inclina
tions of the cords obtained by means of the scales. If the field
be symmetrical about the axis of suspension of the coil, the
electromagnetic action of the frame will be a pure couple, and
the equilibrating forces will form also a couple; but in general
this will not be exactly the case. Let W be the mass, in
grammes, of each pendulum-weight, 0U 02 the inclinations of
the pendulum-cords to the vertical, and let L, b, y have the

   (7) The third method is one which has been frequently used
in the Physical Laboratory of the University of Glasgow, and
consists in exploring the magnetic field by means of the in
duced current in a wire moved quickly across the lines of
force over a definite area in the field. The wire is in circuit
with a reflecting "ballistic" galvanometer—that is, a galva
nometer the system of needles of which has so great a moment
of inertia that the whole induced current due to the motion of
the wire has passed through ti e coil before the needle has been
sensibly deflected. The deflection thus obtained is noted, and
compared with the deflection obtained when, with the same
circuit, a portion of the conductor is made to sweep across the
lines of force over a definite area of a uniform field of known
intensity, such as that of the earth or its horizontal or vertical
component.
   In performing the experiments, it is necessary to take pre
cautions to prevent any action except that between the definite
area of the field selected and the wire cutting its lines of
force. For this purpose the conducting-wire, which is covered
with insulating material, is bent so as to form three sides of a
rectangle, one of which is of the length of the portion of field
to be swept over. This side is placed along one side of the
space over which it is about to be moved so that the connecting-
wires lie along the ends of the space ; and the open rectangle
is then moved in the direction of its two sides until the oppo
site side of the space is reached. The connecting-wires thns
do not cut the lines of force, and the induced current is wholly
due to the closed end of the rectangle.
   Instead of a single wire cutting the lines of force, a coil of
proper dimensions (for many purposes conveniently of rectan
gular shape), the mean area of which is exactly known, may
be suspended in the field with its plane parallel to the lines of
force, and turned quickly round through a measured angle of
convenient amount not exceeding 90°; or it may be suspended
with its plane at right angles to the lines of force and turned
through an angle of 180°. If n be the number of turns, A
their mean area, and I the mean intensity of the field over the
area swept over in each case, then, in the first case, if 6 be the
angle turned through, the area swept over is nA sin 6, and the
number of lines cut is nIA sin 8 ; in the second, the area is
2nA, and the number of lines cut is 2nIA.
   In order that with the feeble intensity of the earth's field a
sufficiently great deflection for comparison may be obtained,

               Intensities of Powerful Magnetic Fields.        155
it is necessary that a relatively large area of the field should
be swept over by the conductor. One convenient way is to
mount on trunnions a coil of moderately fine wire of a consi
derable number of turns wound round a ring of large radius,
like the coil of a standard tangent-galvanometer, and arranged
with stops so that it can be turned quickly round a horizontal
axis through an exact half-turn, from a position in which its
plane is exactly at right angles to the dip. This coil, of course,
always remains in the circuit of the ballistic galvanometer.
The change in the number of lines of force passing through
the coil in the same direction relatively to the coil, produced by
the half-turn, is plainly equal to twice as many times the area
of the turn of mean area as there are turns in the coil (the
effective area swept over) multiplied by the intensity of the field.
   A sufficiently large area of the earth's field, for comparison,
may otherwise be obtained very readily by carrying the wire
along a rod of wood (say two or three metres long), and sus
pending this rod in a horizontal position by the continuations
of the conductor at its ends from two fixed supports in a hori
zontal line at a distance apart equal to the length of the
rod, and securing the remaining wires in circuit so that they
may not cause disturbance by their accidental motion. The
rod will thus be free to swing like a pendulum by the two
suspending-wires. The pendulum thus made is slowly de
flected from the vertical until it rests against stops arranged
 to limit its motion. It is then quickly thrown to the other
 side against similar stops there, and caught. The straight
 conductor thus sweeps over an area of the vertical component
of the earth's field equal to the product of the length of the
 rod into the horizontal distance between the two positions of
 the conductor at the extremities of its swing. The rod may
 be placed at any azimuth, as the suspending portions of the
 conductor in circuit, moving in vertical planes, can cut only
 the horizontal lines of force ; and the induced currents thus
 produced have opposite directions and neutralize one another.
    The calculation of the results is very simple. By the theory
 of the ballistic galvanometer (the same mutatis mutandis as
 that of the ballistic pendulum), if q be the whole quantity of
 electricity which passes through the circuit, and if 6 be the
 angle through which the needle has been deflected, or the
 "throw," we have              %           @
 where ft is the moment of inertia of the needle and attach
 ments, m the magnetic moment of the needle, H the earth's
 horizontal magnetic force, and G the constant of the galvano
 meter. If 6 be small, as it generally has been in these expe

riments, we have               1    /TjJ
and the quantities of electricity produced by sweeping over
two areas, A and A', are directly as the deflections.
   Let A be the area of the field or portion of field the mean
intensity (I) of which is being measured, A' and I' the same
quantities for the known field, q, q' the quantities of elec
tricity generated in the two cases, 6, 6' the corresponding de

If convenient, 9 and & may be taken as proportional to the
numbers of divisions of the scale traversed by the spot of light
in the two cases.
    I may remark, in conclusion, that the method described in
(«) above gives, when the intensity of the field has been accu
rately measured by another method, theoretically a method of
determining a resistance in absolute electromagnetic measure,
This method is nearly the converse of that given by Weber,
in which a magnet is made to oscillate within a coil of wire the
circuit of which is closed. What I venture to propose is to
hang a coil, the constants of which are known, in a sufficiently
intense and uniform magnetic field, and find the decrement of
the oscillatory motion produced by the induction : for it would
scarcely be possible, 1 think, to observe with sufficient accu
racy the point at which the coil just became " dead beat."
How far this method may be practicable can hardly be affirmed
without experiment ; but I think the necessary calculations
and corrections would be in some degree at least simpler than
those required for the method given by Weber.

      1. " The Estuaries of the Severn and its Tributaries, an Inquiry
into the Nature and Origin of their Tidal Sediment and Alluvial
Flats." By Prof. W. J. Sollas, M.A., F.R.S.E., F.G.S.
   Various sources have been ascribed to the mud which is so charac

 teristic of the estuaries of the Severn and its tributaries, such as the
 rivers themselves, the waste of mud shoals, or of bordering clifl's,
 or the sea. The author considered the effect of these sources of
 supply, and showed that, although the first three are doubtless to a
 certain extent correct, they are inadequate to account for some
 very important phenomena. The tidal silt, on microscopic exami
 nation, is found to consist of both inorganic and organic materials,
 the former being argillaceous granules, grains of quartz, flint, &c. :
 the latter, coccoliths, coccospheres, Foraminifera, occasional sclerites
 of Alcyonaria, fragments of Echinodermata, and triradiate spicules of
 Calcispongia, together with numerous spicules of siliceous sponges,
 a few Badiolaria, and a variable quantity of Diatoms. These
 organisms (described in detail by the author) are marine, and yet
 they occur on the banks of rivers at a great distance from a truly
 marine area. The author showed it to be improbable that they can
 have been derived, at any rate to a considerable extent, either from
the older formations through which the Severn flows, or from the
 alluvial flats of its estuary ; for although the latter do contain
marine organisms of a generally like kind, the spicules &c. indicate
corrosion, and are generally not so well preserved as those which
occur in the tidal silt. It seems therefore necessary to conclude
that a considerable proportion of the organisms now present in this
have been brought from the sea ; but sponges are not known to
grow in any quantity nearer Bristol than the coasts of Devon and
Pembrokeshire. It would therefore appear that these organisms,
contrary to what might have been expected, have been drifted up
into the tidal estuaries of the river for a very considerable distance.
The author concluded by describing in detail the alluvial tracts of
the Severn, which he considers to have been formed (with certain
differences of level) much as tidal deposits are formed at the present
day ; and by pointing out the bearing of his investigations on the
question of the probable results of the discharge of sewage into
tidal rivers.

   3. " Notes on the Geology of the Troad." By J. S. Diller, Esq.
Communicated by W. Topley, Esq., F.G.S.
   This paper gave a brief account of the results obtained by the author
whilst attached to the United-States Assos Expedition. Together
with a geological map (scale 1 : 100,000), this was sent to Mr. Topley
for the service of the new Geological Map of Europe (and its borders),
which is now being prepared by a Committee of the International
Geological Congress.
   The country described is that lying south and west of the river
Mendere (Scamander). The sedimentary rocks may be divided into
three great groups :—
    (1) An old, possibly Archa;an, highly crystalline series, forming
the mountainous lands of the Ida range (5750 feet), but also

appearing in smaller detached areas to the W. and N.W. Probably
these have existed as islands from early time, and around these the
later rocks have accumulated. Mt. Ida itself is almost a dome, the
lowest rocks (talc schists) occupying the summit. On the northern
slopes there is true gneiss. No igneous rocks enter into the struc
ture of this mountain. At different horizons there are bands of
coarsely crystalline limestone ; and, as far as can be seen, this series v
conformable throughout.
    (2) Resting on these old rocks and in part made up of their
remains is a series of partially crystalline rocks, chiefly limestone.
 It is probable that this series is in large part of Cretaceous age ; but
it contains rocks which are older, possibly Palaeozoic. Eocene fossils
have lately been discovered by Mr. Frank Calvert, which also may
 have come from this series. The rocks in the south of the Troad,
hitherto supposed to be Lower Tertiary, are now known to be of
 later date. Sharply marked off from these older rocks are the
 Upper Tertiaries : these are of two ages, occurring in two distinct
 areas.
    (3) The Upper Miocene, which fringes the western shores of the
Troad, and forms a broader band at the north-west corner in the
lower course of the Mendere. Hissarlik is built on this. These
 beds are marine, and belong to the Sarmatian Stage. The Troad is
 the most south-westerly point at which the Mactrakalk is yet
 known.
     (4) Freshwater beds, which occur in force in the interior of the
 country, between the Mendere and the south coast, and in patches
 near the coast. These are Upper Miocene or Lowest Pliocene.
    Later than these are the Pliocene beds of the great plain of
Edsemet.
    The igneous rocks are of various ages ; but most are of Tertiary
 date. The oldest is a granite which intrudes through and alters the
 oldest (? Archaean) crystalline rocks. This is invaded by dykes of
 Qutirtz-porphyry.
     Quartz-diorite invades and alters the group of partially crystalline
rocks.
    The oldest rocks in the newer series are the Andesites and Lipa-
 rites. These, in part, are older than the Sarmatian stage, as the
 conglomerate at its base contains fragments of these rocks. But they
 are also in part of later date. Where they can be studied together
 the Liparite is the later of the two, as it flows through and carries
 up fragments of the Andesite. The Andesite (unlike the Liparite)
 seems to have reached the surface, in somo cases, through volcanic
vents.
     Basalts and Nepheline-basalts are of late Tertiary date ; possibly
 they are the latest volcanic rocks of the district ; but their relation
 to the other oruptive rocks of the Troad cannot be definitely deter
 mined.
     The volcanic rocks in the isolated area between Alimadja and
 Lyalar are interesting because their relative ages are here well seen.
 The earliest was melaphyre ; this was followed by mica-andesite,

hornblende-andesite, augite-andosite, basalt, and late (if not last) by

   Mr. Toplet, who, in the absence of the author, read the paper,
explained the objects of the Assos expedition and the geological
results obtained by Mr. Diller. He gave a short account of previous
literature, and mentioned some of the main points in which our
knowledge of the Troad is now advanced. Mr. Topley briefly
described the physical geography and general structure of the
country, illustrating this by means of a section which he had pre
pared from Mr. Diller's map and paper.

                            IRON AND STEEL.
       To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
   Gentlemen,
 TN the April number of your Journal I observe a letter from
      Prof. Warburg showing that a preliminary communication of
 mine to the Royal Society, on the above subject, was in some points
 anticipated by a paper of his, published a year before. I regret
 very much that I have not been sooner acquainted with Prof. War
 burg's investigations, to which even now I am unable to obtain
 access in Japan. Those of my results which have been previously
 stated by him may therefore be regarded as an independent confir
 mation of his work. The Preliminary Notice (published in the
 Proceedings of the Royal Society, vol. xxxiv. no. 220) refers to no
 more than a small part of an extended investigation of the relations
 of stress, permanent and induced magnetism, magnetizing force,
 and thermoelectric quality (in iron), with which I have been en
 gaged for three years. I have recently learnt that some of the
 work has been previously done by E. Cohn, and, as it now appears,
 some by Warburg ; and in the full account, which has yet to be
 published, I hope to be able to refer fully to the results of these
observers, of which my own are in part a rediscovery, in part a
supplement, and in part entirely independent.

         ON DRY CHARGING-PILES. BY JULIUS ELSTKR AND
                              HANS GEITEL.
   In Zamboni's piles phenomena can be observed which unequivo
cally indicate polarization of their plates. If the copper pole of
such a pile be connected with the positive, and the tin pole with
the negative discharger of a Holtz machine, the pile, on being
again disconnected after only a few minutes' action of the machine,
shows a considerably strengthened tension, which, even after

 160           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
 repeated discharging, resumes almost equal intensity. Only after
 the lapse of some hours does the pile get back to its initial
condition.
    For experiments of this kind a form of the pile is adapted
 which is also in other respects to be recommended for the purpose
 of demonstration : the pairs of plates are strung, by means of a
 needle, upon a strong silk thread. In this form it can be easily
placed between the dischargers of the machine, and disturbing
influences, such as appear when a glass envelopment is employed,
are avoided. A pile of 11,000 pairs of plates of 1 square centim.
surface, after ten minutes' charging, gave sparks of about 1 millim.
length, between two metal balls connected with the poles, and
rendered a small Geissler tube at first continuously, afterwards
intermittently luminous. After this it was to be expected that
dry charging-piles could also be constructed of one metal only,
according to the analogy of Plante's battery. Plates of lead foil
were coated on both sides with tissue paper, which was made to
adhere by means of potash waterglass to which a little oxide of
lead was added. The plates were then cut into pieces of 1 centim.
square, and, as above prescribed, strung upon a silk thread. A
pile of 7000 such plates, between the poles of a Holtz machine,
likewise assumed a very powerful polarization. The action wa9
perhaps still more energetic than that of the before-described pile.
In order that the experiment may be successful, it is requisite that
the separating layers of paper have a certain degree of moisture,
which will be produced spontaneously if the pile be left for 24
hours, under a glass bell, by the side of water.
   The tension falls pretty quickly after charging ; so that sparks
of 1 millim. length can be obtained only within the first ten
minutes ; but even after 24 hours free electricity can still be
distinctly demonstrated at the poles of the pile with the aid of a
not particularly sensitive gold-leaf electroscope.
   Here also it appears that the products electrolytically deposited
on the plates by the current (in the present case superoxide of
lead) act considerably more powerfully than when deposited in
any other way. A pile consisting of 1000 pairs of lead plates
coated on one side with chemically produced superoxide and on
the other with protoxide of lead, gave in the electroscope a
proportionally much feebler tension.
   As the electromotive force of dry charging-piles never remains
constant, but, in accordance with the nature of the thing, con
stantly diminishes from the beginning, they can never possess any
practical importance. Nevertheless they are excellently adapted
to illustrate to a large audience the principle of accumulators.
The Holtz machine then represents the dynamo-electric machine,
and the dry pile Plante's or Faure's accumulator : the tension-
phenomena at the poles are so energetic that they can be seen
from a great distance.—Wiedemann's Annalen, 1883, No. 7,
pp. 489-491.

 XXV. On the Admissibility of tlie Assumption of a Solar
    Electric Potential, and its Importance for the Explanation
    of Terrestrial Phenomena. By Werner Siemens*.
 MY brother, Sir William Siemens, in his memoir "On the
         Conservation of Solar Energy," has set up the hypo
 thesis that the sun possesses a high electric potential, which
 possibly produces the phenomenon of the zodiacal light. He
 accounts for the rise and maintenance of this electric potential
 by friction of the matter which, according to his theory, hav
 ing been dissociated by the light- and heat-rays emitted from
 the sun, flows in from cosmical space to its polar regions.
 This would, after condensation had set in, again undergo com
bustion and then flow towards the sun's equator. In doing
this it would be electrified by friction with the rotating body
of the sun, and then be afresh diffused in cosmical space, in
its electrified state, by the centrifugal force of the rotation.
   If this much-controverted theory be admitted as correct, it
follows that the phenomenon in question is really similar to
the electrization (described by mef) of the apex of the pyra
mid of Cheops by the whirling dust-clouds of the desert. We
could then assume that the body of the sun, supposed con
ductive and insulated by the sea of flame enveloping it, the

162        M. W. Siemens on tJw Admissibility of tlie
photosphere, keeps one of the electricities which have been sepa
rated by the friction, while the other is spread by convection in
cosmical space. As it must then be also assumed that this con
vection extends far beyond the orbits of the planets, the body of
the sun must be regarded as having an electric potential with
respect to these and rcting distributively upon them. I will
not enter further upon the controversy respecting the admis
sibility of the theory in question. I do not fail to perceive
the weight of many of the reasons which have been brought
to bear against it ; but I am of the opinion that the possibility
of the assumption of a solar electric potential, given by the
theory, tells much in its favour, since some of the most im
portant terrestrial phenomena would find in it an explana
tion, which has hitherto been sought in vain, and since, on
the other hand, in the present position of physical knowledge
the finding of any other explanation of the presence of a solar
electric potential will scarcely be possiblei For, up to the
present time, no process is known to us in which only one
electricity is called forth. We know only separations of the
two electricities ; and although, according to all expectation,
with the intensely powerful mechanical and chemical actions
which are set up at the surface of the sun's body, such separa
tions take place on a very large scale, they must be again
compensated by conduction within the same ; and even if
there were a lasting separation of the two electricities in the
body of the sun, action at a distance of one of them could not
possibly take place. So long, therefore, as no new and at
present quite unknown facts appear, my brother's convection
theory remains inseparable from the assumption of a solar
electric potential.
   I must not, however, omit briefly to go into tbe weightiest
objection to this theory, urged against it by MM. Faye and
 Him. It is that the invariability of the periods of revolution
 of the planets about the sun logically excludes the admission
 that space is filled with matter—that astronomical observations
 unconditionally demand the assumption that cosmical space is
 an absolute vacuum, since, with the prodigious velocity of the
 motion of the planets, even the most highly rarefied atmo
 sphere must bring about a measurable diminution of the
 planetary velocities, and consequently a shortening of their
 periods. This would be true, on the hypothesis that the
 atmosphere of cosmical space is at relative rest. But this
 cannot be the case if the circulation assumed by my brother
 really takes place. It must be assumed that the sun's atmo
 sphere has approximately the same rotation-period as the body
 of the sun. Any difference in the velocities of rotation,

             Assumption of a Solar Electric Potential.        163
 brought about by the powerful ascending and descending
 currents in the sun's atmosphere which must arise from the
 combustion of the elements cooled by expansion and the cool
 ing of the burnt outermost layers of the photosphere by radia
 tion, will continually be equalized again by friction against
 each other of the parts of the sun's atmosphere rotating with
 different velocities. About the height of this atmosphere
 rotating equally with the sun's body nothing is yet known.
 According to Bitter's calculations*, indeed, the density of
 the solar atmosphere diminishes very quickly (following the
 sudden alteration of the adiabatic curve) in the region of the
 photosphere, in which the supply of heat from combustion con
 siderably retards the diminution of temperature correspond
 ing to the progressive rarefaction ; but we do not yet know
 the limit of rarefaction up to which Mariotte and Gray-Lussac's
 law holds good. If, however, the atmosphere reaches the
 limit at which the force of attraction and the centrifugal force
 counterbalance each other, every material molecule passing
 beyond this must henceforth revolve round the sun like a
 planet. If new particles of the mass were constantly arriving
 at and entering this limit, a progressive condensation of
 matter would of necessity take place and a ring be formed
 here, which would rotate round the sun in accordance with
 Kepicr's laws. Presupposing, however, the continuity of the
 sun's atmosphere, this ring-formation cannot occur, since the
 mutual friction of the strata of gas continues even beyond the
 surface of equilibrium, and consequently those which are al
ready in planetary motion are subjected to an acceleration.
The result must be that with the increase of velocity the dis
tance of each of these microplanets from the sun is perpe
tually increasing; consequently the constant outflow from the
solar atmosphere into cosmical space, assumed by my brother,
must actually take place. And it can only take place in the
zone of the sun's equator, since here at equal distance from
the centre the centrifugal force is the greatest. It must also
be admitted that the density of this atmosphere, everywhere
rotating in accordance with Kepler's laws, in the plane of the
sun's equator remains constant up to great distances from the
sun, since the solar gravitation is throughout equilibrated by
the velocity of revolution. In the directions perpendicular to
that plane, on the contrary, the density must decrease, since
the solar attraction diminishes as the distance from the plane
of the sun's equator increases.
   It follows from this consideration that a material current
emanating from the sun coincident with the phenomenon of the

164        M. W. Siemens on the Admissibility of the
zodiacal light must have everywhere the period of revolution
that planets would have at the distance in question from the
sun. A resistance experienced by planets from the material
parts of interplanetary space, moving nearly uniformly with
them round the sun, is therefore out of the question. Only a
resistance (here negligible) must take place in consequence
of the inclination of their ecliptic to the plane of the sun's
equator, to which the observed lessening of this angle of in
clination may perhaps be traced. The satellites, too, in re
volving round their planets, must experience a resistance from
the atmosphere of cosmical space; while the extreme limit of
the atmosphere of the planets, rotating with them, must under
go a frictional resistance. With respect to the moon M. Hirn
is perhaps right in maintaining that, the celestial bodies
moving with such prodigious velocity, even the most rarefied
resisting medium would sweep away their atmospheres.
    Numerous observations make it highly probable that cos
mical space, at least within the region of the solar system, is
filled with combustible matter. This also indirectly tells very
decidedlj7 for my brother's hypothesis that the products of
combustion, in a state of extreme rarefaction and at very low
 temperature, are again dissociated by the sun's rays. The
 objection which has been made, that the work of dissociation
 would absorb the energy of the luminous rays and thereby
 render cosmical space opaque, could be set aside by supposing
 that the work of dissociation is done by the invisible chemi
 cally acting rays only. But it can also be assumed that, in
 the course of the ages, the work of dissociation is already ac
 complished, and that now only the chemically combined mass
 continually emanating from the sun is still to be dissociated
 by his rays, for which only a part of the light-energy would
 be expended.
    Without the hypothesis of dissociation it would be difficult ¦
 to explain why cosmical space is not filled, like the earth's
 atmosphere, essentially with oxygen, nitrogen, and aqueous
 vapour. It cannot be assumed that the composition of the
 body of the sun is essentially different from that of the earth,
 if both have come out of the same rotating nebulous mass,
 since to suppose a separation of matter in the gaseous state
 according to specific gravity is inadmissible. Hence, at least
 in the solar system, the. electronegative substances must every
 where predominate ; and it is to be assumed that even the
 cold burnt-up sun in the future will be surrounded by an
 atmosphere containing an excess of oxygen. But if cosmical
 space is filled with highly rarefied dissociated products of
 combustion, these must become subject to the attraction of

            Assumption of a Solar Electric Potential.                165
 the sun wherever they are not, as in the vicinity of the
 equatorial plane, withdrawn from that attraction by planetary
 revolution. Hence a constant inflow of dissociated matter to
the sun must take place, especially in the polar regions, where
there is a total absence of centrifugal force, as my brother
 supposes. If the mass of the sun, as may well be assumed,
 remains invariably the same, this means that a state of equili
 brium has entered, in which just as much burnt matter flows
 out from the sun's equatorial zone as is again conveyed by
 attraction, in a state of dissociation, to its polar regions.
Then the flow from the pole to the equator, as well as the
proved lower angular velocity of rotation of the gaseous mass
of the sun in its higher latitudes, would consequently follow.
    Although, however, this gives the possibility of the pro
duction 01 a solar electric potential by friction and continual
removal from the sun of the parts charged with one of the
electricities, yet the mechanism of this electrification still re
mains very obscure. The light of the sun proceeds from a sea
of flame which, according to Ritter's beautiful calculations,
must have a thickness of about 25 kilometres. Whether a
 flame of burning gases of this thickness will still transmit much
of the heat- and light-rays from a hotter source of emission,
how much of them it will absorb or, like a layer of cloud, will
reflect, we cannot know. I have recently* shown that gases
heated to from 1500° to 2000° C. still appear perfectly dark,
while even at a lower temperature they emit the more slowly
vibrating heat-rays. Whether gases become self-luminous on
being raised to a much higher temperature has not yet been
determined by experiment. As, however, a small flame in a
brighter light casts a shadow, it seems unlikely that many of
the light- and heat-rays from the deeper and hotter strata of
the sun can traverse the huge photosphere. The observed
temperature and light of the sun are then phenomena origi
nating essentially in the chemical action that goes on in the
solar atmosphere. This requires that that atmosphere ascend
ing in a state of dissociation and at the same time cooled by
increase of volume, shall begin to burn when the limit of the
temperature of dissociation for the respective compound is
passed, and that this combustion shall continue until the loss
of heat by expansion is equal to the heat liberated by combus
tion. The apparent temperature of the sun will hence be
approximately the dissociation-temperature of those compounds
which have the highest chemical heat-equivalent, consequently
of water, the elements of which will burn at the greatest alti
tude, while the masses which are heavier and at the same time

166       M. W. Siemens on the Admissibility of t/ie
possess a higher temperature of dissociation are already
ignited in lower regions. In order to keep going this upward
motion of the dissociated elements, the final products of the
combustion must return to the main body of the sun. As
Faye, Bitter, and others have shown, this takes place, first,
because those products possess greater specific gravity than
the unburnt gases, and, secondly, in consequence of the cool
ing of the higher strata of the photosphere by radiation of
heat and light. This disturbs the adiabatic equilibrium of the
over- and underlying strata of gases, and compels the higher,
having become relatively heavier, to return in descending
currents to the solar depths. The reason that these descend
ing currents become visible as sun-spots only in middle solar
latitudes is that there only are the conditions present for a
rotating motion of the descending current, by which a vertical
direction is given to it. The funnel-shaped diminution of
the diameter of a sun-spot is the result of the great diminution
of volume effected by the rapidly increasing pressure. The
interior of the funnel must be relatively dark, since there the
formation of luminous flame fails, as the temperature must be
lower by the amount of the heat of dissociation than that of
the surrounding unburnt solar substance, and perhaps products
of condensation already occur, which act as a screen in keep
 ing back the radiation of the moro brightly luminous deeper
strata of the sun. On the other hand, it is not improbable that
the high-blazing faculse consist of bubbles of hydrogen and
oxygen in the proportion to form explosive gas, or of coal-gas
mixed in the right proportion with oxygen, which, in conse
quence of their less specific gravity and greater liberation of
 heat in combustion, bursting through the penumbra and the
 photosphere, soar aloft, and, the elements of luminous flame
 being absent, transmit in part the rays of the hotter deeper
 layers of the sun. The enormous velocity of the coruscations
 of many faculae, scarcely admissible as a mechanical eflect,
 might then find its explanation in this radiation from the solar
 depths. My brother, in a recently published supplement to his
 theory of the sun, assumes that the main body of the sun itself
 may not be hotter than about 3000° C, since at a higher tem
 perature the chemical rays would be the predominant ones,
 and at a very much higher temperature the sun would actually
 cease to give light. This might be true if the photosphere
 did not as a screen keep back the hotter rays of the sun's
 body, as it probably does. In fact, from analogies to the
 observations we cannot draw any safe conclusion as to whether
 a body heated to hundreds of thousands or millions of degrees
 would still be luminous. Only rays of so minute a wave

           Assumption of a Solar Electric Potential.         187
length might emanate from it that they wonld be incapable
of performing any chemical work ! The apparently dark
nucleus of the sun-spots might then be accounted for thus :—
The flameless products of combustion, relatively cooled by
commencing dissociation, returning to the sun, remain trans
parent and permit the deeper layers of the sun, too highly
heated for luminous radiation, to radiate through them. The
violet colour of the nuclei of the sun-spots would tell in
favour of this. For attainable temperatures, it is true, the
law holds good that, besides the rapid undulations of the
aether corresponding to the higher temperature, the entire
scale of the slower undulations comes in also ; but whether
it is or is not different with temperatures so enormously
higher cannot, at all events, be known.
   It was necessary to enter somewhat more into particulars
respecting the constitution of the main body of the sun and
its light- and heat-radiating envelope, in order to get a foun
dation for an answer to the question whether, with the present
extent of our knowledge, the hypothesis of a solar electric
potential appears admissible. As I have already insisted,
its conception is only possible if a separation of the two
electricities goes on at the sun's surface and if one of the
separated electricities is simultaneously conducted away. As
flame is a good conductor of electricity, the entire photosphere
and the penumbra (which probably take part in the process
of combustion) may bo regarded as a conducting mantle
enveloping the hotter body of the sun. As, further, flames
have, like points, the property of transmitting electricity to
their surroundings (here, therefore, to their gaseous com
bustion-products), the photosphere must be continually dis
charged by a partial outflow of the products of combustion
into cosmical space. If, therefore, the photosphere were in
sulated from the deeper body of the sun not yet included in
 the combustion, the latter, if it should be regarded as a con
ductor of electricity, could be charged with electricity by
 friction or chemical processes taking place between the con
 ducting body of the sun and the photosphere. The question
 whether hot gases are conductors of electricity, even when
 no flames appear in them, has not yet been decided by direct
experiments. That gases, like all bodies, become conductors
of electricity when the dielectric polarization of their mole
 cules has reached its maximum, and that this maximum
 diminishes proportionally with the rarefaction of the gases,
 consequently also with their heating reckoned from absolute
 zero, I have already shown, when describing my ozone-
 apparatus, in the year 1857*. Accordingly conductors are

polarization of the former being vanishingly small. That
in very highly heated gases the maximum of polarization
would become, as in metallic conductors, vanishingly small,
can scarcely be admitted. Direct experiments on the di
electric properties of highly heated nameless gases are not
 known to me ; but the phenomena of the electric spark, as
 well as the luminous appearances in the ozone-apparatus and
 Geissler tubes, and the beautiful experiments of Hittorf*, can
 be explained even without assuming that highly heated con
 duct differently from cold gases of equal density. Hence the
 high temperature of the solar gases appears at present to be
 no obstacle to ascribing to them insulating properties.
 Indeed their maximum of polarization will, in correspondence
 with the density of the sun's atmosphere, be greater than that
 of our cold atmospheric air, notwithstanding their elevated
 temperature.
     Very different relations, however, may appear on the
 appearance of the critical state at greater depths in the
 sun. For the electrical property of the critical state we have
  neither experiments nor analogies : hence we can assume
  that the interior of the sun is also a metallically conducting
  mass—that is, having a vanishingly small polarization-
  maximum. The surface of this mass of the sun in the critical
  state might then have an electric potential. The question,
  however, would have to be taken into consideration whether
  the conducting photosphere might not on the face turned
  towards the interior of the sun become electric by distribution,
  so that the sun with its enveloping photosphere would form a
     * M. Hittorf, in a communication in vol. xix. of Wiedemann's Annalen,
  p. 73, says that what I communicated to the Academy on the 9th
  November, 1882, viz. that gases at temperatures from 1500° to 20003 C.
  still appear perfectly dark if they are quite nameless, and that the lumi
  nosity of gases on the passing through them of an electric current is a
  similar process to the shining of a name that separates no solid com
   ponents, had been previously made known by himself and others. I
   willingly grant this with respect to the uonluminosity of hot gases ; but
   I made no claim to priority in this communication : I believe, however,
   that I first proved by experiment that gases so highly heated actually
   appeal perfectly dark, although the hot layer of air be over a metre thick
   and the eye has been rendered in the highest degree sensitive by complete
   darkness. Hittorf's experiments proved only that hot gases are relatively
   dark. As to the conductivity of gases, assumed by Faraday for high
   tensions, in my paper above cited, about 25 years older, I already set up
   the general law according to which the conductivity of gases commences.
   To this I might also refer M. Eilhard Wiedemann, who claims priority for
   his explanation of gases becoming luminous on an electric current passing
   through them as a result of dielectric polarization.

prodigiously powerful Leyden jar, by which action at a
distance of the electricity of the conducting nucleus of the
sun would be in a great measure excluded. This cannot be
assumed at once, since the conductivity of flame has quite
different causes, directly connected with the combustion-process
itself, than that of conductive bodies not in chemical action ;
so that an analogy between the two is hardly to be inferred
with respect to their capacity for electric distribution. I have
therefore made some experiments on the question whether a
 flame is subject to the action of induction in the same manner
 as other conductors; and these experiments have confirmed
 the hypothesis. According to this, two flames insulated from
 each other can act as the coatings of a charged Leyden jar,
 in like manner as other conductors*. According to this it
 must be assumed that tht) seat of the sun's electricity is chiefly
 to be sought in the photosphere, and not in the body itself of
 the sun. The electric properties of flame are still very
 obscure, notwithstanding all the experiments hitherto made
 on the subject. In particular, it is not yet decisively deter
 mined whether a difference of potentials, spontaneously pro
 duced, between the different zones of the flame, especially
 between that where the combustion commences and that
 where it goes out, exists or not. If this were the case, as
 appears probable from some experiments by Iiiess and others,
 the cause of the sun's electricity might be sought therein,
 considering the prodigious dimensions of the sea of flame
    » The experiment was made thus : —A ring-shaped fjas-burner was in
 sulated. On opening the cock a cylindrical flame ot about 2 centim.
 diameter rose above it to the height of about 15 centim. The flame
 passed through a metallic cylinder of about 8 centim. diameter, placed so
 as to be insulated and to surround it concentrically. To produce con
 ducting connexion with the flame, an insulated platinum wire, bent into
 a circular shape, was placed in the lower part of the flame. The charge
 produced between this platinum wire and the cylinder by a galvanic
 series of fifty Daniell cells was now measured, by means of my rapidly
  oscillating electromagnetic switch, with the gascock alternately nearly
  closed and quite open. The difference between the deflections of the
  mirror-galvanometer was then a measure of the capacity of the Leyden
  jar formed by the flame and the cylinder. The results obtained are
  collected in the following table :—

 170       M. W. Siemens on the Admissibility of the
 surrounding the sun, and the corresponding great differences
in temperature and density, since the electricity of the outer
layers of the photosphere would then pass over to the products
of combustion, and with them, according to my brother's
theory, would in part be spread in the direction of the plane
of rotation of the sun in cosmical space. Even supposing,
however, that the process of electrification may have to be sought
in the solar combustion itself, in the friction of the matter
flowing in from cosmical space, or in other causes yet unknown,
the possibility of the existence of an electric potential of the
sun is given by the equatorial diffusion of solar products of
 combustion in cosmical space.
   And this possibility rises to the rank of high probability
when one considers the facility with which some difficult and
hitherto unsolved problems of terrestrial phenomena can be
solved with the aid of a solar electric potential. If the sun
possesses a high electric potential, he must act distributively
upon all the celestial bodies, consequently upon the earth also.
But an accumulation of electricity upon the entire solar
surface can only take place when the opposite electricity
liberated is conducted away ; and the only conceivable way
in which it can be so conducted is by being diffused in
cosmical space. The process is approximately the same as
that which takes place when an insulated sphere is placed
opposite to a larger charged spherical conductor. The sphere
then gradually takes an opposite charge, while the same
electricity is lost by dissipation in space. With the earth this
dissipation of the so-called free electricity arising from the
sun's distribution is, moreover, greatly favoured by the
extreme rarefaction of the upper strata of air and by the
ascending and descending currents of air loaded with moisture,
since by these the free electricity is conveyed to the upper
strata of highly rarefied air. That in this rarefied upper air
electric currents take place is proved by the aurorse boreales
and australes. They might be regarded as the electrical
compensation taking place at the boundary of the earth's
atmosphere, between the matter flowing out from the sun
charged with negative electricity and the liberated positive
induced electricity of the earth. This compensation must
occur whenever by a change in the sun's potential that of the
earth is also changed. For the restoration of equilibrium,
positive or negative electricity must then flow out from the
earth ; consequently either a compensation must take place at
the boundary of the atmosphere with the negative electricity
flowing out from the sun, or this must flow to the earth. The
reason that this exchange takes place preeminently in the

           Assumption of a Solar Electric Potential.            171
earth's polar regions may be that the polar air is more strongly
electric, as it is continually displaced by the more strongly
electrified air brought by the equatorial current in the upper
regions of the atmosphere, and must therefore receive in its
entire mass the electricity of the highest strata of air of the
lower 'atitudes. Earth-currents, standing in intimate con
nexion with the northern and southern lights, are then to be
considered a necessary consequence of the compensation of the
variations of intensity of the electricity of the earth and the
sun taking place preeminently in the polar regions. These
compensation-currents must on their part affect the magnetic
needle by their electrodynamic action.
   Here, however, the question intrudes, is not the earth's
magnetism itself to be considered an electrodynamic action of
the electrical charge of the earth ? According to the beautiful
investigation instituted in Helmholtz's laboratory, under his
direction, by Mr. Rowland*, it is to be regarded as demon
strated that stationary electricity mechanically moved exe-ts
electrodynamic actions in a similar manner as an electric
current. Accordingly the earth must, if its surface is charged
with electricity of great density, exhibit, in consequence
of its rotation, magnetic phenomena, in like manner as if
electric currents encircled it, carrying round it in each lati
tude, during the time of a rotation, just so much electricity
as the static electricity present on the respective surface-rings
amounts to. What density of electricity on the earth's surface
would be required, in order to produce the magnetism of the
earth by its rotation, will not be difficult to practised mathe
maticians to calculate. As the magnetic moment of a circular
current is proportional to the surface flowed round, we may
foresee that, considering the dimensions of the earth, that
density will not prove to be inadmissibly great. Further, with
the colossal dimensions of the sun, whose surface contains
11,483 times the surface of the earth, while the distance of
the sun amounts to only 22,934 earth's semidiameters, the
density of the sun's electricity need be only about twice that
of the earth in order to call forth the latter by electric dis
tribution. Were the whole of the earth's surface equally
charged with electricity, the magnetic pole would necessarily
 coincide with the pole of rotation of the earth. Since it is
not so, and as, on the whole, great irregularities take place
in the distribution of the earth's magnetism over its surface,
the distribution of the static electricity on that surface must
be irregular. This also appears prooable when it is re
membered that about one third of the earth's surface consists of

 172        M. W. Siemens on the Admissibility of the
continent, which mostly has a rocky bottom only thinly covered
with badly conducting earth. The accumulation of the in
 duced electricity will therefore have to be sought rather on
the surface of the incandescent well-conducting interior of the
earth, by the greater distance of which from the outer surface
the preponderant influence of the masses of electricity in
convective motion lying nearest is diminished. Whether it
will be possible to deduce the existing distribution of the earth's
magnetism, as well as the observed periodic and irregular
disturbances of it, from this theory of the cause of the
phenomenon of terrestrial magnetism, must be decided by
subsequent special investigation. The daily regular disturb
ances might be accounted for by the fact that the density of
the induced electricity on the side turned away from must be
somewhat less than that on the side turned towards the sun.
This unequal density of the earth's electricity depending on
the position of the sun, must proceed pari passti with the
rotation of the earth, and may therefore be the cause of the
regtilar equatorial earth-currents discussed by Lamont. The
magnetic disturbances produced by the moon may likewise
find their explanation in the reaction of lunar electricity upon
the distribution of the induced electricity of the earth. On
the other hand, the secular alteration of the situation of the
magnetic pole can, in all probability, only be referred to yet
unrecognized cosmic causes.
   Although this theory may still leave much unexplained, it
yet affords at least the possibility of giving^ an explanation of
the origination of the earth's magnetism fitting in with our
present experience. This is not the case with any previous
theory. The hypothesis of a central magnet in the interior
of the earth is contradicted by the universal experience that
a red heat destroys the magnetism of all bodies. Hence that
hypothesis cannot be maintained without entirely losing sight
of the foundation of experience. The hypothesis of a stratum
of magnetic ore in the crust of the earth as the seat of
terrestrial magnetism is contradicted, in the first place, by
calculation, since the magnetism of such a stratum, even if it
be supposed of the greatest possible thickness and magnetized
to the maximum, would not suffice to produce the existing
terrestrial magnetism ; and, secondly, by the impossibility of
finding a cause for the magnetization of that stratum of ore,
since the magnetism cannot have been present from the
beginning, but must have first arisen after the cooling of the
earth.
   The same might be maintained of the theory advanced
after Faraday's discovery of the magnetic properties of the

            Assumption of a Solar Electric Potential.        173
oxygen of the air, that this oxygen is the seat of the earth's
magnetism, if calculation had not already shown that the seat
of this magnetism cannot he outside of the surface of the
earth. Just as little can those theories of the earth's mag
netism meet with consideration which rest upon thermo
electric currents or, as Zollner attempted to base his, on
convection-currents in the liquid interior of the earth, since
in a medium conducting equally well in all directions such
currents can never take place. Moreover no cause can be
found for the existence of permanent regular currents of the
liquid interior of the earth.
    In like manner as an electric potential of the sun affords
the possibility of accounting for the earth's magnetism, to
gether with the related phenomena of the aurorae and earth-
currents, it also gives a handle for the explanation of the
 electricity of the air and the phenomena of thunder-storms.
That the earth must be charged with negative electricity
was assumed already by Lamont for the explanation of the
perpetually changing atmospheric electricity.         His view,
however, that this electric charge is to be accounted for by
thermoelectric differences, is no more tenable than the view
that friction-processes can generate an electric potential of
 the earth. Such a potential can only arise from cosmic
 influence and the removal of the liberated same electricity
by diffusion in space, or its neutralization by the oppositely
 charged matter which flows out from the sun in the direction
 of the plane of his equator. If, however, we assume this to
 be the case, that consequently the earth together with the
 sun forms an electric accumulation-apparatus the separating
 dielectric of which is the atmosphere of the sun and of the
 earth and the interplanetary space rilled with most highly
 rarefied matter, all the conclusions drawn by Lamont and
 others from the electric charge of the earth are justified.
 But to account for the electricity of thunder-storms, the
 trifling and varying electricity of the atmosphere, to which
 it has hitherto been attributed, does not seem sufficient.
 The sudden appearance of such vast masses of electricity as
 arrive especially in tropical storms repels the supposition that
 they have had their seat in the feeble electric charge of the
 comparatively small quantity of air that carries the thunder
 clouds. The sources from which it springs must be more
 productive. Such a source, of inexhaustible vastness, is
 found in the electric charging of the earth by solar influence.
 When a conducting object is brought near a largo sphere
 charged with electricity, it is subjected to the distributive
 action of the electricity existing on the surface of the sphere.

174         M. W. Siemens on the Admissibility of the
If the similar electricity accumulated in the part of the
conductor most distant from the sphere finds a means of
transmission to still more distant conductors, the first con
ductor becomes lastingly charged with electricity the polarity
of which is the opposite of that of the sphere. But if the
elevation of the conductor above the surface is but little in
proportion to the diameter of the sphere, then the difference
of tension between the surface of the sphere and the most
distant point of the elevation can only be small. For this
reason, oven with a great density of the electricity on the
surface of the earth no electrical repulsion can take place
there, and even on mountain-tops it cannot be very noticeable.
But the ratio takes another form when a sphere is charged by
induction from a distant electrical sphere. The lines of force
which, according to Faraday's molecular-distribution theory,
go from the charging to the charged sphere from which the
electricity is carried away, meet the latter everywhere almost
perpendicularly                        distance between the in
fluencing spheres acting upon each other in proportion to
the diameters of the spheres, in almost equal number on
the side turned towards the distributing sphere and on that
turned away from it. If now an insulated conductive screen
that covers a part of the surface of the influenced sphere be
brought near the latter, if it be thin it will not become
perceptibly electric. But as soon as the screen is touched so
as to conduct away its electricity, it takes the opposite elec
tricity to that of the sphere, while the like electricity is
carried away. The behaviour is the reverse of this when the
screen is conductively connected with the sphere ; tho screen
then forms part of the surface of the sphere and receives its
electric charge, whilo tho part of the surface under the screen
becomes nonelectric. Now the thunder-clouds appear in the
character of such screens upon tho surface of the earth. If such
a screen of cloud be imagined included in the formation over
a part of tho earth's surface, it will remain unaffected by the
earth's electricity so long as the conductive particles of water
are insulated and at a considerable distance from one another.
Hence mist and light clouds will not become electric. But as
soon as the mist has so far condensed that its conductive parts
come into contact with one another, or the distance between
them becomes so small that electricity of very slight tension
can overleap tho intervals, the cloud is subjected to the distri
bution process. This can be initiated by its being put into
conducting connexion with clouds situated in very elevated
regions by ascending cloud vortices. This conductively con
nected cloud is then electrified in its lower part with the

             Assumption of a Solar Electric Potential.                  175
contrary electricity to that of the earth, while the upper
part is electrified similarly to the latter. But a dense con
ductive bank of clouds may in one or more places come into
conductive connexion with the earth itself. It then forms a part
of the earth's conductive surface, and takes up its electricity*.
The latter process most readily occurs at the declivity of steep
mountains against which the layers of cloud rest. Hence
mountains frequently occasion tempests. In the generation
of the clouds that carry the electricity of storms electricity does
   * During a voyage on the Mediterranean in the winter of 1865, in the
vicinity of the Spanish coast, between Cartagena and Almeria I had an
opportunity of observing the course of the phenomenon of a waterspout,
which appeal's to me to tell decidedly in favour of this conception.
   Between the ship and the coast in the vicinity of Almeria, with a vigo
rously agitated so-called dead sea, without any considerable motion of the
air, a dense but apparently not high bank of black clouds was seen, under
which the sea seemed to be in the wildest commotion. It appeared there
like a roundish white spot, the diameter of which the seamen estimated
at from two to three [German] nautical miles, foaming up to a great
height, while the sea around it showed only smooth waves without any
breakers. In spite of the considerable distance of the ship from the place
of violent agitation, amouutiug to several leagues, it could be distinctly
seen through the telescope that the angry surges rose several metres above
the sharply defined surface of the relatively calm mirror of the sea. The
cloud descended at one place in the shape of a funnel, forming a streak
of cloud curved like an elephant's trunk, reaching down nearly to the
foaming surface of the sea, and apparently joining below. Perfect con
tact with the foaming surface could not be perceived ; and, what was
surprising, no greater foaming took place under the trunk-shaped cloud
than in other places. The trunk itself slowly rotated, if I remember
rightly, in the direction of the hands of a watch, over the white spot ; and
its place of junction with the cloud took part in the motion, though not
to an equal extent. Unfortunately, night coming on and the increasing
distance, after about half an hour's observation, during which the trunk
had made a turn and a half, keeping its point constantly at about one
third of the radius of the white spot from its margin, deprived us of the
further contemplation of this interesting phenomenon, which had been
followed with the closest attention by myself, my brother William and
his wife, and the naval officers belonging to the company of the French
cable-ship, on board of which we were. No whirling motion was per
ceptible. Almost a dead calm prevailed. It can only have been a purely
electrical phenomenon, which must have consisted in an electric current
from the earth to the cloud, if we assume that this current had at one
place become so strong that, by electric conveyance of the liquid, a con
ductive water communication between the sea and the cloud was formed,
the rotation of the trunk under the influence of the earth's magnetism is
 also explained. During the night a storm raged on the Spanish coast,
 which probably originated in the waterspout observed by us. The latter,
 however, appeared later to have directed its course from the Spanish to the
 African coast ; for towards the end of the night our ship near the latter
 coast encountered so fearful a storm of only a few minutes' duration that
 it was in the greatest peril, and the seamen were firmly of opinion that the
 waterspout had passed over the ship.

176        M. W. Siemens on the Admissibility of the
not appear to play any essential part. The cause of the for
mation of clouds is, as a rule, to be sought in the ascending
and descending motion of the air, to which not only this and
the rain falling from the clouds, but also the letting loose of
storms is almost exclusively to be ascribed. The views on this
subject which still prevail to a great extent in meteorology need,
in my opinion, correction in some points. Were the equili
brium of the aerial ocean not constantly disturbed by unequal
heating and cooling of the air by radiation, the temperature
and density of the air could not but be in so-called indifferent
equilibrium up to the greatest altitude, and in such wise that
the loss of temperature with increasing height would be every
where equivalent to the work of expansion of the gas. The
higher temperature of the air of the lower latitudes would be
equalized by slowly coursing whirlwinds with a horizontal
axis of rotation, as is shown on a large scale by the trade
winds, and finally the entire sea of air would possess equal
temperature at equal bights. This indifferent or adiabatic
equilibrium is now continually disturbed by extra heating
of the earth's surface and of the lower strata of the air by
solar radiation, by absorption of the same on passing through
the atmosphere, and by the extra cooling of the higher strata
by radiation outwards. Through this the lower strata become
lighter and the upper heavier than the adiabatic equilibrium
requires ; and this disturbance must be compensated by
ascending and descending currents in the atmosphere. As
the ascending air, which has become warmer on the ground, in
correspondence with tho adiabatic curve of temperature pre
serves this excess of heat on ascending, but the upward impulse
increases with the increasing height of the ascending current
because tho succeeding layers of air at the ground have always
the same excess of temperature, the upcurrent must continue,
in the places where it has once been produced by favourable
local conditions, until the dift'erence of temperatures is equa
lized. The work done by the upcurrent of the relatively
lighter air and the descent in other places of the relatively
heavier air cooled by radiation must be converted into vis viva,
as it puts the air into quicker motion. This is effected essen
tially by the volume of the ascending air being increased by
the diminution of pressure. Since, tlie diameter of the terres
trial globe being great, the air-space becomes only impercep
tibly larger with the height, the velocity of the ascending air
must even from this cause increase nearly proportionally to
tho decrease of pressure. In the highest regions of the air to
which each upcurrent formed will reach, the velocity of the
air must therefore be very considerable ; and there with the

            Assumption of a Solar Electric Potential.           177
 same velocity the surrounding calm air must be pushed aside
in order to make room for that which has arrived. This dis
placement will take place chiefly in the direction to where a
descending current has been formed to replace the overheated
air flowing at the surface of the earth to the place of the up-
current. This downflowing air now becomes denser again
correspondingly to its altitude, it is true ; but at tlie same time
it retains the velocity it acquired in the upper regions. It is
evident that the final result may be a very great velocity of
air at the earth's surface, if the disturbance of the adiabatic
equilibrium was qualitatively and quantitatively considerable.
These local storms, the direction of which is modified accord
ing to Dove's law of rotation by the rotation of the earth,
must become peculiarly violent if the upcurrent itself is con
fined within narrow limits, since then the compensating
process, i. e. the conversion of the energy accumulated in the
disturbance of equilibrium into air-velocity, is confined to a
proportionately small quantity of air. Yet powerful storms,
passing over whole continents, may also be produced by as
cending currents of air of wide local extent. That the descend
ing current produces an increase of pressure upon the ground,
and the ascending current a decrease, follows from the laws
of mechanical motion. The mere motion of the air, however,
must of itself always occasion a fall of the barometer, since
the moved air carries away with it the still air at the contact
boundary and consequently produces a rarefaction. The final
result of the compensation of the disturbance will therefore be
to put greater and greater masses of air into whirling motion,
and last of all to bring the vis viva back, by friction, into the
form of heat.
    It follows from these considerations that the aqueous vapour
in the air does not play the great part in the movement of the
air that is usually attributed to it, since the phenomena of the
motion and pressure of the air can be accounted for without
 the water contained in the air. The origin of storms, i. e. in
 this case the place of the acceleration of the masses of air, must
 only be sought, not at the surface of the earth, but essentially
 in the highest regions of the air. If the atmosphere consisted
 of aqueous vapour only, the phenomena would be altogether
 similar. Aqueous vapour is as subject to the law of adiabatic
 expansion as air ; only its density and temperature decrease
  with increasing height much less than those of the permanent
  gases of the atmosphere. According to Bitter a vapour at
  mosphere would be about thirteen times as high as an atmo
  sphere of air. It is true that, according to Clausius and Sir
  William Thomson, with the adiabatic expansion of vapour a

178        M. W. Siemens on the Admissibility of the
continual condensation takes place ; but, at the heights in
which according to experience the formation of clouds occurs,
it mast still be too inconsiderable to bring about the observed
precipitation. The reason of the condensation that takes
place in ascending air-currents lies essentially in this—that
the aqueous vapour is intimately mixed with the air, and that
in the ascending current it does not take the adiabatic tem
perature belonging to itself, but that of the greatly prepon
derating mass of air with which it is mixed. Now, as the
air is cooled much more quickly with increasing height than
the vapour, the latter is cooled below the adiabatic tempera
ture belonging to it ; and this diminution of temperature
gives rise to its condensation if the point of saturation of the
vapour is overpassed.
   This conception is apparently contradicted by the circum
stance that aeronauts have repeatedly proved that strata of
warmer air frequently overlie colder ones, while the law of
adiabatic expansion requires a continuous decrease of pressure
and temperature. But this is easily explained by the dis
similar constitution of the earth's surface, owing to which
the ascending current frequently, and in many places, has a
much higher temperature and contains a far greater quantity
of aqueous vapour than in others. If the amount of water
held by such a hot ascending mass of air is so great that part
of it is separated during the ascent and falls as rain, the air
met with in the upper strata of the atmosphere is still further
heated by taking up the latent heat of the aqueous vapour ;
and thereby its volume and upward impulse are augmonted ;
and the final result must be a stratum of relatively warm and
comparatively waterless air, which is then pushed by its expan
sion over colder air, but which, from containing more aqueous
vapour, is lighter *. These departures from the rule that
the temperature and density of the atmosphere decrease as the
height increases, while the contained water must increase,
are easily accounted for. The latter must be the rule for
 the higher latitudes at least, since the masses of warm air
 containing relatively much water continually ascending in the
 calms, on their way to higher latitudes, after loss of their
 greater heat by radiation, it is true for the most part sink
 to earth again as descending currents ; but they must also
 in part reach the high latitudes as an upper equatorial current.
   * Kronig has already proved that the aqueous vapour mixed with an
 ascending current produces by its condensation no diminution, but an
 augmentation of volume, as the latent heat of the vapour enlarges the
 volume of the air by a much greater amount than the volume of the con
 densed vapour before its condensation (Fortschr. d. Phys, xx. p. 626).

In this greater humidity of the higher strata of the atmo
sphere is to be sought the reason why even with descending
currents of air falls of rain may occur. If the temperature
of a very moist upper current be cooled by radiation below
the point of saturation of the vapour, cirrus clouds will be
formed, probably consisting of ice crystals *. The latent heat
of the vapour and water thereby set free will again heat these
strata of the air and protract the process of formation of hea
vier snow-clouds ; but if by continued loss of heat by radiation
the process be completed, the weight of the ice, no longer
filling any considerable space, must disturb the adiabatic equi
librium, and a sinking of the mass of cloud commence. The
condensation and heating then taking place melt the snow
again ; and the requisite latent heat is withdrawn from the
air. The adiabatic equilibrium is hence still further disturbed;
and the final result will be a cold descending current with
rain. The density of these slowly descending rain-clouds,
however, will not be great enough to make the cloud elec
trically conductive ; consequently there will be no formatior.
of electricity by distribution. The course of things, however,
will be different when by local overheating of the air in the
vicinity of the ground a local upcurrent with rainfall is pro
duced. The upcurrent may then acquire a velocity greater
than that of the falling drops formed in the resisting air ; hence
these will be whirled with the current into the upper regions,
the temperature of which lies far below the freezing-point,
and frozen to hailstones. By the rapid increase of volume, and
the corresponding lateral expansion of the accelerated current,
the next higher strata of air, which are relatively moist and cold,
are set whirling with a horizontal axis of rotation ; and these
whirlwinds combine with that which is ascending and rotating
about a vertical axis. The violent whirling motion into which
   * It is extremely probable, however, that in the high regions of the
atmosphere both water and valour retain their state of aggregation down
to far below the temperature ot their points of freezing and condensation
respectively. That water without the presence of solid bodies to induce
crystallization, and without violent agitation, can be cooled far below
 — 20° C. without freezing is a fact. That steam in like manner can
retain the form of vapour below its point of condensation has not yet
been proved experimentally. We know only the retardation of boil
ing, which so frequently gives rise to steam-boiler explosions. It is at
all events not improbable that this retardation of boiling also stands
opposed to a retardation of condensation. This can only with difficulty
be ascertained by experiments, since means are wanting to cool a mass of
steam out of contact with solid or liquid bodies. Without assuming this
it cannot well be explained why the sky is not always entirely covered
with cirrus clouds ; for it would have to be assumed that water particles
liquefied in the great rarefaction of the higher strata of air do not appear
as clouds.

the hitherto calm overcooled aerial sea is thrown will now in
 duce in it a sudden formation of water and ice. The whirlings
 with horizontal axis of rotation may at the same time acquire
 a great diameter and hurl up the grains of ice repeatedly into
 the ice-region, until they have grown too heavy and fall to the
 ground as hailstones or, after passing through lower warm
 air, as cold drops of rain. By this copious formation of rain
 in a short time the water particles of the path of cloud are
brought so close together up to the highest air-strata, that it
becomes a conductor of electricity and is consequently exposed
to electrical distribution. If at any place it is in conductive
 connexion with the earth, the earth's electricity must flow
into it ; and it then receives the same electricity. If it is not
so, it becomes charged in the vicinity of the earth with the
contrary electricity, while the similar electricity escapes by
the conductive vortex-cloud into the higher regions. Where
the conduction of the cloud is imperfect, it is temporarily
restored by lightning-flashes springing between the layers of
cloud insulated from one another, or between cloud and earth;
and finally, on the whirling storm passing away, and the cloud
formed by it breaking up, the whole of the electricity will
again equalize itself with the earth's electricity by flashes of
lightning, or will in part pass into the air as atmospheric
electricity.
    Many observations of the formation of thunder-storms have
been made from the summits of high mountains or from
balloons ; and almost all of the observers have spoken of
several layers of clouds one above another, either joined to
gether or between which flashes of lightning sprang. The
most instructive description is that given by M. Wite*, who ob
served from a balloon the rise of a heavy thunder-storm. He
saw "two layers of cloud, one about 2000 feet above the other,
of which the upper one sent snow, rain, and hail to the lower.
Between the two passed noiseless undulating masses of yellowish
light. Electric discharges, with lightning and thunder, oc
curred always in the lower layer ; yet the thunder-storm was
far more violent above both layers than below them. The
upper layer was strongly agitated by a west wind." That the
observer could see only two clouds, one above the other, is
explicable, since his balloon was at the altitude of the interval.
It is to be presumed that several more such layers of cloud, up
to the highest region of the atmosphere, were present, between
which the observed precipitation and processes of electric con
duction took place. By the heavy rain falling from the upper
cloud layer, especially from its middle, the two were conduc-

tively connected, and thereby submitted to the process of
electric distribution.
   To the theory of the sun's electric potential might still be
opposed the objection that the electric attraction between the
sun and the planets, and the repulsion which the latter would
necessarily exert upon one another and upon their satellites,
would modify the basis of the astronomical calculations, since
then, besides gravitation, an additional force, the electrical,
would have to be taken into account.
   This objection is perfectly legitimate. But as electric force,
equally with gravitation, stands in the ratio of the square
of the distance of the centres, the paths of the planets would
remain unaltered if a part of the gravitational were replaced
by an electrical attraction. Only the calculated ratio of the
masses of the sun and planets to that of the earth would be
changed. These alterations would be sensible, especially in
the case of the small planets and the satellites, since electric
force is a function of the surface. On the other hand, how
ever, the disturbing influences exerted by the planets and their
satellites upon one another's paths must be changed if gravi
tation be diminished by electric repulsion.
   Perhaps it is reserved for astronomy to bring out from the
perturbations of the paths of Mercury, the asteroids, and the
satellites the demonstration of the existence or nonexistence
of an electric potential of the sun.
XXVI. On Porous Bodies in relation to Sound. By Lord
   Ratleigh, D.C.L., F.R.S., Cavendish Professor of Physics
   in the University of Cambridge* .
IN Acoustics we have sometimes to consider the incidence
       of aerial waves upon porous bodies, in whose interstices
some sort of aerial continuity is preserved. Tyndall has shown
that in many cases sound penetrates such bodies, e. g. thick
pieces of felt, more freely than would have been expected,
though it is reflected from quite thin layers of continuous
solid matter. On the other hand, a hay-stack seems to form
a very perfect obstacle. It is probable that porous walls give
a diminished reflection, so that within a building so bounded
resonance is less prolonged than would otherwise be the case.
   When we inquire into the matter mechanically, it is evi
dent that sound is not destroyed by obstacles as such. In the
absence of dissipative forces, what is not transmitted must
be reflected. Destruction depends upon viscosity and upon

 conduction of heat ; but the influence of these is enormously
augmented by the contact of solid matter exposing a large
surface. At such a surface the tangential as well as the nor
mal motion is hindered, and a passage of heat to and fro takes
place, as the neighbouring air is heated and cooled during its
condensations and rarefactions. With such rapidity of alter
nations as we are concerned with in the case of audible sounds,
 these influences extend to only a very thin layer of the air
 and of the solid, and are thus greatly favoured by attenuation
 of the masses.
    I have thought that it might be interesting to consider a
little more definitely a problem sufficiently representative of
that of a porous wall, in order to get a better idea of the
magnitudes of the effects to be expected. We may conceive
an otherwise continuous wall, presenting a flat face, to be per
forated by a great number of similar small channels, uniformly
distributed, and bounded by surfaces everywhere perpendi
cular to the face. If the channels be sufficiently numerous,
the transition from simple plane waves outside to the state of
aerial vibration corresponding to the interior of a channel of
infinito length, occupies a space which is small relative to the
wave-length of the vibration, and then the connexion between
the condition of things inside and outside admits of simple
expression.
   Considering first the interior of one of the channels, and
taking the axis of x parallel to the axis of the channel, we sup
pose that as functions of x the velocity-components u, v, w, and
the condensation s are proportional to e"tr, while as functions
of t everything is proportional to eM, n being real. The rela
tionship between k and n depends on the nature of the gas and
upon the size and form of the channel, and must be found in
each case by a special investigation. Supposing it known for
the present, we will go on to show how the problem of reflec
tion is to be dealt with.
   For this purpose consider the equation of continuity as in
tegrated over the cross section of the channel a. Since the
walls are impenetrable,

so that
                   n^sd<r + K^udo-=0                          (1)
This result is applicable at points distant from the open end
more than several diameters of the channel.
   Taking now the origin of x at the face of the wall, we have
to form corresponding expressions for the waves outside ; and

                        in relation to Sound.                  183

 we may here neglect the effects of friction and heat- conduction.
 Ifobe the velocity of sound in the open, and x0=n/a, we
may write

                    M=a(-ei'o*+Be-<'<o*y*'; .... (3)
so that the incident wave is
                    s=ei^'+'o'\                                (4)
or, on throwing away the imaginary part,
                    s= cos (nt + Kox).     . . . . . . (5)
These expressions are applicable when x exceeds a moderate
multiple of the distance between the channels. Close up to
the face the motion will be more complicated; but we have no
need to investigate it in detail. The ratio of u and s at a
place near the wall is given with sufficient accuracy by put
ting ^=0 in (2) and (3),

   We now assume that a region about x=0, on one side of
which (6) is applicable and on the other side of which (1) is
applicable, may be taken so small relatively to the wave-length
that the mean pressures are sensibly the same at the two boun
daries, and that the flow into the region at the one boundary
is sensibly equal to the flow oat of the region at the other
boundary. The equality of flow does not imply an equality
of mean velocities, since the areas concerned are different.
The mean velocities will be inversely proportional to the cor
responding areas—that is, in the ratio a- : a + a1, if a' denote
the area of the imperforated part of the wall corresponding to
each channel. By (1) and (6) the connexion between the
inside and outside motion is expressed by
                     nrr-                ,
We will denote the ratio of the unperforated to the perforated
parts of the wall by g, so that g = a' /a. Thus,

If <7=0, k=k0, there is no reflection ; if there are no perfora
tions, <7=oo , and then B=l, signifying a complete reflection.
 In place of (7) we may write

which is the solution of the problem proposed. It is under
stood that waves which have once entered the wall do not
return. When dissipative forces act, this condition may
always be satisfied by supposing the channels long enough.
The necessary length of channel, or thickness of wall, will
depend upon the properties of the gas and upon the size and
shape of the channels.
   Even in the absence of dissipative forces there must be
reflection, except in the extreme case <7=0. Putting *=«o
in (8), we have
                          B=2^                                  <»>
If #=1 (that is, if half the wall be cut away), B =         B2=^,
so that the reflection is but small. If the channels be cir
cular, and arranged in square order as close as possible to each
other, g=(i— ir)/ir, whence B = -121, B2 = '015, nearly all the
motion being transmitted.
   It remains to consider the value of k. The problem of the
propagation of sound in a circular tube, having regard to the
influence of viscosity and heat-conduction, has been solved
analytically by KirchhofP, on the suppositions that the tan
gential velocity and the temperature-variation vanish at the
walls. In discussing the solution, Kirchhoff takes the case in
which the dimensions of the tube are such that the immediate
effects of the dissipative forces are confined to a relatively thin
stratum in the neighbourhood of the walls. In the present
application interest attaches rather to the opposite extreme,
viz. when the diameter is so small that the frictional laver
pretty well fills the tube. Nothing practically is lost by an
other simplification which it is convenient to make (following
Kirchhoff)—that the velocity of propagation of viscous and
thermal effects is negligible in comparison with that of sound.
   One result of the investigation may be foreseen. When
the diameter of the tube is very small, the conduction of heat
from the centre to the circumference of the column of air
becomes more and more free. In the limit the temperature of
the solid walls controls that of the included gas, and the expan
 sions and rarefactions take place isothermally. Under these
circumstances there is no dissipation due to conduction, and
everything is the same as if no heat were developed at all.
 Consequently the coefficient of heat-conduction will not appear
in the result, which will involve, moreover, the Newtonian
value of the velocity of sound (b) and not that of Laplace (a).
   Starting from KirchhofFs formulas, we find as the value of

If we suppose r=TTjlgTJ centim., and g=l, we shall have a wall
of pretty close texture. In this case, by (18), p'=47"4, and
 I'= -0412. A four-per-cent. loss may not appear to be much;
but we must remember that in prolonged resonance we are
 concerned with the accumulated effects of a large number of
reflections, so that rather a small loss in a single reflection
may well be material. The thickness of the porous layer
necessary to produce this eflect is less than one centimetre.
    Again, suppose r=jfoj centim., g = l. We find j/=4'74,
I' =-342, and the necessary thickness would be less than 10
centimetres.
    If r be much greater than TJ5 centim., the exchange of heat
between the air and the walls of the channels is no longer
sufficiently free for the expansions to be treated as isothermal.
 When r is so great that the thermal and viscous effects extend
only through a small fraction of it, we have the case discussed
by Kirchhoff. If we suppose for simplicity ^=0 (a state of
things, it is true, not strictly consistent with channels of cir
cular section*), we have
                       I=A,                                         (19)

The incident sound is absorbed more and more completely as
the diameter of the channels increases ; but at the same time
a greater thickness becomes necessary in order to prevent a
return from the further side. If # = 0, there is no theoretical
limit to the absorption ; and, as we have seen, a moderate
value of g does not by itself entail more than a comparatively
small reflection. A loosely compacted hay- or straw-stack
would seem to be as effective an absorbent of sound as any
thing likely to be met with.
   Inlarge spaces bounded by non-porous walls, roof, and floor,
and with few windows, a prolonged resonance seems inevitable.
The mitigating influence of thick carpets in such cases is well
known. The application of similar material to the walls, or
to the roof, appears to offer the best chance of further im
provement.
   * The problem in two dimensions is somewhat simpler than that treated
by Kirchnofl. Although it would allow us without violence to suppose
ff=0, it seems scarcely worth while to enter upon it here, as the results
are of precisely the same character. The principal difference is that the
hyperbolic functions cosh &c. replace that of Bessel.

XXVII. On the Size of Conductors for the Distribution of
   Electric Energy. By Thomas Gray, B.Sc, F.R.S.E.*
THE principal questions which have to be considered in
       the determination of the proper size of conductors for
the distribution of electric energy are :—
    (1) Economy t, or the amount of metal which must be put
into the conductor in order that the sum of the annual cost
for interest on capital, for depreciation, and for energy lost in
consequence of heat generated in the conductor by the
current may be a minimum.
    (2) Safety, or the amount of metal necessary to prevent
excessive heating.
    (3) Regulation, or the amount of metal required to prevent
too great a variation of potential along the leads.
    In the consideration of the question of economy, let I be
the fraction of the original cost of the conductors to be
allowed annually for interest and depreciation combined, let P
be the price per unit volume of the conductor, A its sectional
area, and I its length. Then the cost per annum of possess
ing the conductor is
   Again, if E be taken as the cost of one erg of electric
energy, c the current flowing in the conductor at any time t,
and 8 the specific resistance of the material, the energy lost
in heat will cost per annum
where T is the number of seconds in a year. In most cases c
will be a complicated and somewhat uncertain function of t, in
consequence of which it may only be possible to form a rough
estimate of the value of the integral. Let C be such a
quantity that
                      Eslj'Tc!Id«=EC2S^T,
and we get for the total annual expenditure due to the con
ductors the expression

 where i is the fraction of the original cost to be allowed per
 second for interest and depreciation.
    Equation (1) shows that, from a purely economical point of
view, the section of the conductor should be directly propor
tional to the quantity C, which, when the current is continuous
and of constant value, is the current-strength in C.G.S. units,
 but which, when the current is variable, has such a value that
 the heat which would be generated by a continuous and con
 stant current of that value is equal to the actual heat gene
rated. The section should also be directly proportional to the
square root of the product of the cost of energy and the spe
 cific resistance of the conductor, and inversely proportional to
the square root of the product of the first cost and the rate
of interest and depreciation to be allowed, while it is inde
pendent of the length of the circuit.
    Equation (1) gives in all cases an inferior limit below
which it is not advisable to reduce the section of the con
ductor. It should be noticed, however, that the investigation
proceeds on the assumption that the whole of the energy wasted
is due to the heat generated in the main conductor by the
current. This assumption may be, in many cases, inadmis
sible, owing to the varying E.M.F. at which the electricity
would be supplied ; and in such cases the economy problem
assumes different forms depending on the conditions imposed.

 or, when C is reckoned in amperes,
    This gives 60 amperes per square centimetre of section as
the proper relation between the current and the section of the
 conductor. It must be remembered, however, that this calcu
 lation is based on the assumption of bare copper conductors
and on a particular estimate of the cost of energy, both of
which may have to be greatly modified in particular cases.
    If, for example, covered cable costing, say, five times as
 much as bare copper be used, the proper ratio of the section
of the conductor to the current would be
                          C~ 60^5 ~ 134'                    w
or for every 134 amperes of current there should be one
square centimetre of section in the copper conductor.
                              Safety.
    We have next to consider whether the size of the conduc
tors given by the above considerations will be sufficient for
safety. The answer to this question depends on the rise of
temperature which will be produced by the greatest current
which is to be sent through the conductor. (This greatest
current must not be confounded with C in equation (1), as the
strength of the current may occasionally greatly exceed that
which it is proper to use according to that equation.) It
is easy to calculate to a considerable degree of approximation
the rise of temperature which will be produced in a con
ductor by an electric current when wo know the specific
resistance of the material, the emissivity of tho surface, and,
in the case of covered wire, the thermal conductivity of the
covering.
   If we assume the rate of cooling for any conductor per unit
length per unit difference of temperature to be r, we have for
the total rise of temperature t tho equation

 temperature depends directly on the square of the current and
 on the specific resistance of the material, and, if we neglect
 the variation of specific resistance with temperature, inversely
 on the rate of cooling and the section of the conductor.
   If we assume 50° C. as the maximum rise of temperature,
we have for the section of the conductor,

maximum value of c will be 100 amperes per square centi

  From this we see that the conductor will only rise 50° 0.
in temperature when the current is of such strength as to
require a conductor eight and a half centimetres in diameter.
The question of safety, then, may, at least in the case of un
covered copper rod, be left out of consideration when the cur
rent is less than 5000 amperes.
   Next take the case of a conductor covered with a substance
whose thermal conductivity is h. In this case r depends both
on the rate of cooling from the surface, or the emissivity, and
on the conductivity k.
   Let e = emissivity of the surface,
        T= difference of temperature between the two surfaces
             of the covering,

   It is of great importance, especially in electric-lighting cir
cuits, that the E.M.F. at which the electricity is supplied

            for the Distribution of Electric Energy.         193

to for the purpose of securing this ; but we do not propose to
go further into the matter at present than to investigate what
the maximum difference of E.M.F. will bo between different
parts of the systems when the conductors are of the size which
we should be inclined, from economical considerations, to adopt.
   Let the E.M.F. between the conductors at any point P of
the system (say at the poles of the generator) bo kept at the
constant value e volts. Then, if the current in amperes per
square centimetre section of the conductor be c, we have

where x is the E.M.F. in volts per unit length along the con

XXVIII. On the Thermoelectric, Actinoelectric, and Piezoelec
       tric Properties of Quartz. By W. C. RoNTGEN*.
I^HE last of the experiments described in my second com
       munication on the optical behaviour of quartz in the
electrical field induced me (as already mentioned f) to inves
tigate experimentally the electrical properties of quartz, espe
cially its thermoelectric and actinoelectric properties. In this
investigation I very soon arrived at the conclusion that it is
possible to refer to a common cause the evolution of electricity
brought about in very different ways, whether by conduc
tion of heat, radiation, or alteration of pressure—namely, to a
change in the strains produced in the crystal by any means.
I therefore consider it unnecessary to distinguish the three
kinds of electricity named as differing from each other in their
mode of production, and should propose to retain only the
name piezoelectricity, if further investigation should show
that the method of explanation indicated is applicable in all
cases and sufficient. I have delayed the publication of this
view and of these experiments, in the first place because the
experiments were not altogether complete, and, secondly,
because my theory is so entirely at variance with that pro
posed by so experienced and skilful an experimenter as
Herr Hankel. It seems to me now, however, not possible to
wait longer ; and in the following I briefly describe the most
important of my experiments.
   I think we may conclude, from the electro-optical experi
ments described, that increase of a uniform surface-pressure
exerted all over a quartz cylinder or quartz sphere produces
such an evolution of electricity that the surface is divided by
the three planes of no piezoelectricity into six electrical
fields, which have the same position and sign as those ob
tained by the method of increase of pressure in one direction,
described on p. 100 of my second paper (Phil. Mag. August
 1883).
    If we bring a non-electrified and hot sphere, having a
uniform temperature all over, into a colder space (so that it
can cool uniformly), the external layers, which cool first, will
exert a pressure upon the inner ones everywhere in a radial
direction, which will increase rapidly at first : consequently
during this period, which we will call the first, we shall have
the same distribution of electricity upon the sphere which
corresponds to an increase of surface-pressure mechanically
exerted upon it. After some time, when the cooling has

           On tJie Thermoelectric Properties of Quartz.           195
advanced further, the pressure exerted by the outer layers
does not increase any more, but begins to diminish ; but then
the sign of the piezoelectricity evolved changes also, and
the electricity produced during the first period becomes more
and more weakened. During this second period the sphere
becomes continually less strongly electric; and it may hap
pen, especially if a part of the electricity produced has dis
appeared by conduction during the first period, that the all
but cold sphere shows an electrification which is the opposite
of that found when the cooling commenced.
   These conclusions I have been able to verify repeatedly
by observing the electricity appearing upon a sphere of
quartz freely suspended, during cooling. Herr Hankel* has
also observed the phenomena just described with quartz
crystals. He, however, calls the electricity which makes its
appearance at first actinoelectricity, and that remaining at
the last thermoelectricity.
   By heating a quartz sphere as uniformly as possible, I have
obtained phenomena altogether analogous to the preceding ;
but the electricities are now of the opposite sign.
   If we observe that the outer layers which receive the heat
first exert upon the inner ones a radially directed tension, and
that, by increase of a tension exerted upon ,the quartz, the
same piezoelectricity is produced as by the decrease of pres
sure acting in the same direction, the explanation becomes
easy.
   Local cooling of a previously heated crystal by means of a
cold stream of air directed against the crystal produces an
energetic evolution of electricity at the points cooled, if these
points did not lie exactly in a plane of no piezoelectricity;
the nature of the resulting electricity was the same as that
which would be produced at the same place by the increase of
a pressure exerted there in the direction of a diameter. Local
heating by a current of warm air produced, on the other hand,
electricity of the opposite kind. In the first case we have a
rapid increase of the pressure exerted by the outer layers upon
the inner ones; in the second case, where the outer layers tend
to raise themselves above the inner ones, the resulting tension
increases very rapidly. I therefore consider the electricity
produced to be simply piezoelectric. The electricity which
Herr Friedel observed to be produced by placing a heated
metal ball upon a quartz crystal is identical, both in sign and
in mode of production, with that produced by a hot current of
air: it is therefore piezoelectricity. Herr Friedel calls it
thermoelectricity; Herr Hankel actinoelectricity.

                                   Q2

196        On the Thermoelectric Properties of Quartz.
   The following experiments seem to me peculiarly adapted to
support my theory.
   A ring of tinfoil, of internal diameter 2 centim. and exterior
diameter 4 centim., was cemented to a homogeneous plate of
quartz cut at right angles to the principal axis ; the ring was
then cut through radially at six points in the direction of the
axis of no piezoelectricity, so that six pieces of the ring,
insulated from each other, were obtained. The first, third,
and fifth pieces were connected by wires with one half-ring of
a Kirchhoff-Thomson electrometer, the second, fourth, and
sixth pieces and the other half-ring of the electrometer being
connected with the earth.
   If then, the plate possessing, to begin with, the temperature
of the room, the central uncovered portion was heated by
placing a warm metallic cylinder upon it, or by radiation
from a flame or from a heated piece of metal, or by a current
of hot air, or in any other way, then the portions of the ring
became electrified, so that each portion of the ring acquired
the same electricity as the end of the secondary axis lying
next it would have acquired if there had been increase in
a pressure acting in the direction of the corresponding
secondary axis. Cooling of the central portion produced in
any way, on the other hand, always produced the opposite
electricities.
    If now, in a subsequent experiment, it was not the central
 portion of the plate, but that surrounding the tinfoil ring
which was heated or cooled as the case might be, then, in case
 of heating, the electrometer showed the presence of the same
 electricity previously found by cooling the centre, and con
 versely, in case of cooling, the same electricity as was produced
 by heating the centre.
    These results are not surprising if we start from the view
 that changes in tension in the crystal are the cause to which
 the evolution of electricity is due. In the first and fourth
 cases, for example, heating at the centre, or cooling at the
 periphery, produces tensions in the plate which are of the
 same kind as those produced by a uniformly distributed pres
 sure exerted upon the edge. In the second and third cases
 central cooling or peripheral heating produces a condition
 of tension analogous to the condition brought about by a
 uniformly distributed tension exerted upon the edge. In all
 cases, during the time immediately following the heating or
 cooling as the case may be, a rapid increase of the tensions pro
 duced takes place. Consequently in the two cases first men
 tioned there must be the same distribution of electricity as
 would correspond to an increase of the pressure exerted upon

               On Concave Gratings for Optical Purposes.           197
   the edge of the plate ; in the two last-mentioned cases, the
    distribution corresponding to a diminution of pressure.
       We see from these experiments that the nature of the
   electricity produced is not dependent upon the particular
   method by which a local heating or warming is produced,
   but depends essentially upon the position in the crystal of the
   point where these changes in temperature take place. From
  the result that heating the peripheral portions of the plate and
  heating the central portions produce opposite electrical effects,
  I am disposed to draw a conclusion, which indeed has not yet
  been experimentally demonstrated but which seems to me
  tolerably safe. If we suppose it possible to warm a plate so
  uniformly that no perceptible differences of temperature or
  tensions should be produced, then I believe that this heating
  would produce no electricity or relatively very little, although
  the particles of the plate suffer considerable displacement
  amongst themselves. If, now, we consider that even very
 small displacements of the particles produce very considerable
 quantities of electricity, if these displacements are accompanied
 by changes of tension in the crystal (as is the case, for
 example, with irregular heating of a plate), the assumption
 seems to bo justified that change of temperature and position
 of the particles in itself produces no electricity, but that, on the
 other hand, the real cause of the evolution of electricity is to
 be found in changes of tension.
     In what has been described I have made a first attempt to
 explain the electricity produced in quartz by change of tem
 perature as due to stress produced in the crystal. I am well
 aware that the explanation given in the separate cases is here
and there defective, and that further investigations are neces
sary in order to establish the exact connexion between changes
of temperature and evolution of electricity.

produces what have been called " ghosts " in the spectrum. At
first I attempted to calculate the effect of other irregularities
by the ordinary method of integration; but the results obtained
were not commensurate with the labour. I then sought for a
simpler method. Guided by the fact that inverse methods in
electrical distribution are simpler than direct methods, I soon
found an inverse method for use in this problem.
   In the use of the grating in most ordinary spectroscopes the
telescopes are fixed as nearly parallel as possible, and the gra
ting turned around a vertical axis to bring the different spectra
into tho field of view. The rays striking on the grating are
nearly parallel ; but for the sake of generality I shall assume
that they radiate from a point in space, and shall investigate
the proper ruling of the gracing to bring the rays back to the
point from which they started. The wave-fronts will be a
series of spherical shells at equal distances apart : if these
waves strike on a reflecting surface they will be reflected
back, provided they can do so all in the same phase. A
sphere around the radiant-points satisfies the condition for
waves of all lengths; and this gives the case of ordinary reflec
tion. Let any surface cut the wave-surface in any manner,
and let us remove those portions of the surface which are cut
by the wave-surface. The light of that particular wave-length
can then be reflected back along the same path and in the
same phase; and thus, by the above principle, a portion will be
thus sent back. But the solution only holds for one wave
length; and so white light will be drawn out into a spectrum.
Hence we have the important conclusion that a theoretically
perfect grating for one position of the slit and eyepiece can
be ruled on any surface, flat or otherwise. This is an ex
tremely important practical conclusion, and explains many
facts which have been observed in the use of gratings. For
we see that errors of the dividing-engine can be counter
balanced by errors in the flatness of the plate ; so that a bad
tions, for which I have not yet had time, I did not publish it at the time.
I was much surprised soon after to see an article on this subject, which
had been presented to the Physical Society and was published in the
Philosophical Magazine. The articlo contains nothing more than an ex
tension of my remarks at the Physical Society, and formula? similar to
those in this paper. As I have not before this" published any thing except
a preliminary notice of the concave grating, I expected a little time to
work up the subject, seeing that the practical work of photographing the
spectrum has recently absorbed all my time. But probably 1 have waited
too long.

                     for Optical Purposes.                   199
dividing-engine may now and then make a grating which is
good in one spectrum but not in all. And so we often find
that one spectrum is better than another. Furthermore Prof.
Young has observed that he could often improve the definition
of a grating by slightly bending the plates on which it was
ruled.
   From the above theorem, we see that if a plate is ruled in
circles whose radius is rsin/u, and whose distance apart is
Ar sin p, where Ar is constant, then the ruling will be appro
priate to bring the spectrum to a focus at a distance r and
angle of incidence fi. Thus we should need no telescope
to view the spectrum in that particular position of the grating.
Had the wave-surfaces been cylindrical instead of spherical,
the lines would have been straight instead of circular, but at
the above distances apart. In this case the spectrum would
have been brought to a focus, but would have been diffused in
the direction of the lines.
   In the same way we can conclude that in flat gratings any
departure from a straight line has the effect of causing the
dust in the slit and the spectrum to have different foci—a fact
sometimes observed.
   We also see that if the departure from equal spaces is small,
or, in other words, the distance r is great, the lines must be
ruled at distances apart represented by
                      \     r sin p,      /
in order to bring the light to a focus at the angle fi and dis
tance r, c being a constant and a; the distance from some point
on the plate. If fi changes sign, the r must change in sign.
Hence we see that the effect of a linear error in the spacing is
to make the focus on one side shorter and the other side longer
than the normal amount. Prof. Peirce has measured some of
Mr. Rutherfurd's gratings and found that the spaces increased
in passing along the grating; and he also found that the foci
of symmetrical spectra were different. But this is the first
attempt to connect the two. The definition of a grating may
thus be very good even when the error of run of the screw is
considerable, provided it is linear.
                        Concave Gratings.
   Let us now take the special case of lines ruled on a spherical
surface; and let us not confine ourselves to light coming back
to the same point, but let the light return to another point.
Let the coordinates of the radiant-point and focal point be
y=0, x=—a, and y = 0, x= +a, and let the centre of the

200        Prof. H. A. Rowland on Concave Gratings
sphere whose radius is p be at x1, %f. Let r be the distance
from the radiant-point to the point x, y, and let R be that from
the focal point to x, y. Let us then write
                          2b=U + rc,
where c is equal to + 1 according as the reflected or transmitted
ray is used. Should we increase b by equal quantities and
draw the ellipsoids or hyperboloid so indicated, we could use
the surfaces in the same way as the wave-surface above. The
intersections of these surfaces with any other surface form
what are known as Huyghens's zones. By actually drawing
these zones on the surface we form a grating which will
reflect or refract the light of a certain wave-length to the
given focal point. For the particular problem in hand we
need only work in the plane x, y for the present.
    Let s bo an element of the curve of intersection of the given
 surface with the plane x,y. Then our present problem is to
 find the width of Huyghens's zones on the surface—that is,
ds in terms of db.

    This equation gives us the proper distance of the rulings on
 the surface; and if we could get a dividing-engine to rule
 according to this formula, the problem of bringing the spec
 trum to a focus without telescopes would be solved. But an
 ordinary dividing-engine rules equal spaces; and so we shall
 further investigate the question whether there is any part of
 the circle where the spaces are equal. We can then write

                       for Optical Purposes.                       201

since these values satisfy the equation. The line of foci is
then a circle with a radius equal to one half p. Hence, if a
source of light exist on this circle, the reflected image and all
the spectra will be brought to a focus on the same circle. This
is, if we attach the slit, the eyepiece, and the grating to the
three radii of the circle, however we move them, we shall
always have some spectrum in the focus of the eyepiece. But
in some positions the line of foci is so oblique to the direction
of the light, that only one line of the spectrum can be seen
well at any one time. The best position of the eyepiece, as
far as we consider this fact, is thus the one opposite to the
grating and at its centre of curvature. In this position the
line of foci is perpendicular to the direction of the light ; and
we shall show presently that the spectrum is normal at this
point whatever the position of the slit, provided it is on the
circle.                        ^ L
    Fig. 1 represents this case. A is the slit, C is the eyepiece,
 and B is the grating with its centre of curvature at C. In
 this case all the conditions are satisfied by fixing the grating
 and eyepiece to the bar B C, whose ends rest, on carriages
 moving on the rails A B and A C at right angles to each
 other. When desired, the radius A D may be put in to hold
 every thing steady; but this has been found practically unne
 cessary.
    The proper formula? for this case are as follows. If \ is
 the wave-length, and w the distance apart of the lines of the
 grating from centre to centre, then we have
                          1    \N     . v

 Now in the given case p is constant, and so N\ is propor

  tional to the line A C. Or, for any giveu spectrum, the wave
  length is proportional to that line.
     If a micrometer is fixed at C, we can consider the case as
  follows:
                    C = 2^=Ksm/*+ sin v),
                   dX    w
                   du    N
     If D is the distance the cross-hairs of the micrometer move
 forward for one division of the head, we can write for the
 point C,
                             A     D
                                   P
 and for the same point fi is zero. Hence
                             M     wT)
                                   Np
    But this is independent of v ; and we thus arrive at the
 important fact that the value of a division of the micrometer
 is always the same for the same spectrum and can always
 be determined with sufficient accuracy from the dimensions
 of the apparatus and number of lines on the grating, as well
 as by observations of the spectrum.
    Furthermore, this proves that the spectrum is normal at
 this point and to the same scale in the same spectrum. Hence
 we have only to photograph the spectrum to obtain the nor
 mal spectrum, and a centimetre for any of the photographs
 always represents the same increase of wave-length.
    It is to be specially noted that this theorem is rigidly true
whether the adjustments are correct or not, provided only
that the micrometer is on the line drawn perpendicularly
from the centre of the grating, even if it is not at the centre
of curvature.
    As the radius of curvature of concave gratings is usually
great, the distance through which the spectrum remains practi
cally normal is very great. In the instrument which I prin
cipally use, the radius of curvature, p, is about 21 ft. 4 inches,
the width of the ruling being about 5"5 inches. In such an
instrument the spectrum thrown on a flat plate is normal
within about 1 part in 1,000,000 for six inches, and less than
1 in 35,000 for eighteen inches. In photographing the
spectrum on a flat plate, the definition is excellent for twelve
inches ; and by use of a plate bent to 11 ft. radius, a plate of
twenty inches length is in perfect focus, and the spectrum

                        for Optical Purposes.                  205
still so nearly normal as to have its error neglected for most
purposes.
   It is also to be noted that this theorem of the normal spectrum
applies also to the flat grating used with telescopes, and to
either reflecting or transmitting gratings ; but in these cases
only a small portion of the spectrum can be used, as no lens
can be made perfectly achromatic. And so, as the distance of
the micrometer has constantly to be changed when one passes
along the spectrum, its constant does not remain constant but
varies in an irregular manner. But it would be possible to
fix the grating, one objective, and the camera rigidly on a
bar, and then focus by moving the slit or then other objective.
In this case the spectrum would be normal, but would pro
bably be in focus for only a small length only, and the adjust
ment of the focus would not be automatic.
    Another important property of the concave grating is that
all the superimposed spectra are in focus at the same point,
and so by micrometric measurements the relative wave-lengths
are readily determined. Hence, knowing the absolute wave
length of one line, the whole spectrum can be measured.
 Prof. Peirce has determined the absolute wave-length of one
 line with great care; and I am now measuring the coinci
 dences. This method is greatly more accurate than any
 hitherto known, as by mere eye-inspection the relative wave
 length can often be judged to one part in twenty thousand,
 and with a micrometer to 1 in 1,000,000. Again, in dealing
 with the invisible portion of the spectrum, the focus can be
 obtained by examining the superimposed spectrum. Capt.
 Abney, by using a concave mirror in the place of telescopes,
 has been enabled to use this method for obtaining the focus
 in photographing the ultra-red rays of the spectrum.
    But nothing can exceed the beauty and simplicity of the
concave grating when mounted on a movable bar such as I
have described and illustrated in fig. 1. Having selected the
grating which we wish to use, we mount it in its plate-holder
 and put the proper collimating eyepiece in place. We then
 carefully adjust the focus by altering the length of p until
the cross-hairs are at the exact centre of curvature of the
 grating. On moving the bar the whole series of spectra are
then in exact focus, and the value of a division of the micro
 meter is a known quantity for that particular grating. The
 wooden way, A G, on which the carriage moves is gradu
 ated to equal divisions representing wave-lengths, since the
wave-length is proportional to the distance A C. We can
thus set the instrument to any particular wave-length we
 may wish to study, or even determine the wave-length to

206        Prof. H. A. Rowland on Concave Gratings
one part in at least five thousand by a simple reading. By
having a variety of scales, one for each spectrum, we can im
mediately see what lines are superimposed on each other,
and identify them accordingly when we are measuring their
relative wave-length. On now replacing the eyepiece by a
camera, we are in position to photograph the spectrum with
the greatest ease. We put in the sensitive plate, either wet
or dry, and move to the part we wish to photograph. Hav
ing exposed for that part, we move to another position and
expose once more. We have no thought for the focus, for
that remains perfect, but simply refer to the table giving
the proper exposure for that portion of the spectrum, and so
have a perfect plate. Thus we can photograph the whole
spectrum on one plate in a few minutes from the F line to
the extreme violet, in several strips each 20 inches long. And
we may photograph to the red rays by prolonged exposure.
Thus the work of days with any other apparatus becomes the
work of hours with this. Furthermore each plate is to scale,
an inch on any one of the strips representing exactly so
much difference of wave-length. The scales of the different
orders of spectra are exactly proportional to the order. Of
course the superposition of the spectra gives the relative
wave-lengths. To get the superposition, of course photo
graphy is the best.
   Having so far obtained only the first approximation to the
theory of the concave grating, let us now proceed to a second
one. The dividing-engine rules equal spaces along the chord
of the circular arc of the grating ; the question is whether
any other kind of ruling would be better. For the dividing-
engine is so constructed that one might readily change it to
rule slightly different from equal spaces.
   The condition for theoretical perfection is that C shall re
main constant for all portions of the mirror. I shall therefore
investigate how nearly this is true. Let p be the radius of
curvature, and let R and r be the true distances to any point
of the grating, R<, and r0 being the distances to the centre.
Let (i and v be the general values of the angles, and /j.0 and v0
the angles referred to the centre of the mirror. The condition
is that                   ^
                         £j= sin /*+ sin v
shall be a constant for all parts of the surface of the grating.
Let us then develop sin fi and sin v in terms of /x.0, va, and
the angle 8 between radii drawn to the centre of the grating
and the point under consideration. Let 8' be the angle
between R and R0. Then we can write immediately

                       for Optical Purposes.                         207
        p sin n = p sin p.0 cos 8' + E0 sin 8' — p cos /x0 sin 8',

As the cases we are to consider are those where A is small, it

   sin n= sin p,0 cos 8 1 1 + cot p^A.8 + ^ £l + - C^8 ^°j 82
+ [A,^1+ e^»)_e™*(1+A(1+ 1))]8. + te.
   We can write the value of sin v from symmetry.                 But we
have
                         adb       .
                         2 -j- = sin u. + sin v.
                           as
In this formula db can be considered as a constant depending
on the wave-length of light &c, and ds as the width apart of
the lines on the grating. The dividing-engine rules lines on
the curved surface according to the formula
                 2 t- = cos 8 (sin p,0 + sin v0) .
But this is the second approximation to the true theoretical
ruling. And this ruling will not only be approximately cor
rect, but exact when all the terms of the series except the first
vanish.
   In the case where the slit and focus are on the circle of
radius \p, as in the automatic arrangement described above,
we have A=0, and the second and third terms of the series
 disappear, and we can write, since we have — = cos /a0 and

But in the automatic arrangement we also have v0=0; and so
the formula becomes

    To find the greatest departure from theoretical perfection,
8 must refer to the edge of the grating. In the gratings
which I am now making, p is about 260 in., and the width of
the grating about 5-4 in. Hence 8 = -r&i> approximately, and
the series becomes
                         1_ 2000000 ***
Hence the greatest departure from the theoretical ruling,
even when tan p,0 = 2, is 1 in 1,000,000. Now the distance
 apart of the components of the 1474 line is somewhat nearly
 one forty-thousandth of the wave-length ; and I scarcely
 suppose that any line has been divided by the best spectro
 scope in the world whose components are less than one third
 of this distance apart. Hence we see that the departure of
 the ruling from theoretical perfection is of little consequence
 until we are able to divide lines twenty times as fine as the
 1474 line. Even in that case, since the error of ruling
 varies as 83, the greater portion of the grating would be ruled
 correctly.
     The question now comes up as to whether there is any limit
 to the resolving power of a spectroscope. This evidently
 depends upon the magnifying power and the apparent width
 of the lines. The magnifying power can be varied at pleasure ;
 and so we have only to consider the width of the lines of the
 spectrum. The width of the line evidently depends in a perfect
 grating upon three circumstances—the width of the slit, the
 number of lines in the grating, and the true physical width
 of the line. The width of the slit can be varied at pleasure;
 the number of lines on the grating can be made very great
  (160,000 in one of mine); and hence we are only limited by
  the true physical width of the lines. We have numerous cases
  of wide lines, such as the C line, the components of the D*
 and H lines, and numerous others which are perfectly fami-
    * I have recently discovered that each component of the D lino is
 double, probably from the partial reversal of the line as we nearly always
 see it in the llame-spectrum.

                         for Optical Purposes.                    209
liar to every spectroscopist. Hence we are free to suppose
that all lines have some physical width ; and we are limited
by that width in the resolving power of our spectroscopes.
Indeed, from a theoretical standpoint we should suppose this
to be true ; for the molecules only vibrate freely while swing
ing through their free path ; and in order to have the physical
width j-jj^QQ^- of the wave-length, the molecule must make
somewhat nearly one hundred thousand vibrations in its free
path ; but this would require a free path of about two inches!
Hence it would be only the outermost solar atmosphere that
could produce such fine lines ; and we can hardly expect to
see much finer ones in the solar spectrum. Again*, it is
found impossible to obtain interference between two rays
whose paths differ by much more than 50,000 wave-lengths.
   All the methods of determining the limit seem to point to
         150000 of the wave-length
about -—1—                           6 as the smallest distance at
which two lines can be separated in the solar spectrum by
even a spectroscope of infinite power. As we can now nearly
approach this limit, I am strongly of the opinion that we have
nearly reached the limit of resolving-power, and that we can
never hope to see very many more lines in the spectrum than
can be seen at present, either by means of prisms or gratings;
for the same limit holds in either case. It is not to be
supposed, however, that the average wave-length of the line is
not more definite than this; for we can easily point the cross
hairs to the centre of the line to perhaps 1 in 1,000,000 of the
 wave-length. The most exact method of detecting the coin
 cidences of a line of a metal with one in the solar spectrum
 would thus be to take micrometric measurements first on one
 and then on the other ; but I suppose it would take several
 readings to make the determination to 1 in 1,000,000.
     Since writing the above I have greatly improved my
 apparatus, and can now photograph 150 lines between the H
 and K lines, including many whose wave-length does differ
 more than 1 in about 80,000. I have also photographed the
 1474 and b3 and 64 widely double, and also one of the E lines
just perceptibly double. With the eye much more can be
 seen ; but I must say that I have not yet seen many signs of
 reaching a limit. The lines yet appear as fine and sharp as
 with a lower power. If my grating is assumed to be perfect,
 in the third spectrum I should be able to divide lines whose
 wave-length differed 1 in about 1 50,000, though not to photo
 graph them.
    * This method of determining the limit has been suggested to me by
 Prof. C. S. Hastings, of this University.

210           On the Aberration of Concave Gratings.
   The E line has components about , 1 ¦ of the wave-length
apart. I believe I can resolve lines much closer than this,
say 1 in 100,000 at least. Hence the idea of a limit has not
yet been proved.
   However, as some lines of the spectrum are wider than
others, we should not expect any definite limit to resolving
power, but a gradual falling-off as we increase our power. At
first, in the short wave-lengths at least, the number of lines is
nearly proportional to the resolving-power ; but this law
should fail as we approached the limit.
XXX. On Mr. Glazebrook's Paper on the Aberration of Con
   cave Gratings. By Henry A. Rowland, Professor of Phy
   sics, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore* .
IN the June number of the Philosophical Magazine Mr. R.
      T. Glazebrook has considered the aberration of the concave
frating, and arrives at the conclusion that the ones which I
  ave hitherto made are too wide for their radius of curvature.
As I had published nothing but a preliminary notice of the
grating at that time, Mr. Glazebrook had not then seen my
paper on the subject, of which I gave au abstract at the London
Physical Society in November last. In this paper I arrive
at the conclusion that there is practically no aberration, and
that in this respect there is nothing further to be desired. The
reason of this discrepancy is not far to seek. Mr. Glazebrook
assumes that the spaces are equal on the arc of the circle.
But I do not rule them in this manner, but the spaces are
equal along the chord of the arc. Again, the surface is not
 cylindrical, but spherical.
    These two errors entirely destroy the value of the paper as
 far as my gratings aro concerned ; ibr it only applies to a theo
 retical grating ruled in an entirely different manner and on a
 different form of surface from my own.
    I am very much surprised to see the method given near the
 end of the paper for constructing aplanatic gratings on any
 surface; for this is the method by which I discovered the con
 cave grating originally, and the figure is the same as that I
 put on the black board at the Meeting of the Physical Society
 in November last. I say I am surprised ; for Mr. Glaze-
 brook's paper was read at the Physical Society, where I had
 given the same method a few months before, and yet it passed
 without comment. Indeed I have given the same method at
 many of our own scientific societies. However, as Mr. Glaze
 brook was not present at the meeting referred to, he is entirely
 without blame in the matter.

XXXI. On the Production of Electricity by Evaporation, and
   on the electrical Neutrality of Vapour arising from electri
  fied Still Surfaces of Liquids. By L. J. Blake, Ph.D.*
OF the different theories as to the cause or causes of atmo
          spheric electricity, two especially have been from time
to time advocated. The basis of the first theory is the hypothesis
that electricity is produced by the simple evaporation of a
liquid. This hypothesis was first proposed by Voltaf, and
afterwards found adherents in Pouilletf, Tait and Wanklyn§.
Saussure||, Configliachilf, Erman**, Reichft, GraugainJJ, and
Biess§§ attempted to overthrow it.
     The second iheory rests chiefly upon the hypothesis that
there occurs a convection of the electricity which may be upon
the surface of any evaporating liquid. This theory was main
tained by Franklin || || , E. BecquerellHI, and De la Rive***;
and the hypothesis itself has been experimentally tested by
BufFftt- The following paper is a description of an exclu
sively experimental investigation of these two hvpotheses.
It was carried out by means of an electrometer herein de
scribed. With the very complicated phenomena of atmo
spheric electricity itself, this paper has nothing directly to do;
hence a more detailed description of the theories just stated
is unnecessary.
             I. Production of Electricity by Evaporation.
    (a) The investigation of the first hypothesis—i. e.                  that
electricity is produced simply by the change of a liquid                 into
vapour—was conducted in the following manner. The                        mo
vable plate A of a Kohlrausch condenser was connected                   with

212            Dr. L. J. Blake on the Production of
a quadrant-electrometer constructed by R. Voss of Berlin,
according to the suggestions of Von Helmholtz. The charge
of the quadrant pairs of this electrometer was maintained by
means of two Zamboni's piles of about 1500 pairs each. The
aluminium needle of the electrometer, suspended by a fine
silver thread, had the form of two nearly right-angled sectors
of a circle whose apices were joined with each other. In
order to make the instrument more sensitive, the distance
between the two horizontal surfaces of the quadrants between
which the needle swung was less than in former instruments
of a similar kind. The mirror attached to the needle swung
beneath the quadrants. The upper end of the silver thread
was fastened in a torsion head, and served also for uniting any
source of electricity with the needle. The metal frame of the
instrument, which supported the Zamboni piles, was connected
with the earth. One Daniell (Cu—CuS04—ZnS04—Zn),
one pole of which was connected with the electrometer-needle,
and the other with the earth, gave at the distance of 3 millim.
between the millimetre-scale and the mirror a deflection from
67 to 71^ millim. After six months, without disturbing in any
way the charge of the quadrants maintained by the Zamboni
piles, the deflection for 1 Daniell under similar arrangement
of experiment was from 64£ to 72 millim.
   The condenser, the electrometer, and all other apparatus
mentioned hereafter were enclosed in metal cases connected
with the earth. All the insulated connecting wires were
enclosed within brass tubes similarly connected with the
earth to neutralize the effect of outside electricity. The brass
axis, which supported at one end the collector plate B of the
condenser, was prolonged at the other end, and about 25
centim. from B was bent into the form of a ring. In this
ring rested a porcelain dish which contained in a sand-bath
a second smaller dish of the same material. By this arrange
ment the insulation in the following experiments could be
affected only through the support for the axis of B. The
insulating power of this support, upon which evidently the
reliability of the experiment depends, was measured both be
fore and after each experiment. When B was charged by
4 Daniells, and the needle of the electrometer which was in
connexion with A, distant A millim. from B, gave a deflection
of 140 millim. through influence from B, then the loss in
electricity upon B, during 10 minutes, varied from 6i to 11
millim., i. e. from 4£ to 7 per cent.
   Further, there was a peculiar electrical action through this
insulating support of the collector plate B. B, unelectrified

                      Electricity by Evaporation.                      213
and insulated, became very slowly charged in the presence of
the tinfoil upon which the condenser rested. When B was
left in the evening connected with the earth, and insulated
the next morning, there was always found upon it a charge
which produced a deflection from 10 to 17 millim., and
under similar conditions always in the same direction. In
15 minutes B became charged to a potential corresponding
to 0'5 and upwards to 2 millim. This peculiar electric
action, which was always present, must evidently be taken into
account, and is so in the following experiments. This action of
the condenser having been determined, the inner porcelain
dish was filled with the liquid to be experimented upon, and
the sand-bath heated to 100° C. The flame employed for heat
ing was then wholly removed*. A platinum wire inserted
through a narrow glass tube fused around it formed metallic
connexion between the plate B and the liquid. By the glass
the steam was prevented from coming into contact with the
wire. The condenser-plate A was separated ^ millim. from
B, and, together with the needle of the electrometer, connected
with tho earth. After 10 or 15 minutes of copious evapo
ration, A was insulated, and then separated from B. The
electrical condition of A, and consequently of B, could be
determined through the deflection of the electrometer-needle,
and any difference of electrical condition at the begining and
end of an experiment could be observed. The liquid used in
 the experiments was at first cold, and afterwards heated to
 rapid evaporation ; but otherwise the conditions were un
 changed, so as to be wholly independent of any disturbances
 possible from the nature of the apparatus itself. The following
 tables show the deflections at a distance of 3 millim. between
 the mirror and scale. 45 millim. scale-divisions denote a
 charge of 1 Daniell upon B. The deflection corresponding
 to 1 Daniell is here less than in the experiments mentioned
 above, because A is not- charged directly, but indirectly
 from B.
    * A line of experiment which I have not at the present time finished
 seems to indicate quite clearly the production of electricity in every
 flame. It was hence found necessary before each observation to extinguish
 the flame employed, because of its disturbing influence ; owing to the pre
 sence of the sand-bath, however, the evaporation was not interrupted.

lasting 15 minutes equals — 0'74millim. scale-division. This
corresponds to a negative charge upon B of O016 Daniell
(0'0145 volt). This charge is too small in proportion to the
 sea-water evaporated, to be used as a basis for mathematical
calculations concerning the electricity resident in the clouds*.
Nor is it a sufficient ground for the assertion that the simple
change of a liquid into a vapour produces electricity.
    (/;) A second method of experiment, in which the insulation
does not come at all into consideration, was as follows :—A
brass disk of 125 millim. diameter was fastened horizontally
by its centre to the end of a stout wire which was connected,
without the condenser, directly with the electrometer-needle.
Both needle and disk C could be together either insulated or
 connected with the earth. The porcelain dish containing the
liquid and resting in the insulated sand-bath was brought
 close under the disk C, and the liquid connected with the
 earth. The sand-bath having been heated and the flame em
 ployed afterwards extinguished, the vapour from the liquid
 was condensed very copiously upon the disk C. The reading
 of the electrometer-needle connected with the earth was first
 taken. Then the needle, and consequently the condensing-
 disk C, was insulated, and any deflection was observed. After
 wards the electrometer-needle was connected with the earth
 and its reading again taken. Thus a change in the needle's
 position of rest during the experiment, which always occurs
 with variations of room-temperature, was observed.

   The Tables indicate so slight a difference in the electrical
action between cold and hot sea-water (and, what is more im
portant, a difference not always of the same sign), that one is
as little entitled here as in the first-described method of expe
riment to assert that a production of electricity by simple eva
poration has been shown.
        II. Electrical Neutrality of Vapour arising from
                  electrified Still Surfaces of Liquids*.
   The second hypothesis to be tested is, that a convection of
the electricity occurs by means of the vapour arising from the
surface of an electrified liquid. An experimental research of
the validity of this hypothesis was conducted in the following
outlined methods.
   (a) The movable plate A of the Kohlrausch condenser still
remained in connexion with the needle of the electrometer.
Upon the stationary collector plate B a water-stratum was
deposited through condensation of warm-water vapour. B was
then gently heated and connected with one pole of a galvanic
battery, whose other pole was connected with the earth. The
cooler plate A was then brought to a distance of 1 millim.,
and the vapours passing from B condensed copiously upon A.
There occurred, however, no convection of the electricity,
notwithstanding that the vapour originated in a water-surface
containing one of the two electricities accumulated in the
condenser. Experiments were begun with a weak potential-

        Vapour from electrified Still Surfaces of Liquids.   217
difference of 1 Daniell between the condenser-plates; and this
difference increased up to 404 Daniells without affecting the
result. Throughout the experiments the plate A was con
nected with the earth, until it was brought opposite the plate B,
so as to protect the electrometer from too great deflections ;
then A was insulated. Any trace of electricity which might
have been conveyed by means of the vapour would have
manifested itself in the electrometer. Furthermore, there
occurred no convection of the electricity either when B
possessed the room-temperature and A was cooled below it,
or when both plates were raised equally above the room-
temperature, in which latter case evaporation without con
densation occurs. If the vapour had conveyed with it the
electricity from the water-surface, the presence of electricity
upon A would have been detected in all the above cases.
    (6) In order to produce evaporation from different liquids,
an apparatus represented in the accompanying figure was
                        AB
                      Til*
constructed. The experiments were conducted as follows. A
horizontal brass disk, C, of 125 millim. diameter, surrounded
by a metal box connected with the earth, was put in metallic
connexion with the plate B of the condenser. The sealing-
 wax supports used for insulating the connecting wire between B
 and C, and at the same time for retaining firmly the disk C in
 its proper position, were so far separated from this disk (both
 being wholly outside the metal box) that vapour employed in
 the experiment could have no effect upon the insulation. An
 insulated porcelain dish, containing the liquid to be experi
 mented upon, was placed on the arm of a retort-stand, so that
 it could be swung either under the disk C or wholly outside
 the metal box. The experiments were made in three series:—
 (1) Liquid as well as condensing-disk C of the temperature
 of the room, so that neither condensation nor marked evapo
 ration took place. (2) Liquid 100° C, disk C cooled so that
 copious evaporation and condensation resulted. (3) Liquid

 218        Dr. L. J. Blake on the electrical Neutrality of
and disk C at equal temperatures, but above the room-
temperature, so that copious evaporation took place without
condensation. The flame used in heating remained con
tinually outside the box*.
    It is necessary to free the surface of the liquid from dust-
particles, and to avoid as much as possible air-currents within
the metal box during the experiment. Moreover no minute
drops must be tossed up during rapid evaporation. In these
experiments the liquid experimented upon was in the first
place electrified to a determined potential, and was swung
under the condensing-disk C. B, and therefore C, had been
previously insulated ; and A, distant £ millim. from B, had
been connected with the earth. Next, after 3 minutes the
liquid was swung away from C. If a convection of electricity
from the surface of the liquid to C had occurred, A would
have fixed it upon B, and would have been itself charged
with the opposite kind of electricity. After A was then
insulated and separated, the presence of any fixed electricity
upon A, and therefore also upon B and C, would have been
shown by a deflection of the electrometer-needle connected
with A. The liquid was electrified by a battery of 480 zinc,
distilled water, copper elements (=404 Daniells). The de
flections, in millim. scale-divisions, observed are given in the
following table.

        Vapour from electrified Still Surfaces of Liquids.     219
    By a convection of electricity, the kind of electricity npon
A, as mentioned above, must have been the opposite to that
upon the surface of the electrified liquid. Now the tables not
only do not show this, but in every case exactly the opposite.
Upon A was always the same kind of electricity, and conse
quently upon B and C the opposite kind to that with which
the liquid was charged. The following facts explain this result.
During the experiment Band C were exposed to a strong induc
tion. Of the two electricities induced upon B and C, one would
be fixed by the surface of the liquid ; the other would be
free and would diffuse itself upon B. If the insulation of B
and C was not perfect, then a loss of free induced electricity
would occur. After the liquid was swung away from C,
there would remain upon B and C electricity equal in quantity,
but opposite in kind, to that dissipated from defective insu
 lation during the experiment. This electricity would induce
 upon A the same kind of electricity as that of the electrified
 liquid. The correctness of this explanation of the charge upon
A is confirmed by the following. Direct measurements of
 the insulating power of B and C were made previous to the
 experiments. B and C were charged either directly or indi
 rectly by means of the 480 zinc, water, copper elements ; and
 the loss during three minutes, which was the duration of
 the experiments mentioned above, was measured. This loss
 amounted to,

   The induction upon B and C in these last experiments was
maintained as nearly equal as possible to that in the first ex
periments. The close agreement of these figures with those
of the deflections in the first tables, justify the conclusion that
the electricity upon A in the first experiments was owing, not
to a convection of the electricity present upon the surface of
the liquid, but to a loss of electricity upon B and C, occurring
in consequence of defective insulation during the experiment.
   (c) The imperceptible variation in potential-difference be
tween the poles of the zinc-water-copper battery rendered
possible a method of experiment still more sensitive, in which
insulation did not come at all into consideration. Without

220       Dr. L. J. Blake on the electrical Neutrality of
employing the Kohlrausch condenser, the condensing-disk U
was directly connected with the electrometer-needle, and with
this needle was put in metallic connexion with the earth.
After the porcelain dish containing the electrified liquid was
swung under C, the needle, and therefore C, were insulated.
Only that electricity which was fixed by the closely lying
electrified surface of the liquid could now be present upon C.
 While the liquid was under C, a deflection of the needle would
show any convection of electricity from the surface of the
liquid, and also any change of potential of that electrified
surface. The following table gives the deflections, in scale-
divisions, observed while the sea-water was 3 minutes under
the disk C. As above, 70 scale-divisions correspond to a
charge of 1 Daniell.
      Positive charge, 480 elements.   Negative charge, 480 elements.

   These numbers are opposed to convection of electricity by the
vapour; otherwise no discrepancies in the signs of the deflec
tions would occur. If convection by the vapour had occurred,
a greater deflection would have appeared with a liquid rapidly
evaporating than when cool. But in two cases the contrary
takes place. When one considers that the rising vapour had
condensed in large drops upon C, and that between C and the
closely adjacent liquid a strong electrical attraction must have
existed, the slight difference between the deflections for hot
and cold sea-water loses all value as evidence of a convection
of electricity by means of vapour.
   The particles of dust which lie upon the surface of the
liquid, or float in the surrounding air, are doubtless the bearers
 of the electricity upon C; for when the surface of the liquid
 was intentionally strewn with dust-particles, the charge upon
 the electrometer-needle was increased, while it was diminished
 when the surface was carefully cleaned. In another place the
 influence of dust^particles will be more clearly seen.
    In regard to the experiments of Buff, already mentioned, I
 quote the following passage*:—"A glass flask, which con-
                  * Liebig's Annalen, lxxxix. p. 203, 1864.

       Vapour from electrified Still Surfaces of Liquids.     221
tained the liquid to be evaporated, rested upon wire netting
over the flame of a spirit-lamp. A platinum wire, connected
with one pole of a galvanic battery, terminated in the liquid of
the flask. The other battery-pole was connected with the
earth. Close over the mouth of the flask was a strip of
platinum, so placed as to be directly exposed to the action of
the rising vapour. This strip could be connected either with
the upper condenser-plate or with the earth, according to the
arrangement of the experiment. The lower condenser-plate
was fastened upon a very sensitive pile-electroscope. As soon
as the water began to boil, or even approached boiling, and the
under condenser-plate was connected with the earth, then the
upper plate collected electricity of the same kind as that of
the pole which stood in connexion with the water. A single
pair of Bunsens was sufficient to noticeably separate the
gold leaves of the Bennett electrometer. The charge increased
proportionately with the number of pairs employed. The con
denser remained closed one minute each time. If the liquid
was in rapid ebullition, this length of time was not necessary
for the charge to reach its maximum."
   Against this method of arrangement of the experiment,
which coincides in many of its principal points with the above
described, arises the objection that convection of the electricity
occurred, not by means of the vapour, but by the drops of water
thrown up against the platinum strip during the ebullition.
   Further, I have found during the experiment, that when
ever a flame touched the porcelain dish (as it was allowed to do
in Buff's experiments) a largo deflection of the electrometer-
needle occurred. This is to be explained only through a
convection of electricity by means of the hot gases arising from
the flame, because the deflections began immediately when the
increase of temperature of the liquid was so slight that there
was no practical increase of evaporation.
   (d) By means of a modification of the apparatus described
upon pages 217 & 218, proof of the accuracy of the results so far
obtained by me was established by the most incontrovertible
 method of experiment possible to be devised. In place of the
condensing-disk C, a brass ball of 20 millim. diameter was
substituted. The arrangement of the experiment was not
otherwise changed. This ball was placed over the still surface
of the electrified liquid, as closely as possible without the
passage of a spark between them ; consequently the distance
between the ball and the surface of the liquid barely exceeded
 the striking-distance. The liquid was then electrified by
means of a Topler electrical machine, driven with great regu
larity by a small water-motor, so that thus the potential of the

222         Dr. L. J. Blake on the electrical Neutrality of
surface remained very constant. The striking-distance varied
in different experiments from 3 to 8 millim. The ball and con
denser-plate B in metallic connexion with it were insulated
just previous to the electrification of the liquid ; and the
presence of any electricity conveyed to the ball was deter
mined by the method described on page 218. It was necessary
that the ball be highly polished and the liquid carefully cleaned
in order to avoid dust-particles. Their influence is shown by
the deflections in scale-divisions given in the following tables
of experiments with sea-water.

     It was found by direct experiments that the loss of elec
 tricity upon B, and consequently upon the ball, during three
 minutes amounted to 39-44 scale-divisions. Between the
action of cold and copiously evaporating sea-water was a dif
ference of only 4 to 13 scale-divisions (0"088 to 0*288 Daniell)
in those experiments made with precaution against dust-
particles. The kind of electricity upon the ball was the oppo
 site to that upon the sea-water. Had convection occurred, the
 reverse must have evidently taken place; and from the high
potential of the sea-water, a strong convection of electricity
 was to be expected.
     (e) To experiment with evaporating mercury, the following

       Vapour from electrified Still Surfaces of Liquids.  223
changes were made in the arrangement of the apparatus. In
place of the condensing-disk C there was used a platinum disk
of 12 centim. diameter, which could be connected at will by
means of platinum wires, either directly with the needle of the
electrometer or with the condenser-plate B. The porcelain
dish in the sand-bath was replaced by an iron dish containing
the mercury to be evaporated. Platinum or iron was neces
sary, because all metals which amalgamate with mercury
show peculiar electric action, the causes of which I have not
yet succeeded in detecting. At 200° C. the mercury vapour
was visibly condensed upon the platinum disk C, and very
copiously from 200° to 360° C. It is necessary in the expe
riments that the surface of the mercury be kept perfectly f ree
from oxide.
   First, the experiments were conducted according to the
method on page 220 ; i. e. the platinum disk C was in direct
connexion with the electrometer-needle, and after the mercury
was swung under C was insulated with the needle. During
the two minutes while the mercury was under C, and elec
trified by 480 zinc-water-copper elements, the electrometer-
needle showed the following deflections:—
                  70 scale-divisions = 1 Daniell.

   Secondly, the mercury was charged by a Topler electrical
 machine to a high potential, and observations were made
according to the method described on page 218; i. e. the disk C
 was connected with the condenser-plate B of the Kohlrausch
 condenser, and with this was insulated before the mercury was
 swung under C. The plate A was \ millim. distant from B,
 and during the two minutes of the experiment was connected
 with the earth. After the mercury was swung away from 0,
 A was first insulated and then separated from B. By this

one atom of" mercury, the result of this experiment is the most
conclusive of the proofs against the hypothesis investigated by
these experiments, and which has been universally held to the
present time. This result with mercury, agreeing as it does
with the results obtained with the other liquids used, is totally
opposed to the hypothesis hitherto entertained, and justifies
the assertion that the vapour arising from electrified still sur
faces of liquids is electrically neutral.

XXXII. An Investigation into the Relations between Radiation,
   Energy, and \ Temperature. By Captain Abney, R.E.,
   F.R.S., and Lieut.-Col. Festing, R.E.*
IN the course of researches on the subject of atmospheric
      absorption of solar radiation, on which we have for some
time past been engaged, it incidentally became desirable to
ascertain the relation between the radiation from a black body
and its temperature—a subject which, though well worn, is by
no means exhausted. Sir William Siemens has made the most
recent contribution to this subject in a paper lately communi
cated to the Royal Society, in which he describes his endea
vour to solve the question by noting the increase of electrical
resistance of platinum wire with increased temperature and
by taking the relationship of energy to resistance—a method
of much promise, but which appears to us to be defective for
the following reasons. Platinum wire is not black at ordinary
temperatures, and it is at least doubtful whether it is such a
good radiator as carbon ; and, secondly, much of the energy
must have been dissipated by convection-currents.
   It has, however, struck us that a continuation of the experi-
                      * Communicated by the Authors."

        between Radiation, Energy, and Temperature.         225
merits which we had some time ago initiated on the radiation
from incandescence lamps might lead to results less liable to
vitiation from external causes than those obtained from plati
num wire.
   Having in our possession incandescence lamps of many
different patterns, we made careful simultaneous measurements
of the radiation and of the energy in each when currents of
varying strength were passed through the filaments.
   A Grove's battery was employed in preference to a dynamo,
because of the greater steadiness of the current obtained. The
current was measured in some cases by a tangent galvanome
ter, and in others by one of Sir W. Thomson's current-meters,
or by both in circuit, the difference of potential between the
terminals of the lamp being measured by a Thomson's potential
galvanometer, and the radiation from the lamp by a thermo
pile the receiving surface of which was coated with lampblack,
and which was connected with a Thomson's reflecting galva
nometer of "5-ohm resistance. The readings were taken of
the first deflection caused by the thermoelectric current and
checked by the total deflection. The former is the more rapid
mode of proceeding, and, we believe, the more accurate of the
two, as there is no change of zero-point during the time of
observation. A pair of cardboard screens with narrow slits in
them were placed between the lamp and the thermopile in
such a way as to cut off as much as possible of tho radiation
from the glass of the lamp, and yet to allow to pass the radia
tion from a certain length of the filament. Another cardboard
screen was interposed in front of the lamp after each observa
tion to cut off all radiation.
   The lamps were also heated in an oven to different tempe
ratures up to 350° C, and the change of resistance of the
carbon filament measured directly by means of resistance-
coils. We hope to be able in a subsequent paper to refer to
the measurements of higher temperatures, our investigations
in this respect being not quite complete.
    The results so far obtained may be summed up as follows:—
The current can be expressed as a function of the potential ;
the radiation, after a certain temperature of the filament has
been reached, bears a simple proportion to the energy expended
in the lamp ; the resistance can be formulated as a function
of the energy and therefore of the radiation ; and the tempe
rature appears to be nearly a simple function of the resistance.
    The curves described by using as ordinates and abscissae the
amounts of current and potential in the different experiments
have the same general form, which appears from inspection
to be that represented by the equation c=ap + bp* ; where c is

the current and p the potential. The first term of the right-
hand member seems to represent the amount of current which
would pass if the filament could be kept at some particular
temperature (probably the absolute zero), and the second the
additional current due to increased conductivity caused by in
crease of temperature.
   We append in a tabular form the results of typical experi
ments with four different patterns of lamps in which the dimen
sions of the carbon filaments differ considerably. These tables
give the observed potentials and currents, together with the
resistance and energy deduced from them, as well as the results
obtained by the application of the above equation to the ob
served potentials ; and it will be seen that these results cor
respond very closely with those deduced from the observed
currents when the resistances have any considerable range. It
should be remembered that for small currents, the deflections
of the measuring instruments being very small, the percentage
error of observation is liable to be large ; these observations
are therefore not so trustworthy as those of larger currents.
It is probable that for these lower temperatures another term
should be introduced into the equation, which may be disre
garded at temperatures above, say, 400°.
   From the above-stated equation another may be deduced for
the value of the energy in watts: this would be io=p2 (a + bp*);
and the resistance in ohms would be            j. The form of
                                        a + bp*
equation between energy and resistance would be rather more
complicated, w= ^ ^ J x -.
   If the curve of current in relation to potential be plotted, it
will be found to be fairly smooth. It is, however, evident
that a result obtained by the combination of two observations
each of which is liable to a small error will probably be further
from the truth than that obtained by a direct observation.
 On this account, in the curve of potential and resistance, the
points indicating resistance are more unevenly distributed than
those indicating current in the former curve. Similar irre
gularity will be found in a curve of potential and energy, and
still greater in the case of a curve of energy and resistance
(see diagram, curves C and D). An inspection of curves
A and B in the diagram will show that, as stated above, the
radiation is directly proportional to the energy when the latter
is above 30 watts ; the deviation from the straight line below
this point is doubtless due to the temperature of the sur
roundings being commensurate with that of the filament.

     * Continued from Phil. Mag. for April, p. 257, where the Table extends
   from 1 to 600 inclusive, and in which the following misprints occur :—
        In the column of ^n', opposite 33, for 333-01 read 331 01
               „         „        „        303, for 28900-59 read 27900-69

     In the extended as well as in the original Table it will be seen that the
   gum-totient is always intermediate between 3/v3 . »' and 3/77*. (n+lf.
     The formula of verification applied at every tenth step to the T column
   precludes the possibility of the existence of other than typographical errors
   or errors of transcription. Accumulative errors are rendered impossible.

   In Memoriam Dominici Chelini. (Collectanea Mathematica, nunc
      primum edita cura et studio L. Cbemona et E. Beltrami.) Milan :
       Hoepli.
    /~\F late years it has become a fashion, as it is in many cases a
          " necessity," to print in a collected form the scattered papers
   of our more eminent mathematicians. This is a good service both
   to the dead and to the living, but it is not the service rendered in
    the "memorial" volume before us. Bather is this a memorial
   cairn, the constituent stones of which are the twenty-nine varied
   but all highly polished stones, t. e. memoirs, contributed by the
   friendly hands of the foremost living* mathematicians of Europe.
    Chelini's life, " semplice e modesta quanto operosa," seems to have
    well merited such loving distinction.
       Dominic Chelini was born, October 18, 1802, at Gragnano, and
   died November 16, 1878. He studied at the Collegio Nazareno
   from 1819 to 1826, and in 1827 was consecrated Priest. Subse
   quently, from 1831 to 1851, he filled the Mathematical chair at the
   above-named college. In 1843-4 he made the acquaintance of
   Jacobi, and subsequently of Lejeune-Dirichlet, Steiner, Schlaefii,
   and Borchardt, and always retained their regard and friendship.
   In 1851 he was nominated Professor of Mechanics and Hydraulics
   at the University of Bologna, a post he occupied until 1860. He
      * Before the volume was issued, one of the most illustrious of these,
   Herr Borchardt, had passed away ; and the further interest is attached to
   his paper of its being among the last he penned. More recently English
   mathematicians have mourned the loss of Prof. Henry Smith.

was allowed for a time to retain this post ; but by a decree of the
18th December, 1864, he was deprived of his chair, as he refused
to take the oath to the Government. Prof. Cremona writes ;—" II
Chelini amava sinceramente la patria italiana ed era assolutamente
alieno dalT associarsi a qualsiasi atto ostile al governo nazionale :
dei quali suoi sentimenti gli amici intimi possono fare ampia testi-
monianza. ...... H Chelini sopporto la sua disgrazia con amroi-
rabile serenita d' animo." After a brief sojourn at Lucca, Chelini
was called in 1867 to take charge of the chair of Eational Mechanics
in the University of Some. His occupancy of this post was short,
as four years later Home became the capital of Italy. In the spring
of 1878 a small yearly pension was voted to him ; but he did not
long enjoy this, as he died in the same year, in the Collegio Naza-
reno, where he had resided since his return to Eome in ] 865.
   His was an uneventful life in the eyes of politicians and men of
the world, but one spent in the production of several valuable ma
thematical memoirs and in the acquiring, to a remarkable degree,
the affection of mathematicians of many nationalities. Hirst,
amongst our own countrymen, was an especial friend, a friendship
commenced at Bologna in 1864 having been subsequently renewed
and increased at Eome.
   Chelini's works range over a space of 44 years, and are 53 in
number. His first paper was " Sulla teoria delle quantita propor
tional! " (read in July 1834) ; his last was a memoir " Sopra alcune
questioni dinamiche" (presented April 1877). Our own knowledge
of Chelini's works, prior to our study of the volume before us, was
confined to the two or three passages in which memoirs of his are
analyzed in Chasles's Rapport sur les progris de la G&ometrie. Ample
justice is done to Chelini's labours, we believe, in the exhaustive
Analytical Sketch prefixed to the Collectanea, which has been
drawn up by Signor Beltrami : to the biography in this sketch,
founded upon an address by Prof. Cremona, we are indebted for
the few details we have recorded.
   We now proceed to a brief examination of the memoirs in the
order in which they are presented to us ; and here we may state,
once for all, that some of the " stones " are of such a kind (t. e. so
mathematically technical) that we can only name them, and not
examine them in any detail. The " Sur les Fonctions O(x) et H(x)
de Jacobi," by M. Hermite, is of this character, though the process
of solution is a very direct one. " LTperboloide centrale nella
rotazione de' Corpi," F. Siacci. The property discovered may be thus
stated :—" When a body, not acted on by any external forces, turns
round a fixed point, a certain hyperboloid connected (legato) with
the body and such that its axes coincide with the principal axes of
inertia relatively to the fixed point, rolls without sliding on a right
circular cylinder whose axis passes through the fixed point and is
parallel to the axis of the impulsive couple (coppia cP impulso)."
" On a Differential Equation," by A. Cayley : this is an equation
considered by Kummer in his memoir on Hypergeometric Series.

several properties relating to a cubic and its Cayleyan, and gene
ralizes some theorems of Clebsch on polar conies and poloconics.
" On the Complexes generated by two Correlative Planes," T. A.
Hirst: this is connected with Dr. Hirst's paper " On the Correla
tion of two Planes" (Proc. Lond. Math. Soc. vol. v.). "Nota
sopra alcuni Iperboloidi annessi alia cubica gobba," E. D'Ovidio :
commences with a resume of results got in the author's " Studio
sulle cubiche gobbe," and then, amongst other matters, specially
treats of the properties of hyperboloids through three chords of a
cubic. " Constructions planes des Elements de Courbure de la sur
face de l'onde," A. Mannheim : starts from MacCullagh's generation
 of the wave-surface and construction for the normal at any point,
 and then determines the elements of curvature of the surface* (in
 this we find the author's definition of normalie, a term he employs
 elsewhere without defining it). "Sulla integrazione delle equazioni
 a derivate parziali del primo ordine," E. Padova : is an extension of
 a method of Ampere's to any number of Variables, and shows how
 it leads (avoiding a difficulty indicated by Bertrand) to the method
 given by Cauchy. " De fractionibus quibusdam continuis," H. J. S.
 Smith: discusses the equations P1PJ-2E3= ±1, P^-SK^+l
  (adopting a lemma due to Sylvester), and gives certain developments
 of square roots in the form of continued fractions. " Sopra i sistemi
 lineari triplamente infiniti di curve algebriche piane," E. Caporali :
 the object of this memoir is the solution of the principal problems
 of numerical (enumerativa) geometry which present themselves in
 the study of the triply infinite linear systems of plane curves. The
  investigation is founded on stereometric considerations ; and the
  properties obtained are got from the study of a surface represented
  point by point on the plane of the linear systems, so that the plane
  sections have for images the curves of the linear system. "Intorno
  ad una generalizzazione di alcuni teoremi di Meccanica," V. Cer-
  ruti ; " Sugli assi di Equilibrio," G. Bardelli ; " Sur l'cquation
  de Biccati," G. Darbouxt : want of space forbids our noticing
  these three papers as we could wish ; we must then pass on.
  " Sur deux Algorithmes analogues a celui de la moyenne Arith-
  metico-geometrique de deux Elements," C. W. Borchardt: this
  friendly letter, written on a sick-bed, applies an elegant analysis to
  what is sometimes called Schwab's series [discussed in Hansen's
  ' Theory of Perturbations,' by Glaisher (" Solutions of Cambridge
  Senate-House Problems, 1878"), M.J. Tannery, and others]. " Sopra
     • The author says his solutions " reposent sur la representation geom6-
  trique d'un element de surface reglee au moven d'une droite auxiliaire et
  sur la representation d'un pinceau de droites au moyen d'une circonffr-
  rence et d'un point."
     t The author applies a covariantive property to the solution of an
  equation studied by Prof. Cayley (' Messenger of Mathematics,' 1874,
  p. 69).

June 20, 1883.—J. W. Hulke, Esq., F.E.S., President, in the Chair.
T^HE following communications were read :—
       1. " On the Discovery of Ovibos moschatus in the Forest-bed,
and its Range in Space and Time." By Prof. W. Boyd Dawkins,
M.A., F.R.S., F.G.8.
   2. " On the Relative Age of some Valleys in Lincolnshire." By
A. J. Jukes-Browne, Esq., B.A., F.G.S.
   In a country which is traversed by a series of escarpments or
hill-ranges, the valleys by which its drainage is effected are usually
separable into two sets or systems—one parallel to the strike of the
ridges, and the other more or less at right angles to the same. The
origin of these longitudinal and transverse valleys has been ex
plained by Mr. Jukes, who has shown that the course of a stream
flowing in a transverse valley and crossing a longitudinal valley is
not likely to be diverted, unless something happens to cut a deeper
channel down the longitudinal valley to the sea. The possibility of
this will depend upon the strike of the rocks and the trend of the
sea-coast ; where a longitudinal valley or the interspace between two
escarpments abuts upon the coast, and is occupied by a stream
running into the sea, the process of erosion may carry the sources
of this stream back so far as to intercept the waters of a transverse
river crossing a higher part of the same general depression or inter
space. The author believes that this has happened in some in
stances, and notably in the case of two Lincolnshire valleys.
   1. Valleys of the Steeping and Calceby Becks.-—These two streams
have their sources near one another in the vicinity of Telford. The
Calceby beck occupies a transverse valley, and flows north-east to the
Saltfleet marshes ; the Steeping flows in a longitudinal valley south
east to the fens by Wainfleet.
   The disposition of the Boulder-clays (Hessle and Purple) along
the eastern border of the chalk wolds affords a criterion of the rela
tive age of the valleys which open eastward, some being older and
some newer than the formation of those clays. Glacial clays and
gravels are found continuously along the Calceby valley, and occur
also in the valleys of its tributaries ; the same deposits sweep round
the southern end of the Wold hills into the entrance of the Steeping
valley, but do not run into it ; hence it would appear that the
Steeping valley is of later date than the Calceby valley.
   Facts were given in support of the hypothesis that the Steeping
valley has been rapidly developed and enlarged by the combined
action of rain and springs, and that its backward extension has
caused the interception of certain streams that originally flowed into
the Calceby valley. As a matter of fact, the Steeping valley now
extends behind the abrupt termination of a broad transverse valley,

 238                      Geological Society:—
which is continuous with that of the Calceby beck, while the
 Telford beck, which appears to have originally been a tributary of
the Calceby stream, now runs into the Steeping ; and its peculiar
course illustrates the manner in which this and other streams have
been diverted from their original channels.
   2. Valleys of the Trent and Witham.—The Trent flows in a
transverse valley as far as Newark, and is then suddenly deflected
northward into a longitudinal valley. Proofs are given that its
ancient course was eastward, by Lincoln to the Fens ; and a remark
able series of old river-gravels are described, which mark out the
former courses of the rivers Trent, Witham, and Devon.
   The longitudinal valley along which the Trent now flows, from
Newark to Gainsborough, may have been excavated in the first
instance by a tributary of the Idle ; the recession of this valley
towards that of the Trent (assisted by other causes) probably led to
the diversion of the latter river from its original transverse valley
into that of the Humber.
   The study of these changes in the river-courses of Lincolnshire
leads to the conclusion that whenever a succession of ridges and
depressions has been developed out of the surface of a country, a
river crossing any one of the longitudinal valleys which happens to
stretch to the sea-coast is liable to diversion by the backward exten
sion of a stream draining directly into the sea from the termination
of the longitudinal valley.
   3. " On the Seotion at Hordwell Cliffs, from the top of the Lower
Headon to the base of the Upper Bagshot Sands." By the late E.
B. Tawney, Esq., M.A., F.G.8., and H. Keeping, Esq., of the Wood-
wardian Museum. Communicated by the Rev. Osmond Fisher,
M.A., F.G.S.
   The authors, after a brief sketch of the literature of the subject
and of the method which they have adopted in measuring the beds
in the Hordwell section, passed on to describe these, viz. the- fresh
water Lower Headon series and the so-called Upper Bagshot Sands
of the Geological Survey. They make the whole thickness of the
former 83£ feet. The bed numbered 32 in their section they
identified with the Howledge Limestone on the other side of the
Solent. It is almost the highest seen in the section, and underlies
the true Middle Headon, which is now no longer exposed. The
authors pointed out that in their opinion the late Marchioness of
Hastings and Dr. Wright have somewhat misapprehended the posi
tion of these several beds. Details were then given of the remainder
of the section, and comparisons made with the details published by
former authors ; after which the authors described the underlying
estuarine series, or Upper Bagshot Sands, which has a thickness of
17i feet

    5. " The Geology of Monte Somma and Vesuvius, being a Study
 in Vulcanology." By H. J. Johnston-Lavis, E9q., E.G.S.
    The author, after referring to the vast amount of literature which
 has appeared dealing with the same subject, stated that his object
 was to lay before the Society the results of his personal observations.
    The external form and general features of Monte Somma having
 been described, the origin of the present condition of the volcano was
 discussed in some detail, and the geological structure of the moun
 tain and of the surrounding plain, as revealed by well-sections, was
 carefully considered.
    As the result of his observations, the author believes that he is
 able to define eight successive phases in the history of the volcano ;
 and the events which took place during these several periods, with
the products of the eruption during each, were discussed in detail.
    The earliest certainly recognized phase in the history of the
mountain was distinguished by chronic activity, exhibited in out
flows of lava and the ejection of scoria and ash. Possibly, however,
a still earlier and paroxysmal stage is indicated by some of the phe
nomena described.
    Phase II. was a period of inactivity and denudation, which was
brought to a close by the violent parox3'sms of Phase III., followed
by the chronic activity of Phase IV. Phase V. marks the return of
 a period of inactivity and denudation, which was again followed by
 the paroxysms of Phase VI. and the less violent outbursts of
 Phase VII., the last subsiding into the chronic activity which is
the characteristic of Phase VIII., the modern period of the history
 of the volcano.
   The products of each of these periods of eruption were described
in great detail.
   The eruptive phenomena which are illustrated by these studies
of Somma and Vesuvius were then considered, together with the
nature and result of the denudation which alternated with eruptive
action in originating the present form of the mountain.
   The paper concluded with a statement of fifty propositions on the
subject of vulcanology which appear to the author to be established
by the studies detailed in the paper.
   6. " Note on ' Cone-in-Cone ' Structure." By John Young, Esq.,
F.G.S.
   This note was written with the object of calling the attention of
the Geological Society to some very fine and remarkably interesting
examples of the " Cone-in-Cone " structure.
   The author, after referring to the views of previous authors on
the origin of this structure, proceeded to describe the interesting
examples of it which occur in the coalfields of Ayrshire and Ren
frewshire. He pointed out that the structure is generally exhibited
in bands overlying beds of fossils.
   7. " A Geological Sketch of Quidong, Manaro, Australia." By
Alfred Morris, Esq., C.E., F.G.S.
   This district is situated about 250 miles S.S.E. from Sydney. The

240            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
cliffs about the fiombala river, are about 100 to 120 feet high, and
formed of very dark limestone, crowded with fossils, chiefly Penta-
merus. In the author's opinion there has been great disturbance in
this region, resulting in a complete change in the course of the
river Bombala and a displacement of the shale. A mass of ferru
ginous sandstone has also been upheaved. This, as well as the
other rocks in the neighbourhood, contain Upper Silurian fossils.
It appears to have been altered by heat. Pockets of galena and
copper are occasionally found in the district, and there is a vein of
hsematite. Clay-slates occur as well as the above rocks, the cleavage
being generally vortical or nearly so.

      To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal .
       Gentlemen,
T HAVE learned in a roundabout way that Prof. Osborne Rey-
      nolds is annoyed with me because I have not carried out an
intention I expressed in a letter to him two years ago, which was,
as well as I can recollect, to publish something more on the subject
of Radiometers, and to state that I was on the whole satisfied
with his position.
   I did not do so because I got rambling on other matters, and
thought that by my silence I practically accepted his answers to
my questions as published in the Philosophical Magazine. And as
concerns some points I wrote to him about privately, and which
he very kindly answered at great length, I hardly thought them
worth publishing alone (though I asked leave to incorporate them
in what I then intended writing upon the subject, and was kindly
authorized to do so) ; for I felt sure that as it was my stupidity that
had mistaken his meaning, others were very unlikely to make such
mistakes and so would not take any interest in them.
   I regret taking up the pages of the Philosophical Magazine with
such a purely personal matter; but as I should be very sorry
indeed that any one, and least of all one who has treated me as
Prof. Reynolds has done, should suppose that I shirked expressing
myself as satisfied with answers to questions I raised, I hope you
will publish this letter; and I further hope that Prof. Reynolds
will forgive me for having forgotten my promise, which I would
certainly never have done if I had thought that he cared one bit
what I said of his work, which speaks for itself too well for any
mere opinion of one such as I am to benefit or injure.

       tology; a Reply to Professor Newcomb, Mr. Hill, and others.
       B/James Croll, LL.D., F.R.S.*
 • "VTINETEEN years ago the theory was advanced that the
       ^    Glacial Epoch was the result of a combination of phy
    sical agents brought into operation by an increase in the
    eccentricity of the earth's orbit. Few or no objections have
    been urged against what may be called the astronomical part
    of the theory; but the portions relating to these physical
   agencies, which are by far the most important part, have from
   time to time met with considerable opposition. Considering
   the newness of the subject, and the complex nature of many
   of these combinations of physical agencies, it would not be
   surprising if some of the original deductions in regard to
   them proved erroneous; but after long and careful reconsi
   deration of the whole matter, I have not found reason to
   abandon any of them or alter them to any material extent.
      The only class of objections urged against the theory which
  I have as yet considered at length are those relating to the
  cause of ocean-currents, and their influence on the distribu
  tion of heat over the globe ; and I think it will be admitted
  that the views which I have advocated on these points are
  now being pretty generally accepted.
     * From advance sheets of the 'American Journal of Science' for
 October 1883.
     Phil. Mag. S. 5. Vol. 16. No. 100. Oct. 1883.          T

 242         Dr. J. Croll on some Controverted Points
    But it is in reference to the influence of aqueous vapour,
 fogs, and clouds on the production and preservation of snow
 that the greatest diversity of opinion has prevailed. The
 object of the present article is to examine at some length the
 principal objections which have been advanced in regard to
 this part of the inquiry. I shall also take the present op
 portunity of discussing more fully some points on which I
 have been sometimes misunderstood, and which appear to
 have been treated rather too briefly on former occasions.
    In the 'American Journal of Science' for April 1876,
 Professor Newcomb has done me the honour to review at some
 length my work, 'Climate and Time;' and as his article is
 mainly devoted to a criticism of my reasoning in regard to
 those very points to which I refer, I shall begin with an
 examination of his objections. One reason for entering at
some length into an examination of Professor Newcomb's
 objections is the fact that they embrace to a large extent those
 which have been urged by reviewers in Great Britain. Some
of his objections, however, as will be seen, are based upon a
misapprehension of my reasoning.
    Temperature of Space.—One of the most important factors
in the theory of geological climate resulting from changes in
the eccentricity of the earth's orbit is obviously the tempe
rature of stellar space. Unless we have, at least, some rough
idea of the proportion which the heat derived from the stars *
bears to that derived from the sun, we cannot form any
estimate of how much the temperature of our earth would be
lowered or raised by a given decrease or increase of the sun's
distance.
   The question of the temperature of space has been investi
gated in different ways by Pouillet and Herschel ; and the
result arrived at was that space has a temperature of — 239°F.,
or an absolute temperature of 222°. The mean absolute tem
perature of our earth is about 521°. Consequently, according
to these results, the heat received from the stars is to that
received from the sun as 222 to 299. All my determinations
of the change of temperature due to changes in the sun's
distance were computed on these data, although I believe, for
reasons stated, that space must have a much lower tempera
ture. Recent observations of Professor Langley made during
the Mount-Whitney Expedition confirm the correctness of
my belief.
   Professor Newcomb, however, wholly ignores all that has
been done on that subject, for he commences his review by
the statement that "practically there is but one source from
which the surface of the earth receives heat—the sun, since

                   in Geological Climatology.                 243
 the quantity received from all other sources is quite insignifi
 cant in comparison."
    Surely Professor Newcomb must have forgotten all about
 the researches of Pouillet and Herschel into what has been
 termed the "Temperature of Space/' or he could not have
affirmed so positively that " practically there is but one source
from which the earth receives heat, and that all other sources
are quite insignificant" without, at least, giving some reason
for the assertion.
   I am pleased to find that he agrees, in the main, with what
has been advanced in ' Climate and Time' in reference to the
heating-power of ocean-currents, and also as to their existence
being due to the impulse of the winds. But he differs widely
from me in regard to the heat conveyed by aerial currents.
    On the Heat conveyed by Aerial Currents.—I stated that the
quantity of heat conveyed from equatorial to high temperate
and polar regions is trifling in comparison with that conveyed
by ocean-currents ; for the heated air rising off the hot
ground of the equator, after ascending a few miles becomes
exposed to the intense cold of the upper regions, and having
to travel polewards for thousands of miles in those regions, it
loses nearly all the heat which it brought from the equator
before it can possibly reach high latitudes. To this Professor
Newcomb objects as follows:—" He (Mr. Croll) speaks of the
hot air rising from the earth and becoming exposed to the
intense cold of the upper regions of the atmosphere. But
what can this cold be but the coldness of the very air itself
which has been rising up ? If the warm air rises up into the
cold air, and becomes cooled by contact with the latter, the
latter must become warm by the very heat which the former
loses ; and if there is a continuous rising current the whole
region must take the natural temperature of the rising air.
This temperature is, indeed, much below that which maintains
at the surface, for the simple reason that air becomes cold by
expansion according to a definite and well-known law. Hav
ing thus got his rising current constantly cooled off by contact
with the cold air of the upper regions, it has to pass on its
journey towards the poles," etc. (p. 267)*.
   Here the cooling of the ascending air is attributed to two
causes—(1) the heat lost by expansion as the air rises; (2) the
heat lost by contact with the colder air through which the
ascending air passes and with which it mixes in the upper
regions. But the two may be resolved into one, viz. the
heat lost by expansion ; for the cold air, to which the ascend
ing air communicates its heat by contact, is assumed to have
                       * The italics are mine.
                                   T2

244         Dr. J. Croll on some Controverted Points
originally derived its cold, in like manner, from expansion.
This is evident, for although he recognizes the effect of radia
tion into space, he assumes that this loss is compensated by
counter-radiation. The upper regions are, he says, exposed
to the radiation of the sun on the one side, and of the earth's
lower atmosphere on the other, and there is no proof that
these do not equal the surface-temperature. And again, when
the air descends in high latitudes to the earth's surface, an
amount of heat will be evolved by compression equal to that
which it lost when it rose from the equator.
   Professor Newcornb has misapprehended not only my
meaning, but also the chief reason why the air in the upper
region is so intensely cold. Any one who has read what I
have stated in pp. 35-40, ' Climate and Time,' regarding the
temperature of space will readily understand what I mean by
the temperature of the upper regions. By the temperature of
stellar space, it is not meant that space itself is a something
possessed of a given temperature, say — 239° F. It simply
means the temperature to which a body would fall were it
exposed to no other source of heat than that of radiation from
the stars. By the temperature of the upper regions I mean
the temperature to which air in those regions sinks in con
sequence of loss from radiation into space. It is mainly to
this cause, and not to the loss from expansion, as Professor
Newcornb assumes, that the intense cold of the upper air is
due. The air in that region has got beyond the screen which
protected it when at the earth's surface, and it then throws off
its heat into space during twelve hours of night, getting no
return from without except from the radiation of the stars.
And even at noonday, as I have endeavoured to show in
Appendix, p. 551, the rays of a burning sun overhead would
not be sufficient to raise the temperature of the air up to the
freezing-point. But the recent observations of Professor
Langley prove that the loss of heat from radiation is in reality
far greater than I had anticipated. He says :—" The original
observations, which will be given at length, lead to the con
clusion that in the absence of an atmosphere the earth's tem
perature of insolation would at any rate fall below — 50° F.;
by which it is meant that, for instance, mercury would remain
a solid under the vertical rays of a tropical sun were radiation
into space wholly unchecked, or even if, the atmosphere exist
ing, it let radiations of all wave-lengths pass out as easily as
they come in " (' Nature,' August 3rd, 1882).
   The temperature of the upper atmosphere, eveu after making
allowance for heat received from below, must in this case
be at least nearly 80 degrees below the freezing-point. The

                     in Geological CUmatology.                245
 quantity of heat lost by expansion must therefore be trifling
 compared with that lost by radiation ; and although the heat
 lost by expansion is fully restored by compression, yet the air
 would reach the earth deprived almost entirely of the heat
 with which it left the equator. All that it could possibly
 give back would simply be the heat of compression ; and this
 would hardly be sufficient to raise air at —50° F. to the freez
 ing-point. How then can the polar regions be greatly the
 better of air from the equatorial regions ? Professor New-
 comb says:—"If the upper current be as great as is commonly
 supposed, it must be as powerful as ocean-currents in tending
 to equalize the temperature of the globe." How can this be?
    Why the Mean Temperature of the Ocean should be greater
than that of the Land.—"Another proposition," he says,
" which the author attempts to prove, reasoning which seems
equally inconclusive, is that the mean temperature of the
ocean is greater than that of the land over the entire globe."
 I certainly never attempted to prove that the mean tempe
 rature of the ocean is greater than that of the land over the
entire globe. The very chapter to which he here refers, and
 which he is about to criticise, was written to explain why the
mean temperature of the southern or water hemisphere is less
than that of the northern or land hemisphere. What I at
tempted to prove was, not that the mean temperature of the
ocean is greater than that of the land, but that, were it not for
certain causes, the mean temperature of the ocean ought to be
greater than that of the land in equatorial regions as well as
in temperate and arctic regions. In other words, the object
of the chapter is to prove that the mean temperature of the
southern or water hemisphere is less than that of the northern
or land hemisphere, not, as is generally supposed, because the
former is mainly water and the latter land, but because of the
enormous amount of heat transferred from the former to the
latter hemisphere by means of ocean-currents ; and that were
it not for this transference the temperature of the water would
exceed that of the land hemisphere. And it is in order to
prove this that the "four a priori reasons" which Professor
Kewcomb criticises were adduced. The first of these is as
follows :—
   First.—' The ground stores up heat only by the slow process
of conduction, whereas water, by the mobility of its particles
and its transparency for heat-rays, especially those from the
sun, becomes heated to a considerable depth rapidly. The
quantity of heat stored up in the ground is thus comparatively
small, while the quantity stored up in the ocean is great.'*
                      » ' Climate and Time,' p. 90.

246         Dr. J. Croll on some Controverted Points
   These sentences are considered unworthy of criticism. Are
they really so unworthy ? Let us examine them a little more
closely. It is in consequence of the sun's rays being able to
penet rate to a great depth that the amount of boat stored up
by the ocean is so great ; and it is to this store that its
warmth during winter is mainly due. The water is diather-
manous for the rays of the sun, but it is not so, for reasons
well known, for the rays of water itself. The upper layers of
the ocean will allow a larger portion of the radiation from the
sun to pass freely downward, but they will not allow radiation
from the layers underneath to pass freely upwards. These
upper layers, like the glass of a greenhouse, act as a trap to
the sun's rays, and thus allow the water of the ocean to stand
at a higher temperature than it would otherwise do. Again,
the slowness with which the ocean thus parts with its heat
enables it to maintain that comparatively high temperature
during the long winter months. And again, it is to the mobility
of the particles of water, the depth to which the heat pene
trates, and the rapidity with which it is absorbed, that those
great currents of warm water become possible. Were the
waters of the ocean, like the land, not mobile, and were only a
few inches at the surface reached by heat from the sun, there
 could be no Gulf-stream, or any great transference of heat from
 the Southern to the Northern hemisphere, or from equatorial
 to temperate and polar regions, by means of oceanic circulation.
    Second.—' The air is probably heated more rapidly by con
 tact with the ground than with the ocean ; but, on the other
 hand, it is heated far more rapidly by radiation from the ocean
 than from the land. The aqueous vapour of the air is to a
 great extent diathermanous to radiation from the ground,
 while it absorbs the rays from water and thus becomes heated.'
    To this Professor Newcomb objects as follows :—" If, then,
 the air is really heated by contact with the ground more
rapidly than by contact with the ocean, it can only be because
the ground is hotter than the ocean, which is directly contrary
to the theory Mr. Croll is maintaining." AVhat I maintained
was that, were it not for certain causes, the mean animal tem
perature of the ocean would be higher than that of the land.
During the day and also during the summer the surface of
the ground is hotter than that of the ocean ; and the air, of
course, will be heated more rapidly by contact with the former
than with the latter. But this does not prove that the air is
not more rapidly heated by radiation from the ocean than
from the land. Professor Newcomb says :—" The statement
that the aqueous vapour of the air is diathermanous to radia

                    in Geological Climatology.                247
tion from land, but not to that from water, is quite new to us,
and very surprising." I am surprised that he is not acquain
ted with the fact, and also with its physical explanation. This
will help to account for his inability to perceive how radiation
from the ocean may heat the air more rapidly than radiation
from the land, even though the surface of the latter may be at
a higher temperature than that of the former.
   He says :—" The rapidity with which the heating process
goes on depends on the difference of temperature, no matter
whether the heat passes by conduction or by radiation." This
statement will hardly harmonize with recent researches into
radiant heat. It is found that the rapidity with which a body
is heated by radiation depends upon the absorbing power of
the body ; and the absorbing power again depends upon the
quality of the heat-rays. Professor Tyndall, for example,
found that in the case of vapours, as a rule, absorption dimi
nishes as the temperature rises. With a platinum spiral
heated till it was barely visible, the absorption of the vapour
of bisulphide of carbon was 6-5, but when the spiral was raised
to a white heat the absorption was reduced to 2*9. A similar
result took place in the case of chloroform, formic ether,
acetic ether, and other vapours. The physical cause of this is
well known.
   If the aqueous vapour of the air, he says, be more diather-
manous to radiation from land than from water, as I have
stated, then I assigned directly contrary effects to the same
cause. For, " reasoning as in (1), he, Mr. Croll, would have
said that the air over the land, owing to its transparency for
the heat-rays from the land, becomes heated to a greater
height rapidly, while the air over the ocean, not being trans
parent, can acquire heat from the ocean only by the slow
process of convection." I would have said no such thing.
Eadiation from the surface of the land will, no doubt, pene
trate more freely through the aqueous vapour than radiation
from the ocean ; but the aqueous vapour will not absorb the
radiation of the land so rapidly as that of the ocean, for the
ocean gives off that quality of rays which aqueous vapour
absorbs most rapidly.
   This is not in opposition to what I have stated in reason (1);
for if the ground were transparent to the sun's rays like water,
evidently the total quantity of heat absorbed by it would be
greater than that by the ocean. But radiation from the sun
heats only the surface of the ground, all below the surface
depends for its supply on the slow process of conduction,
whereas the ocean is heated by direct radiation to great
depths. Consequently the total quantity of heat absorbed by

248          Dr. J. Croll on some Controverted Points
the ocean, say per square mile, in a given time, is greater than
that absorbed by the land.
    Third.—' The air radiates back a considerable portion of its
heat, and the ocean absorbs this radiation from the air more
readily than the ground does. The ocean will not reflect the
heat from tbe aqueous vapour of the air, but absorbs it, while
the ground does the opposite. Radiation from the air, there
fore, tends more readily to heat tbe ocean than it does the
land/
    " Here we have," he says, " the air giving back to the
ocean the same heat which it absorbs from it, and thus heating
it." If Professor Newcomb means by this same heat the
same amount of heat, then 1 believe in no such thing. But
if his meaning be that here we have the air giving back to the
 ocean a quantity of the heat which it absorbed from it, then
 he is certainly correct in supposing that this is affirmed by
 me. But this is a conclusion which no physicist could for a
 moment doubt. To deny this would be to contradict Prevost's
 well-known theory of exchanges. Did the air throw back to
 the ocean none of the heat which it derives from it, the entire
 waters of the ocean would soon become solid ice. In fact, as
 we have seen, mercury would not remain fluid and every living
 thing on the face of the globe would perish.
     He states that reason fourth seems to be little more than a
 repetition of reason second in a different form. It is, how
 ever, much more than that. It is a demonstration that were
 it not for the causes to which I have alluded, the mean
 temperature of the water hemisphere ought to be higher than
 that of" the land hemisphere ; and for this reason I shall here
 give the section in full.
     Fourth.—' The aqueous vapour of the air acts as a screen to
 prevent the loss by radiation from water, while it allows
 radiation from the ground to pass more freely into space ;
  the atmosphere over the ocean consequently throws back a
  greater amount of heat than is thrown back by the atmosphere
  over the land. The sea in this case has a much greater
  difficulty than the land has in getting quit of the heat received
  from the sun ; in other words, the land tends to lose its heat
  more rapidly than the sea. The consequence of all these cir
  cumstances is that the ocean must stand at a higher mean
  temperature than the land. A state of equilibrium is never
  gained until the rate at which a body is receiving heat is
  equal to the rate at which it is losing it ; but as equal surfaces
  of sea and land receive from the sun the same amount of heat,
  it therefore follows that in order that the sea may get quit of

                     in Geological Climatology.               249
its heat as rapidly as the land, it must stand at a higher tempe
rature than the land. The temperature of the sea must continue
to rise till the amount of heat thrown off into space equals that
received from the sun ; when this point is reached, equilibrium
is established and the temperature remains stationary. But,
owing to the greater difficulty that the sea has in getting rid
of its heat, the mean temperature of equilibrium of the ocean
must be higher than that of the land ; consequently the mean
temperature of the ocean, and also of the air immediately over
 it, in tropical regions should be higher than the mean tempe
rature of the land and the air over it.'
     Since the publication of ' Climate and Time ' the accuracy
 of this conclusion has been confirmed in a remarkable manner
from more recent researches on the actual mean temperature
 of the two hemispheres, the details of which have been given
 by Mr. Ferrell in his ' Meteorological Researches' (Washington,
 1877). It is found that them ean temperature of the northern
 or land hemisphere is higher than that of the southern or
 water hemisphere up only to about latitude 35°, and that
 beyond this latitude the mean temperature of the water
 hemisphere is the greater of the two. At latitude 40° the
 mean temperature of the southern hemisphere is 1°"4 higher
 than that of the same parallel on the northern hemisphere.
 At latitude 50° the difference amounts to 4°"4; while at latitude
  60° the mean temperature of the southern hemisphere is
 actually 6° higher than that of the northern on the same
 parallel. The mean temperatures of the two hemispheres are
 as follows :—
      Lat....  0°   10°   20°   30°   40°   50°  60°   70°   80°
                     o     o           o     O    0      O     o
  Northern- 801     810   77-6  676   565   434  293    14-4  45
  Southern... 801   78-7  747   667   57-9 47-8  353
     From the above table we see that it is only in that area
 lying between the equator and latitude 35° that the southern
 hemisphere has a lower mean temperature than the northern.
 But it is from this area that the enormous amount of heat
 transferred to the northern hemisphere is mainly derived.
 Were the transference of heat to cease, the temperature of this
 area would be very considerably raised, and that of the corre
 sponding area on the northern hemisphere lowered. The
 result would doubtless be that the southern hemisphere down
 to the equator would then be warmer than the northern. But,

250          Dr. J. Croll on some Controverted Points
even as things are, as Mr. Ferrel remarks, " the mean tempe
rature of the southern hemisphere is the greater of the two,"
the mean temperature of the southern being 60o-89 F. and
that of the northern 59a54 F.
   Heat cut off by the Atmosphere.—Professor Newcomb says
further, " Another idea of the author which calls for ex
planation is that solar heat absorbed by the atmosphere is
entirely lost, so far as warming any region of the globe is
concerned." This is no idea of mine. My idea is not that
the heat cut off is entirely lost, but merely that the greater
part is lost. A large portion of the heat is reflected, and of
that absorbed one half, perhaps, is radiated back into space
and lost, in so far as the earth is concerned.
   Tables of Eccentricity.—Referring to my tables of eccen
tricity of the earth's orbit, he says :—" That there are from
time to time such periods of great eccentricity is a well-
established result of the mutual gravitation of the planets;
but whether the particular epochs of great and small eccen
tricity computed by Mr. Croll are reliable is a different
question." I may here mention that Professor McFarland,
of the Ohio State University, Columbus, a few years ago,
undertook the task of re-computing every one of the 150
periods given in my tables, and he states that, except in one
instance, he did not find an error to the amount of '001*.
   "The data for this computation," continues Professor New-
comb, " are the formula? of Le Verrier, worked out about
1845f, without any correction either for the later corrections
to the masses of the planets or for the terms of the third
order, subsequently discussed by Le Verrier himself. The
probable magnitude of these corrections is such that reliance
cannot be placed upon the values of eccentricity computed
without reference to them for epochs distant by merely a
million of years."
   In regard to this objection I may mention that the whole
subject of the secular variations of the elements of the pla
netary orbits has been re-investigated by Mr. Stockwell, taking
into account the disturbing influence of the planet Neptune,
the existence of which was not known at the time Le Verrier's
investigations were made. Professor McFarland, with the aid
of Mr. Stockwell's formula;, has computed all the periods in
the tables referred to above ; and on comparing the results
found by both formula;, he states that " the two curves exhibit
a general conformity throughout their whole extent." And
his computations, I may state, extend from 3,260,000 years
  * American Journal of Science, vol. xi. p. 456 (1876).

before 1850. and to 1,260,000 years after tbat date ; or, in
other words, over a period of no fewer than 4,520,000 years*,
thus showing that Professor Newcomb's objection falls to the
ground.
   Influence of Winter in Aphelion.—I have maintained that
at a time when the eccentricity is high and the winter occurs
in aphelion, the great increase in the sun's distance and in the
length of the winter would have the effect of causing a large
increase in the quantity of snow falling during that season.
This very obvious result follows as a necessary consequence
from the fact that the moisture which now falls in the form
of rain would then fall as snow. But Professor Newcomb
actually states that he cannot accept the conclusion that this
would lead to more snow.
   Influence of a Snow-covered Surface.—I have argued that
this accumulation of snow would lower the summer tempera
ture, and tend to prevent the disappearance of the snow, and
have assigned three reasons for this conclusion :—
   First.—Direct radiation. The snow, for physical reasons
well known, will cool the air more rapidly than the sun's
rays will heat it. This is shown from the fact that in Green
land, a snow- and ice-covered country, a thermometer exposed
to the direct radiation of the sun has been observed to stand
above 100°, while the air surrounding the instrument was
actually 12° below the freezing-point. Professor Newcomb
and also Mr. Hill f regard the idea that this could in any way
 favour the accumulation of snow as absurd. They think that
in fact it would have directly the opposite effect. They have
perceived only one half of the result. It is quite true, as they
affirm, that the cooling of the air by the snow will not prevent
the melting of the snow, but the reverse. There is, however,
another and far more important result overlooked in their
objection. If the snow- and ice-covered surface keeps the
temperature of the air, in summer, below the freezing-point,
which it evidently does in Greenland and in the Antarctic
continent, the moisture of the air will fall as snow and not as
rain. No doubt this is the chief reason why in those regions,
even in the middle of summer, rain seldom falls, the precipita
tion being almost always in the form of snow, although at that
very season the direct heat of the sun is often as great as in
 India. Were the snow and icy mantle removed a snow-shower
   * In this laborious undertaking Professor McFarland computed, by
 means of both formulas, the eccentricity of the earth's orbit and the
 longitude of the perihelion for no fewer than 485 separate epochs. See
 American Journal of Science, vol. xx. p. 105 (1880).
   t 'Geological Magazine' for January 1880, p. 12.

  252         Dr. J. Croll on some Controverted Points
  in summer would be as rare a phenomenon in those regions
  as it would be in the south of England.
     Second.—' The rays which fall on snow and ice are to a
  great extent reflected back into space. But those that are
  not reflected, but absorbed, do not raise the temperature, for
  they disappear in the mechanical work of melting the ice.'
     This reason is also regarded as absurd. The heat of the
  sun during the perihelion summer would, he says, suffice to
  melt the whole accumulation of winter snow in three or four
  days. " The reader," he continues, " can easily make a com
  putation of the incredible reflecting power of the snow and of
  the unexampled transparency of the air required to keep the
  snow unmelted for three or four months." Incredible as it
  may appear to Professor Newcomb, I shall shortly show that
  a less amount of snow than the equivalent of the two feet of
  ice which he assumes does actually, in some places, defy the
  melting-power of a tropical sun. But he misapprehends my
  reasoning here also, by overlooking the more important factor
 in the affair, namely, the keeping of the air in the summer
 below the freezing-point. The direct effect that this has in
 preventing the sun from melting the snow and ice will be
 discussed shortly ; but the point to which I wish at present to
 direct special attention is the fact that if the air is kept below,
 or even at the freezing-point, snow will fall ana not rain.
 Snow is a good reflector of heat ; consequently a large portion
 of the sun's rays falling on the snow and icy surface is reflected
 back into space. The aqueous vapour of the air, on the other
 hand, as the vibrations of its molecules agree in period with
 those of the snow and ice, cuts off a large portion of the heat
 radiated by the snow surface ; but here in the ease of reflection
 under consideration the rays are not cut off ; for the reflected
 rays are of the same character as the incident rays which pass
so freely through the aqueous vapour. And in respect to the
remaining rays which are not reflected, but absorbed by the
snow, they do not manage to raise the temperature of the
snow above the freezing-point. Consequently the air is kept
in the condition most favourable lor the production of snow.
    Third.—' Snow and ice lower the temperature by chilling
the air and condensing the vapour into thick fogs. The great
strength of the sun's rays during summer, due to his nearness
at that season, would, in the first place, tend to produce an
increased amount of evaporation. But the presence of snow-
clad mountains and an icy sea would chill the atmosphere and
condense the vapour into thick fogs. The thick fogs and cloudy

                    in Geological Climatology.                 253
sky would effectually prevent the sun's rays from reaching the
earth, and the snow in consequence would remain unmelted
during the entire summer/
   On this Professor Newcomb's criticism is as follows :—
" Here he (Mr. Croll) says nothing about the latent heat set
free by the condensation, nor does he say where the heat
goes to which the air must lose in order to be chilled. The
task of arguing with a disputant who in one breath maintains
that the transparency of the air is such that the rays reflected
from the snow pass freely into space, and in the next breath
that thick fogs effectually prevent the rays ever reaching the
snow at all, is not free from embarrassment."
   If he really supposes my meaning to be that the air is so
transparent as to allow the incident and reflected rays of the
sun to pass freely without interruption, while at the same
time and in the same place the air is not transparent but filled
with dense fogs which effectually cut off the sun's rays and
prevent them from reaching the earth, then I do not wonder
that he should feel embarrassed in arguing with me. But if
he supposes my meaning to be, as it of course is, that those
two opposite conditions, existing at totally different times or
in totally different places at the same time, should lead to
similar results, namely the cooling of the air and consequent
conservation of snow, then there is no ground whatever for
any embarrassment about the matter.
   " We might therefore show," he states, " that if the snow,
air, fog, or whatever throws back the rays of the sun into
space is so excellent a reflector of heat, it is a correspondingly
poor radiator ; and the same fog which will not be dissipated
by the summer heat will not bo affected by the winter's cold,
and will therefore serve as a screen to prevent the radiation
of heat from the earth during the winter."
   There are few points in connection with terrestrial physics
which appear to be so much misunderstood as that of the
influence of fogs on climate. One chief cause of these mis
apprehensions is the somewhat complex nature of the subject
arising from the fact that aqueous vapour acts so very differ
ently under different conditions. When the vapour exists in
the air as an invisible gas, we have often an intensely clear and
transparent sky, allowing the sun's rays to pass to the ground
with little or no interruption ; and if the surface of the
ground be covered with snow, a large portion of the incident
rays are reflected back into space without heating either the
snow or the air. The general effect of this loss of heat is, of
course, to lower the general temperature. But when this
vapour condenses into thick fogs it acts in a totally different

254          Dr. J. Croll on some Controverted Points
manner. The transparency to a great extent disappears, and
the fog then cuts off the sun's rays and prevents them from
reaching the ground. This it does in two different ways.
1st. Its watery particles, like the crystals of the snow, are
good reflectors, and the upper surface of the mass of fog on
which the raj's fall acts as a reflector, throwing hack a large
portion of the rays into stellar space. The rest of the rays
which are not reflected enter the fog and the larger portion
of them are absorhed by it. But it will be observed that by
far the greater part of the absorption, if not nearly all of it,
will take place in the upper half of the mass. This is a
necessary result of a recognized principle in radiant heat
known as the " sifting " of the rays. The deeper the rays
penetrate into the fog, the less will be the amount of heat
absorbed. If the depth of the mass be great, absorption will
probably entirely disappear before the surface of the ground
is reached. The fog will begin, of course, to radiate off the
heat thus absorbed ; but as it is the upper half of the mass
which has received the principal part of the heat, the most of
this heat will be radiated upward into stellar space, and, like
the reflected heat, entirely lost in so far as heating the earth
is concerned. A portion will also be radiated downward,
some of which may reach the ground, but the greater portion
will be reabsorbed in its passage through the mass. We have
no means of estimating the amount of heat which would thus
be thrown off into space by reflection and radiation ; but it
is certainly great. I think we may safely conclude that in
places like South Georgia and Sandwich Land, where fogs
prevail to such an extent during summer, one half at least of
the heat from the sun never reaches the ground. A depriva
 tion of sun-heat of a much less extent than this would
 certainly lower the summer temperature of these places far
 below the freezing-point, were it not for a compensating cause
 to which I shall now refer, viz. the heat " trapped " by the
 fog. The fog, although it prevents a large portion of the
 sun's heat from ever reaching a place, at the same time
 prevents to a great extent that place from losing the little
 heat which it does receive. In other words, it acts as a
 screen preventing the loss of heat by radiation into space.
 But the heat thus " trapped " never fully compensates for
 that not received, and a lowering of temperature is always
 the result.
    Had all those considerations been taken into account by
 Professor Newcomb, Mr. Hill, Mr. Searles Wood, and others,
 they would have seen that I had by no means overestimated
 the powerful influence of fogs in lowering the summer
 temperature.

                   in Geological Climatology.                255
   The influence of fogs on the summer temperature is a fact
so well established by observation that it seems strange that
any one should be found arguing against it.
   Heat Evolved by Freezing.—There is one objection to which
I may here refer, and which has been urged by nearly all my
critics. It is said, correctly enough, that as water in freezing
evolves just as much heat as is required to melt it, there is on
the whole no actual loss of heat ; that whatever heat may be
absorbed in the mechanical work of melting the snow, just
as much was evolved in the formation of the snow. Conse
quently it is inferred, in so far as climate is concerned, the
one effect completely counterbalances the other. This infer
ence, sound as it may at first sight appear, has been so well
proved to be incorrect by Mr. Wallace that I cannot do
better than quote his words :—
   " In the act of freezing, no doubt water gives up some of
its heat to the surrounding air, but that air still remains below
the freezing-point or freezing would not take place. The heat
liberated by freezing is therefore what may be termed low-
grade heat-—heat incapable of melting snow or ice; while
the heat absorbed while ice or snow is melting is high-grade
heat, such as is capable of melting snow and supporting
vegetable growth. Moreover, the low-grade heat liberated
in the formation of snow is usually liberated high up in the
atmosphere, where it may be carried off by winds to more
southern latitudes ; while the heat absorbed in melting the
surface of snow and ice is absorbed close to the earth, and is
thus prevented from warming the lower atmosphere, which is
in contact with vegetation. The two phenomena therefore
by no means counterbalance or counteract each other, as it is
so constantly and superficially asserted that thev do " ('Island
 Life,' p. 140).
    The Fundamental Misconception.—I come now to a mis
apprehension which more than any other has tended to pre
vent a proper understanding of the causes which lead to
 the conservation by snow. Whatever the eccentricity of the
earth's orbit may be, the heat received from the sun during
summer is more than sufficient to melt the snow of winter.
 Consequently it is assumed no permanent accumulation of
 snow can take place. This objection, as expressed by Mr.
 Hill, is as follows :—" We have no reason to suppose that at
 present, in the northern hemisphere, more snow or ice is any
 where formed in winter than is melted in summer. With
 greater eccentricity less heat than now would be received in
 winter, but exactly as much more in summer. More snow
 would therefore be formed in the one half of the year, but

 256         Dr. J. Croll on some Controverted Points
 exactly as much more be melted in the other half. The colder
 winter and the wanner summer would exactly neutralize each
 other's effects, and on the average of years no accumulation
 could begin. Pritnd facie, therefore, high eccentricity will
 not account for glacial periods "* . In the language of Prof.
 Newcomb, it is as follows :—" During this perihelion summer
 the amount of heat received from the sun by every part of
 the northern hemisphere would suffice to melt from four to
 six inches of ice per day over its entire surface ; that is, it
 would suffice to melt the whole probable accumulation in
 three or four days. The reader can easily make a computa
 tion of the incredible reflecting power of the snow and of
 the nnexampled transparency of the air required to keep the
 snow unmelted for three or four months."
    It is assumed in this objection that because the heat received
 from the sun by an area is more than sufficient to melt all the
 snow that falls on it, no permanent accumulation of snow
and ice can take place. It is assumed that the quantity of
 snow and ice melted must be proportional to the heat received.
 Suppose that on a certain area a given amount of snow falls
annually. The amount of heat received from the sun per
 annum is computed ; and after the usual deduction for that
 cut off by the atmosphere has been made, if it be found that
the quantity remaining is far more than sufficient to melt the
 snow, it is then assumed that the snow must be melted, and
 that no accumulation of snow and ice year by year in this
area is possible. To one approaching this perplexing subject
 for the first time such an assumption looks very plausible ;
 but a little reflection will show that it is most superficial.
The assumption is at the very outset totally opposed to known
facts. Take the lofty peaks of the Himalayas and Andes as
an example. Few, I suppose, would admit that at these great
elevations as much as 50 per cent, of the sun's heat could be
cut off. But if 50 per cent, reaches the snow, this would be
sufficient to melt fifty feet of ice ; and this, no doubt, is more
than ten times the quantity which actually requires to be
melted. Notwithstanding all this the snow is never melted,
but remains permanent. Take, as another example, South
Georgia, in the latitude of England. Suppose we assume
that one half of the sun's heat is cut off by the clouds and
fogs which prevail to such an extent in that place, still the
remaining half would be sufficient to melt upwards of thirty
feet of ice, which is certainly more than the equivalent of all
the snow which falls; yet this island is covered with snow
and ice down almost to the seashore during the whole year.

Take still another example, that of Greenland. The quantity
of heat received between latitudes 60° and 80°, which is that
of Greenland, is, according to Meech, one half that received
at the equator; and were none cut off, it would be sufficient
to melt fifty feet of ice. The annual precipitation on Green
land in the form of snow and rain, according to Dr. Rink,
amounts to only twelve inches ; and two inches of this he con
siders is never melted, but is carried away in the form of ice
bergs. Mr. Hill maintains * that, owing to the great thick
ness of the air traversed by the sun's rays, and the loss re
sulting from the great obliquity of reflection, the amount of
heat reaching the ground would be insufficient to melt more
than sixteen feet of ice. Supposing we admit this estimate
to be correct, still this is nineteen times more than is actually
melted. The sun melts only ten inches, notwithstanding the
fact that it has the power to melt sixteen feet.
   In short, there is not a place on the face of the globe
where the amount of heat received from the sun is not far
more than sufficient to melt all the snow which falls upon it.
If it were true, as the objection assumes, that the amount of
snow melted is proportional to the amount of heat received
by the snow, then there could be no such thing as perpetual
snow.
   The reason why the amount of snow and ice melted is not
necessarily proportional to the amount of heat received is not
far to seek. Before snow or ice will melt, its temperature
must be raised to the melting-point. No amount of heat,
however great, will induce melting to begin unless the inten
sity of the heat be sufficient to raise the temperature to the
melting-point. Keep the temperature of the snow below
that point, and, though the sun may shine upon it for count
less ages, it will still remain unmelted. It is easy to under
stand how the snow on the lofty summits of the Himalayas
and the Ancles never melts. According to the observations
made at Mount Whitney, to which reference has already been
made, the heat of even a vertical sun would not be sufficient
at these altitudes to raise the temperature of the snow to near
the melting-point ; and thus melting, under these conditions,
is impossible. The snow will evaporate, but it cannot melt.
But, owing to the frozen condition of the snow, even evapo
ration will take place with ' extreme difficulty. If the sun
could manage to soften the snow-crystals and bring them
into a semifluid condition, evaporation would, no doubt, go
on rapidly ; but this the rays of the sun are unable to do ;

 258         Dr. J. Croll on some Controverted Points
 consequently, we have only the evaporation of a solid, which,
 of course, is necessarily small.
     It may here be observed that at low elevations, where the
 snowfall is probably greater, and the amount of heat received
 even less, than at the summits, the snow melts and disappears.
 Here, again, the influence of that potent agent, aqueous
 vapour, comes into play. At high elevations the air is dry,
 and allows the heat radiated from the snow to pass into space ;
 but at low elevations a very considerable amount of the heat
 radiated from the snow is absorbed by the aqueous vapour
 which it encounters in passing through the atmosphere. A
 considerable portion of the heat thus absorbed by the vapour
 is radiated back on the snow ; but the heat thus radiated being
 of the same quality as that which the snow itself radiates, is
 on this account absorbed by the snow. Little or none of it
 is reflected, like that received from the sun. The consequence
 is, that the heat thus absorbed accumulates in the snow till
 melting takes place. Were the amount of aqueous vapour
 possessed by the atmosphere sufficiently diminished, perpetual
 snow would cover our globe down to the sea-shore. It is
 true that the air is warmer at the lower than at the higher
 levels, and, by contact with the snow, must tend to melt it
 more at the former than at the latter position. But we must
 remember that the air is warmer mainly in consequence of
 the influence of aqueous vapour, and that, were the quantity
 of vapour reduced to the amount in question, the difference
 of temperature at the two positions would not be great.
    But it may be urged, as a further objection to the foregoing
conclusion, that, as a matter of fact, on great mountain-chains
the snow-line reaches to a lower level on the side where the
air is moist than on the opposite side where it is dry and
arid—as, for example, on the southern side of the Himalayas
and on the eastern side of the Andes, where the snow-line
descends 2000 or 3000 feet below that of the opposite or dry
side.
    But this is owing to the fact that it is on the moist side
that by far the greatest amount of snow is precipitated. The
moist winds of the south-west monsoon deposit their snow
almost wholly on the southern side of the Himalayas, and the
south-east trades on the east side of the Andes. Were the
conditions in every respect the same on both sides of these
mountain-ranges, with the exception only that the air on one
side was perfectly dry, allowing radiation from the snow to
pass without interruption into stellar space, while on the other
side the air was moist and full of aqueous vapour absorbing
the heat radiated from the snow, the snow-line would in this

                    in Geological Climatology.              259
case undoubtedly descend to a lower level on the dry than
on the moist side. Melting would certainly take place at a
greater elevation on the moist than on the dry side ; and this
is what would mainly determine the position of the snow-line.
   The annual precipitation on Greenland, as we have seen, is
very small, scarcely one half that of the driest parts of
Great Britain. This region is covered with snow and ice,
not because the quantity of snow falling on it is great, but
because the quantity melted is small ; and the reason why the
snow does not melt is not that the amount of heat received
during the year is unequal to the work of melting the ice,
but that, mainly through the dryness of the air, the snow is
prevented from rising to the melting-point. The very cause
which prevents a heavy snowfall protects the little which does
fall from disappearing. The same remarks apply to the Ant
arctic regions.
   In South Georgia and Fuego, where clouds and dense fogs
prevail during nearly the whole year, the permanent snow
and ice are due to a different cause. Here the snowfall is
great, and the amount of heat cut off enormous; but this
alone would not account for the non-disappearance of the
snow and ice; for, notwithstanding this, the heat received
is certainly more than sufficient to melt all the snow which
falls, great as that amount may be. The real cause is that
the heat received is not sufficiently intense to raise the tem
perature to the melting-point. More heat is actually received
by the snow than is required to melt it ; but it is dissipated
and lost before it can manage to raise the temperature of the
 snow to the melting-point; consequently the snow is not
 melted. Here snow falls in the very middle of summer;
 but snow would not fall unless the temperature were near the
freezing-point.
    Foregoing principles applied to the case of the Glacial
 Epoch.—Let us now apply the foregoing principles to the
 case of the glacial epoch. As winter then occurred in
 aphelion during a high state of eccentricity, that season
 would be much longer and colder than at present. Snow in
 temperate regions would then fall in place of rain ; and
 although the snowfall during the winter might not be great,
 yet, as the temperature would be far below the freezing-point,
 what fell would not melt. As heat, which produces evapora
 tion, is just as essential to the accumulation of snow and ice
 as is cold, which produces condensation, after the sun had
 passed the vernal equinox and summer was approaching, the
 consequent rise of temperature would be accompanied by an
 increase in the snowfall. A melting of the snow would also
                                 U2

260        Dr. J. Croll on some Controverted Points
begin ; but it would be a very considerable time before the
amount melted would equal the daily amount of snow falling.
Rain, alternating with snow-showers, would probably result ;
and, for some time before midsummer, snow would cease and
give place entirely to rain. Melting would then go on
rapidly, and by the end of the summer the snow would all
disappear except on high mountain-summits such as those of
Scotland, Wales, and Scandinavia. Before the end of autumn,
however, it would again begin to fall. Next year would
bring a repetition of the same process, with this difference,
however, that the snow-line would descend to a lower level
than in the previous year. Year by year the snow-line would
continue to descend till all the high grounds became covered
with permanent snow.
   It would not require a very great amount of change from
the present condition of things to bring about such a result.
A simple lowering of the temperature, which would secure
that snow, instead of rain, should fall for six or eight months
in the year, would suffice ; and this would follow as a neces
sary result from an increase of eccentricity. Now, if all our
mountain-summits were covered with permanent snow down
to a considerable distance, the valleys would soon become
filled with local glaciers. In such a case we should then have
more than one half of Scotland, a large part of the north of
England and Wales, with nearly the whole of Norway,
covered with snow and ice. Here a new and powerful agent
would come into operation which would greatly hasten on a
glacial condition of things. This large snow- and ice-covered
surface would tend to condense the vapour into snow. It
would, during summer, chill the air and produce dense and
continued fogs, cutting off the sun's rays, and leading to a
state of things approaching to that of South Georgia, which
would much retard the melting of the snow.
   It is a great mistake, as I have repeatedly shown, to sup
pose that the perihelion summers of the glacial epoch could
be hot. No snow- and ice-covered continent can enjoy a hot
summer. This is clearly shown by the present condition of
Greenland. Were it not for the ice, the summers of North
Greenland, owing to the continuance of the sun above the
horizon, would be as warm as those of England ; but, instead
of this, the Greenland summers are colder than our winters,
and snow during that season falls more or less nine days out
of ten. But were the ice-covering removed, a snow-shower
during summer would be as great a rarity as it would be with
us. On the other hand, cover India with an ice-sheet, and the
summers of that place would be colder than those of England.

                    in Geological Climatology.                261
   When the high grounds of Scotland and Scandinavia, with
those of the northern parts of America, became covered with
snow and ice, and the eccentricity went on increasing, a
diminution of the Gulf-stream and a host of other physical
agencies, all tending towards a glacial condition of things,
would be brought into operation. This would ultimately and
inevitably lead to a general state of glaciation, without the
aid of any of those additional geographical changes of land
and water which some have supposed.
   The Mutual Reaction of the Physical Agents.—Those who
think that the agencies to which I refer would not by them
selves bring about a glacial condition appear to overlook a
most important and remarkable circumstance regarding their
mode of operation, to which I have frequently alluded in
' Climate and Time ' (pp. 74-77) and other places. The cir
cumstance is this:—The physical agencies in question not
only all lead to one result, viz. an accumulation of snow and
ice, but their efficiency in bringing about this result is actu
ally strengthened by their mutual reaction on one another.
In physics the effect reacts on the cause. In electricity and
magnetism, for example, cause and effect in almost every case
mutually act and react upon each other ; but the reaction of
the effect tends to weaken the cause. Those physical agents
 to which I have referred, no doubt, in their mutual actions
 and reactions obey the same law ; but in reference to one
particular result, viz. the accumulation and conservation of
 snow, those mutual reactions strengthen one another. This is
 not reasoning in a circle, as Mr. Searles Wood supposes ; for
 the reaction of an effect may on the whole weaken the cause,
 and yet in regard to a particular result it may strengthen it.
 In the case under consideration the agents not only act in
 one direction, but their efficiency in acting in that one direc
 tion is strengthened by their mutual reactions. This curious
 circumstance throws a flood of light on the causes which
 tended to bring about the glacial epoch.
   To begin with, we have a high state of eccentricity. This
 leads to long and cold winters. The cold leads to snow ; and
 although heat is given out in the formation of the snow, yet
 the final result is that the snow intensifies the cold : it cools
 the air and leads to still more snow. The cold and snow
 bring a third agent into play—-fogs, which act still in the
 same direction. The fogs intercept the sun's rays; this inter
 ception of the rays diminishes the melting-power of the sun,
 and so increases the accumulation. As the snow and ice con
 tinue to accumulate, more and more of the rays are cut off;
 and, on the other hand, as the rays continue to be cut off, the

  262         Dr. J. Croll on some Controverted Points
 rate of accumulation increases, because the quantity of snow
 and ice melted becomes thus annually less and less. In addi
 tion, the loss of the rays cut off by the fogs lowers the tem
 perature of the air and leads to more snow being formed,
  while, again, the snow thus formed chills the air still more and
 increases the fogs. Again, during the winters of a glacial
  epoch, the earth would be radiating its heat into space. Had
 this loss of heat simply lowered the temperature, the lowering
  of the temperature would have tended to diminish the rate of
  loss ; but the result is the formation of snow rather than the
  lowering of the temperature.
     Further, as snow and ice accumulate on the one hemisphere
 they diminish on the other. This increases the strength of
 the trade-winds on the cold hemisphere and weakens those on
 the warm. The effect of this is to impel the warm water of
 the tropics more to the warm hemisphere than to the cold.
 Suppose the northern hemisphere to be the cold one ; then,
 as the snow and ice begin gradually to accumulate, the ocean-
 currents of that hemisphere, more particularly the Gulf-
 stream, begin to decrease in volume, while those on the
 southern or warm hemisphere begin pari passu to increase *.
 This withdrawal of heat from the northern hemisphere favours
 the accumulation of snow and ice ; and as the snow and ice
accumulate the ocean-currents decrease. On the other hand,
 as the ocean-currents diminish the snow and ice still more
accumulate. Thus the two effects, in so far as the accumu
lation of snow and ice is concerned, mutually strengthen each
other.
     The same process of mutual action and reaction takes place
 among the agencies in operation on the warm hemisphere;
 only the result produced is diametrically opposite to that pro
 duced in the cold hemisphere. On this warm hemisphere
action and reaction tend to raise the mean temperature and
 diminish the quantity of snow and ice existing in temperate
 and polar regions.
    * Prof. Dana has shown that in North America those areas which at
present have the greatest rainfall are, as a rule, the areas which were
most glaciated during the glacial epoch. Mr. Searles V. Wood (Geol.
Mag., July) maintains that this fact is inconsistent with the theory that
the glacial period was due to the cause to which I attribute it. I am
totally unable to comprehend how he arrives at this conclusion. Sup
posing the Gulf-stream, as I have maintained, were greatl}' diminished
during the glacial period, still I think it would follow, other things being
equal, that the areas which now have the greatest rainfall would during
that period probably have the greatest snowfall, and consequently the
greatest accumulation of ice. The amount of precipitation might be less
than at present; but this would not prevent the areas which had the
greatest snowfall from being most covered with ice.

                    in Geological Climatology.              263
   The primary cause of all these physical agencies being set
in operation is a high state of eccentricity of the earth's
orbit ; and with a continuance of that state a glacial epoch
becomes inevitable.
   The Explanation begins with Winter.—Mr. Hill asks why I
always begin in my explanation with the aphelion winter
rather than with the perihelion summer. The reason is that
the character of the summer is determined by that of the
winter, and not the winter by that of the summer. It is
true that to a certain extent the influence is mutual ; but the
effect of the summer on the winter is trifling in comparison
with that of the winter on the summer. To begin our expla
nation with the summer would be like beginning at the end
of a story and telling it backward.
   M. Woeikof on the Cause of Glaciation.—In an article by
A. Woeikof on " Glaciers and Glacial Periods in their rela
tions to Climate " (' Nature,' March 2nd, 1882), it is main
tained that the chief cause which leads to the formation of
snow, and consequently to a glacial condition, is a low surface-
temperature of the sea surrounding or adjoining the land.
When the surface-temperature of the water much exceeds the
freezing-point, the vapour, he says, evaporated from the sea
and condensed on the land will be rain and not snow ; but
when the temperature of the water is near the freezing-point,
snow will be the result. A diminution, for example, in the
heat brought by the Gulf-stream that would very greatly
lower the surface-temperature of the sea surrounding Great
Britain would, he says, bring about a heavy snowfall and
lead to permanent snow and ice. Again, he maintains, " As
there is no reason to suppose that the surface-temperature of
the sea would be lower during winter in aphelion and high
eccentricity, it follows that there will not be more snow than
now in countries where rain is the rule, even in winter, all
other things equal."
   There is surely a fallacy lurking under this theory of M.
Woeikof. Snow instead of rain is not, as he supposes, owing
to the low temperature of the water from which the vapour
is derived, but to the low temperature of the air where the
vapour is precipitated. Of course, when the surface of the
sea is near the freezing-point, the air over the sea and the
adjoining land is usually also not far from the freezing-point,
and consequently the precipitation is more likely to be snow
than rain. If the air be cold, as it generally is over a snow-
and ice-covered country, a high temperature of the adjoining
seas, were this possible, would greatly increase the snowfall,

Wallace's modification of the theory, as given in ' Island Life.'
 XXXVIII. On Mr. Heath's Criticism of Ferrel's Theory of
          Atmospheric Currents. By Frank Waldo*.
 IT is not astonishing that Mr. Heath should not have a cor
       rect idea of the Theory of Atmospheric Currents accepted
by the meteorologists of today ; but he was rather hasty in
writing the criticisms on Mr. Ferrel's paper which have just
appeared (in the July number of this Journal).
   I should do nothing more than refer the critic to papers
from which he could obtain information, if it were not that an
answer to his remarks is called f'orj not at all to defend Ferrel,
because that is unnecessary, but to bring this matter a little
more prominently before those who have read the criticism
referred to, and who, if they accept it, will form an incorrect
notion of the theory of atmospheric currents.
   In the first place the critic seems to be almost totally un
acquainted with the literature of the subject. It is true that
he has apparently rend Ferrel's first mathematical paper, and
some minor papers in 'Nature ;' but he makes no reference to
the other papers (more than sixty) on this topic which have
appeared within the last twenty-five years.
   The whole subject is one that has been much neglected in
England ; and, apart from the papers in 'Nature,' an article
published by Mr. Daniel Vaughan of Cincinnati (U.S.) in the
British-Association Report for 1859, and an article by Professor
Everett, I know of no purely English writings which can be
called at all important on the new dynamical meteorology.
   I will first take up some of the points touched upon by the
critic, and make a few references to the literature.
   Dr. Haughton, as quoted on page 13, renders only due
credit to Ferrel when he says that Ferrel has given a solution,
which is in general satisfactory, of the problem of air-currents
in his important memoir. This memoir is justly considered
the first of the series of papers which followed, in which the
atmospheric movements are deduced dynamically ; and it is
recognized as the most important paper in the earlier history
of the new meteorology—new as opposed to the Dovian.
   Mr. Heath says (pp. 14-15):—"A mass situated anywhere
near the surface, but unconnected with it and unresisted
by the air. if put in motion, will begin to move in fixed
                   * Communicated by the Author.

                 Theory of Atmospheric Currents.               205
space, in a straight line, in a direction and with a velocity
compounded of the velocity it had in common with the surface
at that place and that of the impulse given to it, in accordance
with the principle of the Parallelogram of Velocities, and will
be drawn out of that line only downwards, by the force of
frravity at the centre of the earth ; and thorefore it will never
 eave the plane of the great circle, fixed in space, which com
prises the original direction and this centre." This refers to
absolute motion, while the question is one of relative ; it will
be spoken of further on. However, that this absolute motion
is not in the least contradictory to the application of the prin
 ciple of the preservation of areas as carried out by Ferrel and
 others and as questioned by Mr. Heath, is proven by Dr. A.
 Sprung in an article, " Zur Anwendung des Princips der
 Fliichen in der Meteorologio," Oesterr. Zeitschrift filr Meteo-
 rologie, Band xvi. page 62.
    On page 15 he remarks that Sir John Herschel, in bis
' Meteorology,' does not mislead his readers as Ferrel does.
 It may be here remarked that, in the book referred to, Her
 schel did not give the true theory of the winds as at present
 accepted. Ferrel was right in speaking of the wrong teach
 ing of the text-books, because it is only a few years since the
 true explanation was first given in any of them, and even
 now those in which it is found can be counted on the fingers
 of one hand.
    The " force" which is described on page 15 as incomprehen
 sible is explained in Poisson's paper on projectiles, " Memoire
 sur le mouvement des projectiles dans l'air, en ayant egard
 a la rotation de la terre," lu a l'Academie des Sciences, le 14
 novembre 1837, Journal de VEcole Polytechnique, cahierxxvi.
 There is also a discussion on the subject in the Comptes Ren-
 dus, tome xlix. &c, &c. ; and Poisson's paper is mentioned in
  Routb's ' Rigid Dynamics' (3rd edition), 1877, p. 218.
    In regard to Ferrel's criticisms of Colding, he was right
 in saying that Colding did not take into account one compo
 nent of the effect of the earth's rotation.
    As to Ferrel and Everett having jointly discovered this
 component, there has never, to my knowledge, been such a
 claim made. It was discovered many years previously, but was
 rediscovered by Ferrel independently.
    In regard to the two points brought out on page 18—first,
 the application of the principle of the conservation of areas,
 and, secondly, the path of a body on the earth's surface— Mr.
  Heath is in error in his criticism. As to the first point, this is
  not the first time that the application of this theorem has been
  questioned. Dr. Thiesen employs it in an article " Ueber

26iJ     On Mr. Ferrel's Theory of Atmospheric Currents.
 Bewegungen auf der Erdoberflache," pages 203-206, Band
 xiv. of the Oesterreichischen Zetischrift fUr Meteorologie, and,
 on being criticised for doing so, replies, " the area principle
is always applicable in a determined plane, if the projection
of the forces acting in this plane has no momentum'" (see page
88, Band xv. of the same Journal). Also, page 89, " In the
present case, in which the earth is regarded as a rotating body,
the attracting force as well as the predominating pressure
force on the earth's surface lies in the meridian, and conse
quently has in the equatorial plane no momentum of rotation
in relation to the earth's axis.'
    On page 40 of Kirchhoff's Mechanik (2nd edition), as well
as in Schell's Theorie der Bewegung und der Krtifte (2nd
edition), pages 351-354, is found the theorem of the conser
vation of areas and the cases to which it can be applied ; and
here we find the theorem employed by Thiesen. This proves
conclusively that Ferrel is correct in using it.
   With respect to the second point, on page 209 of the
third edition of Bouth's ' Dynamics ' we find the following
theorem:—"In finding the motion of a particle of mass m
with reference to any moving axes, we may treat the axes as
if they were fixed in space, provided we regard the particle as
acted on, in addition to the impressed forces, by two forces:—
(1) a force equal and opposite to that which would constrain
the particle to remain fixed to the moving axes, and which is
measured by mf, where / is the reversed acceleration of the
point of moving space occupied by the particle ; (2) a force
perpendicular to both the direction of relative motion of the
particle and to the central axis or axis of rotation of the mov
ing axes, and which is measured by 2/nVfl sin 6, where V is
the relative velocity^ of the particle, O the resultant angular
velocity of the moving axes, and 0 the angle between the
direction of the velocity and the axis of rotation.''
   It is a question of relative motion that is being considered ;
and it is evident, as fiouth remarks on page 213, that " the
motion of a body on the surface of the earth is not exactly the
same as if the earth were at rest."
   A casual reader might see part of Ferrel's paper in the
same light as Mr. Heath ; but we must remember that it is
to be taken for the most part as a qualitative and not a quan
titative investigation.
   Although not in formula, yet in words the equation of con
tinuity is taken into account.
   On pages 18 to 23 we find a more detailed criticism of
Ferrel's paper.
   That Ferrel's results were somewhat peculiar is to be ad

     On the Secular Inequalities in the Planetary Theory.    267
mitted; and it was perhaps this peculiarity that kept them so
long unrecognized ; but careful study has led to their accept
ance by the foremost meteorologists. He could not hope to
solve the complex problem as it really exists, and was obliged
to make his solution very general.
   On pp. 386-391, Band xiv. of the Oesterr. Zeitsch. filr Me-
teoroloyie is given a review of the first part of Ferrel's elabo
ration, mentioned below, of his early paper; pp. 161-175 and
276-283 of the xvii. Band of the same Journal contain a
review of the second part ; and the whole was again reviewed
in ' Nature ' last year.
   It appears as though Ferrel's critic had written his article
from the point of view of a student of Laplace and Airy, and
had not examined the more modern text-books on mechanics
to see if Ferrel's reasoning was admissible.
   It is hoped that instead of heeding the warning that has
been sounded against Ferrel, the readers of this Journal will
read the elaborations of his first paper, given as Appendices
to the U. S. Coast-Survey Reports for 1875 and 1878.
   Mr. Heath's paper will have one good effect, I hope; and
that is, to interest some of the English mathematicians and
physicists in this subject.
 XXXIX. On the Equation to the Secular Inequalities in the
       Planetary Theory. By J. J. Sylvestek, F.li.S*
AVERY long time ago I gave, in this Magazine, a proof
        of the reality of the roots in the above equation, in
which I employed a certain property of the square of a sym
metrical matrix which was left without demonstration; I will
now state a more general theorem concerning the product
of any two matrices of which that theorem is a particular case.
In what follows it is of course to be understood that the
product of two matrices means the matrix corresponding to the
combination of two substitutions which those matrices represent.
   It will be convenient to introduce here a notion (which
plays a conspicuous part in my new theory of multiple algebra),
viz. that of the latent roots of a matrix—latent in a somewhat
similar sense as vapour may be said to be latent in water
or smoke in a tobacco-leaf. If from each term in the diagonal
of a given matrix, A. be subtracted, the determinant to the
matrix so modified will be a rational integer function of X ;
the roots of that function are the latent roots of the matrix ;
and there results the important theorem that the latent roots of
                    * Communicated by the Author.

2(38     On the Secular Inequalities in the Planetary Theory.
any function of a matrix are respectively the same functions
of the latent root.s of the matrix itself : ex. gr. the latent
roots of the square of a matrix are the squares of its latent
roots.
    The latent roots of the product of two matrices, it may be
added, are the same in whichever order the factors be taken.
If, now, m and n be any two matrices, and M = mn or nm, I
am able to show that the sum of the products of the latent
roots of M taken i together in every possible way is equal to
the sum of the products obtained by multiplying every minor
determinant of the ith order in one of the two matrices in, n by
its altruistic opposite in the other: the reflected image of any
such determinant, in respect to the principal diagonal of the
matrix to which it belongs, is its proper opposite, and the          /
corresponding determinant to this in the other matrix is its
altruistic opposite.
    The proof of this theorem will be given in my large forth
coming memoir on Multiple Algebra designed for the 'Ame
rican Journal of Mathematics.'
    Suppose, now, that /n and n are transverse to one another,
i. e. that the lines in the one are identical with the columns in
 the other, and vice versa, then any determinant in m becomes
 identical with its altruistic opposite in n; and furthermore, if
 m be a symmetrical matrix, it is its own transverse. Con
 sequently we have the theorem (the one referred to at the
outset of this paper) that the sum of the t-ary products of the
latent roots of the square of a symmetrical matrix (?'. e. of the
squares of the roots of the matrix itself) is equal to the sum of
 the squares of all the minor determinants of the order i in the
 matrix; whence it follows, from Descartes's theorem, that when
 all the terms of a symmetrical matrix are real, none of its
 latent roots can be pure imaginaries, and, as an easy inference,
 cannot be any kind of imaginaries; or, in other words, all the
 latent roots of a symmetrical matrix are real, which is Laplace's
 theorem.
    I may take this opportunity of stating the important theorem
 that if Xj, Xj, . . . X< are the latent roots of any matrix m, then
    This theorem of course presupposes the rule first stated by
 Prof. Cayley (Phil. Trans. 1857) for the addition of matrices.
    When any of the latent roots are equal, the formula must
 be replaced by another obtained from it by the usual me-
                                                      1
 thod of infinitesimal variation. If <t>m = ma, it gives the

     On the Distribution of Elect ricity on Metallic Bodies.   269
expression for the wth root of the matrix; and we see that the
number of such roots is g>', where i is the order of the matrix.
When, however, the matrix is unitary, i. e. all its terms except
the diagonal ones are zeros or zeroidal, i. e. when all its terms
are zeros, this conclusion is no longer applicable, and a certain
definite number of arbitrary quantities enter into the general
expressions for the roots.
   The case of the extraction of any root of a unitary matrix
of the second order was first considered and successfully
treated by the late Mr. Babbage ; it reappears in M. Serret's
Cours a" Algebre supdrieure." This problem is of course
the same as that of finding a function                of any given
order of periodicity. My memoir will give the solution of the
corresponding problem for a matrix of any order. Of the
many unexpected results which I have obtained by my new
method, not the least striking is the rapprochement which it
establishes between the theory of Matrices and that of Inva
riants. The theory of invariance relative to associated Matrices
includes and transcends that relative to algebraical functions.
XL. On the Influence of the Direction of the Lines of Force
   on the Distribution of Electricity on Metallic Bodies. By
   Alfred Tribe, F.Inst. C, Lecturer on Chemistry in Dul-
   wich College*.
I WISH it to be understood at the outset that the results
      on electrical distribution, to which reference will be made
in this paper, were obtained during the electrolysis of a solu
tion of copper sulphate, by determining the amount, extent,
position, or nature of the electrochemical action set up on a
metallic plate, or other-shaped conductor, immersed in the
electrolyte, but not in metallic connexion with the battery-
electrodes. I would also point out that when I speak of the
lines of force as having a certain direction with regard to a
part or parts of a metallic plate, or other-shaped analyzer, or
as having a certain direction with regard to the boundary of
an electrochemical deposit, it is to be understood that such
would be the direction supposing the analyzer itself exercised
no disturbing influence on these imaginary lines in the field
of action.

sides and perpendicular to the ends of the metallic conductor.

   These results establish, and, I think, conclusively, that the
distribution of electricity on conductors in an electric field,
when the direction of the lines of force is perpendicular to
their ends, and when the material of the field consists of an
electrolyte, is generally similar to what is known to be the
distribution of electricity on conductors in an electric field
when the material consists of a gaseous dielectric. And the
relatively great electric density found on the end surface of
the rhombus would also appear to establish a very close resem
blance (of course under the given conditions) between the
action of the points of conductors in electrolytic and dielectric
fields respectively.
   In the experiments now to be described, I employed a trough
305 millim. long, 120 broad, and 128 deep, copper electrodes
of the same area as the ends of the trough, a 5-per-cent.
solution of copper sulphate, and a current of one ampere
flowing for six minutes.
   II. When the direction of the lines offorce makes an oblique
angle with the sides of the metallic conductor.
    In a former paper in the 'Philosophical Magazine,' June
1881, p. 447, it was shown that when the direction of the force is
parallel to the plane of the analyzing plate, and perpendicular
to its ends, the electrification of the same sign is identical in
area on both sides of the plate; also that when the force makes
 an oblique angle with the plane of the metallic plate, the
 electrification of the same sign differs in area on the sides of
 the plate; and, furthermore, that this difference in area in
 creases as the plane of the plate approaches a right angle to
 the direction of the lines of force.
    In the annexed table are set out the areas in square milli
 metres of the electrifications and intermedial spaces, side by
 side with the angle of inclination of the plane of the plates.
 The analyzers employed were plates of fine silver measuring
 67x7 millimetres. The expressions "+ side/' "— sido" in
the table refer to the side of the analyzer opposite to the + or
 — electrode respectively.

 272            Mr. A. Tribe on tfie Distribution of
    It is evident from these results that as the plane of the plate
 became perpendicular to the direction of the lines of force—
first, the area of — electrification increased on the + side (at
 least to 67£°) and decreased on the — side of the same plate;
 secondly, the area of + electrification decreased on the + side,
and varied irregularly on the — side; and, thirdly, the area
 of the intermedial space generally increased on both sides.
    I have not explored the distribution of electricity on these
 plates by actual chemical analysis; but, judging from the
 colour and general appearance of the electro-deposits, it
 would appear that as the direction of the force approached a
perpendicular to the plane of the analyzers the quantity of
electricity on tho plates diminished, and that the electric
density also diminished at the respective ends of the plates.
    In support of the first of these conclusions, I would point
 to some experiments bearing on the subject described in my
 paper in the ' Proceedings of the Royal Society,' 1876, p. 313.
    III. When the direction of the lines offorce is perpendicular
to the plane of the metallic conductor.
    There evidently exists, as we have just seen, a relation
 between the quantity of electricity set up on an analyzing
 plate and the direction of the lines of force to its plane, from
 which it would follow that the minimum quantity would be
 found when the plane was perpendicular to the direction of
 the force. Such is the case. In fact, the only sign of electri
 fication noticeable on a plate in this position, of the dimensions
 of those employed in the experiments described in II., was a
 mere trace of copper, longitudinally arranged along the central
 part of that side of tho plate facing the + electrode. This
 latter fact was pointed out in my paper in the ' Philosophical
 Magazine' for June lt>81, [5] xi. p. 448.
    The further investigation of this subject has brought out
 many points of interest. It has shown that the distribution
 of electricity on a metallic plate is totally different when its
 plane is respectively parallel or perpendicular to the direction
 of the lines of force. It has already been pointed out that,
 when the direction is parallel, the maximum electric density
 is at the ends of a rectangular plate, and diminishes towards
 the centre; but, conversely, when the direction is perpendi
 cular, the maximum electric density would appear to be on tho
 central parts and evidently diminishes towards the edges,
 where, and for some distance from which, signs of electrifi
 cation are entirely absent. Again, when the direction is
 parallel, the points or angular projections of the conductor,
 as has also been pointed out, accumulate a proportionally very

                       Electricity on Metallic Bodies.                  273
 large quantity of electricity ; but experiment shows that the
 function of points and angular projections is the reverse of
this when the plane of the conductor is perpendicular to the
lines of force. It has shown also that the area of electrifica
 tion, and, judging from the appearance of the electro-deposits,
the quantity of electrification likewise, increases in an in
creasing proportion as the area of the plate increases, and
furthermore that, with plates of a given area, the area of
electrification (and probably the amount) is determined solely
by the relation between the lengths and breadths of the plates.

cations registered on plates differing in shape but of equal area,

   In this paper I have, for the most part, spoken of the distri
bution of electricity on metallic plates; but I have satisfied
myself that the distribution on other- shaped conductors is
similarly modified by alterations in the direction of the lines
of force. In illustration of this I subjoin a diagram (fig. 2)
showing the distributions registered on a cone with a hemi
spherical base, placed so that its longer diameter was respec
tively parallel and perpendicular to the direction of the lines
of force. The non-shaded parts of the figures represent the
zones of no electrochemical action.
                               Fig. 2.
   The experiments described and referred to in this paper
 have shown :—
    I. That in a given electrolytic field the quantity, the
 distribution, and the area of electrification on a given metallic
 plate are severally determined by its inclination to the direction
 of the lines of force.
    II. That in a given electrolytic field the quantity and area
 of electrification on a metallic plate of a given area, when its
 plane is perpendicular to the direction of tho lines of force,
 are determined by the relation between its length and breadth.
    III. That in a given electrolytic field the quantity and area

  of electrification on a plate of a given shape, when its plane
  is perpendicular to the direction of the lines of force, increase
  in an increasing proportion as the dimensions of the plate
  increase.
     IV. That the distribution of electricity on a plate is sub
  stantially reversed when its plane is respectively parallel or
  perpendicular to the direction of the lines of force.
     V. That when the direction of the lines of force, in an
  electrolytic field, is parallel to the sides and perpendicular to
 the ends of a metallic conductor, the distribution of electricity
 thereon is similar to the distribution of electricity set up on a
 similar-shaped conductor, in air or other gaseous dielectric,
 and subjected to ordinary inductive forces.
     VI. That the power of points in accumulating electricity is,
 under the conditions set out in V., similar to the power shown
 in air when the conductor to which they are attached is sub
 jected to ordinary inductive forces.
     In conclusion, I would point out that our knowledge of the
 power of points to accumulate electric force, and, generally,
 of the distribution of electricity on conductors subjected to
 ordinary inductive forces in air, has been obtained under
 circumstances where it may be supposed that the direction of
 the lines of force was more or less parallel to the sides and
 perpendicular to the ends of such conductors. But I venture
 to think, seeing the close analogy which evidently exists under
 certain circumstances between the distribution of electricity
 on conductors in electrolytes and in dielectrics, that the further
exploration of electrical distribution on conductors in air sub
jected to inductive forces differing in direction, will show that
the laws governing the distribution of electricity on conductors
in the respective electric fields are similar, if not identical.
In other words, the distribution of electricity on metallic bodies
in air may be found to be as dependent upon the direction of
the lines of force as in electrolytes.

XLI. The Dilatation of Crystals on Change of Temperature.

IN a previous paper bearing the above titlef, read before the
       Crystallological Society in November 1879, the following
properties were shown to follow from the assumption that the
         • Read before the Crystallological Society, July 3, 1883.
         t Phil. Mag. 1880, vol. ix^j. 81.

276       Mr. L. Fletcher on the Dilatation of Crystals
geometrical and physical characters of a crystal are the same
along all lines having the same direction :—
   1. A plane of physical and geometrical symmetry is perma
nent for all changes of temperature so long as the crystalline
arrangement is preserved. A crystal may thus, theoretically
at least, pass on mere change of temperature from a system
of lower to one of higher symmetry, but not vice versa, with
out a preliminary destruction of the crystalline arrangement
of its molecules.
   2. A sphere at one temperature in general becomes an
ellipsoid at a second.
   3. Any three lines mutually perpendicular at the first tem
perature become three conjugate diameters of the ellipsoid at
the second.
   4. One particular triad of lines, namely that which at the
second temperature coincides with the axes of the ellipsoid, is
rectangular at both temperatures : the lines of this triad are
the directions of greatest mean and least expansion, and have
been called by Neumann thermic axes.
   5. The pair of diameters at right angles to the circular
sections of the ellipsoid are such that the expansion of all
crystal-lines normal to them at the second temperature has
been the same : they thus present a character analogous to
that of the optic axes and of the magnetic axes of Pliicker.
   6. One triad of lines has absolutely the same position in
space at the two temperatures, and at the suggestion of Prof.
Maskelyne has been designated as a triad of atropic lines ;
being in general not at right angles, they are distinct from
the thermic axes ; and if permanently fixed in space for all
variations of temperature they must be intimately related to
the structure of the crystal, and would in such case have a
claim to be regarded not as arbitrary but as veritable axes of
the crystal.
    7. An infinite number of triads of lines can be found
which retain their mutual inclinations while changing their
directions in space: the lines of such triads will in this paper be
designated as isotropic ; the so-called thermic axes are merely
the particular triad of isotropic lines for which the angles of
 mutual inclination are right angles.
    8. If in a crystal belonging to the Oblique system the two
lines in the symmetry-plane which are atropic for one pair of
temperatures are atropic for all others, no lines isotropic for
 one pair of temperatures will retain their inclination perma
 nently, and thus having no constancy of inclination can scarcely
 be important as structural lines of the crystal.
    It was further shown that in the Cubic system all lines, and

                      on Change of Temperature.                           277
in the Tetragonal and Hexagonal systems all lines parallel or
perpendicular to the axis of highest symmetry, are permanent
in direction on change of temperature of the crystal ; that in
the Rhombic system both the thermic axes and the atropic
lines are coincident with the crystallographic axes ; that in
the Oblique system one thermic axis and one atropic line
coincide with the crystallographic axis perpendicular to the
plane of symmetry, while the remaining thermic axes, atropic
lines, and crystallographic axes lie without any evident con
nection in the plane of symmetry ; and that in the Anorthic
system the thermic axes, atropic lines, and crystallographic
axes are apparently quite independent of each other.
   With the view of experimentally testing the above theory
of the possible want of permanency of the thermic axes, Mr.
Beckenkamp*, at the instance of Professor Groth, has under
taken in the Strassburg laboratory the onerous task of making
precise measurements of the angles of anorthite, axinite, ortho-
clase, and gypsum at various temperatures; and for this pur
pose a large goniometer reading to seconds has been at his
disposal. Deducing from these measurements the positions
of the thermic axes by the help of formulae constructed by
the elder and younger Neumann for Oblique and Anorthic
crystals respectively!, Mr. Beckenkamp finds that, while the
variation in the case of the other minerals examined is within
the limits of the errors of experiment, in a crystal of anorthite
the axis of minimum expansion for the pair of temperatures
20°—80° C. is as much as 26° 36' distant from the corresponding
axis for the pair of temperatures 20°—200°O; and Mr. Becken
kamp further states that it is unnecessary to show that this is
beyond any possible experimental error.
   Any deviation, however small, from absolute rectangularity
of the lines which are thermic axes for one pair of tempera
tures being clearly fatal to their permanency, the magnitude
of this deviation was not touched upon in the first paper. As,
however, the change in the mutual inclinations of these lines
could scarcely be expected to exceed a few seconds, and the
change in the position of the thermic axes perhaps a few
minutes, it seemed necessary to carefully examine the original
formulae of Neumann and the observations and calculations
of Beckenkamp before such an enormous variation as 26° 36' in
the position of a thermic axis could be considered absolutely

Eroved. An examination undertaken with this object in view
  as led to the gradual development of the present paper.
   It was soon found that the formula? of Neumann are so
complex, and are arrived at by so complicated a method, that
it was far from easy to become quite confident that some small
error might not have crept in to invalidate the result, more
especially as Beckenkamp had himself had occasion to point
out two printer's errors in the formulae of the original paper of
Neumann. This feeling will perhaps be more intelligible if we
give Neumann's statement of the method by which the ther
mic axes are to be actually calculated. It is as follows :—
" Let OA, OB, OC be the crystallographic axes and have
lengths A, B, C respectively: take three rectangular axes X\} x3,
x3, xs being coincident with OC, x2 in the plane AOC and
perpendicular to OC, and xt perpendicular to the plane AOC.

 will give the direction-cosines relative to the rectangular axes
 *j, x2, #3 of the directions at the second temperature 6' of
 thermic axes for the pair of temperatures 8 and
    It is not recorded that Neumann himself made any practi
 cal use of these formulae; and it would appear that Pape, by his
 determination of the thermic axes of crystals of copper sul
 phate*, was the first to show that they come within the range
of practical crystallography : the actual results, however, can
not be very precise, seeing that the instrument employed only
afforded readings to a minute. Beckenkamp has now made
extensive use of these formulae to ascertain whether or not in
an Anorthic crystal the same crystal-lines remain permanently
at right angles, and decides the question in the negative.
    It had occurred to the writer that results deduced from these
formulae would really be useless for the purpose of testing the
permanency of the thermic axes, since the equations are ob
tained by neglecting small quantities of the second order upon
which one would expect any change in the thermic axes to
depend. In fact it will be shown later that on reversing the
order of the temperatures, exactly the same equations, and con
sequently the same direction-cosines, as before will be ob
tained; but this time they must give the position of the thermic
axes at the lower instead of at the higher temperature. In
other words, the formulae only give the position of the thermic
axes within an angular distance equal to the actual displace
ment of the corresponding crystal-lines by the change of tem
perature.
  As, however, the calculated deviation of 26° 36' in the position
of one of the thermic axes of anorthite is evidently far beyond
the displacement of any lines of the crystal, it would appear to
result from some other cause than the neglect of the terms of
the second order.
    Since it is very difficult to imagine that two lines of a
crystal can have the same mutual inclination at two different
temperatures and yet deviate therefrom at intermediate ones,
we propose to show in the first place by actual calculation
that such a property is undoubtedly characteristic of crystal
line bodies ; and incidentally we shall find the deviation in
the case of the particular mineral used for illustration, thus
obtaining a clue, however faint, to the order of magnitude
of this deviation in the general case.

280       Mr. L. Fletcher on the Dilatation of Crystals
   The mineral we select for this illustration is rock-crystal;
and for the following reasons :—
   1st. Any section through the morphological axis contains
two lines which are at once thermic axes and atropic lines for
all temperatures;
   2ndly. The expansions along these atropic lines have been
determined by Fizeau with great accuracy ; and
   3rdly. These expansions are very different, one being almost
double the other.
   The precision attained by the method of Fizeau* will be
better appreciated if we mention that two determinations
made with especial care at times separated by an interval of
about twelve months, during which the apparatus had been
heated and cooled some hundreds of times, gave for the co
efficient of expansion in the direction of the morphological
axis 0-0000078118 and 0-0000078117 respectively.
   We may here conveniently call attention to the fact that
Fizeau's method when employed alone gives the variation in
the thickness of the plate and not the variation in length of a
crystal-line initially normal to its faces, the two quantities
only being identical when the same line of the crystal is per
manently normal to the plate. If h be the initial thickness of
the plate, and h! the length at the second temperature of a
line which, though at the first temperature normal to the
plate, is at the second temperature inclined to the normal at
an angle 8, the quantity measured by Fizeau is h! cos 8 — h,
and differs from the true expansion of the crystal-line, namely
 h'—h, by a quantity A'(l— cos 0), which, though always
 small, is in many cases quite appreciable ; if, for instance, for
 an interval of temperature of 100° C. the normal be rotated
 through an angle of 10', as is sometimes the case, the correc
 tion of the coefficient of expansion for that interval is "0000042
 and for an interval of 1° C. is -000000042, quantities scarcely
 to be neglected.
    The present illustration is so chosen that this difficulty does
 not present itself, the expansions having been determined by
 Fizeau from plates normal to permanently atropic lines.
    Let X O Z (PI. III. fig. 1) be any section of a crystal of
 quartz of which O Z is the morphological axis and OX any line
 perpendicular to it, these lines being permanent in direction in
 space for all changes of temperature ; let the unit lengths
 along O X, O Z at the initial temperature <j become a, /3 at the
 temperature ts ; let L' W be the position at the second tempe
rature of the line which initially has the position L N, and let

whence, if P, Q be two planes isotropic for the pair of tempe-

If for the sake of example we take PX = 30°, we find in tbis
wav that the displacement of P for the change of temperature
106—50° C. is about 23": the change in the inclination of P
to Q for tbe change of temperature 10°—50° is thus less than
the TfsVo part °f the absolute displacements of the poles P and Q.
   From the above we think it will be clear that lines may be
isotropic for one pair of temperatures without being so for
others; that when there are two perpendicular atropic lines,
this variation of angle will be a small quantity of the second
order ; and, further, that lines may be isotropic for one pair
of temperatures and yet be absolutely without claim to im
portance as axes of the crystal.
   In the previous paper it was mentioned that, whether the
indices of the planes be rational or irrational, or, what comes
to the same thing, whether the planes be natural or artificial,
the indices will be unaltered by any change of temperature
of the crystals ; and, further, that the anharmonic ratios of
any four natural or artificial planes in the same zone must be
likewise constant on change of temperature, for they can be
expressed in terms of the constant indices*. Considerable use
of the latter property is made in the proof of the various pro
positions given in the present paper ; as in the case of the
anharmonic ratios themselves, the formulae are true whatever

But
                      PP' = QQ' and aa'=a*';
hence
                             aP = QV.
Or, if two pairs of planes be simultaneously isotropic, the angle
between two of the planes, one from each pair, at the first
temperature is equal to the angle between the other two planes
at the second temperature.
     Corollary.—In the first paper it was shown from mecha
nical considerations that, for any pair of temperatures, at least
one pair of real planes is atropic.
    If a,a be the poles of a pair of these planes, the relation just
given becomes
                              aP=Q'o.
 Or if in any crystal two planes are isotropic for a given change
 of temperature, the angle which one of the isotropic planes
 makes at the first temperature with either of the atropic planes
 is equal to the angle which the second isotropic plane makes
 at the final temperature with the remaining atropic plane.

 286       Mr. L. Fletcher on the Dilatation of Crystals
    Prop. IV. If two planes at right angles to the plane of sym
 metry of an Oblique crystal be permanently atropic, no other
 planes in this zone retain their mutual inclination at all tempe
 ratures (fig. 3).
    As before, let a, a be the planes which are permanently
 atropic, and let P, Q be planes isotropic for one pair of tempe
 ratures; whence PQ = P'Q' and PP'=QQ'. From the last
 corollary aP = Q'«: if p, q, S be the points of bisection of the,
 arcs PP', QQ', aa respectively,
         ap=qcc, pq = PQ = P'Q', and pS=Sq= ^
 Whence, if the angle between the isotropic planes P,Qbe given,
 the positions of p, q, the middle points of the arcs of displace
 ment PP', QQ', are absolutely definite.
     But if the temperature of the crystal be again changed and
 the poles P' Q' take up new positions P" Q", it is seen that the
 middle points of the arcs PP" and QQ" do not now coincide
 with pq; in other words, the planes P Q no longer retain their
 mutual inclination.
    Pkop. V. The following method of calculating the displace
 ment of a given pole is sometimes more convenient than the
method indicated in Prop. I.
    Let a, a be the poles of any pair of isotropic planes, and
d, d! the positions of a third pole at the two temperatures : if
 P, P' be the corresponding positions of a fourth pole, we have,
 as before,

and is therefore, so long as we keep to the same pair of tem
peratures, constant for all positions of P.

  Unless sin aa is very small and comparable with e and /, the
  variation in the inclination of P to Q is a small quantity of
 the second order.
     Prop. XI. We shall now consider the results which are
 obtained on neglecting the squares of small quantities.
     (a) We have already seen in Prop. VI. that the displace
 ment of any pole P is in this case given by the relation
                             Q — k sin Pa sin Pa,
 where k is some small quantity independent of the position
of P.
     (6) If 7, 8 be the variations of the arcs ac, ad, then
                         7= k sin ca sin (aa—ac),
                          S=k sin da sin (aa— ad),
 whence both aa and k can be determined. Practically, how
  ever, it is quite as easy to use the rigorous formula? of Pro
  positions II. and VII.
     (c) From the symmetry of the expression k sin Pa sin Pa
 Phil. Miff. S. 5. Vol. 16. No. 100. Oct. 1883.              Y

290         Mr. L. Fletcher on the Dilatation of Crystals
with respect to a and «c, it is seen immediately that any two
poles equidistant respectively from a and a and lying in the
arc aa are isotropic.
   (d) As a particular case, the directions of greatest and least
expansion are inclined at an angle of 45° on opposite sides of
the bisector of the arc aa, and thus have fixed directions in
space at all temperatures if the planes a a are themselves per
manent in direction : as the crystal-lines momentarily coinci
dent with them are in motion, the crystal-lines cannot retain
this property of being directions of greatest and least expan
sion (see previous Paper).
   (e) If 0, </> be the variations of the arcs Pa, Qa for the same
change of temperature,
                             0 _ sin Pa sin Pa
                            <f> sin Qa sin Qa'
Hence if the planes a a be permanently isotropic, the incre
ment of any arc Pa bears a constant ratio to that of any
other arc Qa for all temperatures.
    (/) If P,p be any two rectangular planes and 0, 0' the re
spective variations of the arcs Pa, pa,
       0 + 6' = k [sin Pa sin Pa + sinpa sin pa~\ =k cos aa,
or 8 + 6' is constant for all positions of P and p.
    If <£, <f)' be the corresponding variations for two other rectan
 gular planes Q, q, then, as before, <f> + <t>' —k cos aa, whence
 0 — (f>= —(0'—<f)'); or the increase of the angle between any
two planes P, Q is equal to the diminution of the angle between
tho planes perpendicular to them.
    Pkop. XII. The motion of the plane-normal OP is quite
 distinct from that of the crystals-line OP (fig. 4).
    It is easy to fall into the mistake of assuming that the for
 mula 0=k sin Pa sin Pa gives the displacement of the crystal-
 lino OP. That this is not actually the case will be clear from
 the following :—
    Let the pole P take at the second temperature the position
 P' on the circle of projection, and the point P the position/)' on
 the ellipse : the normal OP thus becomes the normal OP',
 but the crystal-line OP becomes the crystal-line 0//; further,
 the plane tangent to the circle at P, and thus having OP for
 normal, will become the tangent plane to the ellipse at p', to
 which the ray Op1 is only normal when p' is at the extremity
 of a principal axis.
    The difference of motion of the plane-normal OP and the
 crystal-line OP may be found thus :—
   'Let Q be a pole distant 90° from P, so that Qa = Pa + 90°
 and Qa = Pa + 90° : if Q' be the displaced position of the polo

                    on Change of Temperature.                  291
  Q, then (Prop. VI.)
             Q'OQ =k sin Qa sin Qa =k cos Pa cos Pa.
 Now the crystal-line RQ tangent to the circle at Q, and
 thus parallel to the line OP, will become a tangent line r'q'
 to the ellipse and parallel to the tangent to the circle at Q'j
 since parallel lines of the crystal are rotated through the same
 angle, the crystal-lino OP will be rotated through the same
 angle as the tangent to the circle at Q, i. e. through the angle
 k cos Pa cos Pa. The difference of motion of OP the normal
 and OP the ray will therefore be
                 k sin Pa sin Pa— k cos Pa cos Pa,
 or                      — k cos (Pa + Pa),
 which will only vanish when
                   Pa + Pa = (2n + l)|",
 which is the case when OP is a line of greatest or least ex
 pansion (see Prop. XI. d).
    Prop. XIII. To find a physical expression for the quantity k
 (fig. 5).
    We have already seen that in the formula 8=k sin Pa sin Pa,
 a, a are two isotropic poles ; wre shall now show that the co
 efficient k when expressed in circular measure is equal to the
 difference of the greatest and least coefficients of expansion
 of the crystal-lines lying in the plane of the zone.
    Let Ofl, Oa be the normals to a pair of isotropic planes a, a;
 and let OL, OM, OL', OM' be the positions of the crystal-
 linos of greatest and least expansion at the two temperatures.
    If OP, OP' be the normals to LM, L'M', and 8, 8j the coeffi
 cients of expansion of the lines OL, OM, we must have
                   OL'           . OM'

we may write the relation thus,

Equating the two values given by (A) and (B), we find k
is equal to +(8— o\), and is independent of the particular
pair of isotropic poles a, a employed in the formula 6 —

   The positive or negative sign must be taken according as
sin (La + La) is equal to +1 or —1, OL being that axis for
which the coefficient of expansion is 8.

   If, at the two temperatures, bin, bm' be the angular dis

was shown (Prop. XIII.), from the fact of bh remaining per
manently a quadrant, that, omitting small quantities of the
second order,

section of the zone-plane [brn] with the plane of symmetry,
and 83 the coefficient of expansion of Ob, a line perpendicular
to the plane of symmetry.

the coefficient of expansion is 8, then (Prop. XIV.)

   We shall now illustrate the above formula? by a practical
application of them.
   The only published measurements of the angles of an
Oblique crystal at different temperatures were, until the recent
determinations of Beckenkamp, those made upon gypsum by
Mitscherlich, the discoverer of the angular variations produced
in crystals by change of temperature. From these measure
ments Neumann has calculated the positions and expansions of
the thermic axes, and we shall thus be able to directly com
pare the results obtained by his method with those deduced
from the preceding formula}.
   Fig 7 a represents a crystal of gypsum : b is the cleavage-
plane and plane of symmetry (0 1 0), m m^ are planes of the
prism {1 10}, and I li of the form {111}; the planes a (1 0 0),

294         Mr. L. Fletcher on the Dilatation of Crystals
d (1 0 1), if they had presented themselves, would have trun
cated the edges mmx, I /j respectively.
    In the original paper* Mitschcrlich states that, on a variation
of temperature amounting to 100° C, the angle between the
planes mm-i becomes more obtuse by 10' 50 , the angle be
tween the planes / lx more obtuse by 8' 25", and the angle
between the edges d a more obtuse by 7' 26".
    It is worthy of remark that, from the other results given in
the same paper, we infer that these variations have not been
directly observed, but have been calculated from the observed
differences on the assumption that the changes of angle are
proportional to the changes of temperature and are independent
of the absolute temperatures at which the measurements are
made. Perhaps this may partly account for the difference in
the results obtained by Mitscherlich and Beckenkamp.
    Mitscherlich gives no absolute measurements and no initial
temperature. We shall adopt the absolute values as deter
mined byNeumannt for an initial temperature of about 18£°C,
and used by him in his own calculations.
    We then have
     First temperature      Variations

 the pole c (0 0 1) ; we require to calculate ac.
    In the spherical triangle m b I, knowing the two sides in b,
 bl, and the included angle mbl, or the arc ad, we find that
 at the first temperature in /=49° (Y 35""73, and at the second

 temperature =59° 55' 31"-7, and at the second = 59° 58'

 and the angle dlc( = mlb), we find that dc at the first tem

   To ascertain to what extent we shall be justified in neglect
ing the small terms of the second order, we shall make some
calculations founded on the more exact formulae given
above :—

296        Mr. L. Fletcher on the Dilatation of Crystals
   (a) From Prop. VII. we have
                                     sin (j)
                              sin ca sin(m +
where we may write
                         ca= 80° 32' 37"%
                         ca=-80° 55'44"-5,
                          4> = -582"-4;
whence
                           £=598"-18
                             = -0029001
in circular measure. Whence, as before only to the first ap
proximation,
                           8j -8= 0029001.
   (b) If 6l be the displacement of a pole P when small quan
tities of the second order are neglected, we have
            6i= k sin Pa sin Pa=£ sin Pa sin (Pa — aa),
              = k sin Pa (sin Pa + a - 180°),
              = — k sin Pa sin (Pa + a);
whence in the present instance
         0, = -598"-18 sin Pa sin (Pa + 18° 31' 38"-3).
   To show the displacements in various parts of the zone, the
values of 6t for poles at every 10° from a are given below :—
       Pa.                  Pa.        e,".   Pa.    9,".

        60     -507-69      120     -343 08   180      0
Perhaps the alteration of the angles in various parts of the
 zone is more clearly shown by taking the differences of the
above terms, and thus finding the variations of a series of
arcs each of which is initially 10° in length.
   We then have (still neglecting squares of small quantities) :—

       80-90        + 15-40               170-180         - 15-40
This table also serves as a numerical example of Prop. XI./,
which states that to this approximation the quantities in the
second and fourth columns are equal in magnitude but oppo
site in sign.
   To proceed to the next degree of approximation we must
calculate the value of the expression tan             cot Pa, and substi
tute in the formula
                        02 = 0! + tan 20! cot Pa.
   The smaller term calculated for every 10° is given in the
following table in seconds :—
       Pa. tan2 0, cot Pa.  Pa. tan2 6, cot Pa.    Pa. tan2 0, cot Pa.
                              O                      o
        18     +007          70      -t-O-68       130      -6-23
        20     +0-22         80      +0-29         140      -011
        30     +0-42         90        0           150      -003
        40     +0-62        100      -0-23         160        0
        50     +0-74        110      -0-34         170      -0-01
        60     +0-72        120      -0-33         180        0
   The second term is thus a positive maximum for a pole
 between 50° and 60°; a negative maximum for a pole between
 110° and 120°, and also for a pole between 160° and 180°;
 the largest maximum being the one first mentioned.
    We find from Prop. VIII. that the exact distances of these
 poles from a are respectively
          53° 49' 27"-2, 113° 49' 27"-2, 173° 49' 27"-2;
 and the largest maximum will be
                         j sin8 107° 38' 54"-4
                                 =0"-80.

 298      Mr. L. Fletcher on the Dilatation of Crystals
    The second term thus reaches a maximum value of only
 four-fifths of a second, and only exceeds half a second for
 poles in the small arc extending from 35° to 70° from a. The
 second term might thus, in the case of gypsum at least, be
 neglected in comparison with experimental errors.
    To find the exact positions of the lines of greatest and least
 expansion, assuming the measurements of the angles to be perfect.

 If T be the principal axis nearest to a, then, from Prop. IX.,
       tan (2Ta-«a)»        + *\ tan aa =x2171332 tan aa;
whence
                 2Ta-aa + 90°=283"-46,
and
                              Ta = 35° 46' 32"-58.
   To test the accuracy of the formulae we may calculate the
motions of T and Tj respectively relative to that of a.
   (a) For the motion of T,
0,= -598"-18 sin 35° 46' 32"-58 sin (35° 46' 32"-58 + 18° 31' 38"-3)
                           = -284"-000,

                          = +0"-54266;
whence the motion of T to the second order of small quantities
is 283"-457.
   (b) For tho motion of Tlf
     01 = _598"-18 sin 125° 46' 32"-58 sin (125° 46' 32"-58
        = -283-178,                              +18°31'38"-3)
0,-0, = tan20, cot T,a= -0"-28014;
whence the motion of T, to the second order of small quanti
ties is 283""458. T and Tj are therefore isotropic, and distant
90° from each other at both temperatures.
   We may remark that the values above deduced agree very
satisfactorily with Prop. IV., which states that the middle point

                     on Change of Temperature.                 299
of the arc traced out by T must be distant exactly 45° from
the point of bisection of the arc aot.
   To find the change at the second temperature in the mutual
inclinat ion of two planes which at the first temperature are per
pendicular to each otlier but inclined to the thermic axes at an
angle of 1° (Prop. VI.).
   If P, Q be the two planes,
            Pa = 36° 46' 32"-58, Qa = Pa + 90°. ,
   (a) For the motion of P,
      ^=-598"-18 sin 36° 46' 32"-58 sin 55° 18' 10"-88
         = -294"-438,
      tan20, cot Pa = +0-515080;
whence the motion of P is -293"-877.
   (b) For the motion of Q,
      01=-598"-18 sin 126° 46' 32"-58 sin 145° 18' 10"-88
         = -272"-740,
      tan2 0t cot Qa- -0"-26955 ;
whence the motion of Q is 273""010; and the change of incli
nation of P to Q is only 20"-867.
   If, then, we wish to find by trial a pair of planes which can
be proved by direct measurement of the angle between them
to retain their perpendicularity, a possible error of one second
in the measurement of the angle between the planes will lead
           ...          . 3600
to a possible error of .jij-w;* or 172-52 seconds in the deter
mination of the position of the pair of planes relative to the
given plane a.

whence the motion relative to a is only — 3"*4895. Hence
if we are given the plane a, and are required to find a plane «
which can be proved by direct measurement to bo equally
inclined to a at the two temperatures, a possible error of one
second in the measurement of the angle between the planes

 determination of the isotropic plane «.
    The last two numerical results serve to illustrate the diffi
 culty which would be experienced in attempting to determine
 by direct measurement whether two planes are absolutely or
 only approximately coincident with isotropic planes; in other
 words, whether or not two planes are permanently isotropic.
    The expansion 82 perpendicular to the plane of symmetry

where                 8j -8 = -0029001 ;

       Neumann's result is 0'004371.
   With the exception of Propositions IV. and XV., which re
quire the zone-plane to be a plane of symmetry, all the above
propositions are applicable not only to planes perpendicular to
a plane of symmetry, but to any zone of a crystal whatever the
system to which the crystal belongs; but it is clear that the
directions of the maximum and minimum expansions of the
crystal for lines lying in a given zone-plane are only those of
the principal expansions of the whole crystal when the zone-
plane is a plane of symmetry.

    XLII. The Law of Error.          By F. Y. Edgeworth*.
THE Law of Error is deducible from several hypotheses,
       of which the most important is that every measurable
(physical observation, statistical number, &c.) may be regarded
                  • Communicated by the Author.

           Mr. F. Y. Edgeworth on the Law of Error.              301
 as a function of an indefinite number of elements, each element
 being subject to a determinate, although not in general the
 same, law of facility. Starting from this hj'pothesis, I attempt,
first, to reach the usual conclusion by a path which, slightly
 diverging from the beaten road, may afford some interesting
 views ; secondly, to show that the exceptional cases in which
 that conclusion is not reached are more important than is
 commonly supposed.
    The first step is one taken by Mr. Glaisher*, enabling us
 to regard the compound error as a linear function of the inde
 finitely numerous elements. A second step is, after Laplace,
 to express the sought function as a particular term of a cer
 tain multiple. Let us suppose at first that the elemental
 facility-functions are all identical and symmetrical, involving
 only even powers of one and the same variable; say y =/{<?),
 where
                                        1.
                           -
 Then the sought expression, the ordinate of the curve under
 which the values of the compound error are ranged, say uz,
  (where x is the extent of error, and s the number of elements),
        SB
 is the -th term of the multiple

  Assuming such a tendency towards a limiting form that the
 effect of proceeding from the sth to the (« + l)th power is
 indefinitely small (for that part of the result, those values of

 And, if we may regard the last written expression as the ap
 propriate form of the sought function in x, then the condition
 of a facility-curve (that the integral between the extreme
 limits equal unity) will afford a differential equation to deter
 mine ^(s). The solution is -^r(li) = cv/7rv/s + A; where A is
 a constant which will be found to be zero. But I submit that
 the condition on which the differential equation for yjr is based
 is not in general valid; that, for instance, in some cases it
 would be proper to equate the truncated series of Poisson, not,
 as above, to

 the principle stated on page 304, which seems also to bar the
 parallel step* (from 1 — irx1 to e-"2-'1) in the ordinary method.

Here, if we may choose          at pleasure, we may, by choosing
it suitably, avail ourselves of the theorem given by Mr. Crofton
(Phil. Trans. 1870, p. 187), in whose steps we are now almost
treading. But, again, I submit that this procedure is in
general illegitimate; that$(.r) is not to be chosen at pleasure,
but so as to satisfy the condition
                            e« &0 (•)-/(«);
and that when / is hyper-exponential then the theorem of Mr.
Crofton does not apply.
    Subject to this limitation, the preceding proof of the law of
error may be extended to the case in which the component
element facility-curves are not identical (when <? is to be
regarded as a function of *, and for sc2 must be substituted
2c2, approximately §c2ds) and to unsymmetrical curves. By
taking account of quantities of the order        we may obtain a
second approximation to the law of error.
    There is another mode of dealing with equation (1) which
has the advantage of being applicable to those cases in which
 the mean powers of error are not finite. It begins by expand
ing the right-hand member in terms of x and neglecting
those above a certain order, and then proceeds somewhat as
follows:—Construct the form of the sought compound, partly
 by observing the initial tendency exhibited by the superim-
 position of two or three elements, and partly upon the prin
ciple that the compound has the same mean powers finite and
 infinite as the element, and a certain analogous theorem relating
                                 .IX
to mean exponentials, such as I e-z2f{z)dz. Having assumed
the form of the sought function, determine its constants by
 the differential equations presented by the conditions

multiplying the result by *), the absolute term of the average
is approximately equal to the absolute term of the element

still to be multiplied by \/>S but for the. factor | must be

absence of evidence to the contrary, that non-exponential laws
of error of the kind considered in example 2 do occur in rerum
naturd, that the " ancient solitary reign " of the exponential
law of error should come to an end, and that the received for
mula for the probable error of the average requires modifi
cation.
   This conclusion will be best confirmed by considering the
objections which may be brought against it.
    (1) There is, first, the direct appeal to experience—to regis
ters of observations, such as Airy has appended to his treatise.
I find that there is no difficulty in ranging under a curve of
the form /2 • P3            the observations which are registered
             -it Y* + ar
by Airy,or those which are given under the article "Moyenne"
in the ' Medical Cyclopaedia. Quetelet's statistics of conscripts
may be less accommodating; but the fact that the exponential
law of error is verified in one case does not prove that it is
universally true.
    In the sequel to this paper we shall be presented with an
instance of a non-exponential form, if not in nature, at least
in art—the art of measurement. The analogue in relation to
the law of error of that incident of the method of least squares
is the following:—Instead of the hypothesis with which we
started*, of determinate elemental facility-curves, suppose a
source of error consisting of a probability-curve with centre
fixed but modulus varying at random between certain limits.
Let there be taken an indefinite number of couples (or, mutatis
mutandis, triplets &c.) of observations. Select all the couples
which have the same difference, say b. Then the law of error for
the mean of those couples is non-exponential. I do not know,
however, that this method of selective generation has any exist
ence outside the sphere of art; and I notice it here chiefly for the
interest of the hypothesis of elements with varying modulus,
which in general leads to an (elemental) facility-function, not
indeed with finite mean powers, yet unfamiliar—for instance,
not at first sight included in the type given by DeMorgan
(Encycl. Metrop. § 88).
   (2) An appeal may bo made to a less specific experience,
namely the factf that groups of actual errors do possess finite
mean powers. But here the premises relate to actual facility-
curves, which have somehow, in coming into existence, lost the
tails attached to them by theory. The conclusion relates to
the tail of the typical ideal curve. It would be equally easy,
in the case of the orthodox curve, to name caudal properties
         * Above, page 301 .

(analogous to that of infinite mean powers) which, though
postulated by theory, are absent in fact. For instance, the
mean exponentials of the form I e+x* x <f> dx, where <f> is the
                                   %J — «
law of error, ought to be infinite for the probability-curve.
But in fact a finite cluster of points cannot present this infinity.
   (3) The objection may be transferred from experience about
(presumably) compound errors to assumption about elemental
errors. It seems sufficient to reply that, as the probable error
of a non-exponential facility-function may be made infini
tesimal, so an element of this type may become identical with
the received type to all intents and purposes, except indeed
that of generation. The body of the two forms may be sen
sibly identical ; what shape is to be (approximately) assigned
to the tail is a nice question of relative infinities, concerning
which, I suspect, not much is known.
   (4) In fine it may be objected that the non-exponential
curves are not reproductive in the same sense as the proba
bility-curve ; that the superposition of two curves of the
former kind does not result in a curve of the same type.
Whatever force there is in this objection is counteracted by
the remark that the property in question is shared by multi
tudes of forms other than the simple exponential—namely, all
of the tvpe

Whence it appears, by putting a =0, tha.t/(x) fulfils the con
dition that its integral between the extreme limits should be
unitv.   And it also fulfils the condition that          should bo
                                                     dx

compound curve is found to be

which, by putting a =« */3, we may reduce to the parent
type. The probable error of the average is that of the original
curve divided by s 7; not in general «*.              Which was
especially to be proved.

   So far we have taken for granted that the compound curve
does tend to a limiting form, that the average curve is less
dispersed than the original, on the strength of an unwritten
common sense, or unsymbolic reasoning, such as Mr. Venn, with
his usual clearness, has expressed in the chapter on the Method
of Least Squares in his ' Logic of Chance.' But in Chance, as
in other provinces of speculation which have been invaded by
mathematics, common sense must yield to symbol. The fact

that in the case of one particular curve, — ^j7^2> noticed by
Poisson, the average is neither more nor less dispersed than,
is the same as, the original, suggests that there may be forms
on the other side, so to speak, of this particular form. And
such, for instance, the form             r (x positive both ways)
                               4(l+«)»
is found to be; if the average of two curves be taken accordin
to the principle of page 305 (modified for the case of od
powers of the variable). This property of divergence, as it
may be termed, is even more clearly exhibited by the Laplace-
Poisson analysis, if in our adumbration of that analysis
(above, p. 307) we put I a positive fraction. In our second
paper it will be shown that the advantage of taking an average
depends upon the property that the integral I udx is for
                                                    Jo
every value of x greater in the case of the average than the
original curve. This property is now seen not to be universal.
   With some surprise I find that divergence is not confined
to curves all of whose mean powers are infinite. Take, for
example,
                         u= (l +1 .r)B    2
The absolute term of the compound of two is, by our method,
      f"      1     (n-1)2 J _         2      (n-1)*
     J-.(l + *r         4    dz-2n-lX           4 '
   The absolute term of the average is double this; that is, less
      n—1
than         the absolute term of the original.
   The preceding propositions have corollaries relating to the
hyperphysical applications of the Calculus of Probabilities.
   (1) The conclusion that a considerable department of the
Calculus of Probabilities, the calculation of probable errors, is
less arithmetically precise than is commonly supposed, is, if
correct, not unimportant; for the claims of the calculus to

be applied to the human sciences have been prejudiced by
its pretensions to arithmetical precision. The mathematical
forms of the science have been unnecessarily weighted with
numerical content. The logic of Mr. Venn is supposed to fall
with equal force on those who pretend to estimate numerically
evidence and inverse probability, and those who hold that the
entangled quantitative relations which are presented in this
as in other departments of the human sciences are best un
ravelled by the aid of symbols representative, not of number
indeed, yet of quantity. But if the extravagant pretensions
to numerical accuracy be abandoned, the moderate claim put
in for mathematical reasoning may be received with more
favour. If our First Part has shown that the calculation of
"probable error" is often not arithmetical, our Second Part
may show that the calculation of disadvantage is often mathe
matical.
   (2) The property of divergence in the average, in so far as
it is connected with extent of error in the individual, may be
looked for in moral measurements, which seem to admit of
more nearly infinite error than physical observations. Accord
ingly the process of taking a mean between different judgments
is not necessarily advantageous in the case of bad authorities.
By multiplying authorities we may go further and fare worse;
but in touching on the art of measurement we have already
reached our Second Part.

  the effect of the second term may be represented by the fric
  tion of a constant tension in the superficial layer. According
  to Laplace's theory, however, the first term K is enormously
  the greater; only, being the same at all points in the interior
  of the fluid, whatever may be the form of the boundary, it
  necessarily escapes direct observation.
     When two liquids are in contact the difference of pressures
  within them will still be of the form (1), but the values of K
  and H will depend upon the properties of both kinds of
  matter.
     The existence of an intense molecular pressure K is a ne
  cessary part of Laplace's, and probably of any similar, theory
  of these phenomena; but it has not met with universal accept
 ance*. The difficulty which has been felt appears to depend
  upon an omission in the theory as hitherto presented. Before
  we can speak of K as a molecular pressure proper to the liquid,
  it is necessary to show that the change, which we may denote
  by K13, experienced in passing the surface dividing liquid I.
  from liquid III. is identical with the sum of the changes de
 noted by Ku and Ks3; so that it makes no difference whether
 we pass from I. to III. directly or by way of II. That this
 should be the case upon Laplace's principles will be shown
 further on. The point, however, is so important that I pro
 pose to give in addition a proof of much wider generality, by
 which the relation is placed upon a sound basis. The exist
 ence of an intense internal pressure is probable for many
 reasons; and it is hoped that no further difficulty need be felt
 in admitting it as a legitimate hypothesis.
     Let us imagine different kinds
 of liquids, varying continuously                     A
 or discontinuously,to be arranged
 in plane strata, and let us examine
 the difference of pressure, due to                   P
 the attracting forces, at two points
 A and B, round each of which the                     q
 fluid is uniform to a distance ex- — ¦
ceeding the range of the forces.
The difference of pressure in
crossing any infinitely thin stra-                                —
turn at P is due to the forces
operative between P and all the other strata. The force be
tween one of the interior strata Q and P will depend upon the
thicknesses of the strata, upon the nature and condition of the
fluids composing them, and upon the distance PQ. But what-

  ever may be the law of the action in these respects, the force
  exerted by Q upon P must be absolutely the same as the force
  exerted by P upon Q. Now, as we pass downwards from A
  to B, every pair of elements between A and B comes into
  consideration twice. In passing through P we find an in
  crease of pressure due to the action of Q upon P, but in
  passing through Q we have an equal diminution of pressure
  due to the action of P upon Q. Along the whole path from
  A to B the only elements which can contribute to a final dif
  ference of pressure are those which lie outside, i. e. in the fluid
  above A and. below B. By hypothesis the action of the fluid
  above A on the strata traversed in going towards B ceases
  within the limits of the uniform fluid about A; and conse
  quently the whole difference of pressure duo, according to this
  way of treating the matter, to the fluid above A depends only
  upon the properties of A. In like manner the difference due
 to the fluid below B depends only upon the properties of Bj
 and we conclude that the whole difference of pressure due to
 the action of the forces along the path AB depends upon the
 properties of the fluids at A and B, and not upon the manner
 in which the transition between the two is made. In par
 ticular the difference is the same whether we pass direct from
 one to the other, or through an intermediate fluid of any pro
 perties whatsoever.
    It is evident that the enormous pressure which Laplace's
 theory indicates as prevalent in the interior of liquids cannot
 be submitted to any direct test. Capillary observations can
 neither prove nor disprove it. But it seems to have been
 thought that the relation
                        Ki3=Ki2 + K23                            (2)
implies a corresponding relation between the capillary con
stants
                        H13 = Hi2+H23;                           (3)
and the fact that (3) is inconsistent with observation is sup
posed to throw doubts upon (2). Indeed Mr. Riley*, in his
interesting remarks upon Capillary Phenomena, goes the
length of asserting that, according to Laplace, K is a function
of H. It is thus important to show that Laplace's principles,
even in their most restricted form, are consistent with the vio
lation of (3).
   In attempting calculations of this kind we must make some
assumption as to the forces in operation when more than one
kind of fluid is concerned. The simplest supposition is that

312                  Lord Rayleigh on Laplace's
the law of force between any two' elements is always the same,
<f>(r), as a function of the distance, and that the difference
between one fluid and another shows itself only in the inten
sity of the action. The coefficient proper to each fluid may
be called the " density," without meaning to imply that it has
any relation to inertia or weight. The force between two
elements (of unit volume) of fluids I. and II. may thus be
denoted by p^p2 <f>{r); that between two elements of the same
fluid by p2 <f>(r), or p\ #(r), as the case may be.
    We will first examine the forces operative in a fluid whose
density varies slowly, that is to say undergoes only a small
change in distances of the order of the range of the forces,
supposing, for simplicity, that the strata are surfaces of revolu
tion round the axis of z. The first step will be to form an
expression for the force at any point 0 on the axis.
   The direction of this force is evidently along z, and its
magnitude depends upon the variation of density in the neigh
bourhood of O. If the density were constant, there would be
no force. We may write

and that there is no term of the order of the capillary force.
 Equation (7) agrees with our general result that the difference
 of pressures required to equilibrate the forces operating be
 tween two points depends only upon the nature of the fluid at
 the final points; and it shows further that, under the more
 special suppositions upon which the present calculation pro
 ceeds, the molecular pressure at any point is to be regarded as
 proportional to the square of the density.
    But what is more particularly to be noticed is that, in spite
 of the curvature of the strata, there is no variation of pressure
 of the nature of the capillary force; from which we may infer
 that the existence of a capillary force is connected with sud
 denness of transition from one medium to another, and that it
 may disappear altogether when the transition is sufficiently
 gradual.
    For the further elucidation of this question we will now
 consider the problem of an abrupt transition. It does not
 appear that Laplace has anywhere investigated the forces
 operative at the common surface of two fluids of finite density,
 but the results given by him for a single fluid are easily ex
 tended.
     Let 0 A (equal to a) be the
 radius of a spherical mass of
 liquid of " density " p3, sur
  rounded by an indefinite quan
  tity of other fluid of density p1}
  and let us consider the varia
 tion of pressure along a line from a point (say 0) removed
  from the surface on one side to a point B also removed from
  the surface on the other side. The difference of pressure cor
  responding to each element of the path 0 B is found by mul
  tiplying the length of the element by the local density of the
  fluid and by the resultant attraction at the point.
     The attraction of the whole mass of fluid may be regarded

 314                Lord Kayleigh on Laplace's
 as due to an uninterrupted mass of infinite extent of density
 pi, and to a spherical mass OA of density (pi —Pi)- Since
 the first part can produce no effect at any part of 0 B, we have
 to deal merely with the attraction of the sphere 0 A.
    Laplace has shown that if 0 A were of unit density, its
 action along the line 0 A would be
                              K+ =
                                   a
 where
                    /iod                   r* CO
           K = 2tt| ^(r)dr,        H = 2ir j ry(r(r)dr; . .      (8)
 while along A B its action would be
                             K-H-
 The loss of pressure in going outwards from 0 to A is thus
                         (p2-Pl)Pl (k+1);
and from A to B,
Accordingly the whole difference of pressure between 0 and
 B is
                         K(pI-p?)+f(p2-Pl)2                     (9)
Thus, in addition to the former result that the difference of
pressure independent of curvature varies as (p*—             we see
that .the capillary pressure, proportional to the curvature,
varies as (p2—pi)2.
   The reasoning just given is in fact little more than an ex
pansion of that of Young*. If the effect depends only upon
the difference of densities, it cannot fail to be proportional to
0>2-f>i)2.
   Writing H12=H(p1— p3) , we see that there is no reason
whatever for supposing that the capillary constants of three
liquids should be subject to the relation
                          H13=H12 + H23.
On the contrary, the relation to be expected, if the supposi
tions at the basis of the present calculations agree with reality,
is                  ^Hu=i/Hu+^HM                               (10)

In (10) the three radicals are supposed to be positive, and H13
is the greatest.
   If we suppose that the third fluid is air, and put ^3=0, we
have
                    */H11=>/H1-N/Hs,                          (11)

   The reason why the capillary force should disappear when
the transition between two liquids is sufficiently gradual will
now be evident. Suppose that the transition from 0 to p is
made in two equal steps, the thickness of the intermediate
layer of density \p being large compared to the range of the
molecular forces, but small in comparison with the radius of
curvature. At each step the difference of capillary pressure
is only \ of that due to the sudden transition from 0 to p,
and thus altogether half the effect is lost by the interposition
of the layer. If there were three equal steps, the effect would
be reduced to one third, and so on. When the number of
steps is infinite, the capillary pressure disappears altogether.
    Although the relation (12) is given by Quincke* as the
result of experiment, the numerical values found by him do
not agree with (11). In most cases the tension at the common
surface of two liquids exceeds that calculated from the sepa
 rate tensions in contact with air. This result, which must be
 considered to disprove the applicability of our special hypo
theses, need not much surprise us. There was really no ground
 for the assumption that the law of force is always the same
 with the exception of a constant multiplier. The action of
 one fluid upon another might follow an altogether different
 law from its action upon itself. Besides this we are not en
 titled to assume that a fluid retains its properties close to the
 surface of contact with another fluid. Even if the hypothesis,
which would refer every thing to a difference of " densities,"
 were correct, its application would be rendered uncertain by
any modifications which the contiguous layers of different
liquids might impose upon one another. As we have seen, if
this modification were of the nature of making the transition
less abrupt, the capillary forces would be thereby diminished.

rPHE aim of this book, as given in the preface, is to assist
       amateurs and those who are engaged in electrical engineering
by throwing together in a convenient form for reference the
formulae connected with its various branches, and the guiding
principles underlying the various operations that an electrician
may find himself called on to conduct. It is designed, in short, as
a practical handbook on electrical subjects.
   The first part treats of the definitions and general laws of
electricity and magnetism. It may be noted that the custom of
English writers is followed in naming the poles of a magnet, the
north pole being the north-seeking pole of the magnet. The
second part treats of units, and contains several useful tables, such
as are to be found in the " Report of the Committee on Electrical
Standards appointed by the British Association," and in ' Illus
trations of the C.Gr.S. System of Units ' by Professor Everett.
Among the units is included the " watt," which, however, is taken
to be an amount of work and not a rate of working. This is not
the meaning attached to the watt by its originator. It is to be
hoped no confusion will arise as to the meaning of this convenient
term, for it would be a pity if, after its use had become general, it
had to bo abandoned to avoid ambiguity, as in the case of the
" weber."
   Brief descriptions of various forms of apparatus and methods
employed in making electrical measurements form the third part
of the book. This contains diagrams of the various circuits
employed in the ordinary tests ; and it may be noted that the con
ventional sign here used for a battery is just the reverse of that
ordinarily employed in English text-books. The fourth part,
comprising nearly half the book, treats of applications of electricity
to useful purposes, and gives some accounts of the results already
achieved. Details such as algebraical and trigonometrical formula,
specific gravities, resistances of metals and alloys, &c. &c, which
are frequently required in practical work, are presented in a
tabular form, and the values of various quantities (such as the
E.M.F. of cells, accumulators, and thermopiles) are duly recorded.
Probably the sections dealing with generators and motors will be
found of considerable interest, giving as they do in a tabular form
the results claimed for various machines. The concluding pages
of this part treat very briefly of telegraphy and telephony : this
portion of the work might well be amplified, and illustrated with
diagrams of the circuits in common use, in a future edition.

      ON PROFESSOR LANGLEY'S " SELECTIVE ABSORPTION."
                            BY C. H. KOYL*.
 TOURING- a series of years, beginning with 1859, Prof. Tyndall
     carried on experiments which demonstrated the great absorptive
power of water, carbonic dioxide, and the vapour of water in the
infra-red region of the spectrum, and which also demonstrated the
non -absorptive character of these substances in the visible parts.
Other investigators have, almost without exception, arrived at the
same conclusions ; and it now appears beyond dispute that pure
water with its vapour and pure carbonic dioxide deeply absorb the
long-wave rays, but exercise little influence upon the shorter. The
 same series of experiments proves also that dry oxygen and dry
nitrogen, either singly or mixed, are almost without effect upon any
part of the spectrum.
   Our atmosphere is composed principally of oxygen, nitrogen,
watery vapour, and carbonic dioxide. It follows, then, that when
there are not clouds or suspended haze the sky may be, as far as
pure absorption is concerned, almost perfectly transparent to the
visible rays of solar energy, but to the longer waves opaque, to a
degree dependent upon the amount of dissolved aqueous vapour.
   Until within a short time actual experiments upon the absorption
of the earth's atmosphere as a whole have been of little value because
of deficient apparatus ; but since the invention and application to
this work of the bolometer by Prof. Langley, we are able to arrive
at approximate results. In his late paper he shows that the ratios
of energy in different wave-lengths stopped by our atmosphere are
not by any means such as we should expect from the laboratory
experiments above mentioned, but that if e', e", e'" represent the
amounts of energy transmitted, (e') to our atmosphere, (e") through
it on a clear day with a noon sun, and (e'") with a low sun, the
ratios will be about as follows for three representative wave-lengths,
in the ultra-violet, in the green, and in the infra-red :—

of long-wave energy is transmitted at low sun, only about 8 per

 cent, of short-wave radiation reaches us under similar circumstances.
 The intermediate rays are transmitted iu amounts proportional to
 some direct function of the wave-length. It seems almost certain,
 from Tyndall's experiments above quoted, that these short waves
 are not absorbed in the ordinary acceptation of the term. What
 then becomes of them ?
    In 1869 Tyndall demonstrated that if ordinary light fall upon a
 cloud of suspended matter in sufficiently great subdivision, the long
 waves pass through unhindered, while the blue are reflected ; and
 from this he deduced an explanation of the colour of the sky. In
 1880 I published a brief paper experimentally extending these
 results to ordinary coatings of oxides of the metals projected upon
charcoal by a blowpipe-flame. From these it was shown that an
 oxide in thin layers might reflect only a beautiful blue ; that if the
 coating naturally absorbed blue, it reflected in preponderance in
 thin layers the next longer wave-length ; and that, in fact, the
 amount and character of reflection depended upon the size of
 particles and thickness of layer. No quantitative measurements
 were made ; but from the magnificent character of the blues obtained,
 I concluded that nearly all the incident light of that wave-length
 was reflected. Applying this theory to the sky, we have an expla
 nation not only of its blue colour and of its sunset tints, but also
of Prof. Langley's results that through the lower air, fidl of these
 floating particles, the rays of shorter wave-length do not penetrate.
It is not selective absorption ; it is selective reflection.—Johns

ON TI1E RECIPROCAL EXCITATION OF ELASTIC BODIES TUNED TO
           NEARLY THE SAME PITCH. BY DR. G. KREBS.
   When two strings tuned perfectly alike are stretched upon the
same monochord, it is well known that each is capable of causing
the other to vibrate with it. The same is true of tw o tuning-forks
of exactly the same pitch placed opposite each other on two reso
nators.
   But if the pitch of two strings is not exactly the same, the
deeper-toned one can excite the higher, but not the higher-toned
one the lower, provided that the difference between the numbers of
vibrations amounts to at least 2 or 3, at most 3 or 4.
   Conviction of this is obtained when the strings are first brought to
exactly the same pitch, and then the tension of one of them some
what relaxed : if now one of the strings be struck or pulled in the
middle with the finger, after a paper rider has been placed on the
other, it can be distinctly seen that the rider leaps from the higher-
toned string if the difference of the numbers of vibrations amounts
to 3 or 4, while, conversely, the rider upon the deeper-toned string
remains almost unmoved when the higher-toned is struck.
   If the difference of the numbers of vibrations amounts not to 2,
each string is in a condition to excite the other; but the deeper

             Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.              319
toned is observed to act more powerfully on the higher than vice
versa.
   For a counterproof, the string which just now was the lower can
be stretched more strongly, so that it becomes the higher, &c.
   The limits of the excitability moreover follow the length, thick
ness, and tension. With short, thick, strongly stretched strings
the limit of excitability of the higher by the deeper-toned lies at a
difference of 1 or 2 vibrations in a second.
   With tuning-forks, particularly those with short thick prongs,
the difference of the numbers of vibrations must not amount to 1,
if the deeper-toned is to be able to excite the higher. It was,
however, on tuning-forks that I first observed the phenomenon. I
had two forks upon equal resonators, which were said to have
exactly the same pitch. I placed them over against one another,
and struck one of them, when the other did not sound with it ; but
when I struck the other, the first replied very audibly. Having
found out which of the two forks gave the higher tone, I loaded
one of its prongs with a little wax, and, by repeated alteration of the
loading, easily arranged so that each fork was in a condition to
excite the other with equal force. I now augmented the load of
the originally higher-toned fork, and found that now this could
excite the other, but not vice versa".—Wiedemann's Annalen, xix.

                 ELEVATED CORAL REEFS OF CUBA.
                          BY W. O. CROSBY*.
   Mr. Crosby describes in this paper the elevated coral reefs of Cuba,
and draws from them the apparently well-sustained conclusion that
they indicate a slow subsidence during their formation, and hence,
further, that Darwin's theory of the origin of coral islands is the
true theory. The lowest reef-terrace of the northern side of the
island has a height of 30 feet, and varies in width from a few rods
to a mile ; it was once plainly the fringing reef of the shore. The
second reef-terrace rises abruptly from the level of the lower to a
height of 200 to 250 feet, and bears evidence of having been of like
origin with the lower. The altitude of the third reef is about 500
feet ; and the fourth has a height east of Baracoa, near the Yumuri
River, " of probably not less than 800 feet." These old reef-
terraces extend, "with slight interruptions, around the entire coast
of Cuba ; and in the western part of the island, where the erosion
is less rapid than further east, they are the predominant formation,
and they are well preserved on the summits of the highest hills.
Mr. Alexander Agassiz states that the hills about Havanna and
Matanzas, which reach a height of over 200 feet, are entirely com
posed of reef-limestone."
   In the precipitous mountain called El Yunque (the Anvil), five
miles west of Baracoa, reef-limestone, 1000 feet thick, constitutes
the upper half of the mountain, the lower part, on which the reef
rests, consisting of eruptive rocks and slates : and originally the
upper limit of this modern limestone formation must have been
                     * Proc. Boston Soc. Nat. Hist

2000 feet above the sea-level. Mr. Sawkins gives 2000 feet as
the maximum thickness of the Jamaica elevated coral reefs above
the sea.
   Evidence that the reefs were not formed during a progressive
rising of the land is drawn from the thickness of the reefs. Mr.
Crosby observes that the reefs reaching to a height of 500 and
1000 feet, if not also to that of 2000 feet, show, by the remains
within them, that they were made chiefly of reef-building corals,
and hence that they were not begun in deep water, as is assumed
in the theory of Mr. Agassiz, but that they were made in shallow
water during a progressive subsidence. Mr. Crosby concludes as
follows :—
   " We have then apparently no recourse but to accept Darwin's
theory as an adequate explanation of the elevated reefs of the
Greater Antilles, and therefore to admit that the upheaval of this
portion of the earth's crust has been interrupted by periods of
profound subsidence during which the reefs were formed. The
subsidence of 2000 feet, of which El Yunque is a monument,
must have reduced the Greater Antilles to a few Hues of small
but high and rugged islands ; and, as Mr. Bland has shown, this
fully accounts for the absence in these immense tracts of all large
animals, although they were abundant here in Pliocene and earlier
times."
   The writer adds here the following objections to the theory of
the formation of coral atolls in deep waters out of the calcareous
secretions of deep-water life :—(1) It is very improbable that sub
marine eruptions ever make the large and well-defined craters,
like those of subaerial action, which are appealed to in order to
explain the lagoon feature of atolls : (2) Many coral atolls are
twenty miles or more in diameter, which is vastly larger than
the largest of craters ; (3) The atolls are never circular, and the
larger have the irre-gularities of outline or diversities of form cha
racterizing other large islands of the ocean; (4) In the actual reefs
and islands of the Feejee group (see the map of the islands in the
 writer's ' Corals and Coral Islands ') all the conditions, from the
first stage to that of the almost completed atoll, are well illustrated,
one island having only a single peak of rock within the lagoon,
 not y^j- of the whole area, which a little more of subsidence
 would put beneath the waters and leave the lagoon wholly free.—

 § 1. JOATH-DENSITY.—For some years past I have
              been trying to make clear to myself and others
the idea of path-density as distinguished from ordinary den
sity. One is reluctant to introduce new conceptions into
science unless they are called for by existing known facts, or
unless they suggest the existence of unknown ones. The
idea of path-density arose from the attempt to get an insight
into the condition of the common surface of two media, and
especially of that imperfectly understood condition of the
surface of liquid masses, known as Surface-tension or Skin,
The connexion between path-density and surface-tension will
be shown in §§ 13, 14.
   § 2. If a given mass of matter alters its volume, it thereby
alters its density. If a point or minute piece of matter which
weighs a gram were to swell to the size of a cube centimeter,
or if a cube yard of matter weighing a gramf were to shrink
to the size of a cube centimeter, matter of unit density would

be obtained (water at 4° C).      Expressed generally,
                              D= M
                                    V
    § 3. (a) A cube centimeter of water at 4° C. moves in a
straight line at right angles to one of its faces at a uniform
rate of 1 centimeter in 1 second. It traces out a path of unit
density. This conception is perhaps put into a more useful
form: (/3) A square centimeter of surface having the mass of 1
gram moves at the rate of 1 centimeter a second ; its path is of
unit density. The thickness of the surface is here nothing,
and its density is infinite. More generally: (7) Unit path-
density is made when a plane surface of area - centimeter,
weighing - gram, moves with uniform velocity.
    Perhaps this is clearer if we imagine an infinite series of
square centimeter-gram-surfaces following one another at
equal intervals of 1 centimeter apart, and moving at any velo
city along a straight path at right angles to them. Then any
cubic centimeter of such an infinite path will weigh 1 gram.
    Returning to concrete examples: —
    If Pd denote path-density,
       8 denote density (specific gravity),
       I denote the thickness in direction of motion (centimeter),
       r denote rate (centimeter-second);
then                        Pd=—                                (1)
                                    r                           K '
    § 4. The few following obvioUs deductions may serve as
illustrations.   Pd=B when - =1; that is, when the space
passed over by any point of the moving mass in a unit of
time is the same as the length of the matter which passes
through that point when the point is at rest. In other words,
there must be no gaps. Moving continuous matter has a
path of the same density as the matter itself.
    § 5. If the mass be at rest, the expression (1) becomes
Pd=^—, which, though of ambiguous form, here means
that Pd=S. The two O's are equal, having been derived from
rational diminution of I and r. The same is true if r and /
are both infinite.
    It is clear, but must be especially noted, That the ratio
between the path-densities Ydai and Pda , is the same wliether
those paths are generated by the single transit (in an eternity) of
tlie masses Aj and A3 moving at the rates rj and rs respectively:

                        Molecular Constants.                           323
or by an endless succession of masses Aj moving at the rate Tj at
a distance d apart, and an endless succession of masses At
moving at the rate rs at the same distance d apart : or by the
same masses Ax and A2 returning at equal intervals with the
velocities rt and r3.
    These statements may be illustrated as follows:—Let there
be (Plate IV. fig. 1) an annular tube b of 12 cub. centim.
capacity, and let there be 1 cub. centim. of water at a. At
whatever rate a may pass round b, the density of the path is
the same, namely x\2. If it move round at the rate of once
in a second, let its path-density be Yd. If, now, it moves round
n times in a second, then in expression (1) r becomes nr, and
 I becomes nl; so that Yd remains unchanged.
    Again, if the tube b be doubled in length, the path-density
will bo halved at whatever rate a may move.
    § 6. When an irregularly* shaped mass of uniform density
moves with uniform velocity in a straight line, the path is of
uniform density longitudinally but varies in density trans
versely (like a sword-stick).
    Taking the case of a triangle moving on its base (fig. 2,
PI. IV.), we have at once
                              Yda_a
                              Yd„ b'
   The distances a and b are here indeed nothing more than
the expression I in § 3, equation (1).
    § 7. If / be constant, that is if the moving matter have
equal thickness all over in the direction of its motion, varia
tion in density at different parts will of course produce corre
sponding and proportional variation in the path-density.
    It follows that a heavy sector of a circle of unit density
revolving about the centre of the circle will give rise to a path
which is of uniform density, and whose density is a . p, if 8 be
                                                           oou
the angle of the sector. The shadow of such a disk is uni
formly dense or the moving disk is equally transparent to light.
    If a heavy line revolve about one of its ends, the density of
the path, which is a circular surface, varies inversely with the
distance from the centre. The shadow of such a revolving lino
(or narrow strip) varies in density according to the same rule.
    § 8. The path-density of a heavy plane moving parallel to
itself, as in § 3 {ft), but inclined to its path at an angle 6, is
—- q , if Yd be, as before, the path-density, when the plane is at
   * Any shape excepting a prism having parallel back and front faces.

324                 Frederick Guthrio on certain
right angles to the path. The sectional area of the path is of
course proportionally less, being sin 8.
   § 9. Path-mass.—For unit of path-mass it will be conve
nient to take the same conditions of motion as before (§ 3),
namely, a square gram-centimeter moving at the rate of
1 centimeter in 1 second at right angles to itself.
   If two such plates follow one another in a second, the path-
density and the path-mass are both doubled. If they are
placed edge to edge in one plane and move with the unit
velocity, their path-mass will be doubled. For the path has
the unit density but double the volume of that generated by
the single square. Just as in ordinary mass we have
                            M = SV
(where M = mass, S = density, and V = volume), so here we
have
                           P»=VPi.
   Of course, if the path be maintained at uniform density by
the passage of successive surfaces, the total mass will be infinite.
But the mass per unit length is proportional to the sectional
area of the path at right angles to it. And this is the case
when a finite path is maintained at constant density by the
to-and-fro motion of the surface or by its orbital return, as
in § 5.
   § 10. However a mass of matter may rotate, however irre
gular it may be in shape or density, however it may change
its shape or density, and whatever may be its velocity or change
of velocity, its total path-mass is constant for the same time-
interval provided onlv its mass remains the same.
   § 11. If the earth's orbit be 300,000,000 kilometers in dia
meter (a little more than 186,000,000 miles) and its diameter
be 8000 miles, the height of a cylinder having the same volume
as the earth and the same diameter is 5333 miles, or 8580"797
kilometers. It therefore appears that the mean orbit-density
of the earth is 7-761 times the specific gravity of the earth,
or, say, about 39 or 40.
   § 12. If a single moving atom were enclosed in a box of
fixed internal dimensions, the mean density of the gas con
structed by it would be constant, however the atom might
move. But if the atom move to and fro between opposite
walls with acceleration, say harmonically, its path will be
denser at its extremities and densest at the walls according to
the law of sines, or as though the material area between a
semicircle and its tangent had been compressed upon the tan
gent (fig. 3).
   § 13. The increased path-density caused by the retardation

                        Molecular Constants.                   325
  of solid matter towards the end of its harmonic excursions
  is visible with a vibrating rod whose excursions are many
  times longer than its thickness. Better with a long mono-
  chord wire. The shadow of such a wire shows most distinctly
  the increased path-density at its edges when it vibrates in a
  plane at right angles to the light. If such a cord be made to
  vibrate in a circular path, or if an upright rod be fastened ex-
  centrically to the top of a humming-top, the shadow is also
 graduated, being densest at the edges. Here we have really
  of course the projection of a circular path of uniform density
 on a tangent to the circle, precisely as in § 12. The vibrating
 solids have skins.
     § 14. The hypothesis which I submit, and which is quite
 independent of the facts of the preceding paragraphs, is
 briefly that, when a mass of liquid has a free surface, while
 the internal particles have paths more or less free, those that
 strike the bounding surface never have free paths unless they
strike it at such angles as enable them to escape as vapour. They
 are momentarily at rest; and however small and elastic (in
 regard to the surface) they may be, they form a dynamic (ever
 renewed) skin, which in its turn acts as a check upon the pass
ing particles, delays them, and so thickens their crowd.
     There is accordingly at all such surfaces an increased den
 sity- due to diminished mean velocity; and it is this increased
 density which forms the so-called surface-tension or skin.
 Gases and vapours should have such skins at the bounding
 surface between themselves and liquids and solids; and perhaps
 it is for this reason that a solid has the power of what is vir
tually condensing a gas, even sometimes to liquefaction, upon
its surface.
    § 15. Liquid Slabs.—Whether or not the hypothesis in § 14
as to the cause of surface-tension be correct, and whether or
not the terms surface-tension or skin be either of them satis
factory, it is convenient to adopt some such expression for the
apparent toughness of the surfaces of liquids. When a little
liquid is poured upon a flat horizontal surface which is not
attacked by the liquid, a circular disk of liquid is formed, the
shape of the edge of which has been very fully examined by
Quincke and others. In most such cases, one of the most
important factors is the specific relationship in the sense of
adhesion between the solid and the liquid. In fact the ques
tion, like all questions of capillarity, involves density (and
gravitation), cohesion, adhesion, and surface-tension. Such
experiments show the relationship between two bodies as well
as the physical attributes of one. About twenty years ago I
made an attempt to get rid of the factor adhesion, with partial

326                 Frederick Guthrie on certain
success, by examining the size of a liquid drop. But I soon
found that other factors, notably the shape of the solid bodies
from which the dropping occurred, and the rate of dropping,
introduced arbitrary conditions which removed the measure
ments from the class of simple physical constants.
    § 16. The plan adopted in the following experiments is the
endeavour to support a mass of liquid above a plane surface
in such a way that no actual contact ensues, not even such as
takes place between clean glass and mercury. If such can
be done, it is clear that we shall have a circular flat slab with
 rounded edges, and into the shape of that slab the influence
 of adhesion by no means enters. If the thickness of the slab
 be found to be a constant, we shall have a constant as charac
teristic as density, and, like density, varying for the same
mass only according to volume, such volume-change in our
 case being brought about by heat alone. Such slab-thickness
has for its negative influence the action of gravity (density),
 for its positive the cohesion and surface-tension.
     § 17. The actual measurements of the slab-thickness I have
 performed in two Wiiys:—(1) by a spherimeter which, when
 used as such, gives results trustworthy to the yooW of an inch.
 But the upper of the two surfaces whose distance has to be
 measured being liquid, and the lower one not very hard, the
spherimeter cannot be used by the method of touch. Accord
 ingly I have measured the slab-thickness indirectly. A known
 volume of the liquid is poured on the surface, and teased into
 the circular form if it shows any noticeable departures from it.
 Four or five diameters are measured by means of a small hori
 zontal cathetometer. The mean being taken, an allowance
 has to be made for the meniscus. This reduces the shape to
 the cylindrical, from which the thickness h is deduced by
 means of the equation
     § 18. In regard to the actual apparatus:—Upon a thick
 round slab of paraffin, a foot in diameter and 4 inches thick,
 a massive foot of plaster is cast. The whole is placed on
 a three-screw levelling support. The surface of the paraffin
 is scraped into a true plane. When water was being exa
 mined, the surface of the paraffin was lightly powdered with
 lycopodium and the water poured on vertically from a fine
 opening. With some care a perfectly round slab of water
  6 inches in diameter can be formed, which is so free to move
 that the greatest nicety of adjustment in the levelling-screws
  is necessary. Precisely the same arrangement can be adopted

                      Molecular Constants.                    327
for mercury. But it was found that for the latter liquid a
sheet of blotting-paper wetted and allowed to dry on a sheet
of plate-glass gave results identical with those of the paraffin
surface. The paper surface was used in some of the expe
riments. As to the allowance for the meniscus, it is clear
that this is of less consequence with large slabs than with
small ones. Indeed, with slabs a few inches in diameter the
meniscus might be neglected. This was imperfectly shown
in the case of mercury by adding exactly equal volumes to a
small slab. After the slab had passed 2 inches in diameter,
each additional volume produced a " parabolic " increase in
the diameter. Data derived from this and from the mea
surement of an enlarged photograph of the edge gave me
as a mean 2 millim. to be deducted from the diameter in the
case of mercury. Assuming it to be the same for water,
the error incurred, after making this reduction, could not
in a 6-inch slab be more than             of the diameter. This
would be negligible in the deduced thickness.
   § 19. I give the following datum for mercury on account
of the accidental coincidence of the experimental numbers
with numbers easy of remembrance, excepting as to the tem
perature, which is, however, not far from the conventional
temperature of 60° F.
   100 cub. centim. of mercury at 14° C. has an extreme
radius of 100 millim.
                         ,     100,000
                             3-1416 x 992?
thickness of mercury slab = 3*248 millim.
   In the case of water it was found so difficult to get a nearly
circular slab with 100 cub. centim., that only 50 were em
ployed. The slab may then be teased into a circular form by
means of a stick of paraffin covered with lycopodium.
   50 cub. centim. of water at 14° C. has an extreme radius of
54-8 millim.
                       ,       50,000
                           3-1416 x (53-8)25
thickness =5-50 millim.
   Glycerine" is a beautiful liquid in this respect. It is kept
off from the paraffin surface by a very faint blush of lycopo
dium, and it travels very slowly. It can be got into a circular
slab more easily than water; but, perhaps on account of its
capillary action towards its lycopodium props, it is more per
sistent in its motion. In fact, unless there be hills of that sub-
                      * Commercial, "Price's."

328                  Frederick Guthrie on certain
stance to confront it, it rolls along (for that is the motion of a
slab however large) and forms a " level," which requires a very
steady support to avoid the notion that its motion is affected
by the gravity of the observer.
   50 cub. centim. of glycerine at 14° C. has an extreme radius
of 59 millim.
                          ,       50,000
                           1 3-1416 x (58)'i;
thickness =4,731 millim.
    § 20. Accordingly, taking the slab thickness of water as
unity, we may begin a table which will at some future time
assuredly be extended.
                 Specific Slab-thickness (at 14° C).
                         Water . =1-0000,
                         Glycerine =0-8002,
                         Mercury =0-5906.
    These numbers may be, with instruction, considered in re
 ference to the numbers in table vii. which concern the drop
 sizes of the same three liquids in the ' Proceedings of the Royal
 Society,' 1864, p. 17 [" Recess "]. It will, I have no doubt,
 appear that in all cases the greater the drop-size the greater the
 slab-thickness. Water will, no doubt, again assert its singu
 larity and exhibit the greatest slab-thickness.
    § 21. Restrained as slabs are in their form by skin-tension
 as well as cohesion, it is found that the addition of a liquid
 which diminishes the former diminishes also the slab-thick
 ness. Taking 25 cub. centim. of water at 14° C, a slab
 was formed having 38 millim. corrected radius. This gives
 a thickness of 5*51 millim. Such a slab is unchanged if
 touched in the middle by a drop of glycerine. But on touch
 ing it with " glacial " acetic acid, it instantly acquires a cor
 rected radius of 44 millim., or thickness of 4-16 millim. This
 means a diminution in thickness of very nearly 25 per cent.,
 or one quarter. The question therefore presented itself, What
 is the slab-thickness of " glacial " acetic acid ?
    I reserve the results of my experiments in the direction of
 the relationship between the liquids and the alteration of skin-
 tension.
     § 22. The mercury slab, like the water slab, has what vir
 tually amounts to a skin; and it became interesting to exa
 mine the conditions of this skin or region of surface-tension.
 If lycopodium be strewn upon the surface of a mercury slab, and
 a little tin, zinc, or lead, or amalgam of these metals, bo made
 to touch the slab in the middle, no noticeable disturbance
 takes place. But if such a slab be touched by an amalgam

                       Molecular Constants.                    329
of K or Na, the slab instantly expands, and the film of lyco-
podium- powder on its surface cracks radially, exposing the
brilliant metallic surface, which is seen to be agitated over its
whole extent. In a few seconds the slab contracts to its ori
ginal size and the lycopodium cracks heal.
    Does this extension of the slab depend upon the diminu
tion of the cohesion of the mass of the mercury, or upon a
surface effect?
    § 23. I frequently in my researches have had recourse to
the fact, which I first described in the year 1863, that a little
sodium added to mercury enables that metal to touch with
 positive capillarity metals which in its and their ordinary
state are not wetted by the liquid metal. I here make use of
the same fact. A platinum tube, 6 millim. in internal dia
meter and 2 centim. in height, is rubbed and soaked in some
weak sodium amalgam, and then washed in several quan
tities of pure mercury. Placing such a tube vertically in the
middle of a slab of mercury so that its lower edge is clear
of the surface upon which the mercury slab rests, we have
 the condition shown in fig. 4. A little grain of sodium
 amalgam dropped into the platinum tube causes no imme
 diate change; but in a time measurable by seconds, say 20
 to 30 seconds, the slab starts on its expansion and reaches
 its maximum size, apparently immediately. It seems, then,
 that since the effect is not instantaneous, it is a surface effect.
 The effect when produced is due to an alteration of the surface
 between the tube and the outer portion of the slab. By
 dipping the platinum tube further down into the slab so as to
 be within       of an inch of the bottom, I have found the effect
 to be distinctly delayed.
    § 24. The fact mentioned in § 23, that the release of the
 mercury skin-tension by sodium is brought about after a time,
 short indeed, but appreciable when introduced into the central
 part of a liquid slab inside the platinum tube, points to the
 existence of a true diffusion between the metals; and this leads
 to the third part of this communication. For I have exa
 mined already a few such cases, which I will now describe,
 because I believe the subject of elementary diffusion has been
 neglected excepting in the case of gases, and even here but
 little is really known.
     § 25. Metallic Diffusion.—The metals potassium and sodium
 suggested themselves of course at once. They offer excep
 tional facilities for the determination of the composition of the
 mixture, when they have diffused through mercury, because
 the mere addition of water translates the alkaline metal into
 hydrogen. The neutralization of the alkalized water, say, by

330                 Frederick Guthrie on certain
hydrochloric acid, and subsequent evaporization and weighing,
give a control upon the hydrogen translation of the alka
line metal. The mercury is thereupon left nearly ready for
weighing.
   On the other hand, I have not yet been able to establish a
column of mercury having an unlimited stock of pure cold
alkaline metal above pure mercury at the same temperature
below. I do not see the possibility of it. Granted that
when such metals as tin, or lead, or gold, or silver dissolve
in mercury heat may move, such movement of heat is,
I should think, swamped in its power of causing convec
tion-currents by the conductivity of the mass. But in the
case of the alkaline metals the first contact of the two
metals is accompanied by so much heat that the condi
tions obtainable with other metals are here far more difficult.
Perhaps mercury and sodium brought into contact at a tem
perature far below the freezing-point of mercury might give
the required starting-point. If their contact were real and
the elevation of temperature very gradual and well controlled,
we might have a trustworthy condition ; but scarcely at a
single temperature.
    Such a condition would represent a certain fixed sodium
potential (not infinite, because the sodium has to be disin
tegrated), on the one hand, and a lower, but not zero, on the
other; and between the two the integral of the resistances
of the various amalgams after the first contact.
    § 26. This being so, I elected to employ sodium amalgam
and potassium amalgam rather than the free metals.
    On mixing sodium with mercury, the two combine with
 great energy and liberate so much heat as to point to a
loss of volume. Is this loss of volume, if it take place under
 any circumstance, so great as to give rise to an amalgam
 having a greater density than mercury itself?
    If ^ be the density of mercury and ^ that of sodium,
 and if t>8 be the volume of the amalgam, then the density of
 the amalgam would be equal to that of the mercury, if
                          wij + wij _ ml
                                 V     mi/
 If »3 should be less than this for any ratio between the con
 stituents, the convection-currents of sodium would at all
 events begin to flow down if such an amalgam were at the top
 of the mercurial column.

                      Molecular Constants.                   331
   On this point, without making a study of the specific
gravity of alloys of sodium of different strengths, I have satis
fied myself that, as long as the amalgam is liquid, it is lighter
than mercury. This is easily shown by introducing mercury
into one limb and the various liquid amalgams of sodium into
the other limb of a long U-tube: whereupon the pure mercury
always prevails in weight. Now when a solid amalgam of
sodium is brought into contact with mercury, heat may be
either set free or absorbed. Chemists will understand me if I
remind them that a pounds of water mixed with b pounds of
chloride of calcium will give a body which will set free or
absorb heat according as a is greater or less than x.
    §27. Accordingly I made a pound or two of a sodium amal
gam of such a strength as to be solid at the atmospheric tem
perature. This was beaten up in an iron mortar as it cooled.
Putting some of this into a porcelain crucible, plunging it into
 water containing a few drops of hydrochloric acid, and collect
ing the hydrogen, it was found that after a day or two, if the
amalgam was occasionally stirred, all evolution of hydrogen
 ceased; the volumes, reduced to dry hydrogen at 0 C. and
 760 millim., were i Jjjg j" cu^- centim- The mercury, after
drying, was found to weigh j^g^- This gives the per
 centage of the amalgam which I shall call Am amalgam: —

    The ideal amalgam would perhaps be one of such a compo
 sition that heat would neither be set free nor absorbed on
 further mixing with mercury. But such an ideal condition
 could only be ideal in its beginning, and, I think, disturb
ances due to this cause are insensible in comparison with other
 sources of error. The above amalgam when stirred with mer
 cury may reduce its temperature as much as 5° 0.
    1 am informed that sodium may contain a large quantity of
 hydrogen. I am not called on to discuss the experiments (not
 my own) upon which this rests; but I think that any consider
 able quantity would be expelled on amalgamation. Perhaps
 the glow or blush to be described immediately and in § 28 is
 due to the escape of residual hydrogen at the released tension-
 surface of the mercury.
    The first experiment in regard to the diffusion of sodium out
 of this amalgam into mercury was of course a qualitative one.
 A U-tube (fig. 5, PI. V.) was made of glass tube of £ inch in
 ternal diameter—the one limb, A, being about 3 inches and the

332                Frederick Guthrie on certain
other, B, about 2£ inches long, reckoned from the inner bend a.
This was fastened into a mass of fusible metal foot to give sta
bility. The U-tube was dried perfectly under the ordinary air-
condition, and received pure dry mercury, which stood in both
limbs at a height of about 2§ inches (reckoned from a). The
whole was placed in a flat-bottomed vessel g containing a little
melted paraffin, and then upon an immovable slab, to which it
was stuck by a few drops of paraffin. The vessel g then received
water slightly acidulated with HC1 so as to cover the mercury
in the shorter limb, and reach about £ inch above the edge of
the glass tube on that side. A test-tube filled with similarly
acidulated water was inverted over the shorter limb. Upon the
surface of the mercury in A about 15 grams of the amalgam
Am was placed; this was covered with petroleum, and the
tube was plugged with cotton-wool.
   Immediately after introducing the sodium amalgam a kind
of frosted appearance is seen on the immediately lower parts
of the mercury and glass surface in A. This appearance, which
is a blush of bubbles, creeps downwards with strange rapidity,
reaching the bend, say 2A inches, in a quarter of an hour.
   In about 30 hours, bubbles of hydrogen appear at the sur
face of the mercury in B and collect in the pneumatic tube.
Such evolution continues sensible for about a month. After
two months such evolution ceased, the contents were emptied
out, thereby being of course mixed, and no further evolution
of hydrogen could be detected.
   Such a method of experimentation is, however, far from
quantitative, because, when the sodium has diffused down
through A as far as a, it will, being lighter than mercury, rise
through B and cause whirls.
   The ideal condition of such diffusion would be of course
similar to the ideal condition of heat- or electrical transference,
where one may have a given potential at one end of the column,
and a given lower one, fancifully called zero, at the other.
   Perhaps this condition is to be attained with the greatest
practical completeness by the simple long vertical column.
   § 28. Three glass burettes were made, about a foot in
length and an inch in internal diameter. They were drawn
out sharply at the bottom into capillary tubes, upon which
pressure-taps were fixed in the ordinary way. These were
nearly filled with pure mercury. A little of the mercury
was allowed to run through so as to fill the capillary and caout
chouc tube.
   Upon a tube so prepared and filled, about 15 grams of the
amalgam Am were placed. The amalgam was thereupon
covered liberally with petroleum; and the top of the tube was

                       Molecular Constants.                  333
slightly corked. Instantly clouds of minute bubbles began
to make their appearance between the mercury and the glass.
In half an hour the whole column appeared frosted (see § 27).
On drawing off a measure, say ^ of the whole, from the bottom
after two or three hours, no appreciable amount of hydrogen
was to be got from it.
   Accordingly the tube was reemptied, cleaned, dried, and
refilled. The amalgam (Am) was then allowed to rest upon
the top for 14 days and nights in an undisturbed and steady
place, where the temperature ranged from 13° to 18° C. At
the end of this time the amalgam was drawn off. The draw
ing off was effected as follows:—A little block of paraffin
was hollowed so as to have a smooth cavity of the capacity of
about -jV of tho tube in fig. 6. The edge was ground flat, and
a flat slab of paraffin served as a cover. The amalgam was
drawn into this very slowlv so as to stand above the edge; the
slab being then pressed down, a unit volume was entrapped.
This being transferred to a porcelain capsule, the few drops of
overflow were returned to the unit measure, which was again
filled up, and so on. The six lowest measures (each about ^)
did not show a trace of hydrogen. The seven higher ones
evolved hydrogen in the quantities shown in the following
table, in which the actual weights of the mercury are re
duced to 100, the cub. centim. of hydrogen being recalculated
and reduced to dry hydrogen at 0° C. and 7G0 millim. It
appears that in 14 days the sodium had penetrated down a
little more than halfway, say 7 inches, in quantity appreciable.
  I put now these results in such a form that they may be as far
as possible immediately comparable with the results obtained
by other metals. They come out as follows:—

   § 29. A potassium amalgam prepared in a similar manner
was found, when analyzed as in § 27, to have the composition
1"34 per cent, of K. About the same quantity of this was
put into the same tube as had been used for tho Na, under,
as far as possible, the same conditions.
   Reducing the evolved H to 0° and 760, as before, it was
found that the 13 volumes of the column (all of which were

 334              Frederick Guthrie on certain
nearly equal except the last, which, instead of about 84-82
grams of mercury, only held about 52, for this was the drain
age from the amalgam), had the composition:—
                        Per cent, of K.

   As to the comparison between Na and K, we need only
contemplate the potential difference between T92 and 1"34
respectively.
   With regard to the frosted appearance mentioned in §§ 27,
28, it can scarcely be doubted that the minute bubbles which
compose it are hydrogen, due to the film of water or vapour
on the glass. But while this appearance travels at the rate
of at least one foot an hour, there is no sensible quantity
of Na to be found at even a lesser depth after fourteen days.
The effect must therefore be a surface-effect, and be of the
same order as the effect described in § 22, where the mercury-
slab expands when touched by sodium amalgam, on account of
the metals spreading almost instantaneously over its surface
and enfeebling its skin. The condition actually set up in the
mercury column is probably this:—A minute film of sodium
spreads downwards between the mercury and the glass : this
decomposes the water on the glass, and so clothes the glass
with a film of minute hydrogen bubbles, and the mercury sur
face with a film of caustic soda, which latter is in absolute
contact with the mercury surface. It is a question whether
the sodium film is less than, equal to, or more than sufficient
to decompose the water—probably more. At all events it is so
minute as not to exhibit itself in any chemical reaction. The
spectroscopic reaction here has no significance.
  The curves Na and K, Plate IV., which represent these expe
riments graphically, are not directly comparable with the curves
Sn, Pb, and Zn (§ 31) in the same plate, because in the case
of Na and K, for reasons given in § 25, it was found necessary
to start with an amalgam, and indeed with one containing only
about 2 per cent, of sodium. The time in the case of the Na
and K amalgams was also only a little less than half that occu
pied in the diffusion of Zn, Pb, and Sn.
   § 30. The rapid penetration of zinc by mercury suggested
the question whether, when an amalgam of an alkaline metal

                       Molecular Constants.                    335
was presented to zinc, the mercury would penetrate the zinc
and carry the alkaline metal with it. Accordingly the above
potassium amalgam was introduced into a hollow cylinder of
cast zinc, 17 millim. internal, and 21 millim. external dia
meter (thickness 2 millim.), 45 millim. external height, 35
millim. internal height (10 millim. thickness of bottom). The
amalgam was scraped upon the zinc so as to ensurejcontact, and
then covered with petroleum. The zinc cylinder was thereupon
corked up and covered with paraffin. It was placed in a
beaker of' distilled water and covered with a tube of water
according to fig. 7. After two months' standing at a uni
form temperature of about 15°, scarcely a pin's-head volume
of gas had collected in the top of the tube. Abundance
of the semiflocculent fine oxyhydro-carbonate had collected
on the zinc and at the bottom of the beaker. That part
on the zinc was rubbed off the zinc with an ivory blade,
and, together with the sediment in the beaker, dissolved in
hydrochloric acid overneutralized with ammonia and sulphide
of ammonium. After separation of the Zn, no trace of K
could be found. No potassium had found its way through the
zinc. Perhaps a more remarkable fact still is this, that on
scraping about a gram of the solid metal from the outside of
the zinc cylinder, not a trace of mercury could be found in
it. Not only, therefore, did the alkaline metal fail to follow
the mercury into the zinc, but it prevented the mercury from
entering the zinc. Compare this with § 32, where the cylinder
of zinc is literally " slaked " by the mercury.
   § 31. Cylinders of zinc, lead, and tin were cast, an inch and a
quarter long and £ inch in diameter. These were floated on the
mercury contained in the tubes described in § 28. The quantity
of the mercury in each tube was such that it stood at the same
height, reckoning from the bottom of each cylinder. The
burettes had been previously lashed to massive stands, cork
buffers being interposed between the tubes and the stands.
The three were placed side by side on a slab let into the wall,
and were protected as much as possible by cloths from sudden
changes of temperature. The mean temperature was 15° C.
The experiments lasted a month, and the extreme range of
temperature was from 13° C. to 170,5 C.
   At the end of the month (31 days) the mercury was run
off from the bottom very slowly and discontinuously into the
paraffin vessel described in § 28 ; so that, with the exception
of the top quantities, the volumes of the successive portions
were very nearly the same. With regard to the top quantities,
it is clear that, since the metals float at diS'erent depths in the
mercury, the surfaces of contact are not the same in the

336               Frederick Guthrie on certain
several cases ; and therefore these top, or richest, amalgams
can scarcely be compared. Again, the shape of the bottom of
the tube with its capillary &c. puts the lowest or poorest out
of court. But as the contents of the lower, irregular part of
the tube is not more than a third of the volume of the unit
measure, it is only the very lowest amalgam that need be
rejected.
   In each case there were twelve full unit vessels drawn off,
and in each case a fraction of a thirteenth, which last contained
the drainage from the metal.
   Through the kindness of Dr. Hodgkinson a number of
these amalgams were analyzed in the chemical laboratory by
Messrs. Adie, Gahan, and Grange, to whom I am therefore
indebted. These three gentlemen analyzed the zinc, lead, and
tin amalgams respectively. The metals were determined in
the following manners:—
   Lead.—The amalgam dissolved in nitric acid and evapo
rated with sulphuric acid, and the residue either ignited

zinc).

given, so that the proportion of the errors of analysis may be

   At the end of the experiment the cylinders of tin and lead
presented nothing remarkable in appearance. On standing a
couple of months the upper part of the lead cylinder has
become as hard as zinc, though there is no sensible deforma
tion. The zinc cylinder swelled considerably in the tube ;
and when left to itself afterwards, though drained from the
mercury, it continued to swell and crack, and ultimately fell
to pieces like a " lime-light " lime cylinder when slaked. Two
cones with their apices towards the centre of the cylinder
were formed at top and bottom ; the cracking otherwise was
for the most part in radial planes.

gams of the three metals are given graphically, and without

   § 33. It appears accordingly that the three metals lead,
tin, and zinc, all of which and all of whose amalgams are
lighter than mercury, diffuse downwards through this latter
metal in such a fashion that they appear, after a month's
interval, in appreciable quantity at a depth of a foot beneath
the surface when the temperature is about 16°-17° C.
With regard to this latter point, as to temperature, I suppose
that mercury is so good a conductor of heat that the influence

  of convection-currents is at least as inconsiderable as in the
  experiments which have been performed for determining the
  diffusion of soluble salts in water. It is scarcely worth while
  amusing oneself by dividing these diffusion percentages by the
  so-called " atomic weights " of the metals. A more serious
  consideration might be the result of the division of the diffused
  weight by the specific gravity of the metal. Comparing the
  numbers of the group Sn, Pb, and Zn with one another, we
  may remember that the metals are all cast, and therefore so
  far indefinite in structure. This may be especially the case
  with zinc, which cracks and thereby allows the mercury to
 rise by capillarity and so enrich itself, and generally set up
 conditions of amalgamation which I do not care to trace, for
 I do not see my way through.
     As to the comparison of the alkaline group with the
  Sn, Pb, Zn groups, such comparison must be vague, for the
 reason that the K and Na are employed as amalgams (as
 though one would study the diffusion of nitre into water by
 employing a solution of nitre containing only 2 per cent, of
 the anhydrous salt) ; whereas the Sn, Pb, and Zn are use
 with what was supposed to be a sufficient supply of pure 100-
 per-cont. metal. But this imperfection of these conditions is
 manifest if we remember that while the solid metal melts and
 dissolves downwards, the liquid mercury rises. Accordingly
 there is, after the first instant of contact, supposing the metals
 diffuse, no constant metallo-motive force in the same place.
    § 34. I conclude therefore that the general curve of amal
 gamation, and therefore of alloyage, and therefore perhaps
of elementary atomic and molecular diffusion generally, is of
the kind shown in fig. 8. In the case of Na almost the com
plete curve was obtained; whereas in the case of Zn the point
of contriflexure had not been reached. The very fact that
the K and Na curves are more complete, in this fashion,
than the Pb, Zn, and Sn, prove to my mind that K and Na
have a far greater diffusive energy than the heavier metals
examined. And although in this case the percentage of metal
actually found at a given depth was in all cases much less
than the percentages of the heavier metals, it will be borne in
mind that, while the latter were fewer and had acted for
thirty-one days, the former were amalgams containing less than
2 per cent, of the metal. Comparing K with Na, I do not
think we can draw any conclusion beyond the rather negative
one, that the superior diffusive faculty which seems to be the
property of K salts in regard to water does not evidence itself,
if it exist, when that metal and sodium are compared in respect
to their diffusion in mercury. I am far from asserting that

such preeminence may not exist ; but I do not think that it is
here made conspicuous.
   My friend Prof. Chandler Roberta has for a long time been
engaged in studying the diffusion of melted metals, and the
matter has been a subject of frequent conversation between us.
I await with great interest the details of his experiments. The
relative dates of our publication have no relation to the dates of

         XLVII. On Laplace's Theory of Capillarity.
                By A. M. WoRTHINGTONj M.A.
   To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      Gentlemen,
fTPHE appearance of Lord Rayleigh's paper on Laplace's
 -I- Theory of Capillarity encourages me to send you some
 remarks on the same subject which I had prepared some months
 ago in connexion with work ou capillarity on which I have been
 engaged. I should be glad, however, that it should appear on
 the present occasion, as I think it may be of some use in
 explaining, rather more explicitly than Lord Rayleigh attempts
 to do, how the misconception of Laplace's quantity K has
 arisen—a misconception which has become of almost historical
 importance in connexion with this subject.
    The object with which Laplace sets out is to explain the
 fact that the hydrostatic pressure in a liquid just below a
 curved surface differs from the hydrostatic pressure just below a
plane surface by an amount depending on the curvature of the
surface.
   He gives the accompanying figure, representing a vertical
section of a capillary tube N E
plunged in a vessel A C con
taining a liquid which wets the
tube.
   V R Z 0 represents an infi
nitely thin canal or filament of
the liquid whose cross section
is taken as the unit of area, and
which meets the plane surface
at V and the curved surface at
its lowest point 0. On the as
sumption that the fluid is of uni
form density throughout, and
that between any pair of ele
mentary volumes of it there is an attraction which is a function
                                2B2

340           Mr. A. M. Worthington on Laplace's
only of their masses and the distance between them, and that
this function vanishes when the distance becomes sensible, he
points out that any elementary length dz of the filament at a
sensible distance below the surface is attracted by the sur
rounding liquid equally in all directions, and that to establish
hydrostatic equilibrium in the canal it is only necessary to
show that the pressure on the liquid of the canal at V exceeds
the pressure at 0 by the weight of the column reaching from
0 to the level of V. He therefore examines the action of the sur
rounding liquid on the topmost element of the canal at V, and
finds that it can be expressed by a certain integral, which be
calls K, and is of the nature of a pull downwards, producing a
pressure K on the base of the element dz which is transmitted
along the canal. At the other extremity 0 of the canal
there is the same action K downwards due to the liquid
below the tangent-plane KOI, and at the same time an
action upwards due to the meniscus N K 1 M, which latter
action he finds can be expressed by -r, where H is a second
integral and b the radius of the curved surface (supposed in
the first instance spherical). And he points out that this
second quantity ~r is very much smaller than the quantity K;
and he argues that the elevation of the liquid in the canal
Z 0 above the level V is due to the attraction of the meniscus.
   This proceeding is perfectly legitimate. It explains the
equilibrium of one portion of the fluid, namely the infinitely
thin filament, considered on the supposition that the surround
ing liquid is in equilibrium both with itself and with all por
tions of the filament at a depth greater than dz below the
surface. But it does not account for this latter equilibrium.
Nevertheless Laplace goes on as if he had now explained the
elevation of the whole of the liquid in the tube. In doing so
he tacitly assumes that the argument is equally applicable (or
at least applicable in kind) to all the filaments of which the
liquid in the tube may be regarded as composed. It is here
that his theory is incomplete.
   In considering that the equilibrium of the filament is deter
mined by the pressures parallel to its length produced by the
action of the surrounding liquid on the topmost element at
each end, Laplace assumes that all elements at a greater depth
below the surface are in equilibrium with the liquid around
them. If this assumption is made for one filament, it must be
made for all. In other words, he really starts with the assump
tion that all the liquid at a depth greater than dz below the

                        Theory of Capillarity.                 341
 surface is in equilibrium with itself, and then considers the
 action between this mass and the surface layers.
    Now to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction,
 and consequently the attraction K downwards of any topmost
 element dz at the plane sui face by the surrounding liquid is
 accompanied by an equal attraction of the surrounding fila
 ments upwards exercised on portions whose depth is greater
 than dz, i. e. on portions in other respects in equilibrium ; and
 since the sum of the actions K downwards in all the filaments
 is equal to the sum of the reactions upwards, it is evident that
 no pressure will be transmitted to the liquid in the canal at a
 sensible depth below the surface, but that the only effect of
 these equal and opposite forces is to create an elastic reaction
within the liquid.
    This is equivalent to saying that each layer of the liquid of
 less than sensible thickness throughout the liquid clings to
 the next with a cohesive force producing what may be called
a molecular pressure of the nature of an elastic reaction
within the liquid. This molecular pressure is not transmitted,
like an hydrostatic pressure, through the liquid to any sensible
distance, but at any point has its origin in the molecular
actions in the immediate neighbourhood of that point.
    Although Laplace consistently adopts the fiction that this
molecular pressure K is transmitted along any infinitely thin
canal from the surface and balanced by an equal pressure
transmitted from the other end, yet he seems to have had a
perfectly correct view of the physical meaning of the quantity.
    Thus, in his introduction on p. 351, Mecanique Celeste,
Supplement au Livre X., he says:—" Je pense que de ce
terme (K) dependent la suspension du mercure dans un tube
de barometre k une hauteur deux ou trois fois plus grande que
celle qui est due k la pression de l'atmosph6re, le pouvoir re-
fringent de corps diaphanes, la cohesion, et generalement les
affinitcs chimiques."
   Again, in No. 11, p. 391, in                          n
considering the pressure trans
mitted along an elementary
canal V S R to the plane sur
face N R of an immersed solid,
after pointing out that the pres
sure transmitted along S R is            V
equal to the external pressure
P, +K, +g.YS, he goes on
to say :—" L'action dont le
fluide du canal R S est anime            s             R
 est egale: 1° a Paction du

342            Mr. A. M. Worthington on Laplace's
fluide sur ce canal, et cette action est egale a      2° a Paction
du plan sur le meme canal. Mais cette action est detruite par
l'attraction du fluide sur le plan, et il ne peut en rdsulter dans
le plan aucune tendance a se raouvoir; car, en ne considdrant
que ces attractions rdciproques, le fluide et le plan seraient
en repos, Taction dtant dgale et contraire a la reaction; ces
attractions ne peuvent produire qu'une adherence du plan au
fluide, et Ton peut ici en faire abstraction. II suit de la
que le fluide presse le point R avec une force egale k
p + K +g .VS-K, ou shnplement P + g . VS." Thus show
ing quite clearly that he did not regard the pressure K as
capable of being transmitted to a solid surface.
   It is important, however, to observe that in the next page,
when comparing the pressures at the two sides of the plate at
another level, he does not take the trouble to cancel K in this
way, but speaks of it as transmitted to the plate, but balanced
by an equal pressure transmitted from the other side. He
writes carelessly in fact. And though in the very next para
graph, in treating in precisely the same manner the pressure
at a third point, he again accurately cancels the K before it
reaches the plate, it is probable that he does so because of the
necessity of getting rid of it (there being at this point nothing
but atmospheric pressure at the other side of the plate), rather
than from a sense of the importance of using language that
should be strictly correct.
   It will be observed, however, that he consistently speaks of
the elevation of the liquid in a capillary tube as due to the
attraction of the meniscus, and not to the excess of pressure
at the plane surface.
   I have quoted these passages because they show clearly that
Laplace did not himself fall into the error of regarding the
pressure K as transmitted to immersed solids, or of consider
ing the elevation of the liquid as duo to a vis a tergo having its
origin in the free surface. It is not surprising, however, that
others should have fallen into this mistake when we find
that he occasionally used language which could only encou
rage such a view.
   It may be noticed that, through taking for granted the
equilibrium of all the liquid except the single canal which
he considers, Laplace does not at first discover the real seat
of the external force by which the liquid is elevated. In
the Second Supplement, however, proceeding by a different
method, he traces it to the action of the solid matter of the
tube just beyond the edge of the liquid where it meets the inner
wall of the tube.
   It is well known that Young objected to Laplace's theory

                       Theory of Capillarity.                  343
that he had not considered the " repulsive force of heat
within the liquid "—a phrase of which the nearest modern
equivalent would he " the repulsive or elastic reaction between
the molecules considered with reference to temperature;" and
indeed the passage which I have quoted is, I believe, the only
one in which Laplace takes any elastic reaction into consi
deration.
    In a short paper published in the Bulletin de la SocUti Plii-
 lomathique de Paris, 1819-1822 (referred to by Poisson), after
pointing out that the chemical attraction is very great while
the capillary effect is very small, he says:—" La theorie que
j'ai donnee de ces ph^nomenes embrasse Taction des deux
forces dont je viens de parler en prenant pour l'expression
integrale de l'effet capillaire, la difference des deux integrales
relatives k l'attraction moldculaire et k la force repulsive de
la chaleur ce qui r^pond k l'objection du savant physicien
M. Young." Poisson, however, points out that this answer
is quite insufficient; and in his own theory, by examining
 carefully into the nature of the internal equilibrium in which
the "repulsive force of heat " is involved, concludes (1) that
there must be a very rapid increase of density close to the
surface as we descend into the liquid, and (2) that but for
this great variation of density none of the phenomena of
capillarity would occur. Clerk Maxwell, in his article in the
 Encyclopaedia Britannica on this subject, speaks of the latter
 conclusion as mathematically wrong, by which I think he
means that in liquids, for example, much less compressible
than any we know of, there would still be a surface-tension,
 though the variation of density near the surface was vanishingly
small.
    Laplace does indeed point out, on p. 494 in the General Con
 siderations appended to the Second Supplement, that the com
 pression of the liquid is zero at the surface, and increases with
 extreme rapidity, reaching a constant value before a sensible
 depth below the surface is attained. But he is content with
 this cursory observation. Had he attended sufficiently to this
 point, he would probably not have spoken as he does in the last
 paragraph of his treatise of the idea of a surface-tension, where
 he endorses the view of Segner:—" Qu'elle n'etait quJune
 fiction propre k representer les phenomenes, mais que l'on ne
 devait pas admettre qu'autant qu'elle se rattachait a la loi
 d'une attraction insensible a des distances sensibles."
    These words of Laplace have, I believe, contributed greatly
 to hinder the acceptance of the idea of a surface-tension. That
 he should have held such a view is, however, not surprising;
 for it can be shown that it is in virtue of this very extension of

344         Mr. L. Fletcher on the Dilatation of Crystals
the liquid near the surface, which he ignores, that the surface-
tension exists, and that the surface layers are a seat of energy,
and physically different from the liquid in the interior.

XLVIII. The Dilatation of Crystals on Change of Temperature.
    By L. Fletcher, ALA., of the Mineral Department, British
    Museum; late Fellow of University College, Oxford.
                         [Continued from p. 300.]
                              Second Part.
ALTHOUGH we can thus find to any degree of accuracy
         the isotropic planes and the maximum and minimum
expansions for lines in any zone-plane of an Anorthic crystal,
and therefore the positions and relative magnitudes of the
principal axes of the section of the ellipsoid made by the given
zone-plane, the above method cannot be satisfactorily extended
to the calculation of the directions and relative magnitudes of
the three principal expansions of the crystal.
    We shall accordingly solve the problem in an entirely
different way, and, to render the solution for three dimensions
more easy to follow, shall take first the case of an Oblique
crystal and obtain remarkably simple formulae for the calcu
lation of the thermic axes directly from the parameters them
selves.
    At the first temperature let OA, OB, OC be the crystallo-
graphic axes, and let their lengths be denoted by A, B, 0 ;
as usual let OB be the axis perpendicular to the plane of
symmetry containing the two axes OA, OC. At the second
temperature the axis OB' will coincide in direction with OB,
but will have a length B', and the axes OA, OC will have
taken up new directions OA', OC and new lengths A', C.
    The measurement of the angles of a crystal at two tempe
ratures can give only relative, not absolute, displacements of the
lines; and without affecting calculations of these relative posi
tions, the crystal may be imagined to be rotated at the second
temperature round OB until OC coincides in direction with
OC. If it should bo hereafter necessary to determine the
absolute displacement of any line, this imaginary rotation of
the line with the whole crystal will have to be compounded
with the relative displacement now about to be calculated;
till then this rotation of the whole crystal may be disregarded.
    It will be convenient first to calculate from the alterations

                   on Change of Temperature.                 345
of the lines OA and OC the corresponding alterations of a
line OX in the plane AOC and initially at right angles to OC

rectangular axes OX, OC, and xu s, the coordinates of the

Then                  ar=ON,       z=PN,

   (2) At the second temperature OA, OC become OA', OC,
whilst /3 becomes $ and OP, OP'; if, as before, a line P'M'
be drawn parallel to OC or OC, then, since parallel lines or

angle AOC, we can find these coordinates in terms of the altera

circle a? + z3=l will become the ellipse

 and are generally expressed by the symbol a : 1 : c. If the
 parametral ratios for the two temperatures be a : 1 : e and
 a' : 1 : c', we shall thus have A=Ba, C = Bc; similarly for the
 second temperature, A'=B'a', C'=B'cJ ; whence, if X be the

XLIX. Tlie Ice of Greenland and the Antarctic Continent not
   due to Elevation of the Land. By James Croll, LL.JJ.,
   F.R.S*
QREENLAND.—The only two continents on the globe
       covered by permanent ice and snow are Greenland and
the Antarctic. But are these continents to be regarded
as Highlands or as Lowlands? It is an opinion held by
many that these regions are greatly elevated, and that it is
mainly owing to this elevation that they are so completely
buried under ice. I have been wholly unable to find evidence
for any such conclusion. It is of course true that, in regard
to Greenland at least, the observations of Rink, Heyes, Nor-
denskjold, Jensen, Brown, and others show that the upper
surface of the inland ice is greatly elevated above the sea-level.
Dr. Sink, for example, states that the elevation of this icy
plain, at its junction with the outskirts of the country where
it begins to lower itself through the valleys, in the ramifica
tions of the Bay of Omenak is about 2000 feet, from which it
gradually risen towards the interior. Nordenskjold, 30 miles
from the coast, reached an elevation of 2200 feet, and found
the ice continued to rise inwards. Heyes, who penetrated 50
miles into the interior, found the elevation about 5000 feet,
and still continuing to slofie ujnoards towards the interior of the
continent. This upward slope is a necessary condition of con
tinental ice, and must continue till the centre of dispersion is
reached. As the larger portion of the Greenland ice is dis
charged at the west coast, it is probable that this centre of
dispersion, or rather ice-sbnde, will lie nearer to the east coast
than to the west. There is little doubt that the greater part
of the surface of the inland ice is far above the snow-line ; but
this does not prove that Greenland is an elevated country,
for this elevation of the upper surface of the ice may be due
entirely to the thickness of the sheet. If the sheet is at least
1000 or 2000 feet thick at its edge, it is not surprising that it
should be 5000 feet thick 50 miles in the interior, seeing that
it is a physical and mechanical necessity that continental ice
should gradually thicken towards the centre of dispersion.
It has been shown from physical considerations (' Climate
and Time,' pp. 374—386) that the thickness of the ice in
the centre of Greenland is probably upwards of 2 miles,
and that the Antarctic ice-cap at the South Pole, which is
most likely not far from the centre of dispersion, must be over
6 miles in thickness.
                   * Communicated by the Author.

352                  Dr. J. Croll on tlie Ice of
    Certainly no one has ever seen, and probably no one ever will
 see, elevated land under the ice either of Greenland or the
Antarctic continent; and to assume its existence because those
 regions are so completely glaciated would simply be to beg
 the very question at issue.
    It will doubtless be urged that, although the ground under
the ice may not be elevated, yet there may be lofty mountain-
 chains in the interior which might account for the origin of
the ice. We have, I think, good grounds for concluding that
if there are mountain-ranges in the interior of Greenland (of
 which there is absolutely no proof, although one or two iso
lated peaks have been seen), they must be wholly buried under
the ice. For if mountain-masses rise above the icy mantle,
there ought to be evidence of this in the form of broken rock,
stones, earth, and other moraine matter lying on the inland
ice. " But as soon as we leave the immediate vicinity of the
coast," says Dr. Brown, " no moraine is seen coming over the
inland ice. No living creature, animal or plant, except a
minute alga." This could not possibly be the case if ranges
of mountains rose above the general ice-covering. These
mountain-ranges, if they exist, are doubtless covered with snow
and their sides with glaciers ; but this would not prevent
pieces of broken rock and stones from rolling down upon the
inland ice. In fact it would have the very opposite result ;
for glaciers would be one of the most effective agents possible
in bringing down such material, and it is certain that no
avalanche of snow could take place without carrying along
with it masses of stones and rubbish. All these materials
brought down from the sides of the projecting peaks would be
deposited on the surface of the inland ice and carried along
with it in its outward motion from the centre of dispersion,
and could not fail to be observed did they exist. The fact
that no such thing is ever seen is conclusive proof that these
supposed projecting mountain- ranges do not exist.
    But it may still be urged that the absence of moraine matter
on the surface of the inland ice is not sufficient evidence that
they do not exist; for as this material from the interior would
have to travel hundreds of miles before reaching the outskirts,
a journey occupying a period of many years, the stones would
become buried under the successive layers of ice formed on
the surface during their passage outwards. But supposing
this were the case, these buried moraines, if they existed,
ought to be seen projecting from the edge of the sheet at
places where icebergs break off, and also on the edges of the
icebergs themselves near to their tops ; but such, I presume,
is never the case. Further, as the inland ice has to force its

               Greenland and the Antarctic Continent.              353
  way through the comparatively narrow fjords before reaching
  the sea, the moraines could not fail to be occasionally observed
  did they exist.
     But supposing there were mountains in the interior, this
  would not account for the general ice-covering. It would
  not account for the intervening spaces between the mountains
  being filled up with ice. To account for the whole country
  being covered with ice through the influence of mountains, we
  should have to assume that it was studded over with them at
  no great distance from one another ; otherwise all that we
  should have would simply be local glaciers.
     Dr. Robert Brown, one of the highest authorities in matters
 relating to Greenlaud, who does not believe in the existence
 of mountain-masses in the interior, says :—" I do not think a
 range of mountains at all necessary for the formation of this
 huge mer de glace, for this idea is derived from the Alpine and
 other mountain-ranges, where the glacial system is a petty
 affair compared with that of Greenland. I look upon Green
 land," he continues, "and its interior ice-field in the light of
 a broad- lipped shallow vessel, but with breaks in the lip here
 and there, and the glacier like some viscous matter in it. As
 more is poured in, the viscous matter will run over the edges,
 naturally taking the line of the chinks as its line of outflow.
 The broad lips of the vessel, in my homely simile, are the out
 lying islands or 'outskirts;' the viscous matter in the vessel,
the inland ice ; the additional matter continually being poured
in, the enormous snow-covering, which, winter after winter,
for seven or eight months in the year, falls almost continuously
on it ; and the chinks or breaks in the vessel are the fjords or
valleys down which the glaciers, representing the outflowing
viscous matter, empty the surplus of the vessel" *.
    In North Greenland and along Smith Sound a warm south
east wind, somewhat similar to the Fuhn of Switzerland, has
been reported in the middle of winter. From this it has been
inferred by some that there must be high ranges of mountains
in the interior from which this wind descends. There are,
however, certainly no good grounds for such a conclusion ;
for we know that the upper surface of the inland ice of North
Greenland, 50 or 100 miles from the outskirts, has an eleva
tion of at least 4000 or 5000 feet. Now a wind crossing this
icy plateau and descending to the sea-level would have its
temperature raised by upwards of 20°, and also its capacity
for moisture at the same time greatly increased. The conse
quence would therefore bo that, in the midst of a Greenland
winter, such a wind would be felt to be hot and dry.

354                 Dr. J. Croll on the Ice of
   The opinion was expressed by Giesecke, who long resided
in Greenland, that that country is merely a collection of
islands fused together by ice. This opinion is concurred in
by Dr. Brown, who says that "most likely it will be found
that Greenland will end in a broken series of islands forming
a Polar archipelago. That the continent (?) is itself a series
of such islands and islets—consolidated by means of the inland
ice— I have already shown to be highly probable, if not abso
lutely certain, as Giesecke and Scoresby affirmed." It has
long been a belief that several of the west-coast fjords cut
through Greenland from sea to sea—in short, that they are
simply straits filled up with ice. The important bearing that
this island-condition of Greenland has on the explanation of
the warm interglacial periods of that country will be shown
in a future article.
    Antarctic Regions.— It needly hardly be remarked, that what
has been stated as to the total absence of proof that Greenland
 possesses elevated plateaus and ranges of lofty mountains holds
 in a still more marked degree in reference to the Antarctic
 continent. Here is a region nearly 3000 miles across, buried
 under ice, on which the foot of man never trod. There is not
 the shadow of a ground for concluding that the interior of this
 immense region is, under the ice, greatly elevated, or that it
 possesses lofty mountain-ranges. The probability seems rather
 to be that, like Greenland, the area, as Sir Wyville Thomson
 supposes, consists of comparatively low dismembered land or
 groups of islands bound together by a continuous sheet of ice.
 " We have no evidence," says Sir Wyville, " that this space,
 which includes an area of about 4,500,000 square miles, nearly
 double that of Australia, is continuous land. The presumption
 would seem rather to l>e that it is at all events greatly broken
 up; a large portion of it probably consisting of groups of low
 islands united and combined by an extension of the ice-sheet."
    " Various patches of Antarctic land," he continues, " are
 now known with certainty, most of them between the paral
 lels of 65° and 70° S. ; most of these are comparatively low,
 their height, including the thickness of their ice-covering,
 rarely exceeding 2000 to 3000 feet. The exceptions to this
 rule are the volcanic chain, stretching from Balleny Island to
 latitude 78° S.; and a group of land between 55° and 95° west
 longitude, including Peter the Great Island, Alexander Land,
 Graham Land, Adelaide Island, and Louis Philippe Land.
 The remaining Antarctic Land, including Adelie Land, Clairie
 Land, Sabrina Land, Kemp Land, and Enderby Land, nowhere
 rises to any <jreat height" .

     There is another class of facts which shows still more con
  clusively the probabl y low flat nature of most of the Antarctic
  regions. I refer to the character of the great ice-barrier, and
  the bergs which break off from it. The icebergs of the southern
  ocean are almost all of the tabular form, and their surface is
  perfectly level, and parallel with the surface of the sea. The
  icebergs are all stratified ; the stratifications run parallel with
  the surface of the berg. The stratified beds, as we mav call
  them, are separated from each other by a well-marked blue
  band. These blue lines or bands, as Sir Wyville Thomson
  remarks, are the sections of sheets of clear ice; while the white
  intervening spaces between them are the sections of Livers of
 ice where the particles are not in such close contact and pro
 bably contain some air. The blue bands, as Sir Wyville sug
 gests, probably represent portions of the snow surface which
 during the heat of summer becomes partially melted and
  refrozen into compact ice ; while the intervening white por
 tions represent the snow of the greater part of the year, which
  of course would become converted into ice without ever being
 actually melted. It is therefore more than probable that each
 bed with its corresponding blue band may represent the for
 mation of one year. Judging from the number of these layers
 in an iceberg, some of these layers must be of immense age,
 occupying a period probably of several thousand years in their
 formation. And as the ice is in a constant state of motion
 outwards from the centre of dispersion —probably the South
 Pole—the bergs before becoming detached from their parent
 mass must have traversed a distance of hundreds of miles.
    The fact that these bergs must have travelled from great
 distances in the interior is further evident from the following
consideration. The distance between the well-marked blue
lines is greatest near the top of the berg, where it may be a
foot or more, and becomes less and less as we descend, until,
near the surface of the water, it is not more than two or three
inches. This diminution in the thickness of the ice-strata
from the top downwards has been considered by Sir Wyville
to be mainly due to two causes—compression, and melting of
the ice, particularly the latter. But in my paper on the
Antarctic Ice (Quart. Journ. of Science, Jan. 1879) I have
shown that, although compression and melting may have had
something to do in the matter, this thinning of the strata from
the top downwards is a necessary physical consequence of con
tinental ice radiating from a centre of dispersion. Assuming
the South Pole to be this centre, a layer which in, say, lati
tude 85° covers 1 square foot of surface will, on reaching
latitude 80°, cover 2 square feet ; at latitude 70° it will
                                 2C2

356                  Dr. J. Croll on tJie Ice of
occupy 4 square feet, and at latitude 60° the space covered
will be 6 square feet. Then if the layer was I foot thick at
latitude 85°, it would be only 6 inches thick at latitude 80°,
3 inches thick at latitude 70°, and 2 inches at latitude 60°.
Had the square foot of ice come from latitude 89° it would
occupy 30 square feet by the time it reached latitude 60°, and
its thickness would be reduced to jAj of a foot, or $ of an inch.
    Now the lower the layer the older it is, and the greater
the distance which it has travelled. A layer near the bottom
may have been travelling from the Pole for the past 10,000
or 15,000 years, whereas a layer near the top may perhaps
not be 20 years old, and may not have travelled the distance
of a mile. The ice at the bottom of a berg may have come
from near the Pole, whereas the ice at the top may not have
travelled 100 yards.
    There is still another consideration which must be taken
into account. It is this : the icebergs all seem to bear the
mark of their original structure, and the horizontal stratifica
tions appear also never to have been materially altered in their
passage from the interior. This fact seems to have struck
 Sir Wyville forcibly. " I never saw," he says, " a single
instance of deviation from the horizontal and symmetrical
stratification which could in any way bo referred to original
 structure ; which could not, in fact, be at once accounted
 for by changes which we had an opportunity of observing
 taking place in tho icebergs. There was not, so far as we
 could see, in any iceberg the slightest trace of structure
 stamped upon the ice in passing down a valley, or during its
 passage over roches moutonnees or any other form of uneven
 land ; the only structure except the parallel stratifications
 which we ever observed which could be regarded as bearing
 upon the mode of original formation of the ice-mass, was an
 occasional local thinning-out of some of the layers and thicken
 ing of others, just such an apjiearance as might be expected
 to result from the occasional drifting of large beds of snow
 before they have time to become consolidated."
     There cannot, 1 think, be the shadow of a doubt that these
  thin horizontal bands of clear blue ice, with their less dense
  and white intervening beds, are the original structure of the
  bergs. And it is evident that if the ice had crossed mountain-
  ridges, valleys, or other obstructions in the course of its
 journey from the interior, these beds cculd not have avoided
  being crushed, fractured, broken up, and mixed together.
  Had this happened, it would have been physically impossible
  that they could ever have been restored to their old positions.
  Ice is, no doubt, plastic, and pressure, along with motion,

              Greenland and the Antarctic Continent.            357
might perhaps induce fresh lines of stratification; but neither
motion nor pressure could have selected broken blue bands
from among the white and placed them in their old positions.
   Why the icebergs from Greenland are not of the tabular
form and stratified like those of the Antarctic regions, is
doubtless owing to the fact that the Greenland ice is dis
charged through narrow fjords, which completely destroy the
original horizontal stratifications.
   Let us now see the consequence to which the foregoing
considerations all lead. The tabular form and flat-topped
character of the icebergs, with their perfectly horizontal bed
ding, show that they have been formed on a flat and even
surface. They show also that this flat surface is not a mere
local affair, but that it must be the general character of the
Antarctic land ; for all, or nearly all, of the bergs are of this
tabular form. Again, the unaltered character of the stratifi
cations of the bergs shows that there can be no great moun
tain-ranges, or even much rough and uneven ground in the
interior; for if there were, the bergs in their passage outwards
would have had to pass over it ; and this they could not have
done and still have retained, as they actually have, their hori
zontal stratifications undisturbed. These icebergs, as we have
seen, must have traversed in their outward motion, before
being disconnected with the ice-sheet, a distance of hundreds
of miles ; yet none of them bear the marks of having passed
down or across a valley or even over roclies moutonnees.
   That the Antarctic continent has a flat and even surface, the
character of the icebergs shows beyond dispute. But this, it
will be urged, does not prove that this surface may not be
greatly elevated ; in other words, that it may not be a flat
elevated plateau. This, of course, is true ; but it is evidently
far more likely that this region, nearly 3000 miles across,
should consist of flat dismembered land, or groups of low
islands separated and surrounded by shallow seas, than that it
should consist of a lofty plateau without either hills, valleys,
or mountain-ridges. In this case it may be that the greater
part of the Antarctic ice-cap rests on land actually below sea-
level —viz. on the floor of the shallow seas surrounding those
island-groups.     We know that such a condition of things
was actually the case in regard to the great ice-sheet of North
western Europe during the glacial epoch. A glance at the
Chart of the path of the ice given in ' Climate and Time,'
p. 448 (which since its publication has been proved to be cor
rect in almost every particular), will show that the larger portion
of the sheet rested on the bed of the Baltic, German Ocean,
and the seas around Great Britain and Ireland and the Orkney

358                      Dr. J. Croll on the Ice of
and Shetland islands. Unit the Antarctic ice was formed on
low and flat land bordered for considerable distances by shoal
water was the opinion also of Sir Wyville Thomson.
   Assuming then, what seems thus probable, that the Antarctic
regions consist of low discontinuous land, it will help to explain,
as will be shown in a future paper, the disappearance of the ice
during the warm interglacial periods of the southern hemisphere.
     On the Argument against the Existence of a South-Polar Ice
 cap.—We have certainly no evidence that during even the
 severest part of the glacial epoch an ice-cap, like that advo
 cated by Agassiz and other extreme glacialists, ever existed
 at the North Pole ; I am, however, unable to admit with
 Mr. Alfred R. Wallace that some such cap, though of smaller
 dimensions, does not at present exist at the South Pole. Speak
 ing of the Antarctic ice-cap, Mr. Wallace says :—" A similar
 ice-cap is, however, believed to exist on the Antarctic Pole at
 the present day. We have, however, shown that the produc
 tion of any such ice-cap is improbable, if not impossible ;
 because snow and ice can only accumulate where precipitation
 is greater than molting and evaporation, and this is never the
 case except in areas exposed to the full influence of the vapour-
 bearing winds. The outer rim of the ice-sheet would in
 evitably exhaust the air of so much of its moisture, that what
 reached the inner parts would produce far less snow than would
 be melted by the long hot days of summer"*.
     This opinion, that the mass of ice is probably greatest at the
 outer rim, which of course is most exposed to moist winds,
 and that it gradually becomes less and less as we proceed
 inwards till at last it disappears altogether, is by no means
 an uncommon one. At the present moment while I write
  (July 9th), Professor Nordenskjold is probably attempting
 to cross the inland ice of Greenland with the hope of finding
  in the interior, hills, valleys, and green fields completely free
 from ice.
     It by no means follows, as some might be apt to suppose,
 that the ice must be thickest where the snowfall is greatest.
  In case of continental ice the greatest thickness must always
  be at the centre of dispersion ; but it is here that, owing to
  distance from the ocean, the snowfall is likely to be least.
     We have no reason to believe that the quantity of snow
  falling, at least at the South Pole, is not considerable. Lieut.
     * 'Island Life,' p. 156. I am unable to reconcile the above altogether
  with what Mr. \\allace says at page 132, where he refers approvingly
  to my statement that the Antarctic ice-sheet has been proved to be in some
  places at least over a mile in thickness at the edge, and that it must con
  sequently be far thicker inland.

               Greenland and the Antarctic Continent.            359
  Wilkes estimated the snowfall of the Antarctic regions to be
  about 30 feet per annum; and Sir John Ross says that during
  a whole month they had only three days free from snow. But
  there is one circumstance which must tend to make the snow
  fall near the South Pole considerable, and that is the inflow of
  moist winds in all directions towards it ; and as the area on
  which these currents deposit their snow becomes less and less
  as the Pole is reached, this must, to a corresponding extent,
  increase the quantity of snow falling on a given area. Let us
  assume, for example, that the clouds in passing from lat. o'0°
  to lat. 80° deposit moisture sufficient to produce, say, 30 feet
  of snow per annum, and supposing that by the time they
  reach lat. 80° they are in possession of only one tenth part of
  their original store of moisture, still, as the area between lat.
  80° and the Pole is but one eighth of that between lat. 60°
  and 80°, this would notwithstanding give 24 feet as the annual
  amount of snowfall between lat. 80 and the Pole.
     However small may be the snowfall, and consequent amount
 of ice formed annually around the South Pole, unless it all
 melted it must of necessity accumulate year by year till the
 sheet becomes thickest there ; for the ice could not move out
 of its position till this were the case- But supposing there
 were no snow whatever falling at the Pole and no ice being
 formed there, still this would not alter this state of matters ;
 for in this case the ice forming at some distance from the Pole
 all around would flow back towards the centre, and continue
 to accumulate there till the resistance to the inward flow
 became greater than the resistance to the outward; but this
 state would not be reached till the ice became at least as
 thick on the poleward as on the outward side. There is no
 evading of this conclusion unless we assume, what is certainly
very improbable, if not impossible, viz. that the ice flowing
polewards should melt as rapidly as it advances. We know,
however, that in respect to the ice which flows outwards
towards the sea little, if any, of it is melted ; and it is only
after it breaks off in the form of bergs and floats to warmer
latitudes that it disappears, and that even with difficulty. It
is therefore not likely that the ice flowing inwards towards the
Pole, and without the advantage of escape in the form of bergs,
should all happen to melt. If little or none of the ice flowing
toward the Equator melts, it is physically impossible that all
the ice flowing polewards should manage to do so ; and if it
did not all melt, it would accumulate year by year around the
Pole till it acquired a thickness sufficient to prevent any further
flow in that direction, or, in other words, till its thickness at
the Pole became as great as it is all around.

3C0                  Mr. F. Y. Edgeworth on the
    The opinion that the great mass of the ice on the Antarctic
continent and also on Greenland lies near to the outer edge,
and that it gradually diminishes inwards till at last it disap
pears, is evidently one based on a misapprehension as to the
physical conditions of continental ice. I cannot help believing
that had Professor Nonlenskjold duly reflected on the neces
sary physical and mechanical conditions of the problem which
he is endeavouring to solve, he would not have undertaken
the journey ncross the Greenland ice.
    Note, September 22nd.—Baron Nordenskjold has just re
turned, and, as might have been expected, he found the
 interior of Greenland a desert of ice, with the icy plain gra
dually sloping upwards to the interior. The ice rose at the
 furthest spot reached (280 miles from the coast) to 7000 feet
 above the sea, and was still seen to rise to the east. The
 results of the expedition are, however, of the most important
 character, confirming, as they do, the true theory of conti
nental ice.
   L. The Method of Least Squares. By F. Y. Edgeworth,
       M.A., Lecturer on Logic at King\t College, London*.

 fTPHE Law of Error and the Method of Least Squares do
  -1- not traverse the same ground ; and the direction of the
 one course of reasoning is inverse to that of the other. In the
 former we derive the formation of a source t of error from the
 confluence of an indefinite number of small tributaries. In
 the latter we start from a position lower down on the stream
 of causation, from observations resulting from a source of
 error, and reason up from given observations (accompanied
  with some knowledge of the source of error from which they
  result) to (a more complete knowledge of) the source of error,
  the facility-curve under which the observations range them
  selves. For example:— Given .rj, ,r2, &c. observations diver
  ging according to a probability-curve of known modulus, but
  unknown centre, to determine the centre. These distinctions
  are likely to recommend themselves to those who have studied
  Mr. Glaisher's article and other first-rate authorities. But
  there is another distinction, more interesting to the philo-
     * Communicated by tlie Author.
    t According- to the received view, one particular source—the probability-
 curve ; according to our views, a great variety of facility-curves (see pre
 vious paper).

sopher and less familiar to the mathematician, namely, that
in the Law of Errors we are concerned only with the objec
tive quantities about which mathematical reasoning is ordi
narily exercised : whereas in the Method of Least Squares, as
in the moral sciences, we are concerned with a psychical
quantity—the greatest possible quantity of advantage. To illus
trate this application of mathematics to psychical quantity is
the primary object of the following paper ; a secondary pur
pose is to classify the problems falling under our title (taken
in a wide sense), and to offer some contributions towards their
solution.
    In order to attain the first object it is not necessary to go
much beyond Laplace's Method of Least Squares. In the
problem of Book II. art. 20 Laplace in effect, if not very ex
plicitly, assumes that the sought result may be regarded as a
linear function of the observations. He posits this form of
the restilt, not assuming that the most probable value expressed
in terms of the observations will be a linear function of the
observations, which is in fact not generally true, but selecting
the linear form as most advantageous, advantageous in respect
of convenience to the calculator ;ind avoidance of trouble. The
linear form being assumed, Laplace goes on to determine the
 values of the constants. He decides in favour of the system
 of values which are inversely proportional to the respective
 mean squares of error upon two grounds, of which the second
 is here regarded as the more fundamental—namely, that
 system of values is to be preferred which minimizes the dis
 advantage incurred in the long run by employing any par
 ticular system of values. Laplace takes as the measure of
 this integrated disadvantage the mean error. Gauss (dissent
 ing from Laplace on what may seem almost trivial grounds)
 takes as the "moment" of error the measure of detriment
 incurred in the long run, the mean square. And it is con
  ceivable that another criterion, which, in comparison with that
  of Laplace and Gauss, may be described as the mean zero
 power (corresponding to that system which, as compared with
 other linear systems, affords the most probable value), may
  have been assumed by some, not as a first principle (Mr.
  Glaisher's view, to be presently considered), but as a deriva
  tive principle, as the measure of disadvantage.
     It is here submitted that these three criteria are equally
  right and equally wrong. The probable error, the mean error,
  the mean square of error, are forms divined to resemble in an
  essential feature the real object of which they are the imper
  fect symbols—the quantity of evil, the diminution of pleasure,
  incurred by error. The proper symbol, it is submitted, for

 302             Mr. F. Y. Edgeworth on the
 the quantity of evil incurred by a simple error is not any
 power of the error, nor any definite function at all, but an
 almost arbitrary function, restricted only by the conditions
that it should vanish when the independent variable, the error,
vanishes, and continually increase with the increase of the
 error. The proper symbol for the disadvantage incurred in the
 long run is an integral whose elements involve as factors the
said arbitrary function. Advancing, then, in the direction in
dicated by Laplace and Gauss, let us designate the disadvan
tage of a single error by the symbol F(.r2), where x is the
amount of error and F continually increases with x. Or, if
the detriment is not a symmetrical function of error, is not
equal for the same extent of error, whether it be in excess or
defect, put F(x) for the right-hand value of x, and f{x) for
the left-hand value of x ; x being taken as positive in both
cases. Now suppose we have adopted some particular system
of values for the constants <yj, y3, &c. Then, by the law of
errors, if we make several sets of observations, say
                        Xi      X3   X3 &c,
                        x-i     x3' xs' &c,

 least possible when a is the least possible. Which was to be
 demonstrated.
    By an extension of the preceding reasoning we obtain the
 following fundamental theorem. One instrument (or one
 method of using the same instrument, one method of treating
 given observations) is to be preferred to another, when, <j>\(x),

    It may be objected that these results might better have
 been grounded on the more solid and objective foundation of
 greatest probability rather than greatest advantage; agreeably
 to Laplace's first view as formulated by Mr. Grlaisher*—
 namely, it being assumed that the quantity to be measured is
accurately determined, if its error lies between zero and infinite
 simal k, that system of factors which renders the probability that
 the result obtained by means of them is accurately determined
greater than the probability of a result obtained by means of any
other system of factors is to be preferred. It may be replied
that the principles of greatest advantage and greatest proba
bility do not coincide in general ; that here, as in other depart
ments of action, when there is a discrepancy between the
principle of utility and any other rule, the former should have
precedence.
    To exhibit this discrepancy it suffices to observe that the
disadvantage which it is proposed to minimize is the loss of
utility, the quantity of pain due to an erroneous measure
being employed in practice, in the arts. Why is this evil a
minimum when the probability of our measurement being
within the distance k of the real quantity is a maximum ? Let
us take a simple, although grotesque, example. Here are two
shoemakers competing for the contract to supply an army with
boots. Other things heing equal, we have to select him who
makes the best fits, who minimizes the disadvantage expressed
by Horace:—
                        " . . . . ut calceus olim,
         Si pede major erit, subvertet ; si minor, uret."
       * Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society, xl. p. 101.

 364               Mr. F. Y. Edgeworth on the
 Is the shoemaker who makes a rather greater proportion of
 exact fits (who has a smaller probable error), but when he does
 make a misfit makes a terribly painful one, necessarily the
 most advantageous? To quote Horace* again, the slave who,
 in spite of his many accomplishments, " semel Intuit " (" once
 and but once I caught him in a lie," as Pope turns it), may
 have had, so to speak, a less " probable error," and yet may
 have been less " advantageous " to his master than one who
 had a greater number of less serious faults. The man who
 seldom tells a lie, but when lie docs "lies like a man," may do
 more harm than the habitual dealer in white lies. I am
 aware that there is something paradoxical in the preceding
 illustrations ; but I submit that it would be affectation in a
 mathematical writer not occasionally to glance at the real
 objects to which his ideal conceptions are applied, and that
 the disadvantages just instanced are quite homogeneous with,
 only more familiar than, the disadvantage due to the employ
ment in the arts of erroneous measurement (e. g. the disad
 vantage of astronomical mismeasurement), the disadvantage
which, according to Laplace and Gauss, it is the object of the
calculus to minimize.
    The following is a more dignified example. Here are two
instruments of observation, the errors incurred by which are
ranged respectively under a probability-curve with modulus
                                             1      c
unity, and under the facility-curve y —          ..   2, where c is
                                             7T C T X
small. Which of these instruments is to be preferred? Ac
cording to Mr. Glaisher's test, unquestionably the latter. But,
according to our view, it may well happen that the disadvan
tage in the long run is in the former case finite, in the latter
case infinite: for example, if the disadvantage dependent upon
a particular error may be expressed as any power (not less
than the first), or sum of powers, of the extent of error.
   Nor, again, does the principle of greatest probability as
compared with the principle of greatest utility give a con
sonant answer in the following case : —Given the law of
error of a certain instrument, is it better to make a practice
of confining ourselves to a single observation, or of proceeding
to an average? Upon Mr. Glaisher's view, if the average
facility-curve is such as to have its maximum value (its head,
so to speak) above the primary curve, the average must be
preferable to the simple observation. This also follows from
our first principle (by the theory of p. 363) when there is only
one intersection between the primary and average serai-curves ;
but not quite generally. Suppose that there are three inter-
                            • Ep. II. 2.

sections on each side of the origin, and that the space on each
side of the origin is divided by ordinates (one at the origin,
one at infinity, and two intermediate) into three compartments
such that for each compartment the area bounded by the
abscissa, ordinates, and primary curve is equal to the area
bounded by the same right lines and the average curve.
Suppose, further, that throughout the first and third compart
ments the disutility-function is almost level, the disadvantage
of a particular error only just increases with the extent of error,
while in the second compartment the same function rises steeply.
Then the appropriate mathematico-psychical reasoning will
show that it is better to abide by a single observation than
to take an average.
    The two preceding examples, to which it would be easy to
add others similar, are not put forward as practically impor
tant, but rather (like the imaginary cases put by Hume in

distinguish the general principle from the particular rule, and
in the act of doing so to discern the supremacy of the prin
ciple of utility.
    We have next to review some typical instances of the
problems solved by the method of least squares. Let us take
as the principle of a rough classification, complexity. As
a first division we may demarcate those cases in which there
is but one measurable; a single quantity x, whereof a-j, x3, &c.
are values, or more generally functions, given. This class
 may be subdivided according as the facility-curves which
generate ,vu xl} &c. are (I.) or are not (II.) symmetrical. In
 the simpler cases we need not tike the trouble of distinguishing
 between the most probable and most advantageous values, since
 they are coincident. But the distinction soon emerges.
    Subclass I. may be subdivided according as the symmetrical
 facility-curves under which the observations are ranged are
 (A) or are not (B) Probability-cmves.
    I. A (1) The following is one of the simplest problems
 which our subject presents :—Given a set of observations xu
 xs, &c, and given that they have been generated by diver
 gence from an unknown point according to one given law of
error, a probability-curve of given modulus, to find the most
 probable (and advantageous) value for the unknown point.
 By a familiar application of the differential calculus the sought
value is the mean of the observations.
    A variant of this problem is when the observations are dis
tributed into groups, each of which diverges from one and the
same unknown point according to different given probability-
curves. The solution is of course the weighted mean.

 366                Mr. F. Y. Edgeworth on the
    Another variant in this and, be it said once for all, all the
 subsequent typical problems, is when the observations stand
 for, not the simple value of, but definite functions of, the real
 quantity.
    I. A (2) Given a set of observations xlt tc2, &c, and given
 that they were generated by divergence according to a given
 curve of probability of which the modulus is not given but
 sought. Let c be sought modulus ; then it must be taken so
       (I V ft _Tj2+r22+&c.
        —) e         «*     should be a maximum; whence
                               2
    A variant would be the case when the observations are dis
 tributed into groups, each with a different modulus, and the
 ratio between the moduli is given.
    I. A (3) By the degradation of the data in either of
 the preceding problems we reach the complex problem :—
 Given a set of observations xu <r2, &c, and given that they
 have been generated by divergence according to one and the
 same probability-curve from a single point, but given neither
that point nor the modulus, to find both. Put as the proba
bility of the concurrence of a particular central point and a
particular modulus

Equating to zero the first term of variation (that is, equating
to zero the coefficient of </f and also the coefficient of dc in
the development of the above propositvm), we have two equa
 tions to determine £ and c. Whence the most probable value
of f is the mean of xu .r2, &c, and the most probable value of
c is the square root of twice the mean square of apparent errors,

 case of an infinite number of errors ; that, for the finite case,
 there would usually be substituted (n— 1) for n in the above
 value of c. It is with the greatest diffidence that I submit a
 statement which seems to be contradicted by the most distin
 guished authorities, including Gauss and Airy*; and only
 not contradicted, but not, as far as I remember, asserted, by
 Laplace and Poisson. Perhaps I have misunderstood the
 qusesitum proposed by Airy, Merrimanf, and other writers.
 For I assert with some confidence that (in spite of the rather
 puzzling expressions of some authors) the procedure above em
 ployed to determine the maximum of an expression involving
 two independent variables is correct. I submit also that the
 only significant, or at least the most important, quaesita
 afforded by the case in hand are either what was enounced
 above, or what is the " probable error " J incurred by taking
 the mean of the observations as the real value. To investigate
 this probable error, it is proper to consider the given observa
 tions as generated by one of an indefinite number of consti
 tutions corresponding to the different values of f and c's, each
 of which operates in the long run a number of times propor-

The errors committed by taking the mean as the real value are
ranged under the above* sub-exponential expression. Whence
it appears that what may be called the measure of the pro
bable error is the sum of the squares of the apparent errors
divided by n, not, as some might seem to imply, by (n — 1);

priety, is not to be multiplied by the usual factor -476, but by
the length of the abscissa which halves the half-area of the
curve just indicated.

2 — ^—        (where £ is the mean of the observations) instead
of 2 v - '       in the present and similar problems, namely,
that the latter expression, the sum of squares of apparent
errors, is certainly less than the sum of squares of real errors,
appears to be true but not pertinent. For what have we to do
with the sum of squares of real errors, except as a mark of
one or other of the quaesita above proposed?—(1) The law
according to which the observations diverged, the mo
dulus of the probability-curve, from the groups constituted by
which the observations are regarded as random selections ;
(2) the errors incurred by taking the mean as the real value
It may be observed, too, that the most probable value (as de
duced from the observations) of the sum of squares of real
errors is the sum of squares of apparent errors ; a statement
which is quite consistent with the admission that this latter
value is certainly (infinitely probably) less than the real value.
The case might be compared to the following :—A random
selection of an abscissa being made from the group indicated

of the square of the selected abscissa. It is zero. Yet it is
infinitely probable that the real value is greater than zero.
   It appears from the subexponential form* incidental to this
problem, that if, after taking the mean of a group of observa
tions of the type I. A. 3, we take the mean of a second group
of the same type, the mean of those two means (or of any
number of such means) is not likely to be as much nearer the
true value as might have been expected.
   A variant of Prob. (3) is obtained by the distribution of the
observations into groups each of the type (3). This variant
might be obtained from the variant of Prob. I. Thus, suppo
sing the limits of the groups still given, let our knowledge of
the weight corresponding to each group be degraded through
all degrees of conjectural knowledge to absolute uncertainty.
Now let the barriers which separate the groups be unfixed,
and finally become absolutely uncertain, and we shall have
reached a fourth case,
   I. A 4, in which we do not know the weight of any of the
observations ; and they may all, for all we know, have differ
ent weights. The solution may be reserved till we reach the
more general case of I. B. 4.
   I. B. Facility-curves which are symmetricalf, but not pro
bability-curves, present similar cases for the exact solution of
which it would be necessary to assume as given some particular

as Donkin has observed}, it were possible by an unimaginable
perfection of the calculus of functions to take, as it were, a
mean of all admissible functions.
   Approximate solutions of cases under this heading are given
by the Method of Least Squares, as discovered by Laplace.
Concerning these it may be observed that, if the subexponential
form is an appreciable ingredient of the elemental facility-
corves, then the factors assigned by the method of least squares
are not in general the most advantageous. It is obvious to
object that the number of the observations in the case to which
the Method of Least Squares is applicable is supposed infinite;
and therefore that the principle mentioned in the Postscript
of the previous paper will apply. But then infinite is to bo
interpreted here as very large. Or, rather, not so very large;

370               Mr. F. Y. Edgeworth on the
accuracy I impugn. How, then, can we be certain that the
effect of a suboxponential ingredient is extinguished ?
   Agreeably to the distinction clearly exhibited by Mr.
Glaisher (op. cit. p. 102 foot, and p. 103), the method of least
squares belongs to B (3) or B (4) according as it is, or is
not, given that all the observations have the same weight. The
latter case presents the much vexed question, What shall be
done with considerable outlying errors ? Shall the exceptional
observation bo omitted from the average, as Peirce* says? Or
shall it count for one, as Airy saysf ? Or shall it count indeed,
but not count for one, as says DoMorgan ? Upon the hypo
thesis here entertained DeMorgan's view is undoubtedly cor
rect in theory, though in practice it may not differ from the
practice of Peirce. The approximative method is justified in
following the analogy of the exact method ; which would,
according to the inverse method here all along contemplated,
include all the data among the premises, though it may be
that the conclusion, which is a function of them all, is less
affected by (the variation or omission of) some than others.
Thus, to take an example transferred here from its proper
place (A 4) : suppose we have two observations, xx and x2,
close together, and a third outlying, given that the generating
facility-curves are probability-curves, but nothing further.
 Then we have to determine x, hx, h2, h3, so that
                ir~ i M2A3 e-[*>,<I-*l>*+**I--1*>,+*3,<*-*i),]

 When two observations are close together, the root of x which
 lies close to tho two observations is evidently the appropriate
value. The weight of those two observations is then high ;
the weight of the third observation, if it lies at a distance from
the other two, is small. These considerations may easily be
extended to the case of any number of observations given by
probability-curves. The equation
                 X — Xi   x—x2
is easily formed, and admits of approximative treatment for
one or two observations remote from the majority ; and doubt
less in other cases.
    In case of laws of error other than probability-curves, the
method of course does not afford the most probable value. But
I submit that the method is still a very advantageous method;
more advantageous both in respect of accuracy and conve
nience than the method proposed by DeMorgan and Mr.
Glaisher. Our method is at least accurate in one case, and
that the very important and typical case of the law of error
being a probability-curve ; comparable in that respect to La
place's treatment of the sought value as a linear function of
the observations; a procedure which leads to the most probable
value in the case of probability-curves, but is in general only
a convenient, an advantageous, procedure*. But their method
is never (except by chance) accurate, and always inconvenient.
As I understand Mr. Glaisher, if three observations of \m-
known weight are given, say xu xt, x3, his procedure is first
to take the mean Xi — x* — x'-; then to form the apparent
errors Xi    'I3—— &c. ; then to form what may be called the
              d
provisional weight (for all the observations),

   It may be questioned whether this is exactly the procedure
which DeMorgan had in view. Would not his language apply
to the following process ? Find, as before, the prima facie
value        4       > then calculate the weights, upon the prin
             ts
ciples herein adopted, on the hypothesis that the putative is
the real point ; and that the apparent errors are the result of
divergence therefrom, according to probability-curves of dif
ferent moduli. The weights* are

 curves, to the most probable value, which is

 Query whether the DeMorgau-Glaisher process would ulti
 mately reach the most probable value. Their method, then,
 appears to be less advantageous in respect of accuracy than
 the method here suggested. Their method would perhaps be
 more advantageous in respect of convenience in some cases
 where the real weights are nearly equal, and not many ap-
 Eroximative steps are required. It must be remembered,
   owever, that in these cases, as our analysis shows, the obser
 vations must be close together; and therefore that our method
 also becomes facilitated in this case. For instance, taking the
 mean of the observations as origin, neglect powers higher
 than the second of xl} xi} &c. measured from this origin.

Then the general equation for x becomes
         nx»- 1 - (n — 1        . a"-* + (n — 2 )%xrx, x—*,
 which reduces to a quadratic. And in the general case the
coefficients of the equation of the (»— l)th degree, consisting
of combinations of the observations, might possibly be eva
luated by a calculating machine. Whereas the alternative
methods do not seem equally to lend themselves to mechanical
treatment. It may be questioned, therefore, whether even in
respect of convenience the DeMorgan-Glaisher method has the
advantage.
   II. The difficulties thicken as the hypotheses become more
rarefied. For unsymmetrical facility-curves the most pro
bable value is not in general, even presumably, coincident
with the most advantageous value. The most probable
value may, of course, be determined if we assume a particular
form of facility-curve, and determine by inverse calculations
analogous to those already given the value of the constants.
It should be observed that we must here expressly assume,
what before was taken for granted, that is, not only what the
form of each generating facility-curve is, but also how it is
disposed with regard to the real point. Whereas in unsym
metrical curves the longest ordinate, the centre of gravity,
the bisection of the area, may all correspond to different ab
scissae, which of them, if any of them, corresponds to the real
point ?
   The scruple just raised affects also that approximative me
thod of determining the most advantageous value, which is
afforded by Poisson s extension of what may be called Laplace's
law of errors ; I mean Poisson's proof that, even in the case
of unsymmetrical curves, the several values of a linear func
tion of observation, 71^1 + 7^ + ^c' /_ _ &C- being nume-
rous), may be regarded as ranged under a probability-curve,
whose centre is the mean of the mean errors of the elemental
curves. If now each facility-curve be so disposed about the
"real point" (as, waving metaphysical difficulties, I have
called it), then indeed the weighted mean* will be the most
advantageous value ; but not in general. Poisson himself, as
I understand him, points out this cause of failure (Connaissance
des Temps, 1832 " Suite," § 9 beginning).
   A fresh difficulty, connected with a fresh quaesitum, now
also makes its appearance. We have all along described the
method of least squares (taken in a large sense) as an inverse
  * Assuming of course that the utility-functions are symmetrical, and
that the influence of subexponential elements may be neglected.

374             On the Method of Least Squares.
process by which we remount from measurements to the mea
surable, from the plural manifestations of a thing to the thing
itself. But now there becomes differentiated another quassitum
which has hitherto been coincident with the above; viz. given
n manifestations (observations), what is the (most probable or
most advantageous) value of the (n + l)th manifestation ? For
example, if the positions of n shot-marks on a target are
reported to me, and it is given that they are all results of
firing at a wafer, I can in my study calculate (1) the most
probable position at which the shots were fired ; (2 ) (suppo
sing that the firing is renewed after the n observations have
been noted) the point most likely to be hit by the (n+l)th
shot. When the law according to which the shots diverge
right or left of the bulls-eye is symmetrical, these qusesita are
identical, but not otherwise.
   Continually degrading our data concerning the genesis of
the observations supplied to us, as hypothesis after hypothesis
unwinds, we should come to the very zero of assumption—
absolute ignorance as to the genesis of xx, x-2, &c. In this case
many of the preceding problems become unmeaning. But
not the least important—what is the most probable (or advan
tageous) value of the (n-f l)th observation—may still be asked.
An answer, which is probably not altogether valueless, but
serviceable as a starting-point for hypotheses, is afforded by
the remarkable method explained by Boole in the ' Proceedings
of the Royal Society of Edinburgh ; ' especially if we admit,
what Boole does not admit, that the value of a quite unknown
constant expressing probability is to be treated as £ ; as
Donkin* contends. Both Donkin's assumption and those
upon which the whole of Boole's new method of probability
is grounded are not to be regarded as arbitrary, but as the
solid result of experience—that constants do in general in
rerum naturd as often present one value as another. This
principle is illustrated by the occurrence of one digit as often
as another in natural constants (a fact actually verified by
Mr. Proctor in the case of logarithms). The principle is
verified and shown to be at least a good working hypothesis
by the fact that it underlies all the methods of least squares.
For they all presuppose that the a priori probability of the
real quantity, the qusesitum, being, say, between a and
a + Aa, is the same as the a priori probability of its being be
tween b and b + Ab—between formally infinite and practically
considerable limits. And this supposition of equal a priori
probability can have no significance, as Mr. Vennf well

reasons, unless it mean that measurables do, as a matter of
fact, as often have one value as another. But, in touching
these considerations, we have already passed the frontier which
separates mathematical reasoning from general philosophy.
    It remains only to add that the preceding problems are im
mensely complicated when, instead of our single variable x,
there are several variables ; but that these additional difficulties
have been triumphed over by a long line of distinguished
mathematicians, from Laplace to Glaisher.
  LI. Description of an Apparatus to illustrate the Product ion
      of Work by Diffusion. By C. J. Woodward, B.Sc*
DIFFUSION, as a source of energy, is usually shown in
         the lecture-room by bringing a jar of hydrogen over a
porous vessel fitted up with a glass tube dipping into water.
 Hydrogen, by inward diffusion, enters the jar; the internal
pressure thus produced forces the water down, and a stream of
bubbles escapes from the tube. On removing now the jar of
hydrogen, outward diffusion of the hydrogen takes place, a
minus pressure is produced in the porous vessel, and the water
 is lifted.
    The apparatus I am about to describe is an adaptation of this
experiment to the production of an oscillatory movement of a
beam from alternate inward and outward diffusion of hydrogen.

pan and counterpoise, B, and at the other the porous jar, C,
fitted with a cork, and a glass tube c which dips into a gas-jar
D containing water or methylated spirit. Three or four glass
jets, of which one is shown at E, are supported in a horizontal
position, and the opening of each jet is placed as near as pos
sible to the porous vessel without touching it during the oscil
lations of the beam. These jets are connected by means of a
flexible tube with a gas-holder containing hydrogen; the bell of
the holder being loaded so as to force the hydrogen in a gentle
 stream against the sides of the porous vessel. The best position
 for the jets is found by trial ; but usually I place them a little
 below the middle of the porous jar when the beam is horizontal.
 The action of the apparatus is simple. On turning on the hy
 drogen, inward diffusion takes place, producing plus pressure
 within the jar; this pressure is resisted equally in all direc
 tions but the vertical, and in this direction, owing to the little
 friction of the water, movement takes place, and the jar rises.
 When the jar has risen above the jets, inward diffusion dimi
 nishes, or perhaps ceases, while outward diffusion of the hy
 drogen commences ; a minus pressure is thus produced in the
 porous vessel, and the external pressure of the air causes it to
 descend. This descent brings the jar again opposite the jets,
 when the series of movements again begins.
     The work done with this arrangement is very small, and
 falls far short of the theoretical value*. For the best effect
 the jar should be surrounded by hydrogen for inward diffusion
 to take place, and subsequently the connexion with the hydro
 gen should be completely cut off and air take its place. I
 have tried to devise some water-seal arrangement by which
 the flow of hydrogen could be turned off and on at the right
 moments by the movement of the beam; but have not suc
 ceeded, as the friction thus introduced would be more than
 the movement of the beam could overcome. In the arrange
 ment exhibited there is a considerable waste of energy due to
 the imperfect cut-off of the hydrogen, even when the flow
 of gas has been regulated so as to obtain the maximum effect.

          LII. On Curved Diffraction-gratings.—II.
           By R. T. Glazebrook, M.A., F.R.S.*
IN the September number of the Philosophical Magazine
      there is a paper by Prof. Rowland on my paper read
before the Physical Society bearing the above title. In that
paper (Phil. Mag. June 1883) I investigated the aberration
of a curved diffraction-grating ruled so that the spaces between
the lines are equal when measured along the arc of the curve,
and applied my results to Professor Rowland's gratings.
Until Professor Rowland's paper (Phil. Mag. Sept. 1883),
this assumption had been made explicitly or tacitly in all I
have seen written on the subject. In that paper Prof. Row
land mentions (I think for the first time in print) that the
spaces are equal, not along the arc, but along the chord of the
arc, and therefore that my theory fails to apply to the gra
tings as he rules them. Owing to absence from home I have
not until the present date (October 3) had an opportunity of
reading Professor Rowland's paper carefully. I wish now to
express my agreement with him so far as this criticism is con
cerned, and to show the concurrence of results between the two
methods of attacking the problem followed by Professor Row
land and myself respectively when the gratings are ruled in
the manner he has adopted. Another criticism is, that I have
supposed the gratings to be ruled on a cylindrical instead of a
spherical surface. To this I would reply (1) that Prof. Row
land does the same himself. " For the particular problem in
hand," he says, " we need only work in the plane xy at pre
sent." And throughout the paper he works in the plane my.
This is clearly equivalent to treating the surface as cylindrical.
And (2) we are both quite right in so doing.

A B C in B. Then, if P be any point in A B C, Q P + P Q' is a
minimum when P coincides with B ; and the portion of the
line ABC which is effective in illuminating Q' is an element
near B*. Similar results follow for each of the other reflecting-
lines of the grating; and these small elements all lie in the
plane Q 0 Qf. Thus, in considering the diffraction effects, we
need only consider a section of the grating by this plane; and
this is what has been done both by Professor Rowland and
myself.
   With regard to the last paragraph of Prof. Rowland's note,
I would avail myself of this opportunity of stating that I had
no idea that the method referred to was that by which he had
arrived at the theory of the concave grating, or that any
account of such method had been previously given. It seemed
to me instructive, and so I mentioned it. Prof. Rowland's
paper is a conclusive proof of its power. I can only express
the regret that my absence from the mooting of the Physical
 Society in November, at which Prof. Rowland's paper was
read, has led me to appear to claim a priority which really
belongs to him.
   In Prof. Rowland's paper he treats of the aberration by
considering how much the spaces between two consecutive
lines ruled near the edge of the grating differ from theoretical
perfection. In mine 1 determine the difference in phase be
tween the light to the focus coming from the two extreme
lines of the grating.

light on the circle through 0 which touches the grating in A,
 then w = a cos            Hence u'= a cos yjr, and the coefficient of
 sin3 to vanishes; so that we require to consider the term
 sin4 to. Also, if PN be perpendicular to OA, and a be the dis
 tance between two lines measured along NP (this in Prof.
 Rowland's gratings is constant), since P is on the wth line,

 rigorously satisfied for all values of n} and the aberration
 involve only terms in sin4 to.
     If, as I assumed in my former paper, the spaces were equal

 which, on substitution in (4) and expansion of sin to, would give
  us a term in to3 on which the aberration would depend. Thus
  in Professor Eowlaiid's gratings the aberration (between the
 centre and extreme ray) is given by
                 J a sin4 a) (sin cf> tan <f> + sin i/r tan yjr).
  We may express this in terms of \ by means of the equation

              — 8                   sin <f>— sin yfr

  of phase is
                             + I nX sin3 to tan yfr.

In the second spectrum the difference will be doubled, and
so on. The corresponding departure from theoretical perfec
tion in ruling is, according to Prof. Rowland,
                              £ to3 tan yfr.
Thus in the two gratings discussed in my former paper, the
extreme difference of phase in the first spectrum will be about
 01 x X tan i/rinstead of "7X, and -04 x X tan yjr instead of 4-8 x X.
Quantities like this are quite inappreciable; and Professor
Rowland may indeed claim that his gratings are perfect so far
as this qualification is concerned. It will be interesting to
calculate the difference in the position of the extreme line in
the grating, supposing that the lines were ruled with equal
spaces along the arc instead of along the chord. The differ
ence clearly is that between aa> and a sin a>. For if m' be the
angle to the extreme line in this case we have
                 aa)' = n<r=a sin at = a(m — ^a>3) ;
and difference required is a(a> — to'), or
Taking the grating mentioned by Prof. Rowland in his paper,
the value of this is about yoJog of a centimetre, or little more
than the distance between two consecutive lines on the grating.
The extreme minuteness of the change required to produce so
great an alteration in the theoretical definition is very remark
able, and may help to give us some idea of the difficulties
Professor Rowland has had to surmount to produce his
gratings.
LIII. On the Magnetic Susceptibility and Retentiveness of Iron
   and Steel. By J. A. Ewing, B.Sc, F.R.S.E., Professor of
   Engineering in University College, Dundee, formerly Pro
  fessor of Mechanical Engineering and Physics in the Univer
   sity of Tokio*.
DURING three years the writer has been engaged, while
        in Japan, in prosecuting researches on the magnetiza
tion of iron and steel, and on the effects of stress on magnetic
susceptibility and thermoelectric quality. Preliminary notices
of some of his earlier results have appeared in the ' Pro
ceedings of the Royal Society ' (Nos. 214 and 216, 1881, and
No. 220, 1882); but a detailed account of the work has still
to be given. Meanwhile, the following points, not previously
noticed, are perhaps of sufficient interest to justify their sepa
rate publication.
   * Communicated by the Author, having been read before Section A of
the British Association at Southport.

  382      Prof. J. A. Ewing on the Magnetic Susceptibility
      In the experiments on magnetization, iron and steel wires
  were used, either welded into rings or in the form of straight
  pieces of such great length that the influence of the ends was
  negligible. Curves were obtained, in some cases by the
  ballistic method, and in others by the direct magnetometric
  method, showing the changes of magnetization which occurred
  when magnetizing force was gradually applied, withdrawn,
  reapplied, reversed, and so on.
     The results of many experiments with several specimens of
  carefully annealed soft-iron wires have shown that they possess
  in very high degree a property not generally credited to soft
  iron,—the property of remaining strongly magnetic when the
  magnetizing force is removed.
     As an example, the case may be cited of an annealed iron
  wire which was subjected to a magnetizing force of 22 "4
  C.G.S. units. This gave it a magnetic Induction amounting
 to 16,000 C.G.S. units. When the magnetizing force was
 gradually and completely removed, the Induction fell only to
  15,000 units. In other words, the Intensity of residual mag
 netization was equal to nearly 1200 C.Gr.S. units.
     Here more than 93 per cent, of the whole induced magneti
 zation survived the removal of the magnetizing force; while
 in many other cases the residual magnetism amounted to nearly
 i)0 per cent. The somewhat extraordinary spectacle was thus
 presented of a piece of soft iron, entirely free from magnetic
 influence, and nevertheless holding (per unit of its volume)
 an amount of magnetism far in excess of wbat is ever held by
permanent magnets of the best tempered steel.
    In this condition, however, the magnetic character of the
 iron is highly unstable. The application of a reverse mag
 netizing force quickly causes demagnetization ; and the
slightest mechanical disturbance has a similar effect. Gentle
tapping removes the residual magnetism almost completely.
Variations of temperature reduce it greatly, and so does any
application of stress. On the other hand, if the iron be
carefully protected from disturbance, it seems that the residual
magnetism disappears only very slowly, if at all, with the mere
lapse of time.
    If, after magnetization, the magnetizing force be removed
suddenly, the residual magnetism is, as might be expected,
less than if the force be removed gradually.
    The ratio of residual to total magnetization is always small
when the intensity of magnetization is small, and passes a
maximum when the intensity is increased. This maximum is
particularly distinct in wires which have been hardened by
stretching; but it also occurs in soft annealed wires. In one

                and Retentiveness of Iron and Steel.         383
instance, where the wire had been hardened by stretching,
the maximum ratio of residual to total magnetism was 0'60,
which was given by the application of a magnetizing force of
about 10 C.G.S. units ; but after the application of a force of
90 units the ratio fell to 0*33. In steel the maximum in this
ratio is less sharp, but still distinct. Neither in hard iron nor
in steel is the ratio, even at its maximum, so great as it is in
soft iron, where (as has been said) it frequently reaches 0"9.
   During the magnetization of soft-iron wires the greatest
ratio (k) of Intensity of magnetization (I) to magnetizing
force was generally about 200, sometimes nearly 300. And
by gently tapping the wire during the application of magneti
zing force, this coefficient was on one occasion raised to the
enormous value of 1590. In the case alluded to the magneti
 zation went on so rapidly as the magnetizing force was in
creased, that a force of 1 C.G.S. unit gave an Induction of
 10,000.
    In this and other particulars the experiments have been
 strongly confirmatory of the idea that there is in soft iron a
 static frictional resistance to the rotation of the magnetic
 molecules, which is the principal cause of the remarkable re
 tentiveness described above, and which is overcome by gentle
 mechanical agitation.
    Numerous measurements have been made of the energy
 expended in taking iron and steel through cyclic changes of
 magnetization. For example, in changing the magnetism of
 one specimen of annealed iron wire from I = 1250 to I = — 1240,
 and back, the amount of work done against magnetic friction
 (apart from any induction of currents) was 1670 centimetre-
 dynes per cubic centimetre of the metal. In hardened iron,
 and especially in steel, the work done is much greater.
    The effects of stress on existing magnetism and on mag
 netic susceptibility have been investigated at great length.
 The most remarkable effects occur in wires which have been
 hardened by stretching. In them the presence of a moderate
 longitudinal tensile stress increases the magnetic susceptibility
 immensely at low values of the magnetizing force, but dimi
 nishes it at high values. It also increases very greatly the
 ratio of residual to temporary magnetization. Each of these
 effects passes a maximum when the stress is sufficiently in
 creased.
    The whole subject is much complicated by the presence of
 the peculiar action which in previous papers the writer has
 named Hysteresis, the study of which, in reference both to
 magnetism and to thermoelectric quality, has formed a large
 part of his work.

 L1V. On the Distribution of Electricity on Hollow Conductors
    in Electrolytes. By Alfred Tribe, F.Inst. C, Lecturer on
    Chemistry in Dulurich College".
 THE point of view set out in my paper in the ' Proceedings
         of the Royal Society,' 1876, p. 310, would doubtless
 enable the general results of an examination into the distribu
 tion of electricity on hollow conductors in electrolytes to be
 foreseen. An experimental treatment of the subject, however,
 was desirable in order to establish definitely any a priori con
 clusion deduced either from analogy or general theoretical
 considerations. Experience in this case has verified the con
 clusion that the closest analogy would be found to exist
 between the distribution of electricity on hollow conductors in
electrolytic and in dielectric field's respectively. Other expe
 riments to be described in this paper show that the analogy
extends to cases where a conductor is enclosed in mefcil tubes
and even in tubes of wire gauze. A few associated experi
ments are also described in this paper, the results of which
may assist, when the subject is more developed, in determining
between the different views which present themselves, as to
the mode by which a metallic conductor becomes electrified
when placed in a binary compound undergoing electrolysis,
but not in metallic connexion with the electrodes.
   In the experiments to be described, an electrolytic cell was
employed, 120 millim. broad, 128 deep, and 305 long, filled to
within 8 millimetres with a 5-per-cent. solution of copper sul
phate, copper electrodes of tbe same area as the ends of the
cell, and a current of one ampere flowing for six miuutes.
The tubes or hollow conductors were in all cases placed
lengthwise, midway between the electrodes and perpendicular
to them, the bottom of the cell, and the surface of the electrolyte.
   Experiment.— A silver tube 100 millim. long, having an
internal diameter of 10 millim., was placed within the field of
action. The electrifications, in millimetres, counting from
the opposite ends of the tube, on the outside and inside respec
tively, and also the respective zones of non-evident electrifi
cation (intermedial space), were as below:—

             Distribution of Electricity in Electrolytes.       385
     In a second experiment a silver plate, 60 x 7 millim., was
 placed within the limits of no electrochemical action, along the
 axis of a similar silver tube, but not in metallic connexion with
 it, and then placed in the electrolyte as before. The silver plate
 was completely protected from electrification, at least signs of
 both copper and peroxide were entirely absent from the sur
 face of the plate. The electrifications on the tube itself were
 practically the same in area as in the first experiment.
     In a third experiment the plate of silver was equal in length
to the tube, t. e. 100 millim. The electrifications on the out
side of the tube wore again identical in area with those on the
corresponding parts of the tube in the first experiment. The
 — on the inside was also the same, but the + measured 4 mil
lim. less in length. The — electrification on the plate mea
sured 13 millim., and the + 15 millim.
    In a fourth experiment the silver plate projected 10 millim.
beyond the tube at both ends, t. e. the plate was 120 millim.
long. The electrifications on the tube itself, inside and out
side, were practically equal in area with those in the experi
ment last described. The areas on the plate, however, were
notably different. The limit of the — electrification was very
sharply defined, and measured only 11 millim., i. e. it pene
trated 1 millim. only within the tube. On the other hand the
 + measured 25 millim., and therefore penetrated 15 millim.
within the tube, the same as in the last experiment. The 10
millim. of the plate projecting beyond the ends of the tube
appeared then to have exerted no appreciable influence on the
capacity of the + electrification to diffuse itself over the sur
face of the plate within the tube. It was very different, how
ever, with the — electrification; so much so in fact as to almost
prevent its diffusion on that part of the plate coming imme
diately within the shadow, so to speak, of the hollow con
ductor.
    Faraday's well-known experiments on the distribution of an
electric charge on nets &c. naturally suggested the idea of
substituting tubes of wire gauze for those of metallic silver.
Gauze of copper wire was employed having 72 meshes to the
square centimetre. The area of the electrifications set up on
tubes of this material could not be ascertained with exactitude
for the reason that the limits of the opposite electrifications
were not so distinctly marked as in the case of the silver tubes;
but the distribution of electrochemical action was sufficiently
evident to leave no doubt as to the electrifications being mainly
confined to the external surfaces of wire gauze, when in the
form of tubes, and placed in the field of electrolytic action.

numbers in the fifth column express the power exercised by
the several tubes in protecting the partially enclosed plates
from electrification, and were found by subtracting the inter
medial space left on an unprotected plate (15 millim. as given
above) from the intermedial space obtained in the several ex
periments, as given in the third column of the Table.

tubes increased the power to protect from electrification the
part of the conductor within them would decrease. These
results show, moreover, that in the experiment with the small

electrification of the same sign on the plate 3 millim. from
the mouth of the tube ; and that in the third experiment the
— electrification on the plate passed only 2 millim. within
a tube of 40 millim. diameter. In connection with this, which
may prove to be decisive evidence of a repulsive action, 1
would point to the different magnitudes of the electrifications
(especially the — ) on the plate in the fourth experiment with
the silver tube (page 385) and on the plate in the experiment
with the smallest tube of gauze respectively. In the former
of these experiments the — electrification on the plate mea
sured 11 millim., while in the latter the same electrification
measured only 7 millim., the only difference in the two expe
riments being in the material and structure of the tubes.

 LV. On the Reality of Force. By Walter R. Browne, M.A.,
     M. friDt. C.E., late Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge* .
 THE Royal Society of Edinburgh have lately published
         the first part of an Essay on the Laws of Motion by
 Professor Tait, F.R.S.E. This essay is a further development of
 the views upon Force and upon the proper mode of presenting
 the principles of Mechanics, which are set forth in the article
 on Mechanics by the same author in the new edition of the
 Encyclopedia Britannica. Their appearance in such a pub
 lication, together with the weight attaching to the name of
 their author, is sure to give to these views great currency and
 authority; and I trust therefore it will be considered only
just that they should be submitted to careful but fearless
criticism.
    The main point of difference between Prof. Tait and pre
 vious writers on Mechanics is the view which he takes of Force.
 Force he takes to be a mere expression, an abridged notation
 for some such words as " the time-rate of change of mo
 mentum," having no real or objective existence whatever.
 Accordingly it should be possible, and is even desirable, to
 expound the whole of Mechanics without introducing this
 word at all, .and so without giving the student a chance of
 mistaking it (as he is certainly prone to do) for the symbol
 of a real existence. In preparing his article for the Encyclo
paedia, however, Prof. Tait found it difficult to make this
desirable change; and accordingly that article proceeds on the
old lines until it arrives at the last chapter, where the new
discovery is set forth and expanded. In his recent paper
Prof. Tait proposes to supply this defect, and to give a sort
of outline of a new Principia, in which the term Force is
absent, and replaced by the purely abstract conception which
is its only proper signification.
    I shall not criticise this first instalment of the work, only
remarking that, before studying the laws of motion, the stu
dent will apparently have to master such conceptions as those
of Potential Energy, Conservation of Energy, Quaternions,
Vectors and Scalars, the Principle of Least Action, &c. 1 am
thankful, at least, that I was myself taught Mechanics before
its text-books were constructed on the new principle. But the
new treatise will not need much discussion if its raison d'etre
(the non-objectivity of Force) is shown to be erroneous; and
it is this point to which I wish to address myself.
   Turning to the article " Mechanics " in the new Encyclo-
                   • Communicated by the Author.
                                2E2

388                  Mr. W. R. Browne on the
pcedia, which alone supplies the evidence on which this rests, we
find, as already mentioned, that the new conception of Force, as
something without objective existence, is only hinted at the
beginning, and then relegated to an appendix at the end, the
whole of the results being developed in the ordinary manner.
This appendix of " General Considerations " is therefore the
place where we are at last to find the evidence wo seek ; and
here, in fact, we do find it, put in the simplest and clearest form;
so that we are at once able to examine and estimate its value. It
is all confined to a very few paragraphs (291-295), and may
be expressed in the following propositions:—
    (1) We believe Matter, whatever it may be, to have an
objective existence, chiefly because it is " conserved," t. e.
because experiment teaches us that its quantity cannot be
altered.
    (2) The only thing in nature which is also conserved in this
sense is Energy.
    (3) Therefore Energy is the other objective reality in the
physical universe; and we must look to it for information as
to the true nature of what we call Force.
    (4) Taking as the simplest case the fall of a stone towards
the earth, we find the equation
which may be interpreted as stating that the kinetic energy
acquired is equal to the force acting multiplied by the distance
fallen through. But if we introduco the element of time, by
                              vt
means of the relation /t= -jr, this equation at once becomes
                               t
    (5) Hence Force appears in a new light. It is now the
time-rate at which momentum is generated in the tailing stone.
    ((i) But a mere rate, be it a space-rate or a time-rate, is
 not a thing which has objective existence. No one would
confound the bank rate of interest with a sum of money, nor
the birth- or death-rate of a country with a group of indivi
dual human beings.
    (7) Therefore Force, being a rate of generation of momen
 tum, is not an objective reality.
    I do not think Prof. Tait can quarrel with this mode of
 stating the argument, which is mainly in his own words. It
 is a clear and connected chain of reasoning; and therefore the
 conclusion may be overthrown by overthrowing any one of the

                         Reality of Force.                    389
 premises. It maybe thus overthrown, unless I am mistaken,
 in more ways than one.
    First, we may proceed by attacking Prop. 1. That conser
 vation cannot be the ordinary ground for believing in the ob
 jectivity of matter is simply proved by the fact that the mass
 of mankind have always believed (and, according to Prof.
 Tait, believed rightly) that matter exists, without having any
 idea what conservation of matter means: nay, more, while
 believing that matter is not conserved. And if it be said that
 it is not a question of what is, but what ought to be, the evi
 dence for our belief, this does not affect my denial. We
 believe matter has an objective existence, not because it is
 conserved, but because it persists: in other words, because it
 has effects upon us which are regular, constant, can be re-
 experienced at will, and have all the other characteristics of an
 independent object. This proves to us that matter exists now;
 but it does not even begin to prove that it has always existed,
 and will always exist. I have not the slightest difficulty in
 conceiving that the universe may be annihilated to-morrow,
 though I am sure it exists to-day ; even as Prospero did not
 mean to deny the reality of cloud-capped towers and gor
 geous palaces, while asserting that they would one day become
 as the baseless fabric of a vision.
     Secondly, we may challenge Prop. 3. We have only to
 put it in a general form to see its weakness. It would then
 run thus:—" We believe a subject of thought X to have a cha
racteristic A chiefly because it has another characteristic B.
There is another subject Y which also has the characteristic
 B: therefore it also, and independently, has the characteristic
A." It is clear that this does not hold unless we assume the cha
racteristic B to be always and necessarily implied by A. But
obviously this need not be the case. Thus, I may believe
Camoens to be a great poet, chiefly because a great many
 people have considered him as such; but a great many people
 have considered Mr. Tupper a great poet, and yet I am not
logically bound to accept their verdict. But apart from this,
there is another flaw in the proposition; for the subject Y,
though really having the characteristic A, may be simply
another form, or a function of subject X; or, again, both may
be functions of a third subject Z, which has the same characte
ristic. In either case Y is not a separate independent pos
sessor of B. The latter supposition really holds in the case
of Energy, as will be seen hereafter.
    Thirdly, we have a still more important and obvious fallacy
in Proposition 5, which is really the key of the whole. It
needs only to be stated in order to become evident. It is the

390                  Mr. W. R. Brow lie on the
fallacy that, because one thing, A, is proportional to and mea
sured by another, B, therefore A is the same as B, and nothing
else.
    To show that we have here a real instance of this general
fallacy, we have only to put side by side Newton's Second
Law, as quoted by Prof. Tait himself (' Elements of Nat. Phil.'
1873, p. 66), and the words stated in Proposition 5.
    Newton, Law 2. Change of Motion is praporiional to the im
       pressed force.
    Tait, Prop. 5. Force is the time-rate at which momentum
       is generated.
    The fundamental difference between Newton and Tait, and
the fallacy mentioned above, could not be more clearly illus
trated. Nobody, I presume, will assert that Newton meant
to identify the two things spoken of. We do not say that the
Queen is proportional to the Empress of India, or a triangle
proportional to a three-sided rectilineal figure.
    The absurdities into which we should fall if we adopted this
view generally will be patent to everybody. For instance, we
must say that the heating-power of a fuel is a certain number
of pounds of water evaporated per hour; that the quantity
of heat in a body is the product of a certain number of pounds
of water and a degree on the mercury-scale ; and so forth.
 But we need go no further than the equation given by Prof. Tait
 himself in Proposition 4. The expression on the left-hand sido
 is the energy acquired, and that on the right-hand side the
 force multiplied by the distance. According to Prof. Tait, the
 force is not objective, because the symbol representing it ex
 presses the time-rate at which momentum is generated; while
 the energy is one of the two objective existences which are
 beyond the reach of cavil. But if we interpret the expres
 sion for the energy in the same fashion, we find that it is
 a mass (i. e. a weight W divided by a velocity g) multiplied
 by the square of a velocity (or rate of motion), and divided
 by 2. We are therefore bound to regard as non-objective
 something which may be expressed as a time-rate of momen
 tum; but we are bound to regard as objective something which
 may be expressed as a weight multiplied by the square of a
 rate, and divided by twice another rate. It is difficult to
 see how this can be supported; or, again, why an argument
 which is true for one side of an equation may not be applied
 to the other.
    The only other mode in which Prof. Tait proceeds to prove
 the non-objectivity of Force is a curious one; it proceeds by
 anecdote rather than argument. After observing that the

                          Reality of Force.                       391
third Law of Motion tells us that force is always dual, and that
to every action there is always an equal and contrary reaction,
he goes on thus (art. 289):—" 'Do you mean to tell me,'
said a medical man of the old school, ' that if I pull a 1 sub
ject ' by the hand, it will pull me with an equal and opposite
force ? ' When he was convinced of the truth of this state
ment, he gave up the objectivity of force at once."
    I cannot help thinking that this gentleman was not only a
doctor of a very old school, but a very old doctor of any school;
fori have in vain endeavoured to discover in this rebellious be
haviour on the part of subjects anything which could constitute,
any reason—physical, metaphysical, logical, or otherwise—for
believing or not believing in the objectivity of matter. Why
a thing should be real if left to itself, but become unreal and
fictitious if it is opposed to something equal to itself, is a puzzle.
We may conceive our doctor arriving at very singular conclu
sions if he carried out the same principle consistently. Thus the
celebrated Irishman, who complained that it was not his fall that
hurt him, but the stopping so suddenly, might have been told
that he was in error: his fall was an objective action, but when
 it was stopped by the equal and opposite action of the earth it
 became a mere rhetorical figment. Again, if a gentleman
 squeezes a lady's . hand, that is an objective fact; but if she
 squeezes his in return, then it becomes merely a subjective
 impression. This would not interest the doctor, but may be
 a useful hint to younger practitioners. If it be objected that
 in these cases the opposition is temporary, while in the case
 of force it is permanent, I would reply that permanence,
 teste Prof. Tait himself, is a proof of reality rather than the
 reverse. And I still inquire in what way the existence of two
 equal and opposite causes proves the unreality of either or
 both of them.
                                                a
    There is one deduction from the new view, which Prof.
Tait makes himself (art. 297), and which deserves notice. He
observes that " equivalent quantities must always be expressed
by equal numbers when both are measured in terms of the
 same system of units. It appears therefore, from the con
 servation of energy directly, that potential energy must,
like kinetic energy, be of dimensions [ML2T-2]. Now it is
impossible to conceive of a truly dormant form of energy
 whose magnitude should depend in any way on the unit of
time ; and we are therefore forced to the conclusion that
potential energy, like kinetic energy, depends (in some as yet
 unexplained, or rather unimagined, way) upon motion. . . The
conclusion appears inevitable that, whatever matter may be,

302                  Mr. W. K. Browne on the
the other reality in the physical universe—energy, which is
never found unassociated with matter, depends in all its widely
varied forms upon motion of matter."
   Now I should have thought it an accepted principle in
science that if a train of reasoning is found to lead to a con
clusion which not only has not been explained, but of which no
explanation has been imagined—in other words, which is not
only a mere unsupported hypothesis, but as to which no hypo
thesis can by the wit of man be framed—then that is sufficient
reason for concluding, not that the unimaginable is inevitably
true, but that the reasoning is inevitably false. It will be a bad
day for science when its leaders forget the principle of which
Newton was so brilliant an exponent—the principle, namely,
of distrusting your conclusions the moment they are shown
to be incompatible with ordinary matters of fact. But in the
present case the particular flaw in the argument (apart from
the general question at issue) is easily seen by an instance.
 Let us suppose a current of water (it is an ordinary rase) run
ning through a fan water-meter, the disk of which it keeps in
 rotation, and then passing by a pipe into a tank. When this
is over, the quantity of water which has come to rest in the
tank should be the same as that which has passed through the
 meter; but this will be indicated by the counter, i. e. by
 the number of revolutions which the disk of the meter has
 made in the time. Then, following Prof. Tait's reasoning,
 we should say:—"It is impossible to conceive of a truly
 stationary mass of water whose magnitude should depend
 in any way on the number of revolutions of a meter; and
 therefore we are forced to the conclusion that the water in
 the tank must really be continually causing the revolution
 of a meter, though we cannot explain, or even imagine,
 where the meter can be." To this it would be sufficient to
 reply that the water was measured, not when it was at rest,
 but when it was moving; and so we reply that what we have
 measured is not potential energy directly, but kinetic energy
 which was being transformed into or from potential energy,
 as the case may be. It may be well to add that what we have
 measured does not of course give us the total potential energy
 existing in the body, any more than the meter would give the
 total quantity of water in the tank, supposing, for instance,
 that this happened to be the sea.
    That the crit icism of this paper may not be negative only, I
will indicate another line of attack on Prof. Tait's position,
which is of a positive character. We have seen that he
recognises two distinct and independent realities as revealed

                           Reality of Force.                       393
to us in Nature, namely Matter and Energy; and his argument
is based on the fact that both of these are subject to the Law
of Conservation. But I Live elsewhere shown at length *
that the whole of the recognised laws of Mechanics, including
the Conservation of Energy and Matter, flow directly from the
three Laws of Motion (if not from more general principles still),
if we take as our definition of Matter that it is a " collection
of centres of force distributed in space, and acting upon each
other according to laws which do not vary with time, but do
vary with distance." I have also shown t that the second
principle—the Conservation of Energy—does not hold in any
cases where the forces are not of the above character. Hence
instead of the four fundamental realities Space, Time, Matter,
and Energy, we need only three—Space, Time, and Force;
and from these the mechanical universe, as we know it, can be
 constructed. But it will not be contended that we know
anything of Energy as an independent objective reality, except
what is revealed to us in the study of Mechanics; in fact, its
existence was never even suspected until the modern develop
ment of that study had begun. Hence it appears that all the
 facts forthcoming to prove its independent existence can be
perfectly accounted for apart from that hypothesis; and that
being so, the evidence in favour of the hypothesis sinks abso
lutely to zero. But that for which there is no evidence is not
to be believed.
    I will here conclude this paper, perhaps already too long.
 If any illustrations used are not of a kind ordinarily adduced
 in such discussions, it is Prof. Tait's old-school doctor and
 his " subjects " who must be my excuse. For the paper itself
 I do not make any excuse, because I am convinced that the
 new views promulgated by Prof. Tait, and by others, on
 the foundations of Mechanics are doing very serious harm,
especially among those who approach the subject from the
 practical side. It is not that they are led to inquire more
closely into these fundamental principles, and the evidence for
them—that would be a useful result ; but they are led to think
that there is no real ground of truth in any of them—that they
are mere convenient working hypotheses, which may be left
to contradict and stultify each other just as may happen. When
this belief is fully accepted, the era of fruitful progress in
Physical Science will be at an end.

    LVI. On the Involution and Evolution of Quaternions.
                  By J. J. Sylvester, F.R.S.*
ri^HE subject-matter of quaternions is really nothing more
 JL nor less than that of substitutions of the second order,
such as occur in the familiar theory of quadratic forms. A
linear substitution of the second order is in essence identical
with a square matrix of the second order, the law of multipli
cation between one such matrix and another being understood
to be the same as that of the composition of one substitution
with another, and therefore depending on the order of the
factors ; but as regards the multiplication of three or more
matrices, subject to the same associative law as in ordinary
algebraical multiplication.
   Every matrix of the second order may be regarded as repre
senting a quaternion, and vice versa : in fact if, using i to
denote y/—lf we write a matrix m of the second order under
the form
                          a + hi, c + di,
                        —e + di,   a— hi,

so that we may for «, /3, y, 8, substitute 1, h, k, I, four sym
bols subject to the same laws of self-operation and mutual
interaction as unity and the three Hamiltonian symbols. Now
I have given the universal formula for expressing any given
function of a matrix of any order as a rational function of
that matrix and its latent roots; and consequently the 17th
power or root of any quadratic matrix, and therefore of any
quaternion, is known. As far as I am informed, only the
square root of a quaternion has been given in the textbooks

                          fi (cos #±isin 0).

the ^th root of unity under the form of a quaternion !
    It is but justice to the eminent President of the British
Association to draw attention to the fact that the substance
of the results here set forth (although arrived at from an inde
pendent and more elevated order of ideas) may be regarded
as a statement (reduced to the explicit and most simple form)

   INFLUENCE OF MAGNETISM UPON THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY.
    BY JOHN TROWBRIDGE AND CHARLES BINGHAM PENROSE.
rpHE following experiments were made in order to test Maggi's
     results * in regard to the effect of magnetism upon the thermal
conductivity of iron. Maggi's conclusions have never been con
firmed, and have beeu much doubted by other observers. The
experiments of Sir W. Thomson t, in which he found that longitu
dinal magnetization diminished, while transverse magnetization
increased, the electrical conductivity of iron, afford—from the fact
that electrical and thermal conductivities are in general proportional
—the chief confirmation of Maggi's results. The experiments of
Thomson have, however, been questioned.
   In the method employed by Maggi, a circular plate of soft iron
was placed horizontally upon the poles of a vertical horseshoe
magnet. Through the centre of the plate passed a lead tube
conveying steam. The surface of the plate was covered with a
mixture of oil and wax. When the magnet was made, the melted
wax was bounded by an ellipse. If the conductivity had been
equal in all directions, it would have been bounded by a circle.
The long axis of the ellipse was perpendicular to the line joining the
two poles ; the short axis was parallel to the line. The ratio of
the axes was 6 : 5. The two poles were separated from the iron
plate by paper. In order to compensate for the direct effect of
the poles upon the flow of heat, two bars of soft iron were placed
symmetrically beneath the plate, at the extremities of the diameter,
perpendicular to the line joining the poles. No effort seems to
have been made to avoid the effect due to the frictional generation
of heat in the magnetic coil. Several other complicating causes
are apparent in the arrangement which Maggi used.
   A year ago we made some experiments by a rather rough method,
to find the effect of magnetism upon thermal conductivity, and
obtained decidedly negative results. The same results have been
obtained in the present experiments, though a much more sensitive
arrangement was employed. The following method was used :—A
bar of soft Norway iron, 95 cm. long, 1*3 cm. wide, and 02 cm.
in thickness, was placed horizontally through the sides of a wooden
box 6 cm. wide and 25 cm. high. The top and one side of the box
were removed. At 17 cm. from each end of the bar was soldered
a thick German-silver wire. Each projecting arm of the bar wras
enclosed in a glass tube 1*4 cm. in diameter. The ends of the
tubes were closed with cotton. The ends of the iron bar projected
slightly beyond the ends of the tubes, and were exposed to the air
of the room. One arm of the bar was placed between the poles of
a large electro-magnet, with its flat surface perpendicular to the
axis of the magnet. The axes of the poles were in the same

 horizontal line, perpendicular to the bar. The tube between the
 magnetic poles was wrapped in a piece of thick asbestos cloth, in
 order to avoid complications arising from the generation of heat
 in the magnetic coils. The distance between the poles was about
 2-5 cm. A Bunsen lamp was placed in the wooden bos, and was
 so regulated as ) o maintain the iron above it at a very dull cherry-
 red beat. The German silver wires were connected with the
 wires of a reflecting-galvanometer of six ohms-resistance ; the
 connections were separated by paper bound together and covered
 with cloth. The lamp was always lighted from four to five hours
 before any observations were made. It was found that by this time
the apparatus had pratically reached a condition of thermal equi
librium. At first the current from a battery of ten Grove cells was
used ; afterwards a battery of twenty-six very large Bunsen cells
was used.
    After the lamp had been burning for four hours, there was
always a permanent deflection of the galvanometer of about 12 cm.
When the current was now passed through the magnets, this
deflection was immediately changed permanently. The change
 was found to be due to the direct action of the magnet upon the
galvanometer-needle, though the distance between the two pieces
of apparatus was about 10 metres. This deflection amounted to
2'8 cm. when the stronger current was used. Thirty minutes
after the magnet was made, the galvanometer spot was always found
to have changed by about 3 cm. The direction of the change w as
such as to show that the junction on the magnetized arm was
becoming warmer. It was at first thought that this confirmed
Maggi's results.
   The apparatus was next arranged with one arm of the iron
parallel to the axis of the magnet. The arm was passed through
the hollow core of an electro- magnet somewhat stronger than the
 preceding. The same battery was usc-d. The details of the ex
periment were exactly the same as when the bar was perpendicular
to the lines of force. The results of severval observations here also
showed that the junction on the magnetized arm became hotter
under magnetization.
   We had previously assumed that the heat developed in the mag
netic coil would be too slight to affect the iron bar. This assump
tion was now proved to be incorrect, by placing the unheated bar,
arranged exactly as in the preceding experiments, in the magnetic
field. When the magnet w as made, the galvanometer-needle began
slowly to move, always in the direction showing a heating of the
junction on the magnetized arm. This deflection was slightly
larger, after the same space of time, than the deflections observed
in the previous experiments, and consequently rendered the results
of these experiments useless.
   In order to avoid complications arising from the heat generated
by the electric current, the following arrangement was adopted: —
About 17 cm. from one end, the iron bar was bent upon itself. At
the end of the bent part, at the point of the bar opposite this end,

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.             399
were soldered two German-silver wires. These two thermo-electric
junctions were about 0-4 cm. apart, and were separated from each
other by densely packed asbestos. The arm was placed in a glass
tube arranged as before. The bar was heated about 19 cm. from
the thermo-electric junctions. By this arrangement the heating of
the magnetic coils had an equal effect upon the two junctions ;
while any change, due to altered conductivity, of the flow of heat
along the bar would affect the relative temperatures of the junctions.
When the German-silver wires were connected as before with the
galvanometer, and the unheated bar was placed either parallel or
perpendicular to the axis of the magnet, there was, after forty-five
minutes' observation, absolutely no deflection in the galvanometer.
This showed that the arrangement obviated all difficulties arising
from heating the coil ; and moreover that the magnetic field did
not perceptibly alter the thermo-electric relation of iron and
German-silver. When the bar was placed perpendicular to the
axis of the magnet, thin plates of soft iron, running the length of
the glass tube, were placed upon the magnetic poles, thus lengthen
ing the field through which the bar passed. The bar was next heated
as before. After several hours the galvanometer generally showed
a permanent deflection of 35-40 cm., in a direction indicating that
 the junction at the end of the bar was the cooler. Several obser
vations were made, both when the bar was parallel and perpen
 dicular to the axis of the magnet. The current was passed for
about one hour ; and in every case there was absolutely no change
of the deflection beyond the immediate change due to the direct
action of the magnet.
    The result of these experiments seems conclusively to show
 that longitudinal and transverse magnetism, at least of the strength
 used, have no influence upon thermal conductivity of soft iron. It
 was, however, decided to try a thinner piece of iron than the
 preceding. A strip of ordinary tinned iron was therefore cut
 about 1/3 cm. wide, and was bent over and arranged exactly as
 before. The whole tube was packed with asbestos and cotton to
 avoid any motion of the strip when the magnet was made. The
 distance of the flame from the two thermo-electric junctions was
 10 cm. A heating of ninety minutes was found to be sufficient in
 this case for the strip to reach a permanent condition of tempera
 ture. The deflection showing the difference of temperature between
 the junctions was about 13 cm. When the magnet was made, theie
 was no change of the deflection after thirty-five minutes' observation.
    The strength of the magnetic field when the bar was placi d
 perpendicular to the lines of force was measured after the preceding
 experiments were made, and was found to be 10,420 times the
 horizontal intensity of the earth's magnetism at Cambridge. In
 the C.G.S. system this would be about 1760.
    Aside from the experiments of Maggi, those of Thomson upon
 electrical conductivity are the only experiments that seem to be
  directly opposed to the conclusion that must be drawn from our
  observations. Magnetism undoubtedly changes several physical

  properties of iron, but though this renders it probable, a priori,
  that the thermal conductivity might be changed, yet it does not
  necessitate such a change. The thermo-electric relation of iron is
  changed by magnetization; but the thermo-electric relation appears
  to be unconnected with thermal conductivity.—Proceedings of the
  American Academy of Arts and Sciences, May 29th, 1883.
    ON A NEW METHOD OK INSULATING METAL WIRES EMPLOYED
      IN TELEGRAPHY AND TELEPHONY. BY C. WIEDEMANN.
     Having had occasion during the past year to employ, for the
 decoration of jewellery and other objects of art, the processes
 described by Nobili and Becquerel for producing various colorations
 by means of baths of alkaline plumbates and ferrates, I observed
 that the objects thus coloured had become absolutely resistant of
 all galvanic action, that their surfaces once coated with the per
 oxide of lead or iron wore no longer capable of conducting the
 electric current. A copper or brass wire, or even one of iron,
 became thus covered with an insulating layer analogous to that
 of a coating of resin or of gutta percha.
    It appears to me that this process may prove of considerable use
 in the manufacture of cables or wires employed in telegraphy and
 telephony. It is easily effected and its cost is small. The coating,
 which resists in a very high degree all atmospheric influences, is a
 guarantee of its duration. The insulation is absolute. The mode
 of preparation is extremely simple : it suffices to prepare a bath of
 plumbate of potash by dissolving 10 grms. of litharge in a litre of
 water to which has been added 200 grams of caustic potash, and to
 boil for about half an hour ; it is allowed to subside and is then
 decanted, when the bath is ready for use. The metal wire to be
 coated with the peroxide of lead is attached to the positive wire, and
 a small platinum anode at the negative pole immersed in the bath ;
finely divided metallic lead is precipitated at the negative pole, and
the peroxide of lead is deposited on the metallic wire, which passes
successively through all the colours of the spectrum. The insula
tion is only perfect when the wire has attained the final tint, which
is a blackish brown.
    Thus coated the wire is perfectly insensible to all electric action ;
perfectly cleansed objects may be attached to it and connected with
the negative pole in a gold, silver, or nickel bath without the cur
rent, however powerful, having the slightest action on the objects
to be coated with metal. A wire thus treated, placed in a current
and brought in contact with another wire connected with a gal
vanometer, has not the slightest effect upon the latter ; there is no
diminution in the first current, which passes through the wire coated
with the peroxide of lead.
   This perfect insulation may possibly be turned to account by
electricians in the construction of various apparatus.—Comj>tes

                            [Plate VI.]
THE publication of spectroscopic observations upon sun-
       spots made at Greenwich places within our reach a
gradually increasing body of facts bearing on solar chemistry;
and though we have not made a special study of sun-spots, yet
the points of contact between the appearances presented in
sun-spots and those observed by us in the spectra of terrestrial
substances are so many, that we think some discussion of them
will be of interest.
   The spectroscopic appearances of sun-spots in general point,
as all, we believe, are agreed, to the conclusion that in a spot
we are looking through an unusual depth of the solar atmo
sphere charged with metallic and other vapours: that for some
reason there is at a spot a depression in the general contour
of the photospheric clouds, so that the light which reaches us
from the spot has come to us from a greater depth in the sun
and been filtered through a greater thickness of absorbent
gaseous matter. The depression in the photospheric cloud
may be the result of some of the violent atmospheric motions
which are frequent in the sun, moving the clouds about and
causing a downrush at the spot ; or it may be the result of an
ascending current of vapour at a temperature higher than the
                  * Communicated by the Authors.

402        Professors Liveing and Dewar on Sun-spots
mean temperature of the photosphere, which converts the
clouds into the gaseous condition, as sunshine dissipates the
aqueous clouds in our atmosphere. If the spot is due only to
a downrush of the upper atmosphere of the sun, we should be
merely looking through a greater quantity of the outer atmo
sphere, increased in density and in temperature but consisting
mainly of the same materials as before, and driving the photo
sphere, the chief source of light, downwards. We should
 expect to see the ordinary absorption-lines strengthened, and
 perhaps some new lines, due to a higher temperature, developed.
 For we must remember that a vapour is capable of absorbing
 the same kind of radiation as it emits; and that as its emission-
 spectrum varies with change of circumstances, of which tem
 perature is one, its absorption will vary too. If the clouds of the
 photosphere were not merely mechanically depressed, but partly
 vaporized at the spot, we should expect to see new absorption-
 lines ; not only on account of the higher temperature of the
 vapours previously existing as such, but because matter which
 had before been cloud, and emitted a continuous spectrum,
 had now become gaseous, with a discontinuous spectrum.
    And here we would say a word about an a jyriwi objection
to the supposition that a spot may be a region of a temperature
generally equal to, or even higher than, that of the photosphere
at the same level. Messrs. De La Eue, Stewart, and Loewy, in
their 'Researches on Solar Physics '(1st ser. p. 31), have argued,
very cautiously and in a questioning manner, from the known
laws of radiation and absorption, that we must be looking
through a stratum of atmosphere at the spot cooler than the
photosphere, because from such a thickness of matter as the
sun we must at all points get the total radiation due to the
temperature. We do not at all question the general principle
of this argument, but we question its application in this case,
because the total radiation is not the same thing as the lumi
nosity. There may be more radiation on the whole from the
darker spot than from the brighter'photosphere, if the excess
be in the ultra-violet or the infra-red. It is a general rule
 with solids that the radiations of short wave-length increase
with the temperature more rapidly than those of longer wave
 length ; and some of the terrestrial elements which are abun
 dant in the sun, such as iron and magnesium, have an emis
 sion-spectrum which appears to be much stronger in the ultra
 violet than in the visible region. The substance we call iron,
 whether it be one element or many, emits in the electric arc
 ultra-violet rays which are extraordinary both in number
 and intensity. We are not in a position to test whether the
 total radiation from a spot is as great as from an equal portion

               and Terrestrial Elements in the Sun.            403
of the photosphere, because all the radiation more refrangible
than the solar line U is cut off before it reaches us by some
absorbent medium. There is, however, one argument which
makes strongly for the supposition that the spot is a region of
a temperature generally not lower than that of the rest of the
photosphere, which is this : If we suppose the photosphere to
be of the nature of clouds formed by condensation of metallic
and other vapours in the sun's atmosphere, then the gaseous
part of that atmosphere will be saturated with the vapour of
the matters forming the cloud, and any depression of its tem
perature must cause a fresh formation of cloud, which would
tend to destroy the character of a spot. Indeed an apparent
dissolution of photospheric matter carried into spots has fre
quently been observed, according to Secchi, and seems to
suggest an evaporation of the cloudy matter in the spot.
   Dismissing, then, the « priori argument for the coolness of
the spot in comparison with the photosphere as insufficient,
and likely to encumber us in the interpretation of the observed
facts, let us come to the recorded phenomena.
   There is, first, the widening of the Fraunhofer lines. This is
observed in all spots, but the lines are by no means all widened or
all equally widened. The diagram (PI. VI.) represents the lines
in two spots (taken as samples) observed at Greenwich (Obs.
1881) to be widened. The range observed is from F to b, and
the length of the lines drawn under the corresponding lines in
Angstrom's map indicates the amount of widening, except
where the widening is excessive, when the actual breadth is
given as it appeared. As to the precise cause of the widening
of spectral lines, physicists are not agreed ; but as a fact we
know that increased density of the emitting vapour is directly
or indirectly a cause of the widening of the spectral lines of
terrestrial elements ; and we may reasonably attribute the
widening in the spots to the increased thickness of the solar
atmosphere, denser of course in the lower part, through which
the light comes to us. But, then, why are not all the Fraun
 hofer lines widened ? and why are those that are widened so
unequally widened? Whatever the cause be, similar phe
 nomena are observed in the emission-spectra of terrestrial
elements. In the first place, the lines of some metals are
 much more readily expanded than those of others. The ready
 expansibility of the lines of hydrogen and of the L) lines of
 sodium is well known; while the lines of iron and titanium
 are much less easily expanded, but are nevertheless very
 sensibly enlarged when the electric arc is freely supplied
 with the metal. But even so some lines expand more than
 others. This is well seen in the case of magnesium, which
                               2 F2

404        Professors Liveing and Dewar on Sun-spots
has one ultra-violet line (w.-l. 2852) which is far more easily
expanded than any other of its lines. And for a large numher
of metals, when heated in the arc, we have observed that lines,
or groups of lines, repeat themselves at intervals, and that of
such series the alternate members are far more readily ex
panded than the others. This is the case with the doublets of
the visible spectrum of sodium—which are alternately diffuse
and sharp, the diffuse lines being more easily expansible—and
with the triplets of the magnesium, calcium, and zinc spectra.
In more complicated spectra it is very probable that the same
thing occurs, but, from overlapping of the groups, the alterna
tions are not so easily detected. At any rate, they exhibit
some lines which are more easily expanded than others.
   It is only necessary to watch with a spectroscope of suffi
cient dispersive power the spectrum of the arc while iron and
other metals are fed into it, in order to see the great expansion
of some lines and the comparative inexpansibility of others.
Any theory which is to account satisfactorily for the expansion
of lines must account for the difference in the amount of ex
pansion of the different lines of the same substance, as well as
for the fact, noticed in several cases, that lines do not all expand
symmetrically (some spread out more on one side than on the
other), and also for absorption-lines expanding as well as the
emission-lines, and for the fact that the tension of the vapour
has more to do with the expansion of the lines than its tem
perature has. We do not know enough about the mechanical
nature of the collisions, as they are called, between the par
ticles of a gas, whereby the motion of translation due to tem
perature is supposed to be converted into vibratory motions
producing radiation, to say whether in a gas of high density
the frequency of the collisions between similar vibrating par
ticles may not affect the period of some of their vibrations
much more than that of others.
   When we come to examine what lines are usually seen ex
panded in sun-spots, we see that a large number are those of
iron ; and besides these the lines of magnesium, calcium,
barium, sodium, titanium, and nickel aro frequently enlarged.
In fact the greater part of the lines of all these elements are more
or less enlarged in most of the spots observed at Greenwich in
1881. The hydrogen lines are sometimes enlarged, sometimes
not. There may be, probably are, great variations of pressure
in the region of a spot ; and as it is not very likely that the
material of the photospheric cloud contains hydrogen, the ten
sion of the hydrogen in the solar atmosphere will not be in
creased by the evaporation of the cloud. Hence the variations
in the density of the hydrogen will be chiefly due to the cur

               and Terrestrial Elements in the Sun.            405
rents; and the same remark will apply to all those substances
which do not ordinarily exist in the condition of saturated
vapour in the sun's atmosphere.
    But not only are lines sometimes widened and sometimes
not widened in spots, but sometimes lines usually seen as dark
lines disappear, or appear as bright lines. This has been satis
factorily explained as the effect of ascending currents bearing
vapours into the upper regions at such a high temperature
that their emission is equal to or exceeds their absorption. In
fact it is just those lines which have been observed as bright
lines above the sun's limb in solar storms which are absent or
are reversed in spots. There is still the question why some
lines of such elements as iron and calcium should belong to
the category of lines seen extending to considerable heights in
the solar atmosphere while others do not so extend. We are
inclined to the opinion that this appearance of certain lines at
high elevations to the exclusion of others is dependent more
on the tension of the vapour than on its temperature. Of
course; there is a relation between the tension of a vapour and
its temperature, and this relation is by no means the same for
saturated as it is for unsaturated vapour ; and there may be
unsaturated low-tension vapour at a very high temperature
when but littlo of the material of the vapour is present, as well
as saturated low-tension vapour at a low temperature. Now
the distinction of long and short lines in the electric discharge,
first introduced by Thalen, to which Mr. Lockyer has since
drawn more particular attention, corresponds, as he has noted,
with difference in the density of the vapour ; the short lines
being seen only near the poles or in the central portion of the
discharge, while, the long lines extend further. We know
but little about the temperatures of different parts of an elec
tric discharge; but in this case temperature and density of
vapour may very well go together. It is otherwise when one
element is present in very small quantity, as in the alloys on
which Mr. Lockyer has experimented. He found that in
alloys containing only a very small percentage of one metal, it
was the long lines of that metal which were persistent in the
spectrum. This seems conclusive that long lines are the lines
of vapour of low tension rather than of low temperature ; the
lines corresponding to the vibrations which the particles take
up most readily when they are in the most unfettered state, in
their least complicated aggregations. The short lines will on
this supposition correspond to vibrations either of more con
densed particles, or to vibrations induced by the constrained
condition of a dense gas. This view is in harmony with the
fact that only the long lines usually appear in the higher

406        Professors Liveing and Dewar on Sun-spots
regions of the sun's atmosphere where the temperature is high
enough to make the hydrogen luminous, but where the pressure,
if we mayjudge by the width of the lines, is certainly very low.
    But besides the disappearance of some lines in some spots,
new lines and bands frequently make their appearance. Now
of the Fraunhofer lines only a fraction have as yet been iden
tified as corresponding to lines of terrestrial elements; but we
are inclined to the opinion that this is mainly due to the very
imperfect examination which has as }'ot been made of the
spectra of terrestrial substances. At any rate, we have found
that it is only necessary to examine with high dispersive
power any small section of the spectrum of the arc while
different chemicals are dropped into it, in order to see a vast
number of new lines develop themselves which have been
hitherto unrecorded. The lowest horizon of the diagram
shows the results of a somewhat hasty examination of the lines
developed in this way by titanium and cerium, and in a few
places by other substances. The titanium lines are permanent,
but many of the cerium lines are evanescent : they come out
strongly when fresh cerium is introduced, sometimes as broad
bands, and quickly vanish as the cerium is dissipated, a few
lines only remaining. The lines which remain are the lines
of vapour of low tension, or long lines, while the others we
supposo to be lines of vapour of high tension. It seems very
probable, then, that if a careful examination were made of all
the lines developed in the arc by all the known substances,
most, if not all, of the Fraunhofer lines now ascribed to un
known substances would bo accounted for. It is not a little
remarkable that several of the most striking developments of
 lines observed at Greenwich in sun-spots closely correspond
 to new lines which we have observed to be given in the arc by
cerium or titanium. In the case of cerium, the correspondence
 is so marked that it can hardly be accidental. Of course it is
always easy to account for lines in the sun by the supposition
 of unknown elements brought up from the interior, or of
 unknown combinations or decompositions occurring under cir
cumstances which we have not learned to imitate ; but that
is to cut the knot, not to untie it. When we consider the
influence which circumstances besides temperaturo have on
the vibrations which a given substance can assume, the com
paratively partial way in which the spectra of our chemicals
have been examined, the tendency of recent observations such
as the artificial production of auroras with the characteristic
auroral lino at no very great elovation in our atmosphere, and
 the identification by Egcroff of the groups A and 13 with the
 absorption of oxygen, we shall hesitate to say that there is

              and Terrestrial Elements in the Sun.            407
ground for believing that the sun contains any thing which is
not to be found on earth.
   After all, there are very few of the lines developed in spots
which do not appear at least as faint Fraunhofer lines in the
ordinary solar spectrum. The maps of Fievez and Vogel
give many such lines which are not in Angstrom's map.
Whenever lines of two metals are coincident, or nearly so,
there is of course a double chance of increased width; and this
corresponds with the observations. Farther, it is noticed that
the expansion of some lines is unsymmetrical—they expand
more on one side than on the other. This may be an effect
of the upward or downward motion of that portion of the
vapour which is under observation; but it may also be due to
the development of a second line close to that ordinarily seen.
Such an effect we have observed in the case of the blue line
of lithium, which appears to expand with increased tension of
its vapour more on one side than on the other; but the
effect is really due to the development of a second lino close
to the first and the expansion of both lines. This second line
is seen as a narrow line as the metal is dissipated, and then
disappears entirely long before the usual blue line shows any
sign of failing. This will, we believe, satisfactorily account
for some of the apparent motions of lines. Where a displace
ment, by reason of rapid motion of the sun's atmosphere, of
some of the lines occurs without any displacement of others,
we must suppose that the displaced linos are produced by one
layer of the sun's atmosphere, while the undisplaced are due to
another. This will account for the long lines, or lines of vapour
of low tension, being displaced, while those due to vapour of
high tension are unmoved, and rice versd. There is, however,
one line which appears to be very anomalous in its behaviour,
and requires further notice, because Mr. Lockyer has more
than once called special attention to it. This is the line with
wave-length 4923. There is an iron line with this wave
length; but in iron it is certainly not a long line: it is not
 seen in the arc when there is only a very little iron present;
and it comes out with increasing density of vapour. Corre
sponding with this character, it is frequently seen strengthened
in spots like the other iron lines. On the other hand, a line
of this wave-length is one of those most frequently (40 per
cent.) observed by Young as a bright line high up in the
solar atmosphere; and it has as frequently been observed by
Taccbini in the spectrum of prominences. It should there
fore be a long line, or one of vapour of low tension, if
judged by this character; and this is confirmed by the fact
recorded by Mr. Lockyer that it is frequently absent from

408         Messrs. Galloway and O'Farrell on some
spots, which indicates that the emission in the upper regions
balances the absorption. Moreover this line has (Proc. It. S.
xxxi. p. 349) been observed to be undisplaced in spots when the
iron lines near it are displaced, showing that the substance
producing it is at a different level from that producing the dis
placed lines. This is consistent with its existing in the upper
regions to which only low-tension vapour of iron can reach.
But as the lino is certainly not a line of low-tension vapour of
iron on earth, we are not justified in assuming it to be such in
the sun; und we are driven to suppose it due to some unknown
substance X other than iron which at low tension lias a line
 coincident, or nearly so, with a line of high-tension vapour of
iron. Mr. Lockyer thinks that the substance X is a con
stituent of terrest rial iron ; but as the behaviour of the line
in the sun does not correspond to the behaviour of the iron
line on earth, the connexion between the two is reduced to the
probable equality of wave-length. Wo suppose the tension
of vapours in the upper part of the sun's atmosphere to be
low as a general rule; but it may at times be locally higher,
for solid matters falling into the sun and vaporized in its atmo
sphere may produce vapour of considerable tension until it
has had time to diffuse. The descent of dust from the region
of the corona may thus produce lines at elevations where wo
should not otherwise expect to find them.

 IT is very generally conceded that it requires a greater
      expenditure of time and labour to arrive at results in
Chemistry than it requires to attain like ends in any other of
the inductive sciences. Any improvement therefore in ex
pediting and rendering less laborious analytical and other
chemical operations, which are only a means to an end, assists
materially in aiding the progress of the science. The improve
ment the late Baron Liebig effected in quantitative organic
analysis is a remarkable instance of this ; for if the improve
ment had been made before Chevreul commenced his exami
nation into the constitution of fats, he would have been able
to have shortened the time he gave (fourteen years) to this
investigation by one half, viz. seven years. Beautiful as an

analytical process as Bunsen's method is for the determination
of nitrogen in organic substances, no chemist would adopt it
in cases where Will and Varentrapp's less beautiful, but easier
and speedier method, could be employed ; for, as already
stated, analytical operations are only a means to an end, and
the speedier, with accuracy, chemists can arrive at results, the
more conducive it must be to the progress of the science.
   At the present time a great deal of labour is involved, and
time wasted, by having to set up in a laboratory, where a
variety of work is going on, so many distinct pieces of apparatus,
each requiring to be started separately. For obtaining the
indispensable distilled water, a special still and heating- appa
ratus is generally set apart for the purpose. Distillation under
diminished pressure is another distinct, and frequently trouble
some, operation. If a filter-pump is employed to hasten filtra
tion, the pump is solely devoted to that purpose. Then there
are the open and closed water-baths, each distinct and requiring
a separate heating-apparatus ; and for hoating and drying
substances above 100 C. the methods are most inconvenient.
 But of all the slow methods, that of evaporating by means of
the ordinary air-pump and absorbing the water as it evapo
 rates by means of sulphuric acid is, we think, the slowest.
 The appliances that are in use generally for forcing steam, air,
 or gases over substances are, to say the least, inconvenient.
    By the aid of a small general air-pump connected to a little
stationary engine, and ordinary or superheated steam, all these
operations can be carried on at the same time with these ap
pliances excepting the one last described ; for this operation
 there is required, in addition to the air- or suction-pump, a
 compression-pump in connexion with the engine.
    In carrying out some researches recently we found great
 convenience and saving of labour and time in employing a
 general air-pump. This has led us to devise appliances for the
 extension of our plan to a larger number of chemical operations,
 which wo will now describe, as we think the arrangement
 will be found very useful not only in educational laboratories,
 but also in pharmaceutical laboratories, especially in the pre
 paration of delicate organic compounds.
    The boiler A (Plate VII. fig. 1) we recommend is Cochran's
 patent inultitubular vertical boiler with internal fire-box and
 horizontal tubes, because it is the boiler, in our opinion, which
 gives the maximum heating-surface for the space occupied : a
 boiler 2 feet in diameter and 2 feet 6 inches high will afford,
 for example, sufficient steam to work a one-horse-power engine.
 No brick setting or brick chimney is required ; and the top
 can be removed, so that the interior of the boiler can be

410         Messrs. Galloway and O'Farrell on some
cleaned when required. It has the usual fittings, such as the
water-gauge, the pressure-gauge, and the safety-valve. By
the arrangement shown in the Plate, distilled water can be
obtained from it ; and a steam-pipe (not shown in the Plate)
could also be connected with it for the purpose of supplying
steam to an open air-bath, this bath not being connected, as
those shown in the Plate are, with the air-pump.
   The engine, B, is of the donkey-pump type, with one in
verted cylinder whose rod acts directly on the air-pump C.
D is the ordinary vessel for the exhaust steam to escape into
after having performed work in the engine ; it is from there
convoyed, if required, directly, or after it has been superheated,
or a mixture of the two (normal and superheated steam), into
the steam-jackets of the vessels E and F. If it is not required
to heat these vessels, it is carried away through the pipe a on
opening the stopcock b into the escape-pipe or chimney c.
   G represents a filtering-apparatus in position ; and H a
retort and receiver for carrying on distillations under dimi
nished pressure.
   The downward pipes marked d from the vessels E and F,
and the longer pipe e, in which they terminate, form together
the suction-pipe in connexion with the different pieces of appa
ratus and with the air-pump ; it terminates, as shown in the
Plate, in the air-tight box I, in which terminates also the pipe/
from the air-pump. This box is provided with an overflow-
pipe for carrying off the excess of water which accumulates
from the aqueous vapour conveyed from the vessels E, F, G,
and H by the suction-pipe. A vacuum-gauge g maybe attached
to the box I; it would of course indicate the vacuum through
out the entire system ; but if it was considered desirable to
ascertain more accurately the vacuum in any one or all of the
different pieces of apparatus, a separate mercurial gauge would
be required in connexion with the particular apparatus, as
will be presently noticed.
   Little further description is required as regards the appa
ratus G and H ; we have not considered it necessary to illus
trate a condenser in connexion with the retort and receiver.
The filtering-apparatus shown is one for large non-quantitative
operations: if the filtrate is required, it will be seen from the
drawing that portions of it can be drawn off from time to
time by means of the tap for evaporation or for other pur
poses, whilst the filtration or washing is taking place, without
interfering with the vacuum. It need scarcely be observed
that quantitative filtrations can be as conveniently carried on ;
and that many filtrations and distillations are capable, by this
system, of being carried on at tho same time.

   E consists of a vessel considerably deeper than an ordinary
evaporating-dish ; the one we employed was made of copper
plated with silver; but the metal dish might be enamelled;
or the dish might be made of the same material as ordinary
evaporating dishes are made of ; it is fitted steam-tight into a
metal steam-jacket, and around it is a rim of sufficient breadth
for a bell-jar to rest upon. On this rim and also on that of
the vessel F an india-rubber washer or collar is placed, on
which the bell-jar is fixed. The end of the suction-pipe
which terminates a little above the vessel and the end of the
one in connexion with the bath F wo prefer to have closed,
and to have the tube pierced all round just below the end with
small holes whose united area is equal to the area of the
 tube.
    On adjusting the bell-jar and setting the air-pump to work
a vacuum is speedily produced ; and by conveying either the
 exhaust steam, or the steam superheated, or a mixture of the
 exhaust and superheated, into the steam-jacket, we are able
 to obtain different degrees of temperature. In this vessel
 therefore liquids can bo speedily concentrated or evaporated
 to dryness, and organic liquids of higher boiling-points than
 water can be speedily and safely dehydrated. We have also
 found it extremely convenient and useful for bringing about
 chemical combinations which are not easily brought about
 under ordinary conditions.
    This evaporating-dish, whatever may be its form, not being
 movable, as it is fixed to the steam-jacket, cannot be used for
 the evaporation of liquids for quantitative purposes; the vessel
  F is therefore designed to carry on those latter operations, as
  well as for drying and dehydrating solid substances.
     F is a steam-tight jacket, the upper surface having dish-
  shaped indentations of different sizes for seating evaporating-
  dishes in. As this vessel is intended to evaporate liquids in
  movable dishes in vacuo with or without steam heat, and also
  for dehydrating solid substances intended for analysis &c, it
  cannot of course be employed for evaporating liquids and
  drying solids at the same time ; and therefore where much
  work has to bo done, a similar vessel, but with a flat upper
  surface, would have to be employed for drying the solid bodies.
  It will be seen from the Plate that, by a simple piece of ma
  chinery, a thermometer is so held that it can be introduced
  into any of the dishes in which evaporation is to take place.
  F is provided, like E, with a rim on which the bell-jar is fixed.
     At the bottom of the steam-jackets E and F a stopcock is
  attached for carrying off the water which is formed by con
  densation when the steam is first turned on ; the steam, as

 412        Mr. L. Fletcher on the Dilatation of Crystals
 shown by the Plate, is carried away from each of the vessels
  by the jiipos A into the escape-pipe or chimney c.
    The cocks figured in the Plate show how the exhaust-steam,
 or the steam after it has been superheated by passing through
 the superheater K, or a mixture of the two, can be conveyed
 into, or shut off from, the steam-jackets of the vessels E and F.
    In order not to have to stop the engine and air-pump when
 it is desired to disconnect any one vessel or apparatus with the
 air-pump, a stopcock is attached to each branch of the general
 suction-pipe e, and above these stopcocks are attached the
 special mercurial gauges if desired. These stopcocks also
 enable one to moderate the suction-action on any of the
 vessels.
    Fig. 2 (Plate VII.) represents the combination of the air-
 pump and compression-pump; they can be worked together,
 or either of them can be thrown out of action by removing the
 pin which connects it with the rod of the steam-engine.
    We think that in the future the chemical action of bodies
 on one another under increased and diminished pressures will
 be more studied than has yet been done ; and we hope and
 expect the appliances we have described, as they will be always
ready for use, will greatly conduce to the study of chemical
action under either or both of these conditions ; and therefore
it will be seen that we expect that these mechanical arrange
ments will have a much wider application than we have outlined.
    Our friend Mr. J. G. Douglas, B.A., who has kindly made
the drawings for us, has also most kindly given us an approxi
mate estimate of the cost of the apparatus ; he thinks the whole
of the apparatus, excluding the tabic, would not exceed
£50. It will be admitted, we think, that this is by no means
costly when all the different pieces of apparatus, such as
stills, air-pumps, &c, that will be dispensed with are taken
into account ; even leaving out of consideration altogether the
saving of time and labour which will be effected by the adop
tion of those new laboratory appliances.
LX. The Dilatation of Crystals on Change of Temperature.
   By L. Fletcheu, M.A., of the Mineral Department, British
   Museum; lute Fellow of University College, Oxford.
                       [Concluded from p. 350.]
                            Third Part.
WE now proceed to the consideration of the case of an
          Anorthic crystal ; and the method we shall adopt is
one identical in character with that indicated above for an
Oblique crystal.

                     on Change of Temperature.                    413
   At the first temperature let the crystallographic axes have
directions OA, OB, OC, and lengths A, B, C respectively ; at
the second temperature these axes will have taken up new
positions OA', OB', OC, and new lengths A', B', C. As at
the second temperature the positions of the crystal-lines relative
to each other are independent of their absolute position in
space, let the crystal bo rotated from its position at the second
temperature until the axis OC coincides in direction with OC
and the axial plane OA'C with the axial plane OAC : OA'
will not coincide with OA nor OB' with OB.
   It will be convenient first to calculate in terms of the above
quantities the alterations in magnitude and direction of a cer
tain triad of perpendicular lines : one, OZ, coincident with
OC ; a second, OX, lying in the axial plane OAC ; and the
third, OY, perpendicular to this plane.
   Denote the axial angles BOC, COA, AOB respectively by
«, /S, 7, and the angle ACB by C.
   I. Let \lftiVl, Xj^v.,, X.3/13P3 be the direction-cosines of OA,
OB, OC relative to the rectangular axes OX, OY, OZ (fig. 9).
Then
Xj= cos AX= sin {3 \2= cosBX = sin BC cos ACB= sin a cos C X3= cos CX=0

    II. Let .r, y, z be the coordinates of a point P referred to
the rectangular axes OX, OY, OZ, and X\,y\,Z\ the coordi
nates of the same point referred to the oblique axes OA, OB,
OC. Then
                       y=/i1x1
                        z=vix1 + vsyl -rv3si-

     III. Find as a particular case of the above the coordinates
 (.I'l^i Zi) of each of the points X, Y referred to the oblique axes
 OA, OB, OC.

X', Y' relative to the rectangular axes OX, OY, OZ.

   VII. As was pointed out above (p. 347), angular measurement
of a crystal can result in the determination of only the ratios
A : B : 0 and A' : B' : C, and not of the absolute lengths of
the axes. If the parametral ratios are, as usual, given in the
                                              B'
form a : 1 : c and a' : 1 : d, and ~- = 1 + \, we shall have,

Substituting these values of -^-> :j^ > q- in the above expres
sions for P, Q, R, D, E, F, and still neglecting small quantities
of the second order, it will be found that
                       F=p + X,               D=d,
                       Q=q+X,                 E=e,

   We have now determined the expansions and rotations of
three crystal-lines which are initially perpendicular in terms
of the coefficient of expansion \ of a line in the direction OB
and of the parameters of the crystal at the two temperatures.

of the lines OX', OY', OZ', referred to the three rectangular
axes OX, OY, OZ ; OX', OY', OZ' being the positions at the
second temperature of the crystal-lines which coincide with
OX, OY, OZ at the first. Then, neglecting squares of small
quantities,

    IX. Let the coordinates of any point P at the first tempera
ture referred to OX, OY, OZ be x, y, z; the coordinates       y', z1
of P', the position of P at the second temperature, referred to
the three oblique axes OX', OY', OZ', will be
            (l+p+\)x, ¦ (l+q + k)y, (l+r+\)z.
But, from the formulae stated in § II., if £, rj, f be the coordi
nates of P' referred to the rectangular axes OX, OY, OZ, we
have

    X. If all the points P lie on a sphere of unit radius having
the equation ar+y2 + z?=l, all the points P' will lie on an
ellipsoid having the following equation :—
         ie-%p+\)?-2fyft + ly-sfo+xy]
                               + [?-2eK-MvZ-2(r + k)?] = l,
or
( 1 - 2k) [f» + V2 + n -2[/>f + qn1 + r? +           e%        = 1.
The thermic axes, being the axes of this ellipsoid, will have the
same direction as the axes of the quadric
               pxl + qy* + rz'2 + dyz + ezx +fxy— 1,
all the coefficients of which are known in terms of the para
meters, and have, as shown above, extremely simple physical
representations; p, q, r being respectively differences of the
expansions of the lines OX, OY, OZ from the expansion
along OB, (/ the angle of displacement of OY' from its initial
plane XOY, / the angle of displacement of the same line from

418        Mr. L. Fletcher on the Dilatation of Crystals
its initial plane YOZ, and e the angle of displacement of the
line OX' from its initial position OX.
   We may here conveniently point out that the above proves the
truth of the remark made on page 279—that if squares of small
quantities be neglected, the equations for the determination
 of the thermic axes will be identical whether the lower or the
 higher temperature be the starting-point. In fact, if we pro
 ceed from the higher to the lower temperature, each one of the
 coefficients^, q, r, d, e,/retains its numerical value but changes
 its sign, and the same quadric can be used for the determina
 tion of the axes. But as this quadric always gives the positions
 of the axes for the final temperature, it will give in this case
 the position, not at the higher, but at the lower temperature.
    XI. Whatever be the value of k, the principal axes of the
 series of quadrics
         k(a?+y2 + 2s) +pa? + qy2 + rzl + dyz + ezx +fxy = 1
 have the same directions; we may thus diminish the labour
 of numerical calculation by making k + r vanish, and finding
 the axes of the coaxal quadric
             (p—r)x* + (q—r)y2 + dyz + ezx +fxy= 1.
 By comparison of numerical results the equations given by
 Neumann for the determination of the thermic axes are found
 to refer to this particular quadric.
    XII. Without \ being known, the relative angular dis
 placement of a given line OP can be determined.
     From the above equations (§ IX.) we can write
           j=x(l+p + X)+fy           v
           v      y(l + q+\)        y^+p       q)+/>

  from which cos P'X= —^====-^— &c. can be calculated.
  When y is zero or very small, wo must use the corresponding
  equations wherein y does not appear as a denominator ;
  namely,
      £y _ 2(1 + r + \) + ex + dy _ x-CL+r—p)

    XIII. To Hud the position at the first temperature of a liuo
for which the position at the second temperature is given, the
above formula? must be reversed. We then get, still neglect
ing small quantities of the second order,
                    l-Q-P+t)*-/,
and (for use when t) is small),
                    5 =(l-r+p)|+/||-i|-,,

    XIV. The equation to the ellipsoid at the second tempe
rature being
 ( 1 - 2\)(f + v2 + P) - 2(i>f + Wa + r? +           eg +.#?) = 1,
it follows that the radius vector OP'( = p) having direction-
cosines /, m, n is given by the equation
       i = 1 - 2\- 2( pP + qm2 + rri1 + dm + enl +flm),
whence
           p — l = \+pP + qm1 + ri? + dmn + enl+fhi} .
The absolute coefficient of expansion for the crystal-line having
the direction Im n is therefore given by the right-hand side of
this equation, in which X represents the absolute coefficient of
expansion of the crystal-line OB.
    If the absolute coefficient of expansion of a given line of the
crystal bo determined by any method, the unknown quantity
X in the above formula can be eliminated.
    XV. We now proceed to apply this method to the calcula
tion of the thermic axes of anorthite.
    The following Table gives the parameters, as calculated by
Beckenkainp from the observed angles, and also the logarithms
of the various terms required in the calculation ofj>, q, r, d, e,f.

   XVI. We may in the first place remark that the expansions
p, q, r and the angles of rotation d, e,f are far from propor
tional to the changes of temperature ; / in fact is greater at
140° C. than at 80° C. and 200° C.
   The thermic axes for the different pairs of temperatures are
the axes of the following quadrics (§ XI.) :—
  20°— 80°       530«2 + 8V+ 42yz + 152z.z- 38^ = 1,
  20°—140°        952a?+f + 89yz + A70zx- l\ay = l,
  20°—200°      16(39^— 57ys-f- 126yz + 1001^-452jry = l.
   It will be found that the values of A/ &c. used by Becken-
kamp (p. 278) correspond to the following quadrics:—
 20°— 80°        520.r! + 84y,+ 42yr + 152z«- 37^ = 1,
 20°—140°        952x2+/ + 8%r+ 467^- 70^ = 1,
 20°—200°       1668*-2-57/ + 12Gyr + 1000za;-451.zy = l;
and these are   virtually the same as the equations just given.
   XVII. Owing to this identity of the equations as calculated
by these different methods, it was at first intended to assume the
accuracy of the remainder of Beckenkamp's calculations of the
axes of the 20°—200° C. quadric, and to calculate therefrom the
variation in the angles between these lines at 80° C. and 140° 0.
It was found, however, that from some cause or other the
angles between the lines given by him are not quite right
angles; and in fact it will be found that if L'", M'", N'" be the
positions at 200° C. of the thermic axes for the pair of tempera
tures 20°—200° C, the logarithms of cos L'"X, cos L"'Y,
&c. given by Beckenkamp lead to the angles 90° — 16"-87,

 tively instead of 00°.
    As the variations of the angles between these same lines at
 80° C. and 140° C. was expected to be only a few seconds, it was
 necessary to find out to what the above differences are due,
 and for this it was practically the more convenient course to
 recalculate the axes of the quadric; the conclusion being that
 the lines given by Beckenkamp, though not quite at right
 angles, are close approximations to the thermic axes, differing
 only therefrom by small angles, probably due to the fact that,
 as the roots of the cubic equation are only approximate, the
 axial equations are, on the substitution of each of the values of
 r, only approximately consistent with each other. Indeed,
 there is considerable difficulty in obtaining the final angles
 accurate to seconds with the aid of seven-figure logarithms.
 As, however, the quadric itself is only obtained by neglecting
 squares of small quantities, such precision is really unneces
 sary, and it will be quite sufficient for our purpose to calculate
 the positions of three lines exactly at right angles to each
 other, and as near as possible to the lines just determined.
 For the convenience of future verification, we give the more
important numbers obtained in this calculation.
   XVIII. The equation to the 20°—200° C. quadric being
           1669^-57/ + 126y* + 100l2S-452*y= 1,
the directions of the principal axes are to be determined in the
usual way from the following equations :—
                 (1) 3338.* -452,y+ 1001 r=ra,
                 (2) -452a-114y+ U6z=ry,
                 (3) 1001a; +126^             = rz;
in which, since the equations are simultaneously consistent,
r must be a root of the following cubic
                3338-r        -452        1001
               -452           — 114— r 126          =0,
                1001             126        -r
or
             r* - 3224r2 - 1 602 7 13r + 52783878 = 0.
   The roots of this equation, to the first place of decimals, are
                 + 3658-2      +31-0        -465-2;
each of these roots corresponds to one of the thermic axes
which are denoted respectively as 1/", M'", N"'. As it was
found that these roots are not sufficiently approximate to give
the final angles accurately to seconds, the axes were deter

mined by the substitution of the values of r, not in a single
pair but in each of the three pairs of equations, the mean
result being taken as the true value.
   For b-evity, the angle_(7r— PX) is denoted by PX, and
thus —cos PX by cos PX.

   Substituting for r the value +3658*2, and solving for
x : y : z or cos L/"X : cos L"'Y : cos L'"Z, we get from the
respective pairs of equations (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1):—

It will be found by actual calculation that, in each of the
three cases, the sum of the squares of the cosines corre
sponding to the above moan logarithms is unity.
    The angles L'"M'", M"'N"', N'"L'" calculated from these
mean logarithms will bo found to be respectively 90°+ 6",
 90° + 9", 90°-3", and thus still differ from 90°.
    From the fact that the values determined from the different
pairs of equations present in each case only small differences,
we conclude that the above mean direction-cosines cannot be
very far from precise; and, further, that it will be as laborious
as useless to attempt to obtain a nearer approximation by the
help of seven-figure logarithm-tables. We shall therefore now
content ourselves, after thus proving that tho differences are
accounted for by the neglect of small quantities of the second
order, with finding a set of linos exactly perpendicular to each
other, and as nearly as possible coincident with the above
positions of L'", M'", N'".
    It will be found that such a triad of lines is defined by the
numbers given below:—
log cob L'"X 9-9822675-4 log cos L'"Y 90269392-4 log cos L'"Z 9 4133462-5

logcosN'"X 9-4289635-6 log cos N'"Y" 9-7869661 -7 logcosN'"Z9-8713562-8
And we shall henceforth adopt these lines as the positions at
200° C. of the lines which are at right angles both at 20° C. and
200° C. As has been pointed out above, they may, to the same
degree of approximation, be regarded as the positions at 20° C.
of the lines which are at right angles at the same pair of
temperatures.
   XIX. Before we proceed to determine the variation of the
angles between these lines at the several temperatures, we shall
put on their trial the formulae to be used. For this purpose
we shall calculate, with tho help of the values of p, q, r, d, e, f
given in § XV., the angles between the crystallographic axes
at 20° C. from the angles at 200° C, and compare them with the
values given by Beekenkamp.

                   on Change of Temperature.                       425
   The direction-cosines of A'", B'", C" are defined by the
following numbers (§§ I. &XV.) :—
logco8A'"X=9-9543897-7, cosA"T=0,               logcosA'"Z=9-63S7478-0;

from 90° of the angles between the crystal-lines L, M, N at

              Variation of    LM.        MN.       LN.

The variations at 80° C. and 140° C. of the angles between
the three crystal-lines which are at right angles both at
 "20° C. and 200° C. are thus very small ; even if parameters
determined by experiment are accepted as perfectly accurate.

 culated the positions of the lines which are at right angles
 both at 20° C. and 80° C, and find that they are virtually
 coincident with those calculated by Beckenkamp ; hence we
 infer that he is correct in stating that the directions of the
 thermic axes as calculated from his measurements widely differ
 for the two pairs of temperatures.
    XXIII. The variations tabulated in § XXI. are, however,
 sufficient to prove that even this wide difference of about 26^°
 results from changes in the relative inclinations of LMN so
 small that they might be accounted for by the minute errors
 incidental to the measurement of the angles. In the first
 place, although single seconds were read off by the micro
 scope, an angle, when determined with a rising temperature,
 varied in some cases from that determined with a falling
 temperature by as much as 10", the average variation l>eing
  6""1 ; secondly, the corrections derived according to the
  method of least squares and applied by Beckenkamp to the
  measured angles have an average value of 3""2 and reach a
 positive maximum of 9"'7 and a negative maximum of — 8//-7;
  thirdly, although it is not impossibl ¦, still it is curious that
  the pair of lines LM should be at right angles not only at
  20° C. and 200° C. but also at a third temperature between
  80° C. and 140° C; and lastly, as Beckenkamp points out in
  the later paper, there may be a minute distortion of the

crystal owing to the heating-effect of the rays concentrated
on one side during the measurement of an angle.
    In bringing to a close this paper, of which the latter part
has been given up to a critical examination of the important
results obtained by Beckenkamp, we beg to express on behalf
of the students of crystals our hearty thanks for the series
of careful observations made by him with the elaborate in
 strument belonging to the University of Strasburg ; and we
 may add that the labour involved in the interpretation of his
 measurements will only be fully appreciated by those who may
 be attracted by the subject to repeat some of the calculations.
   LXI. On Lines of no Chemical Change. By Edmund J.
      Mills, D.Sc, F.R.S., and William M'D. Mackey*.
                             [Plate Vm.]
 MOST of the chemical changes we ordinarily observe are
         examined either in their course or at their termination;
 but although it is clear that they must have a beginning, the
 beginning is extremely difficult as a mental conception, and
 quite inaccessible to direct experiment.
     We have considered it of great interest to determine in cer
 tain cases the " origin " of chemical change, such origin being
 obviously identifiable in many instances with a line of no
 chemical change.
     The substances selected for reaction were aqueous hydric
  sulphate and zinc, brought in contact under definite conditions.
  Supposing the temperature to remain constant, and hydrogen
  to be evolved from the unrenewed reagents, the gas will, as is
  well known, cease to appear when the hydric sulphate has
  been partially exhausted. If y be the percentage strength of
  the sulphate (H3 S04) and x the amount of gas evolved, we
  can express y in terms of x (provided the experimental num
  bers lie sufficiently near to the origin) by the equation
                           y = a + bx + ex1,
   where a, b, c are constants to be calculated from three expe
   riments at least. Then putting x=0, we obtain the value a
   for y: this value is a point on the line of no chemical change.
      Other points can be similarly obtained at other constant
   temperatures ; and when these are all continuously joined, the
   result is the line of no chemical change for the hydrogen
   reaction as a function of strength and temperature. We have
   always used three experiments and three terms of Taylor's
                      * Communicated by the Authors.

  430               Messrs. Mills and Mackey on
  series; having found these sufficient to enable us to draw,
  with fair approximate accuracy, the line of which we were in
  quest*.
     The zinc we employed was prepared electrolytically from a
  solution of highly purified acetate, pressed together, and then
  rapidly melted in a porcelain crucible by the heat of an alcohol
  Hame. It was then flattened out between recently polished
  steel surfaces until almost exactly 0-5 millim. thick ; ribbon-
  shaped pieces cut from it, 1 millim. wide and weighing 0*5
  grm., were coiled in the form of a short helix. Each zinc,
  before immersion in the experimental liquid, was dipped in
  alcoholic potash for three minutes, rapidly washed with water,
  and drained on clear filter-paper; the metal was thus perfectly
  cleaned without material loss. A fresh zinc was used for each
  experiment.
     The hydric sulphate was prepared by fractional distillation
  from an extremely pure purchased sample. We failed to
 detect in it any foreign body excepting water. As the basis
 of our apparatus, we employed a constant-temperature bath,
 designed by one of us some time since (Edinb. Phil. Trans.
  1881, p. 567, to which place we refer for a detailed drawing
 and description of the instrument). Into the central or " con
 stant '' compartment of this bath we introduced, as will be
 seen in the Plate, a glass tube (15 x 155 millim.) closed at one
 end, which always held 5 cub. cent, of the sulphate under
 examination. Thermometer 40803, on which 0-01 C. could
 be read by estimation, was next inserted, and when this
 showed a sensibly constant temperature the zinc helix was
 dropped in. The delivery-cap (see Plate VIII. fig. 1) was now
 slid down over the reaction-tube, its point inserted under the
 collecting-cylinder, and time noted when the first bubble of
 gas came off. The bubbles were in all cases very small.
 In some cases, especially in the first three or four sets of
experiments, the cessation of the reaction was difficult to
observe. In these the gas came off sluggishly during the
first minute, rose to a maximum of delivery-rate during the
third or fourth minute, and then gradually became slower.
It is among these groups that the longest times were recorded;
and chemical change was considered to have ceased when the
rate fell below one bubble a minute. In the other sets, on
the contrary, there was no difficulty in determining the point
of termination ; action commenced briskly at once;, and con
cluded with considerable abruptness. It will be observed that,
as the temperature rises, the time (as might have been ex
pected) diminishes. All our experiments were performed as

   As regards the first portion of the curve (i. e. up to and

temperature is indicated sufficiently well by an equation based

the equation

which shows that the second hyperbola tends strongly towards
symmetry with the first: s2=57'77 is an asymptote.

s = 79-02. A drawing of them (fig. 3) is appended.
   The percentage strength of sulphato which, as computed
from our data, just prevents action at 35°'25is 79'62—a num
ber decidedly remote from the experimental values from which
it was calculated. We therefore thought it worth while to
make trials with 76-55 per cent, sulphate at mean tempera
tures of 35°-35 and 35°-20 ; in both ca.ses we obtained a very
distinct, though slight evolution of gas. These results add
considerable weight to the particular value under discussion.

                The Physical Basis of Probability.                 433
   The nature of the reaction between pure aqueous hydric
sulphate and zinc is shown by our experiments to be of a very
complicated character. Thus, from 58'77 to 79*62 there are
two temperatures corresponding to every strength ; and
between strength 54*47 and 57'77 at least, there are four
temperatures corresponding to every strength.
   The law of relation of temperature to chemical change has
hitherto been very little investigated. Hood and Warder,
after some trial experiments, have regarded chemical effect
as proportional to the square of the temperature. Our own
representation places temperature on the footing of a chemical
reagent.
    Our work has had exclusive reference to the beginning of
a chemical reaction ; its object has been to find the initial line
of no chemical change. There is, however, obviously a ter
minal zero-line, similarly obtainable, and related to the condi
tions existing at the close of a reaction. Between these two
lines lies the surface, on which would occur all possible events
in the actual process of change.
    It is our intention to resume this investigation.
  LXII. The Physical Basis of Probability. By F. Y. Edge-
    WORTH, M.A., Lecturer on Logic at King's College, London*.
 A REMARKABLE analogy has been drawn by Donkinf
         between the behaviour of a material particle tending to
 equilibrium under the influence of attractive centres of various
 force, and the determination of the judgment to the " weighted
 mean " of several observations. The essential feature of the
 analogy is, according to the view of the present writer, the
 circumstance that mental as well as mechanical equilibrium is
 represented by a sum of squares. The expression
             9\(x\ ~ *02 + 9a(&* —    + ffii.^ —      + &c.
 represents (twice) the potential energy of a dynamical system
 consisting of centres, at the points Xi, x2, &c. along a line, of
 attractive force proportioned to the simple distance multiplied
 by ffif g2, &c. respectively. The same expression represents
 the disadvantage incurred by taking x as the real point from
 which the observations xly x2, &c. of weights respectively gl}
 g2, &c. have diverged. But the representation in the latter
 case is not so faithful as in the former. The simple sum of
 squares is not the measure, but only the criterion, of the
 psychical quantity; decreasing as it decreases, and becoming

the least possible when it becomes the least possible, but not
proportional to it. This sort of relation between psychical
quantity and mathematical expression may be illustrated by
the mathematical theory of exchange. There the forces at
work, the tastes of the buyers ard sellers, are of inconceivable
complexity. Yet the position of equilibrium is characterized
by a feature of geometrical simplicity, uniformity of rate-of-
exchange. This possibility of mathematically representing
maximum advantage is due to the same cause in the market
as in the observatory : what may be called the law of great
numbers. The sum of squares above written makes its ap
pearance in virtue of the exponential law of error or proba
bility-curve incidental to the Method of Least Squares ; and
this simple form arises when the observations are independent
of each other and indefinitely * numerous. Similarly the law
of unity of price holds good where the competitors are inde-
perdent and indefinitely numerous. In both cases uniformity
is due to plurality; definite order to infinite numbers.
    It follows from this view that Doukin's representation of
the forces of the intellectual machine is (except at the vanish
ing-point of equilibrium) nugatory. There is no correspond-
once between a force proportional to the simple distance and
the mysterious pleasure-forco which urges us to choose the
most advantageous value. So, too, it would be easy to en
hance the geometricalf representation of the field of com
petition by introducing the assumption that each economic
atom is urged to objects of gratification according to some
simple law of force. But the assumption would be destitute
of scientific value.
    The real point of union between the things compared by
 Donkin is the correspondence between the tendency of a me
 chanical system to maximum (kinetic, minimr n potential)
 energy and the tendency of volition to maximum pleasure.
 This seems to be the physical basis of volition, and if so, of
belief, with which, upon a plausible^ theory, volition may almost
bo identified. No doubt it is difficult to refer all acts of will
to one and the same law of maximum pleasure ; it is not easy
to refer some actions to any such law. It is difficult also to
identify all the energy-principles of mathematical physics ;

 refracting surfaces, and so forth. Nevertheless he who has
 realized the omnipresence and all-powerfulness of a maximum-
 principle in one form or another, both in the physical and the
 moral sciences, and who is persuaded of the harmony of those
 sciences, will not hastily abandon the conjecture that in the
 correspondence between maximum energy and greatest pos
 sible happiness is to be sought the first principle of Psycho-
 Physics.
         LXIII. On the Electromotive Force of Alloys.
           By John Tbowbbidge and E. K. Stevens.*
THE best study of alloys and the most thorough work on
        them has been done by Mattbiessen, who proved con
clusively that alloys were neither mechanical mixtures nor
 chemical compounds, but what he terms, in a general way,
" a solidified so^tion of one metal in another." Ho also
showed that, with reference to the formation of alloys, metals
were divided in*o two classes—the first class being those
 which, when alloyed with each other, give a conductivity in
proportion to the respective volumes of the two metals ; and
 the second those which, when alloyed with each other, give
a conductivity which is less than that of the respective volumes
of the two metals.
    The aim of this investigation has been to note the variation
of electromotive force in different alloys of the same metals
and to deduce, if possible, some general law which governs
the variation.
    Two sets of alloys were used—one set of lead and tin, and
the other of copper and zinc. The first set was made by
taking the proportional weights of lead and tin, and melting
them together in a crucible, and then pouring them out on a
flat surface and allowing them to cool. The second sot was
made by melting a weighed amount of copper in a Fletcher
gas-furnace, and, when in a molten state, adding more than
the required amount of zinc, in order to make allowance for
volatilization. Pure metals were obtained, in order that the
results might be as accurate as possible.
    It was deemed sufficient, as far as the lead and tin alloys
were concerned, to weigh out carefully the required amounts
of each metal, and to take those weights as showing ths com
position. This could not be done with the copper and zinc
alloys, as it is impossible to determine how much of the zinc

436            Messrs. Trowbridge and Stevens on
volatilizes ; so with these it is necessary to resort to ana
lytical methods of determining the percentage of each. The
copper was determined by electrolysis, by precipitating the
copper, from a sulphuric-acid solution of the alloy, upon a
platinum disk connected with the negative pole of a battery,
and the positive pole dipping in the solution. The zinc was
determined by subtracting the per cent, of copper from a
hundred per cent.
   The composition of the alloys are given in the tables below,
and will be referred to by number hereafter.

   Four determinations were made with these alloys, the first
two being the observation of the electromotive force of each
alloy, with platinum for the positive pole and the alloy as
the negative pole, with fresh pond-water as the liquid ; the
second two being the determination of the electromotive force
with the same positive pole, but with distilled water acidulated
with a small quantity of sulphuric acid for a liquid. A mirror-
galvanometer and ground-glass scale were used, and a large
resistance placed in the circuit, and the galvanometer shunted
so as to reduco the deflection.
   The first two tables do not "give any general law for the
electromotive force of alloys, the force being especially irre
gular, which is perhaps due to the fact that the electromotive
forces of the two metals are very nearly alike.
   The explanation of the third table is rather unsatisfactory,
since the sulphate of lead is insoluble, while the sulphate of
tin is not known ; and this last may account for the change
from the first tables. In the fourth table, the increase in
electromotive force of the alloys containing the more copper
may be accounted for by the fact that the sulphate of copper
is more readily soluble than the sulphate of zinc.

   The resistance of distilled water is so great, that it was
 impossible to get any good or satisfactory results. The
addition of about one tenth of a cubic centimetre of strong
 sulphuric acid to about one hundred and fifty cubic centi

 observations.

    It would seem to follow, from the last table at least, that
in acid solutions the electromotive force of alloys is determined
by the proportional part of that metal which is most readily
attacked by the acid.
    The general differences in the behaviour of the two sets of
alloys may perhaps be accounted for by the distinction which
 Matthiessen* made between the two kinds of alloys. He
 classes an alloy of lend and tin among those which are
" solidified solutions of one metal in another," while he calls
alloys like copper and zinc " solidified solutions of one metal
in an allotropic modification of another."

     LXIV. On the Laws of Motion.         By Professor Tait.
    To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       Gentlemen,
I DO not think that any useful purpose could be served by
       my entering upon a discussion with Mr. Browne, as his
views are so entirely different from mine.
   But I must request you kindly to afford me an opportunity
of letting your readers know precisely what are those views of
mine which Mr. Browne regards as dangerous.
   They will see from the enclosed abstract of my paper that
all I propose is to dispense with the sense-suggested idea of
Force, and to introduce in its place the objective reality Energy.
    I think your readers will probably consider Mr. Browne to
be a much more sweeping and dangerous innovator than my
self ; for while we both acknowledge Time and Space, I main
tain the objectivity alike of Matter and of Energy, and base
my system on them ; but Mr. Browne practically throws them
both overboard, and constructs his physical universe by means
 of Force alone.                                  Yours truly,
   College, Edinburgh,                                  P. G. TAIT.
   November 10th, 1883.
                     On the Laws of Motion*.
The one objection to which, in modern times, Newton's
 wonderfully complete and compact system (the Axiomata sive
 Leges Motiis) is liable, is that it is expressly founded on the
 conception of what is now called ;< force" as an agent which
 u compels " a change of the state of rest or motion of a body.
 This is part of the first law; and the second law is merely a
definite statement of the amount of change produced by a
given force.
    There can be no doubt that the proper use of the term force
 in modern science is that which is implied in the statement—
 Force is whatever changes a body's state of rest or motion.
 This is part of the first law of motion. Thus we see that force
 is the English equivalent of Newton's term vis impressa. But
 it is also manifest that, on many occasiors, hut only where his
 meaning admitted of no doubt, Newton omitted the word im
 pressa and used vis alone, in the proper sense of force. In
 other cases he omitted the word impressa, as being implied
 in some other adjective such as centripeta, gravitans, &c,
   * Communicated bv the Author, as an Abstract of a Paper read before
 the Royal Society of Edinburgh, December 18, 1882.

  440              Prof. Tait on the Laws of Motion.
  which he employed to qualify the word vis. That this is the
  true state of the case is made absolutely certain by the fol
  lowing :—
      Definitio IV. Vis impressa est actio in corpus exercita, ad
  mutandum ejus statum vel quiescendi vel movendi uniformiter in
  directum.
      Contrast this with the various senses in which the word nil
  is used in the comment which immediately follows, viz.:—
      Constitit hajc vis in actione sola, neque post actionem per-
  manet in corpore. Perseverat enim corpus in statu omni novo
  per solam vim inertias. Est autem vis impressa diversarum
  originum, ut ex ictu, ex pressionc, cx vi centripeta.
      These passages are translated by Motte as below:—
      " Definition IV. An impressed force is an action exerted
  upon a body, in order to change its state, either of rest, or of
  moving uniformly forivard in a right line."
     " This force consists in the action only, and remains no
 longer in the body when the action is over. For a body
 maintains every new state it acquires, by its vis inertia; only.
 Impressed forces are of different origins ; as from percussion,
 from pressure, from centripetal force."
     The difficulty which Motte here makes for himself, and
 which he escapes from only by leaving part of the passage in
 the original Latin, is introduced solely by his use of the word
force as the equivalent of the Latin vis.
     We may quote two other passages of Newton bearing defi
 nitely on this point.
     Definitio III. Malerim vis insita est potentia reshtendi, qua
 corpus unumquodque, quantum in se est, perseverat in statu suo
 vel quiescendi vel movendi uniformiter in directum.
     It is perfectly clear that, in this passage, the phrase vis
 insita is one idea, not two, and that vis cannot here be trans
 lated by force. Yet Motto has
     " The vis insita, or innate force of matter, is " &c.
     Definitio V. Vis centripeta est, qua corpora versus punctum
 aliquod, tanquam ad centrum, undique Irahuntur, impelluntur,
 vel utcumque tendunt.
     It is obvious that the qualifying term centripeta here includes
 the idea suggested by impressa, defining in fact the direction
 of the vis, and therefore implying that its origin is outeide the
 body.
    After what has just been said, no further comment need be
 added to show the absurdity of the terms accelerating force,
 innate force, impressed force, &c. All of these have arisen
 simply from mistranslation. Vis, by itself, is often used for
force ; but vis acceleratrix, vis impressa, vis insita, and other

                 Prof. Tait on the Laws of Motion.             441
phrases of the kind must be taken as wholes ; and, in them,
vis does not mean force.
    The absurdity of translating the word vis by force comes out
 still more clearly when we think of the term dm viva, or living
force as it is sometimes called ; a name for kinetic energy,
 which depends on the unit of length in a different way from
 force. It must be looked upon as one of the most extraordi
 nary instances of Newton's clearness of insight that, at a time
 when the very terminology of science was only as it were
 shaping itself, he laid down with such wonderful precision a
 system absolutely self-consistent.
     From the passages just quoted, taken in conjunction with
 the second law of motion, we see that (as above stated) in
 Newton's view—
    Force is whatever causes (but not, or tends to cause) a change
 in a body's state of rest or motion.
     Newton gives no sanction to the so-called statical ideas of
 force. Every force, in his view, produces its effect. The
 effects may be such as to balance or compensate one another ;
 but there is no balancing of forces.
     (Next comes a discussion as to the objectivity or subjectivity
 of force. An abstract of this is given in §§ 288-296 of the
 article Mechanics in the new edition of the Encyc. Brit., and
 need not be reproduced here.)
     But, just as there can be no doubt that force has no objec
 tive existence, so there can be no doubt that the introduction
 of this conception enabled Newton to put his Axiomata in
 their exceedingly simple form. And there would be, even
 now, no really valid objection to Newton's system (with all its
 exquisite simplicity and convenience) could we only substitute
 for the words " force " and " action " &c, in the statement of
 his laws, words which (like rate or gradient &c.) do not imply
 objectivity or causation in the idea expressed. It is not easy
 to see how such words could be introduced ; but assuredly they
 will be required if Newton's system is to be maintained. The
 word " stress " might, even yet, be introduced for this purpose;
 though, like force, it has come to be regarded as something
 objective. Were this possible, we might avoid the necessity
 for any very serious change in the form of Newton's system.
 I intend, on another occasion, to consider this question. How
 complete Newton's statement is, is most easily seen by con
 sidering the so-called " additions " which have been made to it.
     The second and third laws, together with the scholium to
 the latter, expressly include the whole system of " effective
 forces " &c, for which D'Alembert even now receives in many
 quarters such extraordinarily exaggerated credit. The " re

442             Prof. Tait on tlte Laws of Motion.
 versed effective force " on a particle revolving uniformly in a
circle is nothing but an old friend—" centrifugal force." And
even this phantom is still of use, in skilled hands, in forming
the equations for certain cases of motion.
   The chief arguments for ard against a modern modification
of the laws of motion are therefore as follows (where we must
remember that they refer exclusively to the elementary teach«
ing of the subject, and have no application to the case of those
who have sufficient knowledge to enable them to avoid the pos
sible dangers of Newton's method J:—
   I. For. Is it wise to teach a student by means of the con
ception of force, and then, as it were, to kick down the scaf
folding by telling him there is no such thing ?
   II. Against. Is it wise to give up the use of a system, due
to such an altogether exceptional genius as that of Newton ,
and which amply suffices for all practical purposes, merely
because it owes part of its simplicity and compactness to the
introduction of a conception which, though strongly impressed
on us by our muscular sense, corresponds to nothing objective ?
   Every one must answ er these questions for himself; and his
answer will probably be determined quite as much by his
notions of the usefulness of the study of natural philosophy as
by his own idiosyncrasies of thought.
   Those who desire that their scientific code should be, as far
as possible, representative of our real knowledge of objective
things, would undoubtedly prefer to that of Newton a system
in which there is not an attempt, however successful, to gain
simplicity by the introduction of subjective impressions and the
corresponding conceptions.
   In the present paper simplicity of principle, only, is sought
for; and the mathematical methods employed are those which
appea red (independent altogether of the question of their fitness
for a beginner) the shortest and most direct. A second part
will be devoted to simplicity of'method for elementary teaching.
   (1) So far as our modern knowledge goes, there are but
two objective things in the physical world—matter and energy.
Energy cannot exist except as associated with matter; and it.
can be perceived and measured by us only when it is being
transferred, by a " dynamical transaction," from one portion
of matter to another. In such transferences it is often " trans
formed;" but no process has ever been devised or observed
by which the quantity, either of matter or energy, has been
altered.
   (2) Hence the true bases of our subject, so far as we yet
know, are:—
   1. Conservation of matter.

                Prof. Tait on the Laics of Motion.               443
   2. Conservation of energy.
   3. That property (those properties ?) of matter, in virtue of
which it is the necessary vehicle, or, as the case may be, the
storehouse, of energy.
   (3) The third of these alone presents any difficulty. So
long as energy is obviously kinetic, this property is merely
our old friend inertia. But the mutual potential energy of
two gravitating masses, two electrified bodies, two currents,
or two magnets, is certainly associated (at least in part, and
in some as yet unknown way) with matter, of a kind not yet
subjected to chemical scrutiny, which occupies the region
in which these masses &c. are situated. And even when
the potential energy obviously depends on the strain of a
portion of ordinary matter, as in compressed air, a bent spring,
a deformed elastic solid, &c, we can, even now, only describe
it as due to " molecular action," depending on mechanism of
a kind as yet unknown to us :—though in some cases, such
as the kinetic gas theory, at least partially guessed at.
   (4) The necessity for the explicit assumption of the third
principle, and a hint at least of the limits within which it must
be extended, appear when we consider the very simplest case
of motion, viz. that of a lone particle moving in a region in
which its potential energy is the same at every point. For
the corservation of energy tells us merely that its speed is
unaltered. We know, however, that this is only part, of the
truth : the velocity is constant. It will be seen later that this has
most important dynamical consequences in various directions.
   (The remarkable discussion of this point by Clerk-Maxwell
is then referred to, in which it is virtually shown that, were
things otherwise, it would be possible for a human mind to
have knowledge of absolute position and of absolute velocity.)
   (5) But Maxwell's reasoning is easily seen to apply equally
to any component of the velocity. Hence, when we come to
the case in which the potential energy depends on the posi
tion, the only change in the particle's motion at any instant
is a change of the speed in the normal to the equipotential
surface on which the particle is at that instant situated. The
conservation of energy assigns the amount of this change, and
thus the motion is completely determined. If V be the poten
tial energy of unit mass at the point p, we have at once
                             P = -W,
from which the circumstances of the motion can be deduced.
In fact, this problem is precisely tho same as was that of the
motion of a luminous corpuscle in anon-homogeneous medium,
the speed of passing through any point of the medium being
assigned.

444             Prof. Tait on the Laws of Motion.
   (6) It is next shown that the above inertia-condition (that
the velocity parallel to tho equipotential surface is the same
for two successive elements of the path) at once leads to a
" stationary " value of the sum of the quantities vds for each
two successive elements, and therefore for any finite arc, of
the path. This is, for a single particle, the Principle of Least
Action, which is thus seen to be a direct consequence of inertia.
 . (It is then shown that the results above can be easily ex
tended to a particle which has two degrees of freedom only.)
   But it is necessary to remember that, in these cases, we take
a partial view of the circumstances; for a lone particle cannot
strictly be said to have potential energy, nor can we conceive
of a constraint which does not depend upon matter other than
that which is constrained. Hence the true statement of such
cases requires further investigation.
   (7) To pass to the case of a system of free particles we require
some quasi kinematical preliminaries. These are summed up
in the following self-evident proposition : —If with each par-
tide of a system we associate two vectors, e. g. ©1} <£x, with
the mass wij, &c, we have
where                 @=@o+0,
and                2m0 = 2(»n).0o,
                   2m<D=2(m) . <I>0;
so that B0 and *0 are the values of & and $ for the whole
mass collected at its centre of inertia, and 0, <j> those of the
separate particles relative to that centre.
   (8) Thus, if © = P = P0 + p be the vector of m,
                       3>=0 = P=Po + p
its velocity, we have
                  2mPP = S(m) . P0P0 + Xmpp,
the scalar of which is, in a differentiated form, a well-known
property of the centre of inertia. The vector part shows that
the sum of the moments of momentum about any axis is equal
to that of the whole mass collected at its centre of inertia,
together with those of the several particles about a parallel
axis through the centre of inertia.
    If               @=4> = p,
we have              2mP2 = 2(m) . PJ + Imp2;
i. e. the kinetic energy, referred to any point, is equal to that

                Prof. Tait on the Laws of Motion.             445
of the mass collected at its centre of inertia, together with that
of the separate particles relative to the centre of inertia.
    If we integrate this expression, multiplied by dt, between
any limits, we easily obtain a similar theorem with regard to
the Action of the system.
    Such theorems may be multiplied indefinitely.
    (9) From those just given, however, if we take them along
with 3 above, we see at once that, provided the particles of the
system be all free, while the energy of each is purely kinetic
and independent alike of the configuration of the system and
of its position in space:—
    1. The centre of inertia has constant velocitv;
    2. The vector-moment of momentum about it is constant;
    3. So is that of the system relative to any uniformly moving
point;
    4. Zjmwis is obviously a minimum.
    (10) The result of (7) points to an independence between
two parts of the motion of a system, i. e. that relative to the
centre of inertia and that of the whole mass supposed concen
trated at the centre of inertia. Maxwell's reasoning is appli
cable directly to the latter if the system be self-contained, i. e.
if it do not receive energy from, or part with it to, external
bodies. Hence we may extend the axiom 3 to the centre of
inertia of any such self-contained system, and, as will presently
be shown, also to the motion of the system relative to its centre
 of inertia. This, though not formally identical with Newton's
 Lex III., leads, as we shall see, to exactly the same con
 sequences.
    (11) If, for a moment, we confine our attention to a free
 system consisting of two particles only, we have
                   niipi + m2p3=(?nx + rn2)a,
 or
                   rn1p1 + mip2 = 0                             («)
 This must be consistent with the conservation of energy, which
 gives
                   K^^+^)=/[T(Pl-p2)], ...(£)
 since the potential energy must depend (so far as position
 goes) on the distance between the particles only. Comparing
 (a) and (j8), we see that we may treat (/3) by partial differ
 entiation, so far as the coordinates of      and m2are separately
 concerned. For we thus obtain
                     >NiPi = VPl •/=/'• U(pi-p2),

446             Prof. Tait on the Laws of Motion.
   Each of these, again, is separately consistent with the equa
tion in § 5 for a lone particle. Hence, again, the integral
has a stationary value.
   Hence also, whatever be the origin, provided its velocity be
constant,
                           2mVpp=0.
   Thus, even when there is a transformation of the energy of
 the system, the results of § 1) still hold good.
   And it is to be observed that if one of the masses, say m4,
is enormously greater than the other, the equation
                          mip1 + m^p2 = 0
shows that p2 is excessively small, and the visible change of
motion is confined to the smaller mass. Carrying this to the
limit, we have the case of motion about a (so-called) " fixed
centre.' In s^uc'i a case it is clear tha-, though the momenta
of the two m; s^es relative to their centre of inertia are equal
and opposite, the kinetic energy of the greater mass vanishes
in comparison with that of the smaller.
   These results are then extended to any self-con tained system
of free particles, and the principle of Varying Action follows
at once. It is thus seen to be a general express'on of the
three propositions of § 2 above.
   (12) So far as we have gone, nothing has been said as
to how the mutual potential energy of two particles depends
on their distance apart. If we supposo it to be enormously
increased by a very small increase of distance, we have prac
tically the case of two particles connected by an inextensible
string—as a chain-shot. But from this point of view such
cases, like those of connexion by an extensible string, fall under
the previous categories.
   The case of impact of two particles falls under the same
rules, so far as motion of the centre of inertia and moment of
momentum about that centre are concerned. The conserva
tion of energy requires in such cases the consideration of the
energy spent in permanently disfiguring the impinging bodies,
setting them into internal vibration, or heating them. But
the first and third of these, at least, are beyond the scope of
abstract dynamics.
   (13) The same may be said of constraint by a curve or
surface, and of loss of energy by friction or resistance of a
medium. Thus a constraining curve or surface must be looked
upon (like ail physical bodies) as deformable; but, if neces

sary, such that a very small deformation corresponds to a very
great expenditure of energy.
   (14) To deal with communications of energy from bodies
outside the system, all we need do is to include them in the
system. Treat as before the whole system thus increased, and
then consider only the motion of the original parts of the
system. This method applies with perfect generality whether
the external masses be themselves free, constrained, or resisted.
   (15) Another method of applying the same principles is
then given. Starting from the definition dA='£m$pdp, the
kinematical properties of A are developed. Then, by the help
of § 2, these are exhibited in their physical translations.
    (16) The paper concludes with a brief comparison of the
fundamental principles of the science as they have been intro
duced by Newton, Lagrange, Hamilton, Peirce, Kircbhoff,
and Clerk-Maxwell respectively, and also as they appear in
the unique Vortex-system of Thomson.
       LXV. Experiments on the Velocity of Sound in Air.
                      By D. J. Blaikley*.
THE method of experiment which I venture to bring before
        you this afternoon is the outcome of various attempts
made by me to determine with greater accuracy than had
hitherto been done the velocity of sound in small tubes, such
as are used for musical instruments; in addition to which
practical purpose the idea presented itself to my mind that, if
a series of tubes were taken, having their diameters in a
definite ratio, the observed results might by calculation be
extended so as to include a value for a tube of infinite dia
meter, that is for free air. Some of the results were brought
before the Musical Association in June last; but the experi
ments have since been repeated with greater accuracy.
    It will not be necessary to take up your time by referring
 to more than a few of the many determinations that have been
made. A useful summary was given by Mr. Bosanquet in the
' Philosophical Magazine' for April 1877; but we may note
that only those observations in which corrections both for
temperature and for moisture have been made can be con
sidered at all accurate.
    Such corrections being made, there remained at the time of
 Kegnault's great series of experiments f considerable differences
in the results arrived at by difl'erent observers, partly due,

448                  Mr. D. J. Blaikley on the
doubtless, to errors of observation and partly to an assumption
of the absolute correctness of Laplace's formula, the theory in
the application of which is that the excess of pressure in the
wave above the barometric pressure of the air is infinitely
small.
   Experiments on the velocity of sound may be classed as
open-air experiments and laboratory experiments ; and I
venture to think that the latter offer advantages which cannot
be enjoyed in open-air work. The usual method in the open
air has been for an observer at a distance from a gun to note
the time which elapses between the flash and the hearing of
the report ; but even when the actual record of the time is
aided by electrical or other apparatus, some difficulties and
sources of error remain. For instance, the accurate registra
tion of temperature and moisture is difficult, especially when
the sound-wave passes at various heights above the earth's
surface, as is the case when the experiment is carried out on
two hills separated by a valley.
   Many of these gun-fire determinations were critically exa
mined by Lo Roux*, and an estimated correction made for
errors in temperature, the readings having been in all proba
bility too high for air some metres above the ground.
   Midway in character between open-air and laboratory expe
riments stand those of Regnault, carried out in gas- and water-
mains ; one of his reasons for choosing this method being the
facility afforded by these tubes for the accurate observation
of temperature and moisture. Passing by his work for the
moment, we may note the laboratory method employed
by Kundt, and also Le Roux's method, the latter giving
330-7 metres at 0°C. Kundt's method consists in its best
form in the use of two glass tubes connected by a smaller
tube or rod of glass, wood, or metal, this connecting-rod being
clamped in certain positions to establish nodes, and its free
vibrating ends being fitted with pistons working in the large
tubes. The waves are excited by friction in the vibrating rod
and transmitted therefrom to the air or other gas in the tubes,
and the successive half-wave lengths are registered by the
positions assumed by lycopodium dust during the vibration.
By using tubes of different diameters he obtained the results
shown in Table L, and came to the conclusion that the velo
city observed in his largest tube was not appreciably different
 from the velocity in free air. He appears, however, to have
experienced some difficulty in the determination of pitch,
owing to the evanescent character of the sound. The intensity

    Le Eoux's method consisted in employing a U-shaped tube,
0*07 metre (70 millim.) diameter, closed by a membrane at each
end. One membrane was tapped with a small beater, and the
time occupied by the resulting wave in travelling between the
two membranes, as indicated by the disturbance of the second
one, was registered. It appears to me, however, that the em
ployment of membranes may introduce a source of error in this
way:—Let A B be a tube closed by a rigid material at one
end, and of a length to give the
maximum resonance to a quarter- -                             —°
wave. Now, instead of the rigid
end, let the tube be closed by a                            ;
membrane : this will require to be in the position C, t. e. nearer
to A than B is, the exact position depending upon the tension
of the membrane. In Le Roux's experiments, unless the two
membranes were of exactly the same tension, a source of
error would be introduced.
   We may now turn to Regnault's experiments, a summary
of which is here given.

450                 Mr. D. J. Blaikley on the
   The one point which appears to me to be open to question
is whether the rate of diminution of velocity is so great as his
work appears to prove; for if this rate of diminution is ex
tended until we reach tubes of the size used in musical instru
ments, we should have a velocity much less than experiments
show to exist in such tubes (compare with Kundt). Probably
the want of perfect smoothness in Regnault's tubes may account
for some of the difference ; but I think that it is doubtful
whether the influence of the membranes closing his tubes was
thoroughly allowed for, and feel that the question is still an
open one.
   It has long appeared to me that useful results might be
obtained by making use of tubes giving musical notes, as the
pitch of a steadily sounding note can be readily determined
within a remarkable degree of accuracy, and there should be
no difficulty in determining the temperature within half a
degree Fahr., which is equivalent to 6 inches in the velocity.
(Experiment—Resonance of closed tube to fork of 512 vibra
tions, the length of the tube being modified during the expe
riment to show both the maximum and constrained or imperfect
resonance.) (See paper in Phil. Mag. for May 1879.)
   Modifying this experiment by sounding the tube with an
organ-pipe mouth, the disturbing influence of the contraction
of area at the lip comes into play in addition to the correction
for the open end ; so that, although the value of the latter is
pretty accurately known, no measurement of velocity based
merely upon the length of a pipe is at all reliable. By adding,
however, a half-wave or wave-length to a stopped pipe, main
taining the original pitch, and measuring this added length,
I hoped to be able to get reliable results. The observations,
though agreeing very well indeed so long as the pressure
remained constant, did not agree in their different series when
taken under very slight differences of pressure, much less than
would cause sensible variation through change of intensity,
according to Regnault's determinations.
   To properly understand the causes of these variations, it
will be necessary to examine some of the results of imperfect
or constrained resonance, and consider the separate and con
joined influences of'(l) the blast, air-reed, or inducing current;
(2) the prime tone of the resonating air-column; and (3) the
higher or partial tones sounding with the prime; the pitch of
the resultant note, or alternating induced current, depending
upon the values of these three forces, which have a power of
mutual influence within certain limits. The subject presents
itself to my mind in the following way :—
   In the figure, let the blast from A cause the quarter-wave

                          Velocity of Sound in Air.               451
    length of pipe AB to speak a note of a certain pitch, say 105
   vibrations, and let BC be the half wave-length of pipe added
    to AB ; the three-quarter wave-length AC being tuned to
                                                                  1
                          N" N                                    H'
   speak the same note as AB. Assuming values in four typical
   cases, we obtain the following results (p. 452), in working out
   which arithmetical means instead of mean proportionals have
   been taken for the sake of numerical simplicity, although per
   haps the latter would be more correct.
       In Cases 1 and 2 the length JTN' is the true length of a
   half-wave of 105 vibrations. In (1) the position of N (the
   node) would remain unchanged on the addition of the half-
  wave ; but in (2) the three-quarter wave would be of 106§,
  and N would change its position to W: this, however, would
  introduce no error in the result, for 3(106§) — 110=2 X 105,
  the length for half-wave as determined by the positions of
  N and N'.
      In these two cases it is assumed that the first quarter-wave
  has equal constraining-power with the added quarters ; but
  this is not strictly correct for cylindrical organ-pipes, in which
  the first quarter-wave is shortened and the mass in vibration
  reduced, through the contraction of the opening at the speak
 ing end. The tendency of this would be to influence the
 results as shown by Case 3, where the first quarter-wave is
 assumed to have a mass of § instead of unity, and in which
 the measured length would be represented by 3(107^) — 115
  = 207£, whereas it should be 2 x 105 = 210.
      In Case 4 (a), suppose the point N to have been determined
 for the pitch as heard, 105, with a quarter wave-length of tube.
 A half-wave is added, and tuned to the original pitch, = 105,
 and NN' is taken as its measure of length. This is correct if
 the relative strength of the partials remains the same ; but if
 a modification such as (b) takes place, the third partial falling
to half-strength, the position of N as observed would no longer
be correct for a pitch of 105 but only for a pitch of 103^. A
further complication would arise in this case, through the
introduction of the point considered in Case 3.
     To eliminate these sources of error, one of two things must
be attained : we must either deal with pure tones or be careful
to have resonating pipes of such form as to have their various
proper tones strictly in accord with the harmonic series, and
not merely approximately as is the case with organ-pipes;

and in either case be careful that the blast is of exactly the
power to give the desired note without constraint.
   The tubes with which I experimented were of four dia
meters—-45, -75, l-25, and 2-08 inches respectively (11-7,
19 5, 32*5, and 54*1 millim.). After detecting the possible
sources of error which have just been described, and trying a
few modifications of the ordinary organ-pipe, the speaking
ends or first quarter-wave lengths of the tubes were modified
in form from cylindrical to pear-shaped, approximating to the
shape of Helmholtz's resonators, and by this means a pure tone
was obtained. The blast was obtained from a fan, the wind
from which passed through a regulating bellows with automatic-
valve action, and it was found that great care was necessary
on this point. The pressure in the bellows was 2-5 inches of
water, and in the speaking mouth in every case very small.
   The temperature was observed by means of a thermometer
entering the tube, so that the actual temperature during
vibration might be recorded. The wet-bulb temperature and
barometric pressure were also taken for moisture correc
tion. The pitch was taken from a carefully tested Koenig
fork of 256 vibrations, and the tubes were set to give a beating
rate of about 4 per second, the lengths being read by a micro
meter and standard rods. All the notes were exceedingly
feeble, the pressure in the mouth being less than                 inch of
water, much under the lowest which Regnault found to in
fluence the velocity.

    I found it very difficult to get observations with the tube of

454       Experiments on the Velocity of Sound in Air.
11*7 millim. diameter. Very many trials were made; and
although the best single observation gave 324'78, I have
reason to think that the mean value 324*56 is too high. I
hope yet to verify it, and also to continue experiments with a
tube 90'2 millim. diameter.
   There is one point connected with the velocity of sound
which appears to require elucidation, and that is, the modifi
cation it may undergo near its point of origin ; for the waves
which affect us as sound are usually not plane-waves, but
emanate from an origin which more or less nearly approaches
a point—this point being the centre of a system of spherical
waves.
   We may refer to the vibration in conical tubes as bearing
upon this point. A complete cone, speaking its lowest note,
with its apex or closed end for the position of the node, is of
twice the length of a closed cylindrical tube of the same pitch,
and has the same succession of harmonics as the open cylin
drical tube (see Phil. Mag. August 1878). This property is
independent of the proportion of base to height in the cone;
and if we assume the base of the cone to be a portion of a
spherical surface described from the apex, we may continually
increase the conical angle until the cone becomes a sphere.
Now, if we consider the effect of this principle and apply it to
divergent waves, it will be found that such waves cannot have
exactly the same velocity for all pitches, but that the lower
the pitch the greater will be the velocity, owing to the differ
ence of velocity between the first and succeeding quarter- wave
lengths. To take a numerical example, we may choose two
wave-lengths of 32 feet and 8 feet respectively:—
                            Quarter-wave lengths.    Excess in
                             Cylinder.    Cone.        Cone.
     32-ft. wave ...            8 ft.     16 ft.       8 ft.
      8-ft. wave. . .           2 ft.      4 ft.       2 ft.
                               Difference .... 6 ft.
Or, if we assume a velocity in free air (away from origin of
vibrations) of 1120 feet per second, we shall have:—
   Velocity of sound-wave of any pitch, not including
     first quarter-wave                                  1120 ft.
   Velocity of 8-ft. wave, or wave of 140 vibrations
     measured from apex of cone, 1120 + 2 . . . 1122 ft.
   Velocity of 32-ft. wave, or wave of 35 vibrations
     measured from apex of cone, 1120 + 8 . . . 1128 ft.
We thus find that waves near their origin are not of normal
length.

    In gun-fire experiments the pitch of the explosion is not
known, and there may therefore be a variation in the recorded
velocities which is due simply to an effect of conical or
spherical divergence. If, in addition to the corrections made
by Le Koux for temperature, some of the gun-fire experiments
were submitted to a correction of this nature, the discrepancies
would probably be much reduced.

THE following communications were read :—
      1. "On the Geology of the South Devon Coast from Tor Cross
to Hope Cove." By Prof. T. G. Bonney, M.A., F.R.S., Sec. G.S.
   The author, after a brief reforence to the literature of tho subject,
stated that the chief petrographical problem presented by this
district was whether it afforded an example of a gradual transition
from slaty to foliated rocks, or whether the two groups were per
fectly distinct. He described tho coast from Tor Cross round by
the Start Point to Prawle Point, and thence for some distance up
the estuary leading to Kingsbridge. Commencing again to the north
of Salcombc, on the other shore of this inlet, he described the coast
round by the Bolt Head and Bolt Tail to Hope Cove. These rocks,
admittedly metamorphic, consist of a rather thick mass of a dark
mica-schist and of a somewhat variable chloritic schist, which also
contains a good deal of epidote. In the lower part of this are some
bands of a mica-sohist not materially different from the upper mass.
It is possible that there are two thick masses of mica-schist, one
above and one below the chloritic schist ; but, for reasons given, he
inclined to the view that there was only one important mass, re
peated by very sharp foldings.
   The junction between the admittedly metamorphic group and the
slaty series at Hope Cove, as well as that north of Salcombe, is clearly
a fault, and the rocks on either side of it differ materially. Betwoen the
Start and Tor Cross the author believes there is also a fault, running
down a valley, and so concealed. On the north side of this the rocks,
though greatly contorted and exhibiting such alterations as are usual
in greatly compressed rocks, cannot properly be called foliated, while
on the south side all are foliated. This division he places near
Hallsands, about £ mile to tho south of where it is laid down on the
geological map.
   As a further proof of the distinctness of the two series, the author
pointed out that there were clear indications that the foliated series

had undergone great crumpling and folding after the process of folia
tion had been completed ; hence that it was long anterior to the
great earth-movemcnte which had affected the Palajozoic rocks of
South Devon. He stated that the nature of these disturbances sug
gested that this district of South Devon had formed the flank of a
mountain-range of some elevation, which had lain to the south. Of
the foundations of this we may see traces in the crystalline gneisses
of the Eddystone and of the Channel Islands, besides possibly the
older rocks of South Cornwall and of Brittany. He also called
attention to some very remarkable structures in the slaty series near
Tor Cross, which appeared to him to throw light upon some of the
structures observed at times in gneisses and other foliated rocks.

ON THE INDUCTION PRODUCED BY VARIATION OF THE INTENSITY
    OF THE ELECTRIC CURRENT IN A SPHERICAL SOLENOID. BY
    M. QUET.
rPHE problem which I propose to solve is not without some
 ¦*• interest, for, supposing the solenoid of the same volume as the
 sun and at the same distance from the earth, it will be possible to
 examine whether (in spite of that enormous distance, and without
 the necessity of attributing to its electric currents momentary
 variations of intensity which would be excessive in comparison with
 those of our voltaic currents) its induction is capable of producing
 appreciable effects. It will be seen further on what equivalence
 there exists between the real sun and the fictitious solenoidal sun
 in the point of view of terrestrial induction.
     Imagine upon the surface of a sphere a series of circular coils,
 parallel with each other, following at a constant distance, and tra
 versed by the same electric current, the intensity of which under
 goes at every point the same momentary variation. Barlow con
 structed a solenoid of this description, the several circuits of which
 were excited by a single and constant current. The direction of
 the radius of the sphere which is perpendicular to the planes of the

 the induced elementary mass m, I draw Ox perpendicular to the
 axis of the system, Oz parallel to this line, and Oy perpendicular
 to the plane zO.v, to the left of Oz as personified and looking
 towards Ox. The inductive action of each circular current, and
 consequently that of the solenoid, is a force applied to the mass m
 and in a direction either similar or the reverse to Oy, according
 as the momentary variation is positive or negative. When the

in which B' is the distance from the point O to the centre e of the

 same throughout the current. Designating by u' the measure of
the angle whose vertex is at G and whose sides intercept the con
stant distance I, which separates two consecutive circuits upon the

ON THE RELATION BETWEEN THE INTERNAL FRICTION AND
   RESISTANCE OF SOLUTIONS OF SALTS IN VARIOUS SOLVENTS.
   BY E1LHARD WIEDEMANN.
   In connexion with a remark of G. "VViedmann* attempts have in
recent times been frequently made to establish strict numerical
relations between the coefficients of friction and the conductivity
for voltaic electricity, against the universality of which, however,
he raises theoretical objections. Experimenters on this subject
have either followed the change in the above magnitudes with the
temperature in the same solution, or with the concentration in
various solutions; and a certain analogy has been ascertained to
exist between the two processes. For a strict investigation, solu
tions of the same salt should be investigated which have as differ
ent coefficients of friction as possible. 1 have therefore made some
experiments with solution of zinc sulphate in water aud in aqueous
 glycerine. A special investigation showed that the glycerine was
 quite free from acid, and conducted the current very badly.
    The resistances to friction were determined with the apparatus
 described by Sprung t ; the electrical resistances were determined
 by Wheatstone's bridge. Solutions of zinc sulphate in water and in
 glycerine of the same strengths were placed in two troughs of equal
 dimensions, and two equal amalgamated zinc plates were dipped in
 them. Both troughs were simultaneously introduced into the two
 arms of the bridge.
    In the first series of experiments the solutions were prepared
 by dissolving 10 parts of ZnSO, -+- 7H20 in 100 parts of water, and
then making this solution up to 500 c. c. by the addition of 50 c. c,
 100 c. c, or 250 c. c. of water or of glycerine. Hence the solu
 tions always contained an equal number of molecules of the salt
 in equal volumes.
    For the solutions in water and glycerine the following ratios
 were obtained : —
                                      Internal

    In all cases the solution of glycerine showed the greater frictional
and electrical resistances.
    The second experiment was made by dissolving 50 gr. ZnSO,
 + 7H20 in water to a volume of 500 c. c. ; and on the other hand
50 gr. of ZnS04 was dissolved in a little water, and made up to
 500 c. c. by glycerine.
   It was not possible to dissolve zinc vitriol directly in glycerine,
because glycerine first of all withdraws water from this salt, and
the salt with a smaller quantity of water of crystallization dissolves
 with difficulty in glycerine.
    In this case the ratios were :—
     Frictional resistance 1 : 86-2 ; Electrical resistance 1 : 109.
   The above numbers show throughout that no proportionality
exists between frictional and electrical resistance ; but that the
solvent has a predominant influence in the processes in question.
It follows moreover that the more concentrated are the solutions
the less predominant is the influence of the solvent.

                        SPECTROSCOPIC NOTES.
          BY PROFESSOR C. A. YOUNG, PRINCETON, N. J.
   For the past few months I have been examining the spectra of
sun-spots with great care, and with an instrument of high dispersion.
The spectroscope employed consists of a comet-seeker of five inches
aperture aud about forty-eight inches focal length, used both as
collimator and view-telescope after Littrow's method, the slit and
diagonal eye-piece being as close togelher as it is convenient to
place them. A small spot of black paper, about three tenths of an
inch in diameter, is cemented to the centre of the object-glass
(as suggested by my colleague, Professor Brackett, in a note
published in the American Journal of Science, July 1882), aud
entirely destroys the internal reflections, which would otherwise
most seriously interfere with vision.
   The dispersion is obtained by one of Professor Rowland's
magnificent gratings on a speculum-metal plane, with a ruled surface
three and one-half inches by five, 14,000 lines to the inch. The
slit and eye-piece of the telescope are so placed that the line joining
them is parallel to the lines of the ruling. An instrument of this
sort is incomparably more convenient than one in which the
collimator and view-telescope are separate, though of course, on
account of the inclination of the visual rays to the axis of the
object-glass, there is a little aberration, and the maximhsimum of
definition is not quite reached. There is no difficulty, however, in
seeing easily the duplicity of the 6's, E,, and other similar tests
with the instrument thus arranged. The spectroscope is mounted
upon a strong plank, stiffly braced, and this is attached by powerful

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.             461
ring-clamps to the tail-piece of the 23-inch equatoreal of the
Halsted observatory, so that the image of the sun falls directly
upon the slit.
   The detailed examination of the spot-spectra has been thus far
confined mainly to a few limited regions in the neighbourhood of
C, D, and b.
   With the high dispersive power employed, the widening and
" winging " of the heavier lines of the spectrum is not well seen,
not nearly so well as with a single-prism spectroscope. All diffuse
shadings disappear much in the same way as the naked-eye markings
on the moon's face vanish in a powerful telescope—to be replaced
by others more minute but not less interesting. In a few spots,
however, the broadening of the D's and the reversal and occasional
" lumping " of C has been noticeable even with this high dispersion.
But the most striking result is that, in certain regions the spectrum
of the spot-nucleus, instead of appearing as a mere continuous
shade, crossed here and there by markings dark and light, is resolved
into a countless number of lines, exceedingly fine and closely packed,
interrupted frequently between E and F (and occasionally below E)
by lines as bright as the spectrum outside the spot. These bright
lines, so far as the eye can determine, may be either real lines
superposed, or merely vacancies left in the shading of fine dark lines,
since they are not sensibly brighter than the ordinary background
of the surrounding spectrum.
   The darker and more intense the spot, the more distinctly the
fine lines come out, both the bright and the dark ; and so far as I
have been able to make out yet, there is no difference as regards
these fine lines between one spot and another. I have never yet
seen any evidence of displacement in them due to motion, no
" lumpiness " nor want of smoothness in them.
   When seeing is at the best, and everything favourable, close
attention enables one to trace nearly all these lines out beyond the
spot and its penumbra. But they are so exceedingly faint on the
sun's general surface that usually they cannot be detected outside
the spot-spectrum. This resolution of the spot- spectrum into a
congeries of fine lines is most easily made out in the green and blue.
Near D, and below it, it is much more difficult to see ; and I am not
even quite sure that this structure still exists in the regions around
C and below it. Here, in the red, even with the highest dispersion
and under the most favourable circumstances of vision, the spot-
spectrum appears simply as a continuous shade, crossed here and
there by widened and darkened lines, which, however, are very few
and far between as compared with the number of such lines in the
higher regions. Of course the resolution of the spot-spectrum into
lines tends to indicate that the absorption which darkens the centre
of a sun-spot is produced, not by granules of solid or liquid matter,
but by matter in the gaseous form ; and it becomes interesting to
inquire what substances are capable of producing such a spectrum,
and under what conditions. As to the fineness and number of the
lines, it may be noted that in the region included between bl and bt

462           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
the single lines appear to be each about half as wide as the com
ponents of b„ and are separated by an interval about one third
as great. The whole number between bt and bt must be over a
hundred, though they are of course very difficult to count with
accuracy. They are a little wider in the middle of the spot-spectrum,
in fact spindle-shaped, running out into extremely fine threads
where they pass into the penumbra, and in my instrument they
seem to be a little more hardly and sharply defined on the upper
(more-refrangible) edge than on the lower.
   The bright lines, of which there are six between 5, and bt, are
generally about as wide as the interspace between the components
of b3. They are sharply defined at both edges, and no brighter at
the centre than at the edge—a fact which rather bears in favour of
the idea that they are merely interruptions in the dark-line series,
and not really superposed bright lines. Just above bt (at X 51 62-3)
there is a very conspicuous one, which is also noticeable enough
in the ordinary solar spectrum. Attention has indeed been
frequently called to it long since by other observers. Below E
these bright lines are rare. Higher up in the spectrum, between
P and G, they become very numerous.
   I have also made a considerable number of observations upon
prominences with the nine and one-half inch equatoreal and its own
spectroscope. There have been lately numerous very line exhibi
tions, especially in connection with the spots. The number of lines
reversed in the spectrum of the chromosphere has at times been
very great, far exceeding the number observed and catalogued in
1872; but I have not been able to detect a single new one below
C, though the two mentioned in my catalogue have been seen
almost continuously. On two occasions (July 31st and August
1st) anew line above 11 (\ 3S84 + 2) was conspicuously visible for
an hour or two each time, during a specially vigorous eruption of
the prominences associated with the great spot, which was then just
passing off the limb. This line was seen easily without the aid of
any fluorescent eye-piece; and I am satisfied that on a photographic
plate it would have been more brilliant than either 11 or K. I
could not determine its position within one or two units on account
of the difficulty of identifying the numberless fine lines around it.
   With the widened slit it showed clearly the form of the lower
part of the prominence, but not the upper. It was almost precisely
imitated by two new lines at X 4092 and 4026 ; and the catalogue-
lines 4077 and 3900 resembled it also. On the other hand, /(, 11,
and K showed the higher parts of the prominence as well as the
lower, while the lines at 4045 and 3970 were exceedingly fine and
smooth, without knottiness or structure.
   On August 1st, at 2h 58"' local time (=7" 57m Greenwich time),
the intensity of the chromosphere-spectrum was very remarkable,
the bright lines more vivid and numerous than I remember ever to
have seen them before. Between this time and 3.12 a prominence
was shot up in fragments of flame to an elevation of over 120,000

      THE FLUORESCENCE OF IODINE VAPOUR. BY E. LOMMEL.
    Fluorescence has hitherto only been observed in solids and
 liquids. It is an interesting question whether gaseous bodies are
 not also susceptible of fluorescence.
    In order to approach the question, I have made a few prelimi
 nary experiments in this direction with some of the more power
 fully absorbing gases and vapours, especially hyponitric acid,
chlorine, and the vapours of bromine, iodine, and sulphur.
    It was found that iodine vapour has a pronounced orange-yellow
fluorescence. This is easily observed when sunlight concentrated
by a lens is allowed to fall on a flask containing vapour of iodine
which is not too dense. The orange-yellow pencil of light is par
 ticularly marked when the exciting light has passed through a
green glass. If a blue glass is used as filter for the rays, the fluo
 rescence is only feeble; while with red glass it disappears altogether.
    Of the pure spectral colours, the most active were the green
 rays on each side of the lineE; the yellow and bluish green were
 less so ; and the red, blue, violet, and ultra-violet were quite in
 active—a result which was to be expected, from the well-known
 absorptive properties of iodine vapour.
    In order to ascertain whether the ultra-violet rays were active,
 the spectrum was produced by means of apparatus of quartz; and
 after it had been ascertained that this part of the spectrum could
 not excite fluorescence of iodine vapour, it was also confirmed
 that iodine vapour does not absorb either the ultra-violet, the blue,
 or the violet to any appreciable extent ; for the very highly luminous
 ultra-violet part of the spectrum received on solution of esculine,
 remained unchanged when dense violet vapours of iodine were libe
 rated in a test-tube held in front of the slit.
    Hence iodine vapour is the only fluorescent substance yet known
 in which the violet and ultra-violet rays are quite inactive.
    The feebly luminous spectrum of the orange-yellow fluorescent
 light is seen to be composed of red, orange, yellow, and green,
 extends from the division 35 of Bunsens scale to about 00, and is
  brightest in orange. It appeared continuous, without lighter and
  darker lines.
     Solutions of iodine in bisulphide of carbon and alcohol exhibited
  none of the fluorescence characteristic of iodine. It has already been
  stated that solid iodine does not fluoresce.
     I was unable to recognize any fluorescence in the gases and
  vapours mentioned above.—Wiedemaun's Annalen, 1883, No. 6,

                     CLASSIFICATION OF METEORITES.
      Professor Tschermak, who has made many important contri
 butions to the study of meteorites, has been led by the results of
 recent microscopic study to propose some changes in the system of
 classification given by Rose in 1864. The meteorites are classified
 after the principles of lithology according to the kind and relative
 amounts of their mineralogieal constituents. The classification as
  proposed by Tschermak, with some typical examples under each
  head, is as follows :—
     I. Meteorites consisting essentially of iron : Meteoric iron.
     II. Meteorites having an iron ground-mass with enclosed sili
 cates, (a) Pallasite : iron and olivine the chief constituents (Pallas-
 iron, Ataeama, Bitburg) ; (6) Mesosiderite : iron with olivine and
 bronzite (Hainholz, Estherville) ; (c) Siderophyr : iron and bronzite
 (Rittersgriin, Breitenbach, Steinbach) ; Orahamite : iron with pla-
 gioclase, olivine, bronzite (Serra da Chaco).
     III. Meteorites consisting chiefly of olivine and bronzite with
 iron as a subordinate constituent ; the texture mostly chondritic.
 Chondrite (Aigle, Knyahinya, New Concord, Pultusk).
     IV. Meteorites consisting essentially of olivine, bronzite,
 pyroxene, (a) Ohassignite : olivine (Chassigny) ; (6) Amphoterite :
 olivine and bronzite (Manbhoom) ; (c) Diogeriite : bronzite or
 hypersthene (Ibbenbiihren, Shalka); (d) Chladniie, enstatite
 (Bishopville) ; (e) Bustite : diopside and enstatite (Busti).
      V. Meteorites consisting essentially of augite, bronzite, lime
 felspar; with a shining crust, (a) Howardite: augite, bronzite,
 plagioclase (Frankfort, Loutolaks) ; (ft) Eukrite : augite, anorthite

    PROFESSOR FERREl/s THEORY OF ATMOSPHERIC CURRENTS.
       To the Editors of the Philosophiad Magazine and Journal.
       Gentlemen,
    Understanding that you consider that this question has been
sufficiently discussed in your pages, I nevertheless hope you will
allow me to set myself right with Prof. Everett.
     First, by acknowledging a blunder which he has pointed out.
A mass moving in a fixed great circle over the earth's surface does
gain and lose, not only relative (as 1 said), but also absolute
velocity parallel to the equator, because it changes its direction
relative to that plane.
    Secondly, by stating that this is not the doctrine which I still
understand Prof. Ferrel to maintain, and which I still dispute.
    Thirdly, by pointing out that this, after all, is not "the main point
of my criticism." That main point is the utter baselessness of the
mathematical theory propounded in the paper of 1860.
                                    I remain,
