     the winters of 1845 and 1846 three series of experiments
IN   on the dilatation of ice were made independently,     by
MM. C. Schumacher of Copenhagen, Moritz of Dorpat, and
Pohrt at the Observatory of Pultowa. These experiments have
been described by W. Struve in the memoirs of the Academy
of St. Petersburg t.
   The experiments of M. Moritz differed from the others in
this, that he measured the dilatation in a direction perpendicular
to the surface of the water out of which the ice was frozen,
whilst the others measured it in a direction parallel to that surface.
   The results of the three series of experiments were nearly
identical.

2      Canon Moseley              on the    Mechanical Properties of Ice.
  For 80° R., or for the whole dilatation between the freezing
and boiling temperatures, this gives the coefficient
                                           •005142*.
 And as there are 180° of Fahrenheit between these tempera
tures, the coefficient of the dilatation of ice for 1° F. is
                                      00002856.
    The experiments of M. C. Schumacher were the most nume
rous and the most complete. They were conducted as follows.
    By pouring water which had been previously boiled into a
wooden trough or mould, and leaving it on trestles exposed to
the air for twenty-four hours, it was frozen into a solid block of
ice tolerably free from air-bubbles, which, when brought into a
regular shape and rounded at its angles, was 6 feet 3 inches
long, 6£ inches deep, and 6 inches wide.            A longitudinal sec
tion of this block of ice is shown in Plate I. fig. 2 A, and a
transverse one in fig. 3.
    To have fixed points on the block from which to measure its
dilatation, two steel bolts (b and U) were made to pierce the
block from side to side near its ends, and were frozen into it.
Each of these bolts had fixed across one end a silvered brass
plate (n,       n',
              fig.       with divisions and the other end of each bolt
                             2)                ;
was pierced in the direction of its axis             by
                                                 cylindrical hole (p, p)'.
                                                         a
The two bolts had their divided plates on opposite sides of the
block, and also the holes pierced in their extremities.            In the
upper surface of the block of ice three equidistant holes were
bored     {t,   P,
               /"') halfway through its thickness, into each of which
a  thermometer was frozen.          The bulb of each thermometer was
contained in        cavity of the ice larger than itself, so as to be
surrounded            by a
                     air, all communication between which and the
external air was cut off             by
                                   the stem being frozen into the ice.
The block of ice was then slung, at about                  feet from the
                                                              8

                                                                        a

                                       1)  stood  on  one  of  the projec

that standard.         For the standard measure, two bolts were driven
into the wall of a room of the observatory, in the same horizontal
line and at the same distance from one another as the bolts in
the block of ice.    One of these bolts had a hole sunk in its end
in the direction of its axis, of the same size as the holes in the
bolts inserted in the ice ; and the other bolt carried at its end a
divided plate similar to the plates on those bolts.    The room, in
the wall of which these bolts were fixed, was preserved us nearly
as possible at the same temperature*.      To compare with the dis
tance  of these bolts the distances at different temperatures of the
bolts in the block of ice, a rod (B, fig. 2) of dry white deal was
used, 5 feet 3 inches long, having for its section a square whose
sides were in the middle 1§ inch in length, but tapered off at
the ends to 1 inch.     On each end of this rod was firmly fixed a
brass ring, a    a',
                  l-83 inch in diameter.     Fixed to one of these
rings, parallel to the axis of the rod and at the extremities of the
same diameter of the ring, were two plates (m, m') of brass, whose
surfaces were silvered, and divided on their chamfered edges, so
as to be applied to the corresponding     plates on the bolts in the
ice-block.
  Through the other ring,           also through the measuring-rod
                                     as
itself, was passed      bolt,
                        a       s  which had at each extremity            a
pin of hardened steel accurately fitting the holes sunk in the
ends of the bolts which passed through the icet.           The whole
stick was thickly wound round with cotton-wool sewn up in linen
cloth, so that   itcould only be very slowly affected        by
                                                             variations
of external temperature. The divisions of the plates on the rod and
on the ends of the bolts in the ice were so adjusted as to form ver  a
nier measuring to the tsVo of an inch. When not in use the mea
suring-rod was hung on the wall the bolts in which served as the
standard of measurement, so as to acquire its constant tempera
ture. When used, the rod was carried out, and the pin passing
through the ring at one of its ends was passed into the hole
sunk in the extremity of the bolt projecting from one of the
two vertical faces of the ice-block, the plate on the ring at the
opposite end being at the same time brought into contact with
the plate on the end of the other bolt which projected from the

by  the  vernier, the rod was turned    round on its axis 180°, so as
to bring the opposite pin into the hole sunken in the one bolt in
the ice, and the opposite plate into contact with the plate fixed on

 the other bolt.         The measurements being in each case taken,
 and the heights of the thermometers recorded, the measuring-rod
 was carried to the opposite vertical face of the block, and they
 were there repeated.           Corrections were thus applied for the dif
 ferences of expansion on opposite sides of the ice-block, and dis
 tortions in the form of the measuring-rod. Before the measuring-
  rod was brought out, at each observation, it was compared with
 the standard length on the wall, and when it was brought back
 the comparison was repeated.
     The observations began on the 11th of February, and by the
 continuance of frost M. Schumacher was enabled to go on with
  them to the 24th of March.             During this time he made 153
  different admeasurements, each separate and complete in itself,
 but all on the same ice-block.           All are included in the mean of
 his results.
     When he had completed 72 observations, M. Schumacher de
 termined to test the permanence of the temperature of the wall
 in which were fixed the two bolts whose distance was his standard
 of measure.        For this purpose he bent the tube of a thermo
 meter at a right angle three inches above the bulb, and made a
 corresponding hole in the wall, into which he plastered up the
 bent part of the thermometer, bat so that the bulb should stand
 free of the masonry.           The temperature of the wall was found to
vary as much as 3° R.
     It is not necessary to describe in detail the corrections made
 by M. Schumacher for the resulting variation in his standard ;
 or those by which he corrected other errors incidental to his
 experiments, or the expedients he adopted in the construction of
                           '

 from them.         They are models of ingenuity and laborious fidelity

apply  the strain required to tear the rod asunder, two pieces of

      Experiments        on the Crushing                 of Ice, August 26, 1869.
    A wooden frame was constructed    (fig. 7), having fixed to its
base two vertical iron rods, on which traversed a strong wooden
platform intended to carry the weights necessary to crush a cy
linder of ice placed vertically beneath the platform. The first
experiment was made with a cylinder          inch in diameter and
2^    inches long.   It bore without crushing 578 lbs. for forty
minutes, during which time its diameter diminished by thawing
to 1 1 inch.  Planes of cleavage at right angles to the axis formed
themselves as the loading went on, all down the cylinder, and
also longitudinal planes, some of which passed through the axis,
and others were parallel to it. This shorter cylinder was then re
placed by one of the same diameter (1| inch), but 6 inches long.
It showed signs of failure, first, by a slight bending in the middle,
then by the formation of a plane of shearing at an inclination of
23° to the horizon at its middle point, round the edges of which
plane it bulged out into a sort of lip (see fig. 10).    Along this
plane it slowly sheared with a pressure of 545 lbs.        While it
was in the act of shearing, planes of cleavage formed themselves
parallel to the axis; and along them it finally split up. Knowing
the inclination      of the plane of shearing, the radius
                     (t)                                      of the                  (r)

                                        fi=   101-8 lbs.

termined   by   the direct shearing of ice.     The crushing-pressure

a  glacier, that glacier (710 feet deep) would only just,            its                    by
 weight, crush itself upon its base.
    As there    is no glacier alleged to have so great        depth as            a
710 feet, this fact       an answer to that theory which attributes
                           is
the descent of   a  glacier to the crushing of the ice of its base                               by
the incumbent weight.

                            The Shearing     of Ice.
    Two blocks of hard wood, each 3 inches in thickness, had
their surfaces carefully fitted to one another, and the one was
adjusted so as to slide on the other by means of guides.                  The
two were then pierced through in a direction perpendicular to their
planes of contact by a cylindrical hole 1£ inch in diameter.              The
apparatus     (fig.  8) was used  in  a vertical position, one  of the blocks
being screwed to a carpenter's bench near the edge, the other
block overhanging the edge.             From this second moveable block
a scale-pan was suspended by a strong cord.                  The two blocks
being    then   brought    so that   the  cylindrical  hole  in the one cor
responded      with   that in the  other,  a  cylinder of ice turned in the
lathe to a diameter of 1^ inch was inserted through the two, and
weights were added to the scale-pan until the cylinder of ice
began to be sheared across.            The process of shearing was slow,
notwithstanding that it was accelerated by the melting of the ice
by reason of the heat conducted from the apparatus, and of the
pressure sustained at the upper and lower surfaces of the cylin
der, by which its temperature of congelation there was lowered.
After about thirty minutes the weights were removed, and the
cylinder, now sheared partly across (fig. 9), was taken out of the
apparatus. There was not the least appearance of separation in the
plane a b, over which a surface of ice had been continually shear
ing. The new surfaces made to slide into contact had entered
into precisely the same relations with one another as they had
to the surfaces with which they were before in contact, and the
ice was continuous.
     Thirteen such experiments were made. Their results are re
corded in the following Table*.             The last six were made, not
 with cylinders turned out of solid ice, but formed by regelation —
 by hammering with a mallet and a solid rammer broken pieces of
 ice into the cylindrical holes of the apparatus when brought
 together so as to form one hollow cylinder.
    * The unit of   shear cannot be determined by experiment with absolute
 accuracy, except by taking into account the observed time of shearing. In
 the case of a cylinder this determination is difficult ; but in the case of n
 prism having a rectangular section it is comparatively easy.        If a and b
 be the sides of such a section in feet, W the shearing-weight          in lbs.,
 fi the unit of shear in lbs. per square toot, and t the time, in seconds, of
 shearing through the distance x,
 where a, b, g are known, and W, t, x are determined        by the experiment    :
 the equation determines therefore /i.

    That ice is diathermanous has been shown by others.                           I  have
verified it by the following experiment.                     Finding that ice could
easily be turned in the lathe,              I had an ice lens constructed by
means of an iron templet whose edge was a circle 12 inches in
radius.        I  thus obtained a lens whose two faces were surfaces
of spheres of that radius, and whose focal distance was 19 inches.
When the sun's rays were received on this lens, the light streamed
through it in abundance, and it was not possible to hold the
hand in its focus by reason of the heat.                     A lucifer-match placed
there was instantly lighted.                The experiment was repeated three
times.        Ice lenses would be so easily made and renewed that it
would not perhaps be impossible to use them for astronomical
purposes in countries the temperature of which is below that of
freezing for two or three months of the year.                         They might be
constructed of any size ; and ice is to be found of different den
sities, and therefore probably of different refracting-indices.

improvement on that described by Dr. Donders.            No exact mea
surements being given,        I  am not quite certain that 1 exactly
realize the description given by Mr. Douglas ; but presuming
that    I do, I think  I  can satisfy him that the indications of such
an instrument are fallacious.
     It is assumed, then, that a little screen (2 millims. in dia
meter) is interposed betwixt the eye and a source of light
about 250 millims. distant from it : moving this source of light
nearer to, or further from the eye, a certain distance is deter
mined, at which, as      I  understand Mr. Douglas, the two pencils
of light, one passing on either side of the screen, cease to be se
 parated from each other, one impression only being received
 upon the retina.
     To test this, let two small screens be used, one the largest
 possible that the pupil will admit of using, the other of smaller
 dimensions ; and let exact measurements              be made of their
 breadth, and of the distances of the screens and of the source of
 light, at the moment preceding the perception of the single
 image.      If now, to fix the ideas, a large horizontal section of the
 eye be laid down upon paper, using the data given in Dr. Don-
 ders's and other recent works, and these pencils be traced upon
 it to their termination on the arch representing the first surface
 of the retina, it will be found that they do not meet at that sur
 face.     No reasonable hypothesis can make them do so.
     The case is simply an extreme example of the experiment de
 scribed half a century ago in Brewster's Journal : the looking at
 a pin in a bright light through a series of minute holes (fifteen
 to the centimetre) in a thin sheet of brass ; six or eight images
  of the pin are seen, which are true images imprinted on the
  retina, as can be easily shown.
      Next, let a leaf of paper be taken, on which is good-sized and
  distinct printing, and let it be doubled up so that a line of let
  ters may be close to the edge of the fold : let this paper so folded
  be brought to a shorter distance than that of clear vision, the
  letters becoming misty and confused ; now move leisurely across
  the paper, but much nearer to the eye, a somewhat dark-coloured
  ruler, approaching it gradually to the folded edge : close in along
  the edge of the ruler the letters will become distinctly visible

10         Mr. R. Templeton's Remarks           on   Mr. Douglas's
and sharply defined.         Let
now a large capital letter
be pinned up against the
window-shutter frame (so
as to have the advantage of a
good light), and bring (see
figure) the eye carefully up
to it to the distance of ordi
nary correct vision ; then
slip in between the eye and the capital letter the folded-up paper
with the ruler, so that the letters along its edge, distinctly seen,
may be observed in the line of the capital letter : the smaller
letters and the capital letter can now be seen at the self-same
moment with perfect distinctness.             The result is very striking,
and, I need scarcely add, goes to the root of all hypotheses of
lens adjustment*.
      Physicists have too readily, and on quite insufficient evidence,
adopted the opinion that the eye is simply a camera, with a lens
to form a picture, a retinal surface to receive a picture, and an
adjusting-power for distance.           Since the date of my paper, in
vol. xxxii. S. 4. of Phil. Mag. p. 425 t,             I  have seized every
    * I am acquainted with a case of reticular cataract in which three of
the meshes are sufficiently open to permit light to enter freely when at
night the pupil is dilated : three distinct images of distant lamps are then
plainly seen ; this is incompatible with the accommodation hypothesis.
 Vide Phil. Mag. S. 4. vol. xxxii. p. 428, § 16.
    -f In that paper I showed that if an opaque object be looked at atten
tively in a good light so as to be perfectly well seen, D being the distance
of the object from the cornea, and 6 the diameter of the pupil, or of any
other diaphragm held quite close to the cornea which permits a conical
                                                   8
pencil of rays to pass on into the eye, then is g- a constant quantity    ; and
the rule holds good up to a metre or two, beyond which absolute definition
ceases.    The angle answering to       is about 20' in a fair light   ; but its
value decreases as the degree of illumination increases, constant, however,
for the same light.
    In the paper above alluded to I have likewise shown that, as far as can be
at present surmised, the impulses are received in each case on a portion of
the retina of which the diameter is exactly equal to the depth of the sentient
layer of that part.
    The appearance of printed matter seen through a narrow slit (0-25 mil-
lim. in breadth) is very curious, and merits further examination : close along
the edges of the slit, above and below, the lines of letters are distinctly
 seen, the central portion a heap of short lines in singular disorder.
    Lastly, I may add that I have been able many times to make out indi
 stinct objects by reducing the size of the diaphragm supplied by the opti
cian ; and I think Sir John Herschel makes a remark which comes to much
the same thing, if 1 remember right. in his ' Cape Observations.'

opportunity of examining the eyes in different classes of animals,
and have come to the conclusion that the retina does not cor
respond in form to a caustic surface of revolution, but that its
form is in a greater or less degree determined by the amount of
mobility required and by the construction of the head, or, in
other words, simple adaptation to what is suitable to the habits
and instincts of the animal.       I have likewise in the most careful
manner separated the lens under water from its sclerotic attach
ments, suspended it in the water, shut off extrinsic light, and
searched for the focus of parallel rays with different sizes and
different arrangements of diaphragm, but have totally failed to
discover it : nothing has been noticed but an ill-defined diffused
brightness, rather more brilliant in the middle ; nothing to force
upon the mind the conviction that it acts as a common corrected
lens would do ; but as the experiments, however carefully made,
carry with them a suspicion of inexactness, I do not venture to
affirm this too positively.
     The eye, like other organs of sense, has its active and passive
states ; it is often no more sensible of the presence of external
objects than the ear to accustomed sounds, or the skin to the pre
 sence of the clothes ; but the moment attention is excited it is
 roused into full activity, and perception becomes possible ; the
 iris, controlling the size of the pencils, the lens concentrating
 the impulses, then determine the exact conditions favourable to
 vision, and, it may be said, act such a part as an ear-trumpet
 to a dull ear, by supplying to the retina the exact impressions
 that are required to be conveyed to the sensorium.
     A priori, it ought not to be expected that the retina would
 present a simple surface on which to receive a picture ; the
 waves which compose white light are of different lengths and
 arrive with different velocities, so that, leaving the source of
 emanation at the same instant, they must arrive at the retina in
 very different phases of their length, requiring a certain depth
  of retinal matter for their full development, a depth not less than
  \\  the length of a medium wave, or about 0-00084 millim.
  This is just one-fiftieth part of the depth of the rods and bulbs,
  which are with good reason believed to be the sentient receptacle
  of the retina.   There is therefore ample depth in the body of
  the retina for the reception of rays from whatever group of ex
  ternal objects the mind be prepared to select.        It would seem
  probable, therefore, that the impressions are received within the
  substance of the retina, and that the iris and lens between them
  regulate the intensity of the impulses : time moreover is cer
  tainly required by the retina for the impulses to become adjusted
  to meet the requirements of vision, part of this time being
  known as " personal equation," the whole of it being no more

 the eye is without doubt known ; but         I strongly insist that
 further inquiry should take place before it be assumed that " the
 known properties of light afford a complete elucidation of the
 whole mechanism of vision and the use of every part of the visual

 III.  Note on certain Slates, Felsites, and Elvanites occurring
    near Knockmahon in the County of Waterford. By        J.  Arthur
    Phillips*.
               rocks are exposed in the sea-cliff east of the vil
 THESE    lage  of Knockmahon, and are much contorted, their
 general strike being from N.E. to S.W.         The dykes or bands
 of felsite and elvanite often appear to be interstratified with
the Lower Silurian fossiliferous slates of the district, and to fol
 low the line of their bedding without producing any marked
change in the character of the rocks in immediate contact with
them.      They can in many instances be traced for considerable
 distances, but appear to be frequently lenticular in shape, thin-
 ningout horizontally at either end, whilst the workings in the adja
 cent mines have afforded examples of a similar dying out in depth.
    At the extreme south-west corner of the townland of Tankards-
 town is a well-detined north and south fault, immediately to the
 west of which the rocks are traversed from N.W. to S.E. by the
 productive copper-bearing lodes of Knockmahon.
    Four specimens of the more characteristic rocks from the
 above locality were selected for microscopical and chemical
 examination, and afforded the following results.
    Elvanite, spec. grav. = 2 66. — A section was prepared from a
 band of compact elvanite of a bluish-grey colour, which, when
 freshly broken, shows imbedded crystals of quartz and felspar in
 an amorphous matrix.      This band, which is of considerable but
 varying width, is in the immediate vicinity of the Tankardstown
 lode, and has been intersected by the workings of the mine at a
 considerable distance from the cliff.
    Examined under a ^-inch objective, this rock is seen to be
 composed of an amorphous greyish matrix in which are por-
 phyritically imbedded crystals of quartz and felspar, the latter
 being chiefly oligoclase.     In addition to these, a few small
 crystals of some hornblendic mineral are sparingly disseminated
throughout the mass. It was further observed that the larger
quartz crystals are sometimes penetrated by crystals both of
felspar and hornblende; and when examined under a high power,
the quartz is seen to contain fluid-cavities.

this rock seen in the cliff near the village of Annestown, and
immediately west of a copper vein on which some explorations
are being made.

and generally amorphous matrix enclosing a few dodecahedral
crystals of quartz and some small crystals of felspar.
    Other portions of the matrix appear to be indistinctly crystal

chlorite.     A chemical analysis of this rock afforded results as

 frequently much coloured by peroxide of iron. A section of this
 slate, made parallel to one of its lines of cleavage, when examined
 under the microscope, was found to consist of an amorphous
 matrix through which is somewhat thickly disseminated a floc-
 culence of a dirty greenish colour, perhaps due to the presence
of minute quantities of chlorite.             A few well-defined quartz-

    Metamorphosed Slate?, spec. grav.            = 2-65. — A     section pre
pared   from   a band,   apparently    of   highly metamorphosed slate,
lying to the east of the foregoing, in which the cleavage-planes
had to a great extent become obliterated, was found under the
microscope to be chiefly composed of felspathic-looking crystals
crossing each other in all directions, with here and there some
minute scales of chlorite. These crystals, which readily depo
larize polarized light, are nearly transparent; but the small
amount of potassa, soda, and lime present in the rock, as shown
by analysis, renders it improbable that so large a proportion of
it can consist of any variety of felspar.
    Its composition, as found by analysis, is as follows : —

     It will be observed that the two specimens of rock most un
 like in general appearance, and which, when microscopically
 examined, were found to differ most essentially in their struc
 tural arrangement, resemble each other very closely in point of
 chemical composition.            In fact the ultimate chemical constitu
 tions of the elvanite and of the columnar clay-slate are so nearly
  alike, that a slight change in the latter, resulting in the rear
  rangement and crystallization of certain of its constituents,
 might evidently lead to the production of the former.
     The compositions of the two other rocks differ essentially, not
 only between themselves, but also very materially from those of
 the specimens to which we have referred above.
     Analyses. — In making these analyses, the following general
 routine was adopted.
     The amount of moisture present was ascertained by heating
 a weighed quantity of the finely pulverized rock in a water-bath
  until it ceased to lose weight, when it was strongly ignited and
 the further loss noted.
      About thirty grains of the powdered substance was intimately
  mixed with three times its weight of carbonate of soda in a pla
  tinum crucible. This waa enclosed in a clean earthen one, and
  fused in an ordinary air-furnace supplied with hard coke.
      The fused mixture, after being allowed to cool, was treated
  with hydrochloric acid and evaporated to dryness.                 The dried
  residuum was then moistened with hydrochloric acid, water
  added, and solution of the chlorides aided by ebullition.                The
 silica, now separated by filtration, was washed, dried, and ignited.
  From the filtrate, after peroxidation of the iron, oxide of iron and

 16     On certain Slates, Felsites, and Elvanites near Knockmahon.
alvmina were precipitated by ammonia ; and after being washed
 and ignited, their united weight was noted.
    The separation o{ peroxide of iron from alumina was effected
by dissolving the mixture in dilute nitro-hydrochloric acid, and
precipitated by an excess of pure caustic potassa.       The peroxide
of iron thus obtained, after being redissolved and precipitated by
ammonia, was washed and weighed.          The alumina was obtained
by acidifying  the alkaline  solution and  precipitating by ammonia.
    A small quantity of silica was frequently obtained on attacking
the mixture of peroxide of iron and alumina, and its weight was
added to that previously found.
    In order to determine the respective amounts of protoxide
and peroxide of iron, a separate fusion was made on a weighed
quantity of the pulverized rock and sesquicarbonate of soda, care
being taken to cover the surface of the mixture with a layer of
the pure sesquicarbonate.
    The contents of the crucible were thus both fused and allowed
to cool in an atmosphere of carbonic acid, besides being preserved
from oxidation by a covering of carbonate of soda.
    The crucible and its contents were now placed in a covered
beaker containing dilute hydrochloric acid, and heated on the
sand-bath ; and as soon as carbonic acid ceased to be evolved, the
solution was allowed to cool, without removing the cover, and
the quantity of protoxide of iron present estimated by a freshly
standardized solution of permanganate of potassa.
    The protoxide thus found was subsequently converted, by cal
culation, into sesquioxide, and deducted from the amount ob
tained by direct estimation.       The lime was precipitated in the
filtrate separated from the mixture of oxide of iron and alumina
by the addition of oxalate of ammonia ; and to the filtrate from
the lime-salt phosphate of soda was added for the precipitation of
magnesia.
    The percentage of the alkalies was determined by fusion with
caustic baryta, dissolving in hydrochloric acid, and evaporating to
dryness.    Baryta-water and carbonate of ammonia were subse
quently added, and the weight of mixed chlorides obtained. To
the solution of these, bichloride of platinum was added, and the
weight oipotassa determined in the usual way. The amount of
soda was ascertained by deducting from the weight of mixed
chlorides the chloride of potassium corresponding to the potassa
found, and calculating the quantity of soda corresponding to
the remainder.

IV. Observations of the Corona during the Total Eclipse, August 7 ,
  1869.   By G. K. Winter, Telegraph Engineer, Madras Rail
  way Company, Arconum.
      To   the   Editors of   the   Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       Gentlemen,
      the October Number of the Philosophical Magazine there
IN is    an article by Professor Pickering entitled "Obser
vations of the Corona during the Total Eclipse, August 7th,
1869." As the results obtained by Professor Pickering by
means of the double-image polariscope are directly at variance
with the experience of myself and others during the eclipse of
August the 18th, 1868, 1 hope a few remarks upon the subject
may be deemed worthy of your acceptance.
    In August 1868 I accompanied Mr. Pogson (the Government
Astronomer at Madras) to Masulipatam, to assist him in ob
serving the now celebrated eclipse of that year.         My special
duty was to test the light of the corona and red flames for pola
rization. For this purpose            I
                                was provided with a Savart's pola
riscope, and a double-image prism with a plate of quartz cut per
pendicularly  to the axis. Each of these polariscopes was adapted
to an excellent telescope by Cooke and Sons, 2i" aperture and
28" focal length.
    On examining the light from the corona by means of the
Savart's polariscope, I found it very strongly polarized every
where in planes radial to the sun's centre.     The bands were ex
tremely vivid near the moon's limb, and faded off with the co
rona. There was very little light, polarized or unpolarized, beyond
the limits of the corona ; so that the explanation that the po
larized light seen by some observers was derived from the atmo
sphere illuminated by the unobscured portions of the earth                is,
                                                                           I
think, untenable.    Several portions of the corona were succes
sively tried   and in all the white central bands were brightest
                 ;
where they were radial to the sun, and the black-centred bands
were equally marked when they were tangential to the limb.
    My observations were completely confirmed             by
                                                      those made                by
Captain Branfill, of Major Tennant's expedition.
   Instead of being negative,  consider the results obtained
                                       I                                    by
the polariscope to have been conclusive as to the cause of the
corona of the eclipse of 1868. Iu order to give reflecting angle
                                                         a
calculated to produce the amount of polarization observed, the
reflecting atmosphere must have surrounded the sun.
                                   Yours very truly,

V. A Mathematical Theory of Tides. By the Rev. Professor
           Challis, M.A.. F.R.S., F.R.A.S*
          problem of the tides of oceans, which was pronounced
THEby Laplace      to be " le plus epineux de toute la Mecanique
Celeste," is also one which, when put in its simplest form, espe
cially requires to be treated in strict accordance with the neces
sary principles of hydrodynamics.      In the following attempt to
give it such a solution, on the supposition that the whole of the
solid part of the earth is covered by water of a certain limited
depth, I commence with employing the general equations appli
cable to the motion of an incompressible fluid. The mode of ap
plying these equations in this problem, and the subsequent course
                                           I
of the reasoning, are, as far as am aware, such as have not been
adopted before.
   The resolved parts of the velocity V at the point xyz at the
time t being u, v, w in the directions of any axes of rectangular
coordinates, we have for an incompressible fluid the known
general equation
                                du        dv
                                               ^
                                                    dw   _~ q                          .   .
                                dx        dy        dz
This equation expresses that the quantity of fluid in a given
small rectangular space remains the same, in whatever way the
fluid passes through it. I assume as an axiom the existence of
                                           is,
                                      of surfaces which cut at right
surfaces of displacement (that
angles the directions of the motion), which may also be disconti
nuous   in any manner so long as they are not broken or their
tangent planes do not at any point make         finite angle with each
                                                                  a
other.   Consequently   the   equation  udx + vdy wdz=0, which         +                   is
capable of satisfying these conditions,       the general differential
                                                             is
equation of the surfaces of displacement, provided the left-hand
side be integrable of itself.    If       not, it  must, according to
                                                    is            it

    Putting (d<f,) for udx + vdy wdz, the equation (a) becomes

 equations are identical, inasmuch as both apply to motion which
 is peculiar to a fluid. As this expression for V has been obtained
 prior to the consideration of any particular case of motion, it
 must be applicable in all cases, and at every point of the fluid
 mass at all times.     Consequently it partakes of the character of
 a general integral, but gives the value of the velocity, in any par
 ticular case of the disturbance of the fluid, only through an infi
 nitesimal portion of fluid, for which the radii of curvature of the
 surfaces of displacement may be supposed to have, at a given in
 stant, the same positions.    If such a portion be bounded laterally
 by planes coincident in direction with lines of motion, any trans
 verse section of the small included element will be proportional
 to the product rV'. Hence, if the velocity and transverse section
 be V, and m\ at one end of the element, and Vs and m\ at the
 other, we shall have V,mi = V2m|.        Then passing to the next
 element, and supposing iJ and r" to change in magnitude and
 position either continuously or discontinuously, but not per sal-
 turn, we have similarly Vgm|=Vam|; and so on. This reasoning
 proves that if the whole of the fluid be divided into filaments
 of indefinitely small transverse section, having their lateral boun
 daries everywhere coincident in direction with lines of motion,
 and the value of V^m* at a certain transverse section of a fila
 ment be given, the value Ym* at any other transverse section is
 also given.    This inference is evidently consistent with the prin
 ciple of the  constancy of mass, and is independent of the form
 and position of the filament, which have to be deduced from the
 given conditions of the particular case of motion.
     The general integral of the equation (/8) may, as Poisson has
 shown, be expressed under a form which involves arbitrary func
tions of impossible quantities.     This analytical result might give
 the means of arriving at that form of the general integral which
is obtained above by a different process ; but actually it renders
the integral unfit for application to the particular circumstances
of a case of motion. In fact, as the equation (/S) takes no account
of the impressed forces, its general integral cannot possibly ad
mit of specific applications to given cases of disturbance of the
fluid, and can ouly have the general signification which I have
just indicated.     This remark will be further illustrated by the
 proposed method of solving the problem of the tides.
    In the subsequent analytical reasoning a differential is put in
brackets to show that the differentiation has relation to coordi
nates only ; a differential coefficient in brackets is a complete
differential coefficient, with respect to time, of a function of co
ordinates and the time; all other differential coefficients are
partial. This being understood, I proceed next to adduce some

in which the impressed accelerative forces in the directions of the
axes of coordinates are X, Y, Z.         It will be assumed that
JLdx + Ydy + Zdz is an exact differential (dF), so that
This equation proves that the left-hand side of this equation is
an exact differential in all cases, if only the impressed forces be
such as to make ¥.dx + Ydy + Zdz an exact differential.        The
condition of integrability is therefore satisfied both when each
element moves as if it were solid, and when the motion in each
element is characteristically that of a fluid.   We have seen that
in the latter case udx + vdy + wdz is always an exact differential,
and that in the former the same differential quantity is in
tegrate by a factor.     It thus appears that the left-hand side of
the equation (8) is made integrable by putting {d<f>), or else
X(rfi|r), for udx + vdy + v:dz.

in the problem of the tides.     In order to simplify the reasoning,
it will be supposed (1) that the solid part of the earth is sphe
rical ; (2) that this part is covered by water, the depth of which
is small compared with the earth's radius ; (3) that the moon
revolves about the earth in the plane of the equator at her mean
distance with the mean angular velocity.      W e may, if we please,
abstract from the earth's rotation by conceiving an equal angular
velocity to be impressed on the moon in the opposite direction.
   Conceiving, therefore, the earth to have no motion, and taking
its centre for the origin of rectangular coordinates, let the axis of
z coincide with its polar axis, and the axis of x pass through the
meridian of Greenwich.       Then if          \
                                        be the north latitude, and 0
the west longitude, of any particle of the fluid distant by r from
the origin, we shall have

mark of considerable importance must be made, in order to meet
an objection that might be raised against the previous reasoning.
It appears that the equation (/9), viz.

derivable from the general integral of that equation.   But this
is impossible,   inasmuch as the equation takes no account of
the impressed forces.     The explanation of this apparent diffi
culty    is,
         that  the  equation (iS), while  expresses the principle

one  I    have already     obtained,            viz.   V=          ^pr-   In      any particular
case  of motion this value of    may be assumed to be the same

By treating these magnitudes     and positions as variable parame

The analytical circumstances are therefore analogous to those of

tial equations.   The latter, although it gives the solution of
the proposed problem, is not directly obtainable by integrating
the given differential equation, but may be deduced by varying
the parameters of the general integral.  It is thus that in every
case of the solution of a hydrodynamical problem by a par
ticular and definite integral, the general equation         V=               is
                                                                   ^)

tion of making udx + vdy + wdz an exact differential.       In the in
stance before us it has been shown that this condition is satis
fied ; and we may therefore conclude that our integral is in ac
cordance with the principle of constancy of mass expressed by
the equation (yS), which is all that exact reasoning demands.
But because the integral is not obtainable by direct integration
of that equation, I have attached a dash to the symbol             for <f,
the sake of distinction.    The views here stated have long been
advocated    by  me in my hydrodynamical researches, but they
have not,I    think, been so clearly exemplified in any previous
problem.
   The following conclusions are deducible from the foregoing

water along the meridian under the moon, and along the opposile
meridian, and low water along the meridians 90° distant from
these.
   The moon being supposed to move in the plane of the earth's
equator, the tide on   given meridian varies as the square of the

therefore eastward, at the meridian under the moon, and at the
opposite meridian, and westward at the meridians 90° from these.
At the four meridians midway between these four            vanishes.

the moon's mean motion, that the length of the sidereal day may
be affected          by
               tidal action.   But the verification of this view evi
dently demands that the mathematical investigation employed
for the purpose should be conducted in strict accordance with
the principles of hydrodynamics, and be carried to terms of the
second order with respect to the disturbing force.       As far as                          I
can judge without the aid of such investigation,        seems to me         it
possible that the increment of pressure at high water on eastern

         Prof. Challis    on a  Mathematical Theory       of Tides.      31
shores, or against obstacles in ocean-beds to the free propagation
of the tidal wave westward, may not be exactly compensated for
by the reverse action at low water, and that there is consequently
a residual action westward tending to diminish the rate of the
earth's rotation.      Such an effect would depend on terms of the
second order.        But whether this cause actually operates, and
whether currents produced by the moon's attraction have any
effect, we should, I think, have some means of deciding if the
problem of tides, as here proposed, were strictly solved to the
second approximation.
    I beg to conclude this communication by adverting to a ques
tion which bears in an important manner on the truth of the
foregoing mathematical reasoning.                                   I
                                             It will be seen that have
inferred from      the expression   for u' that it is " high water along
the meridian under the moon."             In an article contained in the
'Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society' (vol. xxvi.
No. 6), the Astronomer Royal has maintained that, when fric
tion is left out of account,
                                  " it is low water under the moon."
It is absolutely necessary, for the credit of mathematics, to ac
count for such contradictory results being obtained from the
same premises.
    In support of his view Mr. Airy cites Newton's Principia,
Lib. I. Prop. 66, Cor. 19. But Laplace, in his account of New
ton's theory of the tides, interprets that passage in           a different
sense.    In the Mecanique Celeste (vol. v. p. 146, edit. of 1825)
he states that Newton in that corollary only shows that the water
in an equatorial canal surrounding the earth ought, when at
tracted by a luminary, to have a flux and reflux movement like
that of the sea, and that
                               " he gives neither the law nor the mea
 sure of the movement."         Laplace adds that
                                                      " the true explana
tion of the phenomenon is contained in Propositions 36 and 37
of the third book," which Mr. Airy does not refer to. There, in
 fact, Newton says expressly that
                                        " the sea is depressed at places
 90° distant from the sun, and elevated both under the sun and
 in the opposite region," the same law applying, of course, to the
 moon.
    Again, Mr. Airy asserts that, according to Laplace's theory,
it will be low water under the moon.             But in the Mecanique
 Celeste (vol. ii. p. 222) I meet with this sentence : — " If the ocean
covered a spheroid of revolution, and if it experienced no resist
ance to its movements, the instant of high water would be that
of the passage of the sun across the superior or inferior meridian."
On what ground, therefore, is the opposite view attributed to
Laplace ? In the Essay on Tides and Waves in the Encyclopedia
Metropolitana (arts. 109, &c.), Mr. Airy finds that it is low water
under the moon by a method which he considers to be " equiva

32                   Mr. C. Tomlinson     on the   Mutiuns   of certain
lent " to that of Laplace, and infers that Laplace should have
come to the same conclusion. Without pretending to have formed
an opinion respecting the correctness of this inference, I venture
to say that the question admits of decision, apart from reasoning
with mathematical symbols, from this single consideration.       So
long as the disturbing  force tending  to depress  a given vertical
column of the fluid is diminishing, or that tending to raise it is
increasing, the length of the column is increasing ; but as soon
as the   force ceases to increase, the raised column begins to de
scend by the force of terrestrial gravity.    Accordingly there will
be high water under the attracting body.        It seems to me, after
consideration of the terms employed in the latter part of Cor. 19,
and especially of the meaning of the expression
                                                      " usque ad
                                                                 qua
dratures," that Newton intended to point out the kind of action
I have just described, which             is,
                                     in fact, the same as that from
which he draws his conclusions in Prop. 36 of Book                For III.
these reasons    am of the opinion that the above-mentioned con
                     I
tradiction     due to fault or defect of principle in the method
                is
of solution the Astronomer Koyal has adopted.
I    think   Iam entitled to say that the solution of the problem
of the tides given in this communication, which differs materially
from that of Laplace,      the only one hitherto proposed that
                             is                                                  is
strictly based on the necessary principles of hydrodynamics.

     d. If about seven or eight parts of water be shaken up with
 one part of ether, the experiments a, b, c can no longer be per
 formed on the surface of the resulting solution ; but if this so
 lution be boiled and filtered and left till cold, the results a, b, c
 can be obtained on its surface as before.
     2. Experiments of this kind were performed by means of the
 vapours of various volatile bodies ; but a very remarkable dif
 ference appeared in the behaviour of the vapour, according, as it
 seemed to me, as it had a strong attraction for the water, or for
 the substance of the film.      In the one case the vapour would thin
 out and even disperse the film ; in the other it would gather it
 up, thicken  it,  and deprive      of colour.
                                   it             For example —          :
     e. The ether-sponge was held over           film of oil of lavender
                                                  a                                    ;
 the latter was scattered and dispersed.               A
                                                       sponge dipped                   in
 benzole was now held over the surface, when the parts of the
 film became gathered together and thickened.            In like manner,
a   film of oil of peppermint was scattered and dispersed           ether-   by
 vapour  ;  but when the turpentine-sponge was held over the sur
face, the scattered parts sailed up to         and, being thus gathered
                                               it
 together, formed       number of thickening lenticules.
                         a                                      Other ex
 amples   of  this action  will be given   hereafter  (18).
    /.   Adrop of creosote on the surface of water will sometimes
 split up into a   number of separate lenticular masses, sometimes
 remain as one such mass —each lens having motions of vibra
 tion and translation, and so wasting away.
     3. Now in such       case as this (/), as the water approached
                             a
 the limit of saturation, the motions of the creosote became
 slower, and ceased altogether when saturation was fully attained,
just as, in the case of the ether repulsions, the experiments a,
                                                                                       b,
                                                                                       c
could not be performed on          saturated solution (as in
                                   a                                     d)  .
     4. Hence these effects seem to arise out of that kind of ad
 hesion which, overcoming cohesion, constitutes solution, and,
 when the two forces are in equilibrium, saturation.          The strong
attraction or adhesion of water for ether- vapour, and the appear
 ance of the latter on the surface as     disk of liquid ether, combined
                                           a
 with the expansive force and weight of the ether-vapour, appa
 rently explained such results as those given under a, b,c; while
 the motions of the creosote         (/)seemed evidently to come under
 the phenomena of solution.         When, for example,        quantity of
                                                                     a
 water had been saturated with creosote, so that all further mo

                                                                 if
 of water were increased, the motions set in again, and that with
 out increasing the superficial area of the water           so also
                                                                 ;     the        if
 solvent power of the water was increased, as              by
                                                          the addition of
a   drop of acetic acid, the motions of the creosote were renewed.

S   i             Mr. C. Tomlinsou           on the   Motions of   cm-tain
In  my first paper on the cohesion-figures of liquids3, an expe
riment is described in which creosote was placed on the surface
of water in two similar glasses ; but one of them contained one
ounce of distilled water, and the other two ounces.     The first
drop of creosote lasted seven minutes on each surface, the se
cond drop 20 minutes on one ounce of water, 12^ minutes on
the two ounces ; the third drop had not disappeared from the
first glass after 135 minutes; but from the second glass it dis
appeared in 25 minutes, and even a fourth drop was disposed of.
    5. Professor Van der Mensbrugghe4       takes great pains to
show that in the experiments a, b, c the ether-vapour streaming
down upon the water on the film exerts no mechanical action
by its weight.    I only referred incidentally to this action, and
remarked that a stream of carbonic acid gas from a gas-bottle
will, by its mechanical action, produce iridescent rings on some
films.    The chief action seemed to me to be, as already stated
(4), the strong adhesion existing between the water and the
ether.    The Professor explains the experiments a to /, as well as
the varied phenomena of cohesion-figures, on the principle of
surface-tension ; and yet, before surface-tension can act in the
way described, there must be adhesion.       Of course he admits as
much, and distinguishes between effects due to various degrees of
this force which I have so much insisted on. For example, in § 51
of his memoir, in reference to some experiments by the Abbe
Mann5, in which whale-oil spreads on the surface of boiling
water, while olive-oil and linseed-oil refuse to do so, he says,
" This arises most probably from the fact that the first liquid
adheres much more strongly to the water than the ether two
oils, and can thus spread under the action of a force inadequate
to the extension of the other two."       And again, § 52, with re
ference to the formation of cohesion-figures,      he says : — " It is
evident that the different oils deposited on pure water cannot
produce the same figures, since the phenomenon depends at
once on surface-tension and on the amount of adhesion of the
substances employed.       Hence it is also clear that the same oil
may produce different cohesion-figures when placed successively
on clean water, mercury, sulphuric acid, &c.      This explains per
fectly  the numerous   varieties of figures described  by Mr. Tom-
linson."
   6. Connected with these surface-motions is an experiment by
Prevost 6, and one also by Macquer7, of which I took note many
        3   Phil. Mag. for October   1861.

                    Liquids   on the Surface    of Water.                35
years ago, but never could explain until I had read Professor Van
der Mensbrugghe's memoir.          Prevost noticed that if a red-hot
iron wire or poker be presented obliquely to the end of a disk of
tinfoil floating on water, the disk will be repelled ; but if the hot
wire be held vertically over the disk, it does not move.       By di
recting the focus of a burning-glass on the disk, it is also re
pelled.    The water must be perfectly clean, or the experiment
will fail ; simply touching it with the finger is sufficient to pre
vent the result8.
    I had fancied that the red-hot wire diminished the adhesion of
the surface locally, and during the expansion the disk got shifted
to a cooler part, where the adhesion was strdnger; but this could
not apply to Macquer's observation, that gold spins when melted,
and that minute fragments of grit on its surface are powerfully
repelled.    When the metal is fused by the action of a large lens,
fine powder on the surface is dispersed as if by a powerful blast
of the breath9.
    7. I proceed now to describe the method by which Professor
Van der Mensbrugghe gathers up the various facts described,
together with many others that will be indicated, and presents
them in harmonious relation to each other.
   8. Admitting the surface-tension of liquids to be a vera causa,
his first general proposition is as follows : —
    Let a and b be the respective surface-tensions of two liquids,
A and B, of which the second is supposed to be very volatile
and more or less soluble in the first, or, at least, capable of ad
hering to it ; pour the liquid A into a large perfectly clean cap
sule, then take up (by means of a capillary tube, for example) a
small quantity of the liquid B, and hold it vertically over and very
near to the surface of A; then, if a be notably superior to b, the
subjacent layer will immediately move towards the edge of the
capsule and a circular depression will be produced, the more de
cided in proportion as a exceeds b ; but if these quantities scarcely
differ from each other, there will be no movement on the sur
face of A ;  if, on the contrary,      b greater than a, there will be
                                           is
developed  a   centripetal current    that
                                       ;      to say, the part situate
                                                is
beneath the tube will attract towards itself the neighbouring su
perficial portions.
  9. In fact,  if the vapour of   be more or less soluble in
                                       B                       or   A,
remain adherent to      it,
                         and     if,

     The surface-tension of metals in state of fusion would form

subject of inquiry for any one who has ample means at his disposal.   Re
sults of great value might be expected from it.

36           Mr. C. Tomlinson        on the  Motions of certain
the surface-tension of that part of the liquid immediately below
the tube becomes less than on the surrounding portions, and
these exert on that part a traction which is made evident by the
apparent repulsion of the particles of powder floating on A ; or,
by this same force of traction, the superficial layer drags away
the molecules situate below the tube and thus produces a de
pression.      If this force be sufficiently energetic, waves are pro
pagated on the surface of the liquid.             When, on the contrary,
b is greater than a, the subjacent         portion of A acquires a greater
surface-tension      and attracts the surrounding layer, unless the
resistance be too great.
    10. Let A be distilled water at 20°       C,  when the tension a = 73
milligrammes per millimetre of length;                B ether;    b = 1'88;
       =0*74.      When the interior diameter of the ether- tube is
  a
less than a millimetre, the depression on the surface of the water
is well marked ; with a tube 2 millims. in diameter the concavity
is from 4 to 6 centims. wide, and the particles floating on the
surface are powerfully repelled towards the edge of the vessel.
If the ether-sponge (1 a) or a finger wet with ether be held
over the water, the effect is still more energetic, and a sys
tem of waves is propagated on the surface of the water.                     If
the water be in the form of a stratum not more than 2 millims.
thick, the part below the sponge will fly open and leave the por
tion of the bottom of the vessel thus exposed quite dry so long
as the vapour of ether pours downi0.              If the water be made to
rest on the surface of pure clean mercury, a much thicker stra
tum may be used ; the ether-sponge will act at considerable dis
tances, producing sensible motions in the well-defined perfectly
circular iris of water. That vapour of ether will act at a dis
tance and produce motions on the surface of water, was pointed
out by B. Prevost in his controversy with Carradori, noticed in
my former paperi'.           Fragments of gold leaf or of tinfoil floating
on water became agitated as soon as a capsule of ether was
placed at some height over the surface.
    11. It will be understood that the above experiments cannot
be performed if the water be previously saturated with ether,
or if the water be soiled with the finger or otherwise, because in
such cases the surface-tension or contractile force of A becomes
   i0
      Draparnaud (Ann. de Chim. vol. xlvii. p. 303) noticed that a thin
layer of water at the bottom of a capsule flies open when touched bv a drop
of alcohol at the end of a glass rod, leaving the bottom of the vessel un
covered. The water slowly closes in again as the alcohol evaporates. The
bottom of the capsule should not be convex.        Carradori (Mem. Soc. Ital.

greatly reduced.     The mere contact of the finger with the sur
face is sufficient to lower the tension from 7"3 to 4-5.   The ad
dition of 1 per cent. by weight of soap to the water lowers its
tension to about 3, so that on such a surface the effects described
cannot be produced.
   12. Similar effects to those obtained with ether may be ob
served with alcohol, only less marked, since the difference a — b
is actually less.  Wood-spirit, acetic ether, paraffin oil, &c. exert
also about the same degree of energy as alcohol.       With turpen
tine the effects are still less marked, that liquid being much less
volatile than ether or alcohol, and but little soluble in water.
     13. When       A is olive-oil   [a   = 3-5) and B ether,             =0*462,
there is motion on the surface, as is evident from the apparent
repulsion of dust-particles as soon as the ether-tube is adjusted.
If the oil be in the form of a layer about 1 millim. thick, the
approach of the ether will cause it to              fly
                                          open (10). With olive-
oil and alcohol, a— 4=1,                        29,     a   similar effect   is   pro
                                     ^-^—=0
duced, although      the difference between the tensions of the two
liquids   isonly     1;whereas vapour of ether acting on mixture of   a
seven parts of water and one of ether produced no effect, although
in such case a— = 2-12.  6        The author explains this apparent
anomaly        referring, tirst, to the difficulty vapour of ether has
               by
in dissolving in such        mixture, whilst alcohol
                              a                         very soluble in
                                                                is
the oil and secondly, the superficial viscosity (or the greater or
          ;
less difficulty the superficial molecules have in being displaced)
is greater in the case of the ether solution than in that of oil of
olives.       solution of carbonate of soda (a=4"28), according to
              A
Plateaui3,   has    agreat superficial viscosity, and on this account
     i2
       See Phil. Mag. December 1869.      The solutions used by Plateau in
bis ingenious experiments fur determining the superficial viscosity were, of
course, only saturated.   In supersaturated solutions the superficial viscosity
is  one of the most marked features.     As soon as the flask    closed or co
                                                                     is
vered, the surface of the solution becomes quite viscous; and this increases
during the cooling — so that, on gently shaking or inclining the flask, the
superficial layer breaks up and partially mingles with the lower strata, like
a  strong syrup mingling with water.     When    long and wide tube contain

that the superficial layer     constantly being dissolved and as constantly-
                               is
being renewed, the one by contact with the hot liquid beneath, which
causes the viscous layer to descend in saccharine- looking streams, the other
by contact with the outer air, into which the surface-layer evaporates and
becomes viscid preparatory to crystallization.     the tube remain uncovered,
                                                    If
crystals begin to form on the surface, the air supplying the nuclei,                if
covered, in time the solution will cool down without depositing crystals,
and the surface will long remain viscid.    In my " Experimental Examina
tion of the so-called Storm-glass" (Phil. Mag. for August 1863), many of
the phenomena which accompany the cooling of saline solutions are given.

38             Mr. C. Tomlinson         on the   Motions of certain
the ether-vapour has scarcely any action on its surface ; while
there is no action at all with a solution of one part of saponine
in sixty parts of water, although a = 4"67, the viscosity of the
surface of this solution being very great.   On such a surface a
drop of turpentine spreads almost as slowly as upon a solid
surface.
 14.   A, carbonic disulphide (a = 3*5 7); B, alcohol; a—~ = 030.
In this case the observation is difficult, because the particles
floating on A are being constantly displaced by spontaneous
movements, arising from variations in tension at different parts
of the surface consequent on the evaporation of A (clogged as it
is by the powder dusted on) being unequal.        This produces a
lowering of the temperature, the effect of which is to increase the
superficial tension of a liquid in proportion as such reduction is
great.        It   was evident,   however, that the alcohol-tube           did act
in producing the apparent repulsion of the powder.
 15.       A, absolute alcohol    ;   B, carbonic disulphide;            = — 0-30.
Since the difference in the tensions of the two liquids is negative,
the motion on the part of A subjected to the vapour of B is no
longer centrifugal, but centripetal.     The alcohol was in a cap
sule of from 20 to 25 centims. diameter, and on the surface
were dusted some light particles of bran ; then holding very near
the surface a tube of not more than 1 millim. diameter contain
ing a small drop of the disulphide, particles at the distance of
from 4 to 5 millims. floated up and remained stationary under the
tube.    In fact the vapour of the disulphide condensing on the
surface of the alcohol augments somewhat its tension, and thus
produces an attractive effect on the neighbouring particles.
    16. If in this experiment a tube of 3 or 4 millims. be used,
the particles are first attracted near to the drop and then imme
 diately repelled.    The author explains this by supposing that the
condensation of the vapour slightly augments the temperature
of the subjacent portion, while evaporation is diminished there
by the presence of the tube and of the disulphide vapour.
 But the surrounding portions of the alcoholic surface evaporate
freely, and so acquire an exaltation of tension more than suffi
cient to counterbalance the increased tension of that part of the
surface just below the tube.       In fact it can be shown that if
evaporation    be  interrupted  at one part of the surface of the
alcohol, the neighbouring parts pull upon         as     it,
                                                       evident from
                                                                  is
the apparent repulsion of the particles on the surface.

                    Liquids  on the Surface   of Water.                39
No effect, probably because the vapour of the disulphide being
heavier than that of the oil prevents it from being deposited on
the surface of A, and so renders any variation in tension impos
sible. When, however, the vapour of the disulphide acts on a
surface of turpentine dusted over with lycopodium, the particles
near the end of the tube move up to it and produce a centripetal
current.
      18.  I  will now give some further experiments of my own,
illustrating on a large scale the formation of centrifugal and
centripetal currents.       A bit of sponge tied over the end of a
glass rod (1 a) was used to convey the vapour, a separate sponge
being used for each liquid.
      Vapour of chloroform produces powerful centripetal currents
 in the films of various oils &c. on the surface of water.          Many
 years ago I observed that a large film of black Japan varnish on
 the surface of water contained in a dinner-plate was singularly
 acted on by the chloroform-sponge.          The vapour first converted
 it into a multitude of minute globules, which then moved up to
 the sponge as to a common centre of attraction.
      A similar effect is produced by the action of the ammonia-
 sponge on a film of oil of tar (Ol.picis).      No sooner is the sponge
  held over the film than it separates into distinct portions, and
  each portion gathers itself up into a very convex lens, which re
  flecting the light, the appearance is as if the surface were all at
  once studded with eyes.       The effect is very singular and striking.
  Chloroform slightly repels this film.
       Oil-of-turpentine Film. — Chloroform powerfully attracts and
  gathers it together.      It does the same with films of the oils of
  origanum, rosemary, lavender, and many others.             But it often
   happens that, when chloroform has gathered up the film, the
  ammonia-sponge will spread it out sufficiently thin to form iri
  descent colours.     Such is the case with the films of oils of laven
   der, amber, &c.      So also benzole will thicken and attract a film,
   while ether will scatter and repel it.      The naphtha-sponge acts
   ceutripetally on the oil-of-sassafras film, while on a film of oil of
   pepper it produces a remarkable swinging to-and-fro motion.
   Acetic acid, in which oil of lavender is soluble, acts by its vapour
   upon a film of the oil in a very marked manner, attracting it and
   gathering it up into little disks.     This film is also very sensitive
   to the ether-sponge, even when held at a great distance above.
   The oil-of-aniseed film is dispersed by ether and brought together
   by ammonia.        A film of oil of turpentine is first repelled and
   then attracted by the ammonia-sponge.             The oil-of-rosemary
   film is gathered up by the vapour of carbonic disulphide.         Ether
   disperses a film of oil of peppermint; vapour of turpentine brings
   it together.

40               Mr. C. Tomlinsim               on the   Motions of certain
    19. Effects of this kind I endeavoured to explain by supposing
the liquids, in passing into vapour, were endowed with a repul
sive force; but when such vapours condensed on the film and
became soluble in              it,
                              attraction set in accompanied         an increaseby
of cohesion.      I   fully   admit   the   great superiority    of the theory
which accounts for and explains these varied effects                  variationsby
in thesurface-tension.          Some of the phenomena just given (18), and
others to which         Ishall afterwards refer (28) (32), always puzzled
 me until    Isaw what         vast number of analogous phenomena were

 generalized         the theory of the surface-tension of liquids.

 when held over           film of oil of turpentine (2) that when the

if   a drop of oil of turpentine be held over the surface the parts
 will gather together and display colours.                On referring to my
 note- book,     find the first effect also entered for the oils of rose

 its own vapour.          These experiments were first made in bright
 summer weather, which                so favourable to all the camphor and

I   failed   that

 the action of its own vapour upon it. When the film had become
 attenuated        by
                    evaporation,          obtained the iridescent effects
                                               I                                              by
  the action of the turpentine-sponge.                This arises, according to
 the theory, from an increase                   in
                                            thickness consequent on the con
  densation of vapour; and as the tension of the water so covered
  diminishes up to           certain limit in proportion as the thickness
                              a
  of the film      increased,
                  is                will be understood how, as the tension
                                          it
  becomes less in the coloured portion, the surrounding parts
  remove this from the centre until the white of the first order                              is
  again developed at this centre.             The rings then remain station
  ary, or even become slightly compacted                       by
                                                          virtue of the tension
  of the central part.         The condensation of         fresh portion of va

  pour only slightly changes           the aspect   and  diameter of the rings,
  so that the central white remains.              When the source of vapour
is   removed, the rings disappear and the white tint covers the
  whole film.

                    Liquids on  the Surface  of Water.                 41
     21. The spreading of a drop of a liquid upon the surface of
another liquid is dependent on the conditions enunciated by Pro
fessor Van der Mensbrugghe in the following proposition : —
     When on the surface of a liquid, A, whose tension = a, we de
posit a drop of a liquid, B, whose tension, b, is notably smaller than
a, this drop usually spreads into a thin film with a display of
beautiful colours.       But if b is superior to, or scarcely inferior to
a, the drop, instead of spreading, assumes and maintains a lenti
cular form.        Hence it follows that if a liquid, B, is capable of
spreading on another liquid, A, it is not possible that A should
spread upon B.
     22. In order to show the superior tension of that portion of
the surface not covered by the film, the author resorted to the
 ingenious contrivance of the silken coil described in my former
paperi4.       The action of ether and also of camphor within and
without the coil has already been giveni5.           One more example
 will repay perusal.
     A, distilled water   ; B, solution   of at least one part of Mar
 seilles  soap in forty parts of water        (6=2-83);           =0-61.
 As soon      as a drop of the solution touches the liquid surface
 within the coil, this immediately assumes the circular form;
 but it does not rebound as in the case of ether, because the
 soapy solution, not being very volatile, does not increase the
 contractile force by the cold incident on evaporation ; and the
 oily matter of the soap greatly diminishes the tension of that
 part of the water on which the drop spreads.           It is curious to
 remark that the floating disk of liquid bounded by the coil moves
 over the surface of the water, and even rotates, without changing
  its circular form.     These effects are thus accounted for : — If the
  boundary limited by the coil stopped all communication between
  the lamina of soapy water and the surface of the pure water, it
  would be tended equally in all directions by the external liquid
  layer, and so would remain in equilibrium ; but along this boun
  dary there exists generally one or several points where it is pos
  sible for the soap-disk to communicate with the pure water
  outside the coil ; and it is here that a small portion of the soap-
  solution escapes from the coil in a certain direction, and neutra
  lizes in this direction the external traction which would otherwise
  act on the coil at these points.     Consequently the forces to which
  the system is subject are not everywhere and in all directions
  equal among themselves, so that equilibrium cannot be main
  tained.     It is easy to conceive that the sum of these forces may
  be replaced by a single resultant, and then the coil would un
  dergo a movement of translation ; or by a couple, when we should

42        Mr. C. Tomlinson       on the   Motions of certain
get a movement of rotation ; or by one single force and a couple,
when the soapy disk would be displaced in turning upon itself.
These motions do not continue long, since the soapy solution
gradually invades the surface of pure water external to the coil,
and so diminishes greatly its tension.
   23. It has already been stated (20) that the tension of water
covered with a film of turpentine diminishes up to a certain limit
in proportion as the film becomes thick. Water covered with a
film too thin to give a uniform white tint of the first order has a
tension equal to about 5 ; after a second drop of turpentine has
been deposited, the contractile force is only 4*71, after a third
4-12, after a fourth 37, and after a fifth 3*43.        As the ten
sion of turpentine is only 2'9, we have a sufficient reason why
several drops of turpentine in succession spread upon the sur
face of water.     As soon as the contractile force of the water
is reduced to 3, the drops of turpentine no longer spread, but
assume the lenticular form.       I may remark, however, that the
phenomena of cohesion-figures are not well exhibited after the
deposit of the first drop.      Some oils (that of lavender, for ex
ample) will perform their evolutions on the film of a second drop,
 but a third drop remains as a film.     It also happens, with newly
 distilled oils especially, that the second drop remains for a long
time in the spheroidal state on a film of the first, from which it
is separated by a cushion of its own vapour.       I beg to refer to a
note on this subjecti6.
   24. It will be readily understood that the great difference in
tension between water and the oils causes the latter to spread
rapidly on the surface of the former, while they maintain the
lenticular form if the water be covered with even an impercep
tible film of greasy matter, since in such case the tension of the
water becomes diminished.        It is a difficult question to deter
mine how the lenticular form can constitute a figure of equi
librium when the tension of the water on which the oil-lens
rests is still greater than that of the oil.      Professor Van der
 Mensbrugghe takes it for granted, although I very much doubt
the fact (25), that at the surface of separation of the two liquids
there is greater or less adhesion, which must diminish the con
tractile force of each liquid, so that a resultant tension prevails
over such surface which is neither that of the water nor that of
the oil.   Hence he arrives at the general condition of equilibrium
of a liquid lens resting on the surface of another liquid.    Let t,
t, t" be the respective tensions of the surrounding liquid, of the

                     Liquids       on the Surface           of Water.                                   43
tions determined by the meridional plane of the lens in the ex
ternal liquid surface, and in the superior and inferior zones of
the floating mass. We then get, in the case of the spreading of
the drop, the condition
                           t cos a     >   t' cos a'   -f /" cos a" ;
and in the case of equilibrium of the liquid lens, the relation
                           / cos a = /' cos a' + 1" cos a".
But these formulae also show that / may considerably exceed t'
without the extension of the drop into a film being possible,
and that, if the spreading does take place, it is feeble in propor
tion as /" becomes greater — that is to say, as the two liquids
brought into contact have less mutual adhesion.        Unfortunately
the difficulties of obtaining direct measurements of a,       a", and                  a',
especially   of  t",
                  are opposed   to the exact valuation   of the  limit
beyond which extension becomes impossible.

the tension of the two liquids at the surface of separation —
whether in fact there were any, and what amount of, adhesion
between the two surfaces, and how far this adhesion modified
the tension.       have already in the former paperi7 insisted
                     I

and benzoic acid on the surface of water are not interrupted                                            by

in no way impeded          its presence.  Hence      may be argued         it
there can be little or no adhesion between the oil and the sur
face of the water, or the motions of the camphor would be
arrested, as   so decidedly the case when

saline solutions, of which those of sodic sulphate may be taken as
the type.     If we deposit on the surface of such solution drop           a                  a

44            Mr. C. Tomlinson     on the Motions of certain
 spheric temperature, resting on (I do not say in contact with) a
 highly supersaturated and consequently very sensitive solution,
 without any separation of the salt arising from nucleate action.
 Nay, more, during all this time the flask containing the solution
 may be shaken so as to disperse the oil in globules through the
 solution, and yet there is no crystallization. So far as their
 action as nuclei depends, they might as well be outside the flask.
 In such a case, as it seems to me, each globule of oil does not
 adhere to the solution, although this may completely surround
 it when the flask is shaken, but maintains its own surface-ten
 sion, while that portion of the solution which moulds itself upon
 it and forms, as it were, a new surface, thus acquires and pre
 serves its own peculiar surface-tension ; so that in fact the oil-
 globule and the solution are not in contact at all.        The extreme
 sensitiveness of the solution to the action of nuclei renders this
 view probable.      We have only to convert an oil-globule into a
 film, which may be done by a peculiar jerk of the flask, whereby
 a few globules flatten against the side and spread, when in an
 instant, as if by a flash of light, the whole solution becomes
 solid.    By thus converting an oil-globule into a film we ensure
 contact ; and contact is necessary to convert the non-nucleate
 oil-lens or globule into a nucleate oil-film.      Now this condition
 of film is precisely that which we get when a glass rod, for
 example, made chemically clean and therefore non-nucleate, is
rendered powerfully nucleate by simply drawing it through the
 hand, whereby it becomes tainted with a film of greasy matter.
 In like manner a glass rod smeared with oil is a nucleus ; but
 if the oil be made to roll up into globules, neither the rod nor
 the oil- globules act as nucleii8.

                            = 49-l); B, ether;          = 096.       Ether
 spreads rapidly on the surface of mercury, and then resolves itself
into a multitude of small lenses. On repeating the experiment
a few times, the surface of the metal became covered with a thin
film apparently of greasy matter, arising, as Professor Van der
Mensbrugghe suggests, from the ether ; but may it not rather
have originated in the mercury, which is very difficult to main
tain chemically clean ? Alcohol, benzole, wood-naphtha, and the
oils spread rapidly on the surface of mercury, as would naturally
be supposed from the great differences between their tension and
that of mercury.       But a difficulty arises in the case of water,
which does not spread on mercury, although its tension is six
times less than that of mercury.          A drop of distilled water on

such a surface maintains the form of a spherical segment not
greatly differing from a hemisphere; but the water has very
little adhesion for mercury, so that the tension /" of the surface
of separation of the two bodies has a value very nearly that of
the tension t of the mercury.       On the other hand, a and a" have
no value, on account of the great density of the metal.              The
equation therefore is only possible when the cos a! is very small —
that is to say, when a! scarcely differs from a right angle and
the drop is sensibly a hemisphere.         The same equation shows
that when by any means we diminish            or     f    t",

covers the free surface of the small liquid mass, and in              few           a
seconds the mass itself spreads, since soap-water has              much        a
smaller tension than pure water.         The same result may be ob
tained     bytouching  the surface of the segment with      speck of oil.

rent repulsions between two liquids, of which so many examples
have long been known, are simple effects of surface-tension.                        It      is
remarkable that so long ago as the year 1855 Professor Thomson
of Belfast19, brought before the British Association at Glasgow
the phenomena of " weeping," or " tears in the wine-glass,"
and connected them with surface-tension.           He says " The more :
watery portions of the entire surface having more tension than
those which are more alcoholic, drag the latter briskly away,
sometimes even so as to form         horizontal ring of liquor high up
                                          a
 round the interior of the vessel, and thicker than that           which       by
the interior of the vessel was wetted.            Then the tendency                         is
 for various parts of this ring or line to run together to those
parts which happen to be most watery, and so there              no stable is
 equilibrium for the parts to which the various portions of the
 liquid aggregate themselves, soon to be too heavy to be sustained,
 and so they fall down.       In wine-glass the thin film adhering
                                      a
 to the glass must very quickly become more watery than the
 rest, by the evaporation of the alcohol being more rapid than
 that of the water."     Thus      ifphial partly filled with wine

46             Mr. C. Tomlinson          on the   Motions of certain
air capable of producing evaporation be introduced, the liquid
film creeps up the interior with thick or viscid-looking pendent
streams descending from it like a fringe from a curtain ; the
 more watery portion draws itself away from the more alcoholic
 portiou, as when a drop of alcohol is put into the centre of a
thin stratum of water the water will retire (10), (28).
    29. If the conditions be inverted and a drop of water be de
posited on a thin stratum of ether or absolute alcohol, the drop
assumes the form of a well-defined spherical segment, notwith
standing the great affinity existing between the two liquids. So
also a stratum of olive-oil retreats before a drop of turpentine,
cold water before hot, distilled water before soapy water, and
so on.     Invert these conditions, and there is no retreat of the
liquid.
   30. The phenomenon pointed out by M. Jeitteles in 1853s0
 belongs to differences in surface-tension.      When a liquid de
scends in a thin layer down the interior surface of a funnel or of
the vessel which receives       it,
                                light particles floating on the sur
face rise sometimes many centimetres in         direction contrary to
                                                           a
that of the current and describe within this current oval lines.
The effect may be observed with water, saline and acid solutions,
&c., but not with alcohol or ether.      The conditions required for
the exhibition of the phenomenon are         liquid of great surface-
                                                       a
tension and an unclean vessel, or one more or less contaminated
with greasy matter, as from the hands or an ordinary glass-cloth.
Then,    ifa liquid with its surface-tension undiminished descend
in   a layer down the side of the funnel and come into contact
with another portion of liquid whose tension has been diminished
 by  contact with the grea3y film, this portiou will tend to obey
the preponderating contractile force — that       to say, to form an
                                                               is
ascending current.     The current     not visible unless the beak
                                                is
of the funnel dip into the liquid in the vessel below and the            ;
slower the motion the better the effect, since in such case the
effects of the higher tension are less interfered with.     That this
explanation     the true one was proved
                  is                                       by
                                                 Professor Van der
Mensbrugghe, who employed          chemically clean funnel, when
                                         a
the effect was no longer obtainable.

of creosote4i, eugenic acid2*, and the displacing-power of some

  54 There are some curious experiments described by M. Dardenne (Bull. de

                    Liquids   on the Surface    of Water.                  47
paper, I noticed a curious series of motions with the film of oil
of nutmegs that had been broken up by the action of creosote
and exposed some time to the air. The oil formed a well-defined
film with small bosses just within the edge ; and the film almost
completely covered the surface of the water in a shallow glass
3 inches in diameter.          On placing a drop of creosote near the
edge,    it  entered   the  film   and cleared out a space for itself,
although     it did  not vibrate   as it usually does when alone on the
surface.      It gradually flattened ; and as the film became thinner
by evaporation and displayed fine iridescent colours, the creo
sote became active, broke up the film, and drove about the frag
ments.       When, however, the creosote was placed first on the
water and then the oil, the latter flashed into a film and stopped
the motions of the creosote ; but as the oil got thinner, the cre
osote disks became active and cut through the film with energy.
One disk of creosote became attached to the edge of the glass
and exerted its influence chiefly in a right line nearly to the op
posite point.       Portions of the film, now become almost powdery
in texture, sailed up in gently curved lines to within one-tenth
of an inch of the creosote, and then fell-in in two and two, t. e.
one from either side of the creosote, and proceeded in a straight
line nearly to the opposite point with all the order and regularity
of a drill movement.          This effect lasted about fifteen minutes,
 until the creosote had nearly disappeared. When the oil was re
 distilled, it formed a smaller film than before ; a drop of creosote
 shut it up instantly.       When the creosote was put on the water
 and then the newly distilled oil, the latter formed a lens.
     32. There are many curious phenomena which                I  noted down
 during my study of cohesion-figures which could not well be
 with a chalky finger a pane of glass wet with condensed moisture, he noticed
that as the streams descended stained by the chalky particles, some of these
 followed the descent, but others near the edge of the stream moved up
 wards.     He then ground up a little oil with chalk or with a few drops of
 water, and on leading a gentle stream of water into it down an almost
 vertical plane, active contrary currents were obtained.     In this case the
 pure water reaching the oily deposit, its excess of tension over the oily
 matter would tend to raise the superficial layer of oil and with it the solid
 particles suspended in it. It seems to me, however, that, in such cases as
 the above, other forces are at work as well as surface-tension.      In refer
                             "                        " as effects of a
 ring to the phenomena of tears in the wine-glass                       chemi
 cally clean surface (Phil. Mag. for October 1868), it is remarked that in
 the spaces between the tears will be seen an ascending current " which
 rises (1) by the adhesive action of capillarity, (2) by the formation of a
 back current in consequence of the downward flow of the tears, just as a
 backwater is formed at the place where two currents of a river meet."
 So also in endeavouring to explain the motions of eugenic acid (see
 note M), eddies are formed and an indraw such as are due to the opera
 tion of well-known forces apart from surface-tension.

  a film of 01. Ruta, sends out short processes from the edge,
  which sometimes split at the free end and become bifurcated with
  wide-spreading forks ; or the free end may terminate in a boss,
  which is torn away and another formed.             I   have also observed
  a hole to open in the centre of the film, showing colour ; after a
  time the colour would disappear and streamers set in directed to
  wards the centre of the opening.          Then the hole enlarged and
  the film separated into two or three well-defined disks, which re
  mained quiet for a time, and at length put forth active streamers
  from the edge, which sailed away and disappeared. The splitting
  up and scattering over the surface on the part of some films I have
  endeavoured to represent in the case of creosote in the plate
•
  which accompanies one of my papers45; and the spasmodic actions
  which accompany separated portions of some other films are re
  presented in the subsidiary figures b, c, d which accompany the
  engraving of the principal figure of oil of lavender*6.                The
  waving   to-and-fro   motion   of the film  of oil of  bitter almonds  and
  some other oils is very remarkable.        In bright warm weather the
  energy of some oils on a large surface of water is striking. A disk
  of oil of cloves, for example, will set the whole surface vibrating
  after the manner of camphor pulsations*7.              When one drop of
  absolute alcohol was added to twenty drops of oil of cloves, and
  one drop of the solution placed on the surface of water, the disk
  that was formed shot out volleys of small globules with immense
  velocity, which covered the surface, and then all became quiet.
  In attempting to estimate the value of the cohesion-figure test
  by adding small proportions of the fixed oils to the more costly
   essential oils, an endless variety of phenomena was obtained,
   which, as it seemed to me, only required to be studied in order
   to render this test valuable.      I refer to them now as affording
   good illustrations of variations in surface-tension ; but it might
   be tedious if these examples were prolonged.
      33. In conclusion,      I must express my satisfaction that the
   vast number of phenomena described or alluded to in this and
   my former paper have been erected into a tasteful and harmo
   nious structure by the Belgian physicist.           I  have contributed a
   good many bricks to the building ; but it is a privilege to serve
   science, even though it be in the humble capacity of hod-carrier
   to a master bricklayer.

 VII.            Note    on some     Propositionsin the Theory of the Tides.

          College, Dublin*.
        the following paper it is proposed merely to give elementary
  IN proofs    of the following propositions : —
     I. That if there were no friction it would be low water under
  the moon.
     II. That friction accelerates the times of high and low water.
          III.
           That, in addition to the oscillatory motion of the water,
  there is a constant current produced by the moon's action. And
     IV. That the effect of friction is to increase the length of the
  day.
     I. The theorem that if there were no friction it would be
  low water under the moon, is common to the theories of Newton
  and Laplace and Airy.      That it is not mentioned in elementary
  treatises        is,
                 suppose, owing to the circumstance that the proof
                    I
 is  supposed to require     knowledge of the higher mathematics.

  The following proof        direct, and presupposes only the most
                                      is
  elementary knowledge.
    I suppose the moon to be fixed, and the earth rotating in the
                                                   Fif?.    I.

                    B      C   D, carrying the ocean with it.                       It   is   shown in
  elementary books (Galbraith and Haughton's       Manual of Astro        '
  nomy,' p. 66) that the tangential force alone need be considered,
  and that this acts in each quadrant in the direction indicated                                    by
  the arrows, viz. always towards the line joining the centres of
  the moon and the earth.
     Now in the course of one lunar day every particle of the ocean
  is subjected to precisely the same forces acting   the same order            in
  of succession and for the same periods, being accelerated for

50              The Rev. T.              K. Abbott             on some Propositions
about one quarter of a day, viz. while passing froin B to C, then
retarded for a quarter, from C to D, and so on.       The variation
in the amount of the force does not concern us, being the same
for every particle.
   This being so, it is obvious that those particles will be moving
faster which have been for a longer time acted on by an accele
rating force, and the velocity will be a maximum when the acce
lerating force has acted during its full period, viz. through one
quadrant.   On the other hand, those particles will be moving
slower which have been longer acted on by a retarding force,
and the absolute velocity will be a minimum when the retarding
force has acted during its full period, or through one quadrant.
The maximum velocity is therefore at A and C, the minimum at
B and D.
   Secondly, it is clear that the tide will be rising where each
portion of water is moving faster than that just in advance of                                      it,
or, in other words, where water    flowing    faster than is flows       in                it
out. Where this process has gone on for the maximum time,
the tide will be highest.  On the other hand, the tide will be
falling where the water     moving slower than that in advance
of   it,
       or, in other words,                   is is
                            flowing out faster than      flows in.                    it
Where this has continued for the maximum time the tide                                              is
lowest.
    Now consider any point in the quadrant           C. The water
                                                     s                        B

                          is          the case through the whole

therefore, water        flowing  in

          is             ;                                        D.    What      C

    On the whole, then, the water assumes the form of an ellipse,

its absolute position except with the moon's monthly motion ;
only the water accompanying the rotating earth moves fastest

is there deepest.   Relatively to the earth it is moving westward
at B and D, eastward at A and C.

     II.
       The theorem that the effect of friction is to accelerate the
time of high and low water admits of an equally simple proof.
As the water approaches C, the tangential force diminishes gra
dually to zero at C. Therefore it must have been equal to the
force of friction at some point n (fig. 1), after which friction prevails
and the velocity diminishes.   It is therefore low water at n. Ap
proaching D, the ocean is moving slower than the earth ; there
fore here friction tends to accelerate           it,
                                            while the retarding force
is  decreasing to zero.   The two forces, then, must be equal at
some point o, after which the velocity again increases.                         It   is
high water therefore at o.
     It   proper to observe that the preceding proof assumes (as
           is
does Mr. Airy's) that the ocean       carried round
                                            is                    by
                                                         the earth in
its rotation.   This amounts to supposing that       has not assumed
                                                            it
a position of equilibrium       *.
   Mr. Airy assumes further, that when the tide      rising fastest
                                                                 is
the water     flowing in from both sides. This
                is                                       no meansis   by
evident.   The rate of rise depends on the difference in velocity
between two successive parts ot the ocean, and this may be greater
when the two velocities have the same sign than when they have
different signs.     Taking into consideration the rotation of the
earth, the assumption amounts to this — that the tide         rising       is
fastest where the velocity of the ocean       just equal
                                                       is to that  of
the earth.      This   certainly not evident
                         is                    in fact  :would not    it
be true      the tangential force did not decrease at the same rate
            if
on both sides of each of the four maxima.       It ought not, there
fore,  to be  assumed,  but deduced.
     III. We now come to the question whether, in addition to the
    Mr. Airy indeed supposes, not only that the ocean has some move
    *
ment of rotation, but that its mean movement  the same as the earth's.
                                                       is

52                    Mr.   J. Parnell    on Secondary Currents
oscillatory motion, there is any constant current produced by the
moon's force.    Now, as the circumstances about the four points
of equilibrium are precisely similar as long as the ocean is sup
posed spherical, we may assume that the relative velocity of the
water at equal distances from each of these points is the same,
the points of no relative velocity being e,f, g, h.  This is equi
valent to supposing that the mean movement of rotation of the
ocean  does not differ ab initio from that of the earth.       In this
case, then, the retardation between e and                     /
                                                  is exactly balanced
by the acceleration between
two quadrants.
                                          /
                                 and g, and similarly in the other
                   But when the ocean has assumed the form of an
ellipse this symmetry ceases.    As the tangential force        cceteris is,
paribus, proportional   to the distance of the particles attracted
from the centre of the earth,     follows that the forces are greater
                                          it
from       e
               to/
             and from     to   than from
                                 g    h      to     and from
                                                      f       g   to e.   h
Therefore the retardation in the former intervals       not        is
                                                            completely
compensated            by
                  the acceleration in the latter.     Hence there                is   a
balance of retardation, in other words,     continuous current, re
                                                          a
latively to the earth, westward.
   IV. Friction being taken into account, the effect of this                   is   to
retard the earth's rotation, or to lengthen the day.

   (d)    A Thomson's    astatic reflecting galvanometer, whose in
 ternal resistance was rather less than '6 B.A. unit.     The deflec
 tions were read off in the usual manner, on a scale which was so
 graduated that 300 divisions occupied a space of 19 centims.
 The image of the slit appeared as a hand of light 4 millims.
broad, the position of one edge of which, sharply defined, gave
the index-reading.      By using a lens sufficiently large for the
scale to be viewed by both eyes at once, the error of observation
did not exceed "5 of one division, or, in the deflections generally
obtained, -3 per cent. of each reading.       Attached to the galva
nometer was a shunt, by which 9 per cent. or 99 per cent. of the
current could be diverted at pleasure from the galvanometer-coils.
The directing magnetic bar was placed at the top of its support,
and with the same orientation as the upper needle.
    The index-readings taken were in all cases those correspond

When the commutator is turned off, by depressing the key Z
the Daniell current is sent through the resistance-coils to the
galvanometer.
    4. The modus operandi will now be quite apparent : the index
having been carefully adjusted to zero, the commutator was
turned so as to excite the secondary couple, and at the expiration
of twenty seconds, the interval having been taken by the ticks
of a clock beating dead seconds, the Morse key was depressed,
the index-reading observed, the commutator turned off, and a
short circuit made to exhaust the secondary couple before another
experiment was made.        This process was repeated in each case
till five results had been obtained,the mean of which was recorded.
After the first, third, and fifth experiment tbe deflection of the
galvanometer by the Daniell cell was observed and the mean of
these results noted.      The ratio of the secondary to the Daniell
mean, multiplied by 103, is the figure of merit recorded in this
paper, and gives the value of the couple under examination,
that of the Daniell cell being 1000.      During a set of five conse
cutive experiments, the index-reading due to the Daniell cell
never differed from the mean by more than one division of the
scale.     The following instance of a set of experiments, taken at
random from the many hundreds which have been made on this
subject, will give a fair notion of the results obtained (Table         I.)

   6. When the copper plates were clean and polished, the figure
of merit was far below that mentioned above but the more fre    ;
quently the plates were excited, and the more corroded they
became, the stronger was the current produced.        Copper plate
asit  comes from the rollers will, under the influence of powerful
electric currents, very quickly acquire     condition of surface

the highest result obtained with any experimental couple was
given    by  pair of copper plates whose surfaces appeared to be
              a
completely   covered  with crystals of carbonate of copper, the so
lution in which they had been placed having evaporated.
   7. Other alkaline solutions were then tried, viz. of the hydrates
of sodium and potassium and the carbonate of potassium.          The
results obtained       by

same solutions, but they all (with the exception of brass in car

   * In this and all subsequent Tables the highest uniform results given                 by
good experiments are recorded, as all the errors of observation, whether in
strumental or functional, tended to diminish rather than to increase the
figures of merit.

56                Mr.  J. Parnell  on Secondary Currents
solution slightly raises the figure of merit, but not to an extent
sufficient to counterbalance the disadvantage of a more rapid
efflorescence on the plates.        A very few drops of a solution of
ammonia added to the sod.-carb. solution reduced its power by
75 per cent.        A prolongation of the time of excitation caused
an augmentation of the figure of merit, which, when that time
is a variable, becomes a function of its reciprocal; and as cop
per in sod. carb. attained very nearly its maximum force after
twenty seconds' excitation, whereas all other combinations re
quired a much longer time, it is not thought necessary to burden
this paper with Tables of the results obtained.
    9. Although, as has been before stated (§ 4), by the mode of
manipulation adopted we practically eliminate all external resist
ance (other than the resistance-coils) and their variations from
consideration as regards the galvanometer circuit, yet the varia
tion of the internal resistance of the Daniell cell, which affected
the intensity of the exciting current, is of serious importance, and
was, no doubt, one cause of the variations which appeared in the
readings    obtained     on different days during the course of this
investigation, although on the same day the results were very
accordant.     On this account the experiments were continued from
day   to day  till a large number of results had been obtained ; and
from these it appears that the relative powers of the metals and
solutions described in the Tables to this paper were always
maintained.
    10. There is another point to which attention was directed,
which was this — that the secondary couples did not lose their
power with the same rapidity, either during discharge or sponta
neously ; and as in the practical application of secondary bat
teries, as well as in their scientific aspect, the persistence of the
current is of importance, experiments were undertaken to deter
mine the rate of decadence of the powers of certain couples; and
some of the results are recorded in Table IV. : —

    In these experiments, after the Daniell cell had been cut off
from the secondary couple, an interval of twenty or forty seconds
was allowed to elapse before contact was made with the galvano
meter, and in the above Table IV. we have the percentages of
loss sustained by the secondary couples during those intervals.
We see that copper in a solution of hydrate of potassium lost
only 8'5 per cent. of its force during forty seconds, whereas pla
tinum in dil. sulph. ac. lost in the same time 43 per cent.

    11. To test the permanency of the secondary current during
discharge, the resistance was reduced to 700 B.A. units, employ
ing the 99 per cent. shunt. In the following Table V. we have
the figures of merit of copper in sod. carb. and platinum in dil.
sulph. ac. with 7000 units and 9 per cent. shunt, and 700 units
       99 per cent. shunt respectively : —

                 Platinum.                   772          570
     From this we see that, on diminishing the resistance of the
 secondary circuit by more than 6000 B.A. units, the platinum
couple lost its force during the time (about three seconds) of the
swing of the galvanometer-needles much more rapidly than the
copper couple.
     12. Copper* plates were tried in a solution of the impure car
 bonate of sodium known in commerce as " soda                  and not only
 did they rise more quickly to their full power, but the maximum
 was far greater than that with the pure substance, giving a figure
 of merit 920 — a value so high that, if it represented even the
 whole of the electromotive force generated in the secondary
 couple, we might be inclined to think that further experiments
 in this direction could lead to no better result ; but a portion of
 that force was lost during the swing of the galvanometer-needles.
 It will be seen further on that, when working on a larger scale
 and with a more accurate method of measuring the electromotive
 force, we can obtain a figure of merit higher even than that just
 mentioned.
      13. The force developed with the copper-" soda

  periods of excitation less than twenty seconds is shown in

                                "
perimental copper-" soda          couple having shown no tendency
to diminish its force*, a forty-cell secondary battery was con
structed, each couple of which consisted of two plates of copper
separated by flannel, each plate presenting an effective surface
of 516 square centims., and was immersed in a solution of
" soda," spec. grav. 1050. This battery was arranged in ten
sets of four cells each, and each set was connected in series.             A
commutator was devised for the purpose of charging this bat
tery as ten compound cells, and discharging it as forty cells in
series.     This instrument, shown in plan in fig. 2, consists of a
                                   Fig.  2.

observe any deterioration in the condition of the flannel, yet no doubt an
electrolytic action had taken place, as a purple dyeing-substance was pro
duced, which gave a deep violet tint to the flannel and solution, the latter
becoming fluorescent.     We shall see further on that when a powerful ex
citing battery is employed, flannel is not suited to the purpose required.

connexion with the exciting battery. Eleven pairs of brass springs
(A, B,), (A4 B4),            , fixed to the ebonite stand aud pro
vided with screws for the necessary connexions, press against
the cylinder in a direction transverse to its axis.         Two narrow
brass plates, C and D, are fixed to the cylinder on opposite sides,
and are respectively in metallic communication with the. supports
N and P. In the position of the cylinder shown in this figure,
these two plates are in a horizontal plane ; and it will be seen
that they do not extend the whole length of the cylinder, but
that plate C is just clear of the spring A,„ and the plate D
clear of the spring B,, which springs are connected with the
wires T and S respectively, through which the secondary dis
charge is to be taken.       Between the letters H and H are seen
eleven  white   circles, which   represent the extremities of the same
number of brass rods passing across the axis of the cylinder and
extending slightly beyond its surface on each side ; in the above-
 mentioned position of the cylinder the rods are vertical.          The
 forty cells being arranged in ten sets of four each, let us call
 the right-hand terminal of each set R„ Ra, . . . Rl0 in order,
 and the left-hand terminals, L,, Ls,       .... Li0, in the same order.
 Then A, and R„ Aj and R4,          ....  A,0 and   Ri0, and B2 and L,,
 B3 and L2, . . . . B,, and Ll0 are respectively connected, as shown
 in the figure ; and P and N are connected with the positive and
 negative poles respectively of the exciting battery, which con
 sisted of five Grove cells.     When the plates C and D are in a
 horizontal plane, the springs A,, A2,           ....  Ai0 are pressing
 against the plate C, and therefore all the right-hand terminals,
 R„ Rj,   ....  R,0, are connected with the negative pole of the
 Grove battery; and similarly the left-hand terminals L, . . . . LM
 through the springs Bs . . . . B„ and the plate D, are connected
 with the positive pole, and the secondary battery is being charged.
 Let the cylinder be now turned through 90° into the position
 shown in fig. 3, which (having the same lettering as fig. 2) re-

springs across the axis of the cylinder. The plates C and D are
thrown out of contact with the springs, which, through the now
horizontal brass rods across the cylinder, become connected me
tallically in pairs, as shown in the figure 3; t. e. A, toB„ A« to
B4,  ... A,, to B,„ so that R, is connected with S, Rs to L„ Ra
to Lj, . . . T to Ll0, the whole ten sets being thus joined toge
ther in zigzag fashion ; the forty cells will then be con
nected in series and discharged through the conductors S and T.
Complicated (and, it is feared, too much so) as this description
may be, the instrument and its action are in fact very simple ;
and as this apparatus " functions
                                       " remarkably well, and may
be used for other and analogous purposes, the account has been
made somewhat elaborate.
   15. The current from this battery had for a secondary cur
rent considerable duration ; after one excitation, repeated defla
grations could be obtained with tin- or platinum-foil ; with the
latter of the thickness of '1 millim. a hole was pierced 4 mil-
lims. in diameter, the edges of which were fused.      Its electromo
tive force was measured by a Thomson's portable electrometer,
and the results are given in Table VII.

    (In order to throw the Grove battery into the        same    circuit
and in the same direction as the secondary battery, a very simple
and obvious addition was made to the connexions.)                 These
results were repeatedly obtained without any variation, and
are in complete accord.       The electromotive force, therefore, of
the forty cells   was  equal to that of 316 Grove cells.
   16. After some months' inaction this battery had seriously
declined in power; and on examination it was found that the
flannel was almost entirely destroyed.      The couples were ther-
fore reconstructed, and on a smaller scale.     Each of the copper
plates in each pair now made exposed an effective surface of 108
square centims., and was separated from the other by pieces of
ebonite at a distance of rather less than 2 millims.     On charging
forty of these couples by live Grove cells, and connecting the
terminals with the electrometer, the following results were ob
tained : —

    Now, since the electromotive force of the forty secondary cells
in series is represented by 23, that of five cells will be 2 875;
and as the force of the five Grove cells is expressed by 3, we see
that the force of each set of five secondary couples is 95-83, or
nearly 96 per cent. of that of the exciting battery, a result which
can scarcely be greatly surpassed.          An experiment was made to
test the usefulness of this form of battery for telegraphic pur
poses.    The discharge was sent through 19,000 B.A. units, or
more than twice the resistance of the Atlantic cable, and was
received at an indicator such as is employed only to test the
continuity of telegraph wires, and which is a comparatively
coarse instrument.      The deflection of the needle when contact
was first made was 35°, and at the end of one minute, the con
tact having been continued during that time, 20°; whereas the
five Grove cells could of themselves produce but a very feeble
motion of the needle, of 2° or 3° only.              An excitation of five
seconds' duration appeared to completely restore to the secondary
battery its original power.
    17. There is one disadvantage attending the use of the car
bon ate-of- sodium solution in secondary batteries, viz. the efflo
rescence on the plates and cells.           Many different substances,
such as shellac in alcohol, oil, lard, and black enamel varnish,
have been tried, but sooner or later the crystals of the car
bonate creep either under or over the varnish.               Perhaps hot
paraffine poured    into  the  top of    the   cells  when the   battery is
first made, and, after cooling, a hole bored to allow of the
escape of any gas generated, might answer the purpose of check
ing the efflorescence.

IX.   Reply   to some Remarks    of Father Secchi on the recent Solar
         Discoveries.    By  J.  Norman Lockyer, F.R.S.*
             portion of a recent note (communicated to the Royal
THAT    Society   and printed in the Comptes Rendusoi the 12th of
July)  which had reference to Father Secchi's observations, had
                     *
                       Communicated     by the Author.

62         Mr.  J.  N. Lockyer's Reply      to some Remarks  of
for its object, as I clearly stated, the settlement of certain points
where our observations were not in agreement, in order that
other workers might employ the new method of observation
under the best conditions.
   I gather from Father Secchi's communication —
   I. That he still holds toa"couche donnant un spectre continu,
couche qu'il considere comme la base de I' atmosphere solaire, et
dans laquelle, il pense que s'effectue le renversement          selon la
theorie de Kirchhoff."
   II.  That he has doubts as to the importance which I attribute
to the widening of the F line at its base, on which Dr. Frank-
land and myself have founded our estimate of the pressure of the
chromosphere.
   III. That he also has doubts as to the changes of wave-length
in the hydrogen-lines, which I have asserted to be continually
visible both on and off the sun.
   IV. That he holds still that the line F is due to the absorp
tion of some other substance besides hydrogen.
   With regard to all these points I am quite content to leave
the verdict to the future.       I may, however, remark with regard
to the first point, that although I see nothing like a continuous
spectrum, I do see traces of reduced absorption in the exterior
layer of the photosphere;        and Dr. Frankland and myself have
proved why      the  absorption increases as the lower layers are
brought into action, as in a spot.         Father Secchi has written *,
" Ayant examine comparativement le spectre dn noyau des
taches et celui du bord du disque du cote interieure, je suis
arrive k la conclusion que ces deux spectres se ressemblent con-
siderablement.     L'enlargissement des raxes constats dans le noyaux
se reproduit prits du  bord." I do not find this ; but it appears to
me that this is a contradiction in terms to his assertions about the
continuous spectrum of these regions.
   With regard to the second, in which the action of pressure is
in question, I again quote : — " J'ai encore porte mon attention
                                t
sur la largeur des raies brillantes de la chromosphere et j'ai con
stats qu'en ge'ne'ral les raies principales sont toutes trois plus
large k la base qu'au sommet, ce qui prouve l'influence de
la frkssiox exercie par les couches superievres."          This strikes
me as another contradiction in terms, and Father Secchi must
take his choice between these assertions.           But I must do him
the justice to admit that he early thought something could be
made out by means of pressure experiments, for he recommended
that the spectrum of hydrogen sous une tres forte pression should
be observed, while Dr. Frankland and myself were working suc
cessfully near the vacuum-point.

  Passing from these major points, then, which, as I said before,
I am content to leave to the future, there are several minor
ones on which           I
                 beg the Academy will allow me to say a few
words.
    Father Secchi says,                 " Lorsque M.
                                       Lockyer affirme m'avoir pre
cede dans les observations des injections de magnesium, on ne
peut pas dire jusqu'a quel point cela est exact."       So far as the
mere question of priority goes, I should not think this remark worth
answering ; but as Father Secchi seems to cast doubt on my ve
racity, I beg to refer him to a paper communicated to the Royal
Society on March 4, 1869, the first observations, as there stated,
having been made on February 21 and 28.           With regard to his
assertion,
                 "
              J'ai clairement vu et demontre que seulement une
ligne du magnesium est renversee et que l'autre ligne brillante oc-
cupe l'espace intermediaire des deux plus voisines," I feel my
self justified in denying the accuracy of the observation, and I
leave this, like the other questions, to be decided by the future.
 I should not venture to do this if a long series of experiments at
 the Royal College of Chemistry had not been absolutely in ac
 cord with my telescopic observations which have already been
 described in the Comptes Rendus.
    M. Secchi objects to my mixing up theory and observations.
I  plead guilty.                I
                       confess a remark made some time ago by M.
 Faye  is always present with me when I am observing.       The re
mark      is,   "A    good theory               is   as necessary as
                                                         good telescope."       a
Without         a    working hypothesis,                 I    should certainly
                                                               have cross-
questioned   the  sun   much    less than    have   done     and
                                                              I      should         ;          it
be   a truism   that  in    research,   such
                                        a      as  the   one  we are now
conducting,       will not do to observe blindly or haphazard.
                     it                                                  For
iustance,     began on the generally received theory that the ab
                I
sorption took place outside the photosphere, which                evidently               is

think that     Father Secchi had done the same, there would have
                 if
been less contradiction in his statements, and he also would
have found such          theory untenable.

                                                                       la
Father Secchi remarks that he does not see the justice of my
conclusion.     This may arise from the fact that he does not
agree that the         line widens
                            F             pressure       by
                                                       that        he elects;           is,   if

to hold to that statement instead of the contrary one ; but my
remark simply meant that if the chromosphere were thin instead
of thick, that          is,
                          did not extend to the photosphere,
                             if  it                                 there
would be less room for pressure to make itself evident.                He
then adds, " cette structure des masses suspendues dans une at
mosphere            resulte          des observations    des eclipses."
Here  I  would ask where such observations of the chromosphere
 (for the prominences are not in question) are recorded, and how
such observations,      they exist, could help us in such
                              if                                question.       a

   In my former paper said that,   I                    by
                                          using three prisms, the spot-
phenomena were possibly as complicated as Father Secchi has
described them, but that with my greater dispersive powers this
complication vanishes to       great extent.
                                           a     On this Father Secchi
states that

tantes."         Here again, then,   I must leave Father Secchi to settle
the matter with himself.           With regard especially to the bright
lines at times visible in spots, which Father Secchi considers due
to the radiation of the interior gaseous nucleus of the sun,              I can
only state that I have seen in the spots no bright lines which are
not at times visible in the ordinary solar spectrum ; it is true
that in the spots they are better seen.
     In conclusion, I may state : — that the method of observation
I    employ, of which        I regret to find Father Secchi thinks so
little, consists in observing the actual images of the sun cast by
a reflector of 625 inches aperture and 100 inches focal length,
or an image enlarged to 6 inches in diameter, according to
the state of the air ; that my spectroscope is furnished with a
train of seven prisms of the densest flint glass, giving me a
refracting-angle of over 300°; that this dispersion is increased by
another dense Hint-glass prism of 60°, and a direct-vision prism
of equal power ; and, finally, that I am not satisfied with this
dispersion, which is more than double that employed by Father
Secchi, and in a few days I hope to double my present power.

          "On Jargonium, a new Elementary Substance            associated with
Zirconium."          By H. C. Sorby, F.R.S. &c.
     At   the   Soiree of the President of the Royal Society on March
 6th,   I  exhibited various spectra, differing so much from those cha
racteristic of any known substance, that I considered myself war
ranted in concluding that they were evidence of a new element.
 Since this may be studied to the greatest advantage in the jargons
of Ceylon, it appeared to me that, like as the name zirconium has
been adopted for the principal constituent of zircons, so that of jargo
nium would be very suitable for this constituent of jargons.
     At the above-named Soiree I gave away a printed account of the
objects     I   exhibited, and in this I said that the earth jargonia " is
distinguished from zirconia and all other known substances by the
following very remarkable properties. The natural silicate is almost,
 if not quite colourless ; and yet it gives a spectrum which shows above
a dozen narrow black lines, much more distinct than even those cha
racteristic of salts of didymium. When melted with borax, it gives a
glassy bead, clear and colourless both hot and cold, and no trace
of absorption-bands can be seen in the spectrum ; but if the borax

may be filled with crystals     of       of jargonia, the spectrum shows
                                     borate
 four distinct absorption-bands, unlike those due to any other known
 substance."
     I have since applied myself almost exclusively to this subject,
 hoping to be able to communicate to the Royal Society a full
 account before the close of this session ; but so much still remains
 to be done, that it is now impossible to give more than a brief outline
 of some of the more important facts.            The delay has not been
 occasioned by any difficulty in proving it to be a new substance,
 but because its properties are so unique and have so much interest
 in connexion with physics that it appeared desirable to carefully
 examine all other known elements, in order to ascertain whether
 any exhibit analogous phenomena.
     That jargonium is quite distinct from zirconium is proved not
 only by the spectra, but also by other facts.            Both I and Mr.
 David Forbes have succeeded, by entirely different processes, in se
 parating from jargon zirconia apparently quite free from jargonia,
 and jargonia nearly, if not quite, free from zirconia ; and even if
 the separation be not perfect, it          is,
                                          at all events, more than suffi
 cient to prove that they are distinct.        They are certainly closely
 allied, and are deposited from borax blowpipe beads in microscopical
 crystals of the same general forms, quite unlike those characteristic
 of other known earths     ;  but beyond this the difference         as greatis
 as that between any other two closely related elements.            Judging
 from Mr. D. Forbes's analysis, kindly made at my request, and
 from a   comparison of the spectra, the amount of jargonia in differ
 ent jargons varies up to about 10 per cent.           Its entire or compa
 rative absence from the zircons of Miask, Fredericksvarn, and various
 other localities, appears to explain some of the facts which led Svan-
 berg* to conclude that zircons contain more than one earth.              He
 was so far correct, but failed to establish the existence of any sub
 stance with special chemical or physical properties       and     as
                                                                   ;     proif,   is
 bable, the Norwegian zircons, which, according to his views, contain
 such a   notable quantity of this supposed new earth as to have led
 him to give   it the name noria, were from Fredericksvarn, and           the     if
 Siberian were from Miask, his norium cannot be looked upon as equi
 valent to my jargonium, which         almost or quite absent from those

 ever both occur in the same mineral.             In the case of jargonium,
 however, the three types of spectra are all met with in crystalline
 modifications of apparently the same compound.
     The most characteristic test for jargonia is the spectrum of the
 borax blowpipe beads, seen with the spectrum-microscope, which
 enables us to detect it in zircons containing less than one per cent.
 As much of the earth or natural silicate as will completely dissolve
 should be melted in circular loops of platinum wire, about ^ of an inch
 in diameter, with a mixture of borax and boric acid, and a very strong
 heat kept up till crystals begin to be deposited, owing to loss of the
solvent by volatilization.        On removing the beads from the flame
 they    remain  clear,   and   show  a few acicular crystals, but give no
absorption-   bands    in  the  spectrum.    On reheating to a temperature
just    below  very   dull   redness, they  turn  white, and so very opaque
 that no ordinary light will pass through them. When, however, a
 small and very bright image of the sun is formed in their centre, by
 means of an almost hemispherical condensing lens of £ inch diameter,
and a cap placed over the object-glass, with a round hole less than
 the beads nearly in the focus, so as to prevent the passage of extra
 neous light, they are seen to be illuminated by transmitted light of
 about the same brilliancy as that of a bright cloud, so as to give
 an excellent spectrum, without being at all dazzling.         In the case of
 beads containing jargonia, the spectrum differs completely according
 to the temperature at which the included crystals have been depo
 sited.    As already    mentioned,   a clear glassy  bead gives no absorp
 tion-bands ; and when the crystals are deposited at as low a tempe
rature as possible, much below dull redness, and only just high
 enough to soften the borax, there may be scarcely any trace of bands ;
 but if a clear bead be quickly raised to a temperature very little
below dull redness, it suddenly becomes opaque, and shows a spec
trum with a number of narrow black absorption- bands (fig. 1). The
 most distinct is in the green, then one in the red, and one in the
blue ; and there are three fainter — one in the orange, and two in the
green.      On raising the temperature to bright redness all these bands
 vanish, and four others appear, none of which coincides with the
former (fig. 2). Three are situated in the red and orange, and one in
                Red end.                                       Blue end.
the green, so as to give a spectrum of very different general cha
racter.     In this state the bead is a pale straw-colour, and not, as
before, almost white.           In the case of nearly pure jargonia, the

 bead should not be more than         ^   of an inch thick, or else it would
 be too opaque.         Pure zirconia treated in the same manner gives no
 bands whatever in any condition ; the bead is quite white, and
 sufficiently transparent when two or three times              as thick as just
 named.
     It might    be thought that the three different spectra thus briefly
 described    were due to different compounds, if it were not that there
 is a similar series in the case of the natural crystalline silicate.     Some
 of the jargons of Ceylon have a specific gravity very little inferior to
 that of pure zircons (4-70), and contain very little j argon ia ; but
 those of low gravity (4-20 or thereabouts) contain perhaps nearly
  10 per cent., in a form which gives scarcely any trace of absorp
 tion-bands.       On keeping such a specimen at a bright red heat for
 some time, the specific gravity increases from about 4'20 to 4*60.
 Judging from the imperfect data now known, this indicates that
 the volume of the silicate of jargonia is reduced to about one-half;
 the hardness becomes somewhat greater, and, when examined with
 the spectrum-microscope, the spectrum is found to be entirely
 changed.       Instead of a mere trace of bands, a spectrum is seen
 with thirteen narrow black lines and a broader band, more remark
 able than that of any clear transparent substance with which I am
 acquainted.       No such changes occur in the case of zircons free from
jargonia,    like   those from Miask, Siberia ; there is no increase in
 the specific gravity, and no absorption-bands are developed ; and, as
 a general rule, the increase varies simply and directly as the amount
 of jargonia which passes from one state into the other. Zircons in
 their natural condition from various localities contain a very variable
 absolute and relative amount of these two modifications of jargonia,
and there seems good reason to believe that this difference in phy
sical state may materially assist us in determining the temperature
at which certain rocks have been formed.                I have also met with
one example of the third form of spectrum.                A brown-red zircon
from Ceylon was so dark in one part as to be quite opaque, and
therefore I do not know what the original spectrum might have
been.     On heating it to redness, the whole became a clear pale green ;
and, without examination with the spectroscope,            no one would have
suspected any      difference  between   the  different portions. That which
was originally a pale brown-red then showed the same spectrum as
that usually developed by heat, whilst that which was originally very
dark showed an entirely different spectrum, corresponding exactly
with that of the borate deposited in blowpipe beads at a medium
temperature.         It also corresponds in general character, but not in
detail, with that of the blue spinels from Ceylon, which must, I think,
contain a small quantity of jargonia.          That part of the zircon which
gave this spectrum appears to have had the same remarkably low spe
cific gravity of about 4-0 both before and after ignition, as though
the volume of the silicate of jargonia in this state were even greater
than in that which gives no bands.           All these spectra due to jargo-
nium are of a very marked character, and quite unlike those due to
any other element in similar conditions.

 as at first, the specific gravity and hardness are increased, and the
 spectrum   is  entirely changed.      Iodide of mercury         an excellent

illustration of an alteration     in the spectrum, due to          change in   a
crystalline form produced by heat          ; but still the facts differ most
materially from those described, and there are only two modifications
— the yellow and the scarlet. The existence of three crystalline
 modifications     issimilar to what occurs in titanic acid.         Anatase,
Brookite, and rutile have distinct crystalline forms but they do not
                                                                 ;
differ much in specific gravity, and their spectra present no charac
teristic differences.     On the whole, the different states of carbon
(charcoal, graphite, and diamond) are perhaps the best illustration
of the existence of three different conditions in the same substance,
since they differ materially in specific gravity and optical characters,
one being black, the other having          ametallic lustre, and the third
being transparent and colourless     ; but these are variations of the ele
ment itself, and not, as in the case of jargonium, modifications of its
compounds. So far as am aware, there
                            I                    indeed no substance which

shows strictly comparable facts.
    There cannot, then,     I think, be any doubt whatever that jargo
nium  is  not only     new elementary substance, but
                        a                                     also one likely

and hydrochloric acids, which left undissolved apparently pure zir-
conia that had passed into an imperfectly soluble state.          To the
solution so much ammonia was added as to give a very copious pre
cipitate, but yet to leave the solution with a very decided acid reac
tion.    After removing the precipitate, which was chiefly oxalate of
zirconia almost or quite free from jargonia, excess of ammonia was
added to the solution, and the washed precipitate digested in dilute
hydrochloric acid, to remove peroxide of iron. The insoluble por
tion must have been approximately pure oxalate of jargonia ; for it
gave the characteristic spectra described in remarkable perfection.
Though this method succeeded far better than I anticipated, I do
not yet understand the exact conditions requisite to ensure success,
and have been prevented by absence from home from making further
experiments.
    "Solar Radiation." By J. Park Harrison, M.A.
    In a communication which the author had the honour of making
to   the Royal Society in 1867*, it was shown, from observations of
the black- bulb thermometer and Herschel's actinometer, that maxi
mum effects of solar radiation occur at Greenwich, on the average,
some weeks after the summer solstice, and about two hours after
midday, when the atmosphere would appear to be charged with a
considerable amount of vapour.
    These results accord with the fact that the highest readings of the
solar thermometer are met with in India in districts of great relative
 humidity +, the explanation of the phenomenon being, as the author
ventured to suggest in the paper above alluded to, that an increase
of insolation is produced by radiation from cloud and visible vapour.
    During the two years which have elapsed since the spring of 1867,
whenever the state of the sky and other circumstances permitted,
 special observations have been made for the purpose of ascertaining
 with greater certainty the nature of the relation between insolation
and humidity.
    Before proceeding to state results, it will afford additional proof
that a connexion between the phenomena really exists, if a passage
in the appendix to a work by the late Principal of St. Andrews,
until very recently overlooked, is quoted in support of the fact. Mr.
Forbes, writing some years ago, employs much the same words that
were used in the paper above referred to: — "Cloudy weather, if the
 sun be not itself greatly obscured, apparently increases the effect of
                 "
solar radiation J.
    The action, however, does not appear to be confined to days on
which there is visible cloud ; for even on cloudless days (so called)
very high readings of solar radiation seem to be due to the presence

of opalescent vapour, which      can be easily detected if the hand or some
other screen is held for a few minutes before the sun.           .
     Thus, on May 2, 1868, at lh 30™<, solar radiation appearing to be
relatively intense, on raising a screen white glare was observed around
the sun, and the tint of the sky, which had previously appeared a
fair blue, was found, more especially in the south, to be very pale.
     But the most interesting result of this series of observations is the
discovery that an apparent increase of solar radiation occurs as the
sun enters a white cloud of sufficient tenuity to allow free passage for
its rays.
     In October 1867, at 2h, whilst attentively watching a solar thermo
meter, a sudden rise was observed to take place, upon which, the
sun being immediately screened, it was found that it had entered the
bright border of a cumulus.
     On May 1 1, 1868, at 22" 40m, as a very light cloud approached the
sun, which was shining in blue sky, the mercury rose 4°, and in
30 seconds 3° more as it entered the white cloud.
     On the same day, at 23h, the reading of the solar thermometer was
 101°F. when the sun was in the midst of cirri, but it fell in 3 mi
 nutes 9° when well free again ; then rose 6° as light cloud again
crossed it.     The air was perfectly still.
     On May 15, 1868, the highest reading of the solar thermometer
 for the day occurred at 2h 1 7m, just as the sun entered the skirts of
a cloud.
     On July 21, 1868, at 2\ the maximum of the day (128° F.) was
 reached when the sun was shining in a patch of pale sky surrounded
with white cumuli, some of which were within one or two diameters
of its disk.
     To mention one more example amongst numerous others which
 might be cited : on Aug. 3, 1868, at 0h 40m, under an apparently
clear sky, the solar thermometer registering 1 1 2°, and the tempera
 ture of shade 82°, in two minutes insolation increased to 125°, whilst
 the temperature of shade rose 0-3 only ; on examining the sky in
 the neighbourhood of the sun, white cirri were detected crossing its
disk.
     Light cloud and opalescent vapour having been thus found, when
 in the direction of the sun, to intensify the effects of solar radiation,
 a series of experiments was commenced with circular screens of va
 rious sizes, to discover, if possible, the distance to which the effects
 of bright glare and light vapoury cloud extended round the sun.
     The observations were made when the sun's altitude was between
 30 and 50 degrees.        All the screens were placed at a uniform dis
 tance of six inches from the bulb of a solar thermometer ^ in. in
 diameter, coated with China ink, and laid on a small piece of dark
 oak about two inches by ten iuches on grass*.               The bulb of the
    * Similar results were obtained when the solar thermometer was laid
                                                                        upon
short grass, in the afternoon, when the dew was oil' the ground.
     With the instrument freely suspended 6 in. aboTe the grass, the readings
showed a proportionate fall.

thermometer was not covered with an exhausted globe. The mean
results of the experiments were as follows : —
    1. A screen £ in. in diameter reduced the difference of the read
ings of the black-bulb thermometer and a thermometer in the shade,
four yards distant, by one-third.
    2. A screen 2\ ins. in diameter reduced the difference by two-
thirds.
    On reversing the experiment, converse results were obtained, e. g.
    The rays of the sun, after passing through a circular aperture
2j ins. in diameter in a 12-in. screen, were made to fall on the bulb
of the solar thermometer, when the readings were found to equal
in value those obtained when the instrument was entirely exposed*.
    And no difference was noticed when the black-bulb thermometer
was screened from the rest of the sky by a double cover of mill-board
placed tent-wise over it.
   Results of an equally negative kind were obtained in the case of
other experiments which were made with the object of detecting
heat in the light reflected from sky and cloud not in the direction
of the sun.
   A black-bulb thermometer, after having been placed for sometime
in a dark room, was then exposed to the sky, near a large French
window, facing S.E., the glass of which was clear, and had been care
fully cleaned, without any rise being perceptible. The sun, at an
altitude of about 40°, was shining brightly on white vapour and light
cirro-cumulit.
    Thermometers were also placed in the open air on the north side
of   the house, on a still day, exposed to half the sky when covered
with bright white clouds ; but the mercury stood at the same height
as in a dark passage on the same side of the buildingj.
    The same apparent absence of any direct heating-power in the
light reflected from the sky generally was shown in this as in the
previous series of experiments when the solar thermometer was
screened excepting in the direction of the sun.
    As respects the momentary increase of insolation which occurs in
connexion with bright vapour in the neighbourhood of the sun,
further experiment is required for the purpose of ascertaining whether
it is due to radiation or to reflection.
     Note. — An opportunity occurred  on the 7th of June of repeating
the experiments with screens at altitudes of the sun exceeding 50°.
The following results were obtained : —
   * In the above experiments, it is evident that the whole of the results were not
due to direct radiation or reflection.  Account must be taken of the greater or
less distance of the heated surface of the ground, and of the hot air in contact
with  it,from the bulb of the solar thermometer.
 t   Experiments were also tried with  a  7-inch lens, without result.
  %  The thermometer exposed to the sky would probably have stood lower
than the one in the house if the sky had been perfectly clear.

    ON THE LAWS OP INDUCTION.                BY MM.      JAMIN AND ROGER.
rPHE      experiments we are about to describe were arranged like those
  ¦-
      which are made on induction. A current interrupted at regular
intervals by a mercury contact-breaker traverses an inducing coil the
resistance of which is b ; in this is placed the induced coil, the resist
ance of which is /3 ; in the centre is a bundle of annealed iron wires.
The two ends of the inducing coil are connected with the two arma
tures of a Fizeau's condenser ; lastly, both the induced and the in
ducing coil may be lengthened by scales of varying resistance, which
we shall designate by 0 and t, and which may be increased from zero
to infinity.
   The peculiarity of our apparatus is that the coils, the soft iron, the
condensers, and the resistances 0 and t are immersed in an insulating
liquid (oil of turpentine or benzole) in separate vessels hermetically
closed and terminated by divided thermometric tubes. By means of
a levelling tube with a stopcock the liquid in these tubes may always
be brought to a fixed height ; each apparatus constitutes therefore a
thermorheometer. As its electrical motion creates a quantity of heat
proportional to its vis viva, the liquid receives this heat, and the ex
pansion measures it. We shall omit any details as to these experi
ments, and restrict ourselves to giving a resume of the facts.
   Induced current. — The induced coil is connected with the scale
of resistance 0, which varies from zero to infinity.             The quantities of
heat, C, C,, produced in the unit of time in this resistance and in this
coil are measured.        We may always write
                                  a             a
K  being the total duration of the passages of the inducing current

during one minute, 1 — a that of the breaks.  Calculating I's and I',',
we find them to be equal, and that they satisfy the relation

     Now, ifthe wire of the induced coil /3 and that of the resistance
were extended in a straight line so as to avoid induction, and if the
current of a battery were passed the electromotive force and resistance
of which were M and N, we should have a current of the real inten-
              M
sity                   ;   and       if it   were opened at regular               intervals in such a
          ^^^^0
manner that the duration of the passage were reduced                                        from    1   to a.
we should have a mean intensity

Further, the amounts of heat developed in the resistance                                           0 and     in
the coil /3 would be, according to Joule's law,
                                       C=eX2,               c=£T.

The       same would be the case if the currents were alternately in op
posite   directions.   Inverting this reasoning, we are led to identify
this hypothetical case with that of induction, and to formulate the
law of the induced current as follows.
    1 . The successive induced currents, although alternately in oppo
site directions and of varying intensity, have the same mean intensity
I' as if they proceeded from a battery with constant current ; 1' is
expressed by Ohm's law,

                                                        N+/3 + 0*
   2. The quantities of heat C and C which these currents develope
either in an external circuit 0 or in the coil are the same as those
which would be created in these resistances    this hypothetical bat     by /3,
tery.     and C are expressed by Joule's law,
              C

   3. The electromotive force M of these currents      far greater than           is
that of the inducing battery which sets the whole in action     and the                      ;
resistance       itself far more considerable than the resistance
                  N   is                                              of                                /3

   The experiment may                    be varied by placing the two coils in the
same vessel, and           measuring, on the one hand, the sum of the heats
created by the inducing and induced currents, and, on the other, that

     Condenser. — When the experiments are made without usingthe con
 denser, sparks are seen to pass . in the contact-breaker between the
 platinum point and the mercury.                       These are due to the extra current
 produced      at  each    breaking         of the  circuit;  its variations are indicated by
 the lustre and noise of these sparks.                          Now they are feeble if the
 resistance 0 added to the induced coil is small ; they increase
 with 0 to a maximum when 0=oo (that is, when the coil is open).
 Hence the extra current becomes small or increases with 6.
     These sparks have two inconveniences : first, they divide the
 mercury, make the alcohol turbid, and increase its conducting-power;
 then also they expend the heat of the pile. The condenser remedies
 these defects, annuls the sparks, prevents the turbidity of the liquid
 and the increase of its conductivity ; it also annuls the heat, which is
 transported from the cup, where it is not measurable, into the inte
 rior of the condenser, where it can be measured.
     The following is the working of the instrument.                          At the moment
 of rupture the extra current has two paths — one by the contact-
 breaker and the battery, the other by the condenser; this latter pre
 sents least resistance ; this current collects there in the form of two
 charges of high tension, positive and negative, which condense on
 the armatures as long as it lasts, and rccombine through the coil

when it has ceased, leaving in the apparatus the excess of the vis
viva which has brought them over that which they carry away with
them — that is to say, heat, like an elastic body which rebounds with
out rising to the height from which it fell.
   This heat will be proportional to the square of the mean intensity
of the extra current, and will measure it. We shall presently see
that it will be feeble if 0=0, that it will increase to a maximum for
0=oo (that is, if the bobbin is open). This is in fact what is proved
by experiment.
   The extra current is produced in the inducing coil as if it were a
battery ; in returning from the condenser it traverses afresh the wire
of this coil.  We must ask whether it produces heat.       It is easy to
answer this question.     Suppose the two coils enclosed in the same
vessel; they will be traversed by the inducing and the induced
currents, the intensities of which are 1 and                 I',

As the inductive force finds on this side an increasing resistance,                         it

and in the soft iron ; for this is the effect of this extra current.
   Inducing Current. — It is clear that the inducing current transfers
the heat into the induced wire, the condenser, and the iron. We are
utterly ignorant of the manner in which this transfer is accomplished.
It might be that the inducing current preserved its intensity, and
lost some of its heat by radiation.         But this is not the case : Ohm's
formula ceases to be applicable ; the current loses force ; it preserves
the heat which corresponds to its reduced intensity I (that is to say,
a heat equal to the product of Is into the resistance r) ; but it has
transmitted around            by   it,

established, the heat corresponding to its lost intensity.
     Now, in proportion as increases, the heat increases in the con

           ON THE CALORIFIC        POWER OP THE LUNAR RAYS,
                            BY M. H. MARIE-DAVY.
     Older experiments made by concentrating, through the aid of
 mirrors or of lenses, the light of the moon on the most delicate ther
 mometers, gave no appreciable result.          Melloni was the first to ob
 serve any heating, by concentrating the lunar rays on the face of
 the pile by means of a glass lens of 3 feet aperture.
     Mr. Piazzi Smyth, in the scientific expedition which he undertook
 in 1856 to the Peak of Teneriffe, confirmed Melloni's experiments.
 Piazzi Smyth collected the rays directly on the pile, the face of
 which was provided with the ordinary cone of polished metal.
 Although the moon was very low, the effect of its rays was a third of
 that of the rays of a wax candle placed at a distance of 4-75 metres from
 the pile.    A candle placed at the same distance from my pile gave
 a deflection of 17°,3 without the introduction of the cone.             The
 direct rays of the moon would therefore have produced a deflection
 of 5c-8, corresponding to 0°-00075, if it is possible to compare the
 flames of candles at such long intervals of time and place.
     Lord Rosse, working with a reflector of 3 feet aperture, obtained
 still more marked results. His thermopile had been previously gra
 duated by being exposed in front of blackened surfaces at definite
temperatures.        Lord Rosse concludes from his results that the
moon's heat-radiation equals that of a surface heated to 182° C.
    In a Note, of February 18, 1869, on the Heat received from the
Stars by the Earth, Mr. Huggins, while establishing the fact of heat
from the stars Sirius, Pollux, Regulus, Arcturus, announces that
his observations on the full moon were not concordant.               On one
night   a sensible  effect was  produced   ; on others, the indications were
excessively   feeble  and  were  not  uniform  enough   to warrant  any con
fidence being placed in them.         Mr. Huggins worked with a refractor
of 8 inches, the lenses of which stop almost entirely the obscure
heat-rays of the moon, while Lord Rosse's reflector reflects them like
the luminous rays.
    The moon sends us three kinds of heat-rays — the luminous and ob
scure rays of the sun reflected or diffused by it, and the rays emanating

                   Intelligence and Miscellaneous       Articles.           79
 directly from its heated surface. These three kinds of rays are
 combined in Mr. Piazzi Smyth's and Lord Rosse's experiments ;               I
 proposed to myself to isolate them as much as possible, and to value
 them individually, commencing with the luminous rays.
    In a preliminary experiment made by means of a differential air-
 thermometer graduated by comparison with a very delicate mercurial
 thermometer,      I sought the first limit of the phenomenon I wished
 to measure.        The lunar rays concentrated on one of the bulbs
 of the thermometer by means of an old lens of about 3 feet aperture
 (belonging to the Imperial Observatory) produced no appreciable
 effect on the instrument, each division of which corresponds to
 0o-0043.       Hence it was necessary to go much further.
    I had recourse to the thermopile*.          An astatic galvanometer with
 long   needles,   which   I owe to the  kindness   of M. Ruhmkorff and of
 the Ecole Normale, has enabled me to ascertain almost the hundred
 thousandth of a degree : one division of the galvanometer is equal to
 0°'00013 ; and the tenth of a division can be read off.
    The pile was placed behind the ocular of projection of an equatorial
of 9 inches, placed in the garden of the Imperial Observatory.             The
distance from the pile to the ocular was such that the pencil of lunar
rays just covered the entire face of the pile. The apparatus, more
over, was protected against external influences by a double metallic
envelope, and by four or five folds of black cloth.
    The telescope was pointed to the moon so that the image of
the satellite given by the seeker covered a circle previously traced
on a screen fixed to the apparatus ; and the regulator of the equato
rial being set in motion, the object-glass was, during a definite num
ber of seconds, alternately opened and shut by a stop, the least dis
turbance in the direction of the telescope producing a displacement
of the needle.       Each deflection observed when the stop was removed
or replaced was compared with the mean of the two observations im
 mediately before and after. Thus was avoided, as much as possible,
the influence of magnetic perturbations, which are always great under
an iron cupola.        The following Table contains the mean of the
results of each series, opposite to the mean of the times of observa
tion.      The last column translates these deflections into decimals of a
thermometer degree : —

   The ratio of the surface of the object-glass to the illuminated sur
face of the pile was about 230.           If we assume that three-fourths of
the light which falls on the object-glass reaches the pile, the power
of concentration of the telescope is equal to about 247. The deflec
tion obtained on the 20th would then correspond to twelve millionths
of a degree for the direct luminous rays of the moon. This is about
the sixtieth part of the result obtained by Mr. Piazzi Smyth on the
Peak of Teneriffe, working with the whole of the lunar rays.
   The luminous heat of the moon increases rapidly with the phase ;
but its height and the condition of the sky, even without cloud,
greatly affect its intensity. — Comptes Rendus, October 25, 1869.

Ocean-currents in relation to the Distribution       of Heat    over the Globe.
HHHE       absolute Heating -power of Ocean-currents. — There is
        perhaps no physical agent concerned in the distribution
of heat over the surface of the globe whose influence has been
so much underrated as that of ocean-currents.       This is no doubt
owing   to the  fact that although  a considerable amount    of atten
tion  has  been bestowed in ascertaining the surface-temperature,
direction, and general influence of ocean-currents, still little or
nothing has been done in the way of determining the absolute
amount of heat or of cold conveyed by them, or the absolute in
crease or decrease of temperature, as the case may be, which
must result from the heat or cold conveyed.
   The modern method of determining the amount of heat-effects
in absolute measure      is,
                          no doubt, destined to cast new light on all
questions connected with climate, as      has done and

in every department of physics where energy, under the form of
heat,    the phenomenon under consideration.
        is                                         But this method
has scarcely been attempted yet in questions of meteorology;
and owing to the complicated nature of the phenomena with
which the meteorologist has generally to deal, its application
will very often be found practically impossible.      Nevertheless             it
is  particularly suitable to all questions regarding the direct
thermal effects of currents, whatever the nature of those currents
may happen to be.

82         Mr.   J. Croll  on Ocean-currents in relation to
    In the application of the method to an ocean-current, the two
most important elements which we require as data are the volume
of the stream and its mean temperature.          But although we know
something of the temperature of most of the great currents of
the ocean, yet, with the exception of the Gulf-stream, little is
known regarding the volume of any of them.
    Extensive and accurate observations have been made on the
breadth, depth, and temperature of the Gulf-stream by the
United-States Coast Survey.         In the memoirs and charts of the
Survey, cross sections of the stream at various places are given,
showing its breadth and depth at those places, and also the tem
perature of the water from the surface downwards to the bottom.
We are thus enabled to determine pretty correctly the mean
temperature of the stream.        And knowing its mean velocity at
any given section, we have likewise a means of determining the
number of cubic feet of water passing through the section in a
given time.     But although we can obtain with tolerable accuracy
the mean temperature, unfortunately observations regarding the
velocity of the water at all depths have not been made at any par
ticular section.    Consequently we have no means of estimating
so accurately as we should have wished the volume of the cur
rent.    However, as we know the surface-velocity of the water at
places  where   some of the sections were taken, we are thus enabled
to make at least a rough estimate of the volume of the stream.
    From an examination of the published sections some years
ago*, I came to the conclusion that the total quantity of water
conveyed by the stream is probably equal to that of a stream 50
miles broad and 1000 feet deept, flowing at the rate of four
 miles an hour, and that the mean temperature of the entire mass
of moving water is not under 65° at the moment of leaving the
Gulf.    I think we are warranted to conclude that the stream,
before it returns from its northern journey, is on an average
cooled down to at least 40° ; consequently it loses 25° of heat.
Each cubic foot of water, therefore, in this case carries from the
tropics for distribution upwards of 1 500 units of heat, or 1,158,000
foot-pounds. According to the above estimate of the size and
velocity of the stream, 5,575,680,000,000 cubic feet of water
 are conveyed from the Gulf per hour, or 133,816,320,000,000
 cubic feet daily.    Consequently the total quantity of heat trans-

   t The Gulf-stream at the narrowest place examined by the Coast Sur
vey, and the place where its velocity was greatest, was found to be over
30 statute miles broad and 1950 feet deep.    But we must not suppose this
represents all the warm water which is received by the Atlantic from the
equator ; a great mass of the water flows into the Atlantic without passing
through the Straits of Florida.

                t/ie Distributioa of Heat      over the Globe.             88
ferred from the equatorial regions per day by the stream amounts
to 154,959,300,000,000,000,000 foot-pounds.
     This estimate of the volume of the stream is considerably less
than that given both by Captain Maury and by Sir John Her-
schel.     Captain Maury considers the Gulf-stream equal to a
stream 32 miles broad and 1200 feet deep, flowing at the rate of
five knots an hour (Physical Geography of the Sea,
                                                                  § 24, 6th
edition). This gives 6,165,700,000,000 cubic feet per hour as
the quantity of water conveyed by this stream.              Sir John Her-
schel's estimate is still greater.           He considers it equal to a
stream 30 miles broad and 2200 feet deep, flowing at the rate
of four miles an hour (Physical Geography, § 54). This makes
the quantity 7,359,900,000,000 cubic feet per hour.
     From observations made by Sir John Herschel and by M.
Pouillet on the direct heat of the sun, it is found that, were no
heat absorbed by the atmosphere, about 83 foot-pounds per
second would fall upon a square foot of surface placed at right
angles to the sun's rays*.        Mr. Meech estimates that the quan
tity of heat cut off by the atmosphere is equal to about 22 per
cent. of the total amount received from the sun.               M. Pouillet
 estimates the loss at 24 per cent.           Taking  the former   estimate,
64*74 foot-pounds per second will therefore be the quantity of
 heat falling on a square foot of the earth's surface when the sun
 is in the zenith.     And were the sun to remain stationary iu the
 zenith for twelve hours, 2,796,768 foot-pounds would fall upon
the surface.
     It can be shown that the total amount of heat received upon
 a unit surface on the equator during the twelve hours from sun
 rise till sunset at the time of the equinoxes is to the total amount
 which would be received upon that surface, were the sun to re
 main in the zenith during those twelve hours, as the diameter of
 a circle to half its circumference, or as 1 to l-5708.          It follows,
 therefore, that a square foot of surface on the equator receives
 from the sun at the time of the equinoxes 1,780,474 foot-pounds
 daily, and a square mile 49,636,750,000,000 foot-pounds daily.
 But this amounts to only         , a / 8 7 0  Part °f tne quantity of heat
 daily conveyed from the tropics by the Gulf-stream. In other
 words, the Gulf-stream conveys as much heat as is received from
 the sun by 3,121,870 square miles at the equator.              The amount
 thus conveyed is equal to all the heat which falls upon the globe
 within 63 miles on each side of the equator.             According to cal
  culations made by Mr. Meecht, the annual quantity of heat re
  ceived by a unit surface on the frigid zone, taking the mean

81.         Mr.   J. Croll  on Ocean-currents   in relation to
of the whole zone, is        5
                               of that received at the equator    ; con
sequently the quantity of heat conveyed by the Gulf-stream in
one year is equal to the heat which falls on an average on
6,873,800 square miles of the arctic regions. The frigid zone or
arctic regions contain 8,130,000 square miles.         There is actually,
therefore, nearly as much heat transferred from tropical regions
by the Gulf-stream as is received from the sun by the entire
arctic regions, the quantity conveyed by the stream to that
received from the sun by those regions being as 15 to 18.
    But we have been assuming in our calculations that the per
centage of heat absorbed by the atmosphere is no greater in polar
regions than it is at the equator, which is not the case.          If  we
 make    due allowance for the extra amount absorbed in polar
 regions in consequence of the obliqueness of the sun's rays, the
 total quantity of heat conveyed by the Gulf-stream will probably
 nearly equal the amount received from the sun by the entire
arctic regions.
    If we compare the quantity of heat conveyed by the Gulf-
 stream with that conveyed by means of aerial currents, the result
 is equally startling.     The density of air to that of water is as 1
 to 770, and its specific heat to that of water is as 1 to 4-2 ; con
 sequently the same amount of heat that would raise 1 cubic foot
 of water 1 ° would raise 770 cubic feet of air 4°,2, or 3234 cubic
 feet 1°.   The quantity of heat conveyed by the Gulf- stream is
 therefore equal to that which would be conveyed by a current of air
 3234 times the volume of the Gulf-stream, at the same tem
 perature and moving with the same velocity.          Taking, as before,
 the width of the stream at 50 miles, and its depth at 10C0 feet,
 and its velocity at 4 miles an hour, it follows that, in order to
 convey an equal amount of heat from the tropics by means of an
 aerial current, it would be necessary to have a current about 1
 mile deep, and at the temperature of 65°, blowing at the rate of
                                                                         J
 four miles an hour from every part of the equator over the north
 ern hemisphere towards the pole.         If its velocity were equal to
 that of a good sailing-breeze, which Sir John Herschel states to
 be about twenty-one miles an hour, the current would require to
 be above 1200 feet deep.       A greater quantity of heat is probably
 conveyed by the Gulf-stream alone from the tropical to the tem
 perate and arctic regions than by all the aerial currents which
flow from the equator.
    We are apt, on the other hand, to overestimate the amount
of the heat conveyed from tropical regions to us by means of
 aerial currents.    The only currents which flow from the equa
torial regions are the upper currents, or anti-trades as they are
called.    But it is not possible that much heat can be conveyed
directly by them.      The upper currents of the trade-winds, even

               the   Distribution of Heat         over the Globe.             85
at the equator, are nowhere below the snowline; they must
therefore lie in a region actually below the freezing-point.          In
fact, if those currents were warm, they would elevate the snow
line above themselves.     The heated air rising off the hot burn
ing ground    at the equator, after ascending a few miles, becomes
exposed to the intense cold of the upper regions of the atmo
sphere ; it then very soon loses all its heat, and returns from
the equator much colder than it went thither.          It is impossible             ^
that we can receive any heat directly from the equatorial regions
by means of aerial currents.      It is perfectly true that the south
west wind, to which we owe so much of our warmth in this
country, is a continuation of the anti-trade ; but the heat which
this wind brings to us is not derived from the equatorial regions.
This will appear evident, if we but reflect that, before the upper
current descends to the snowline after leaving the equator, it
must traverse a space of at least 2000 miles ; and to perform
this long journey several days will be required.        During all this
time the air is in a region below the freezing-point; and it is
perfectly obvious that by the time it begins to descend it must
have acquired the temperature of the region in which it has been
travelling.
   If such be the case, it is evident that a wind whose tempera
ture is below 32° could never warm a country such as ours,
where the temperature does not fall below 38° or 39°.            The heat
of our south-west winds is derived, not directly from        the equator,
but from the warm water of the Atlantic — in fact from the Gulf-
stream.    The upper current acquires its heat after it descends to
the earth.     There is one way, however, whereby heat is indi
rectly conveyed from the equator by the anti-trades ; that                    is,
in the form of aqueous vapour.        In the formation of one pound
of water from aqueous vapour, as Professor Tyndall strikingly
remarks,   a quantity of heat       given out sufficient to melt five
                                           is
pounds of cast iron*.      It must, however, be borne in mind that
the greater part of the moisture of the south-west and west
winds     isderived from the ocean in temperate regions.              The
upper current receives the greater part of its moisture after                 it
descends to the earth, whilst the moisture received at the equator
is    great part condensed and falls as rain in those regions.
     in
   These, as well as many other considerations which might be
stated, lead to the conclusion that, in order to raise the mean
temperature of the whole earth, water should be placed along the
equator, and not land, as         generally believed.

86            Mr.  J.  Croll on Ocean-currents     in relation  to
means of the upper currents of the trades ; for the heat conveyed
by conduction along the solid crust, if any, can have no sensible
effect on climate.       But these currents, as we have just seen, are
ill adapted for conveying heat.
    The surface of the ground at the equator becomes intensely
heated by the sun's rays.         This causes it to radiate off its heat
more rapidly into space than a surface of water heated under the
same conditions.         Again, the air in contact with the hot ground
becomes also more rapidly heated than in contact with water,
and consequently the ascending current of air carries off a greater
amount of heat.        But were the heat thus carried away transferred
by means of the upper currents to high latitudes and there
employed to warm the earth, then it might to a considerable
extent compensate for the absence of ocean-currents,                  and in
 this  case   land  at  the  equator might     be   nearly  as well  adapted
 as water for raising the temperature of the whole earth.                But
 such is not the case ; for the heat carried up by the ascending
 current at the equator is not employed in warming the earth,
 but is thrown off into the cold stellar space above. This ascend
 ing current, instead of being employed in warming the globe, is
 in reality one of the most effectual means that the earth has of
 getting quit of the heat received from the sun, and of thus
 maintaining a much lower temperature than it would otherwise
 possess.     It is in the equatorial regions that the earth loses as
 well as gains the greater part of its heat ; so that, of all places,
 here ought to be placed the substance best adapted for pre
 venting the dissipation of the earth's heat into space, in order
 to raise the general temperature of the earth.                Water, of all
  substances in nature, seems to possess this quality to the great
  est extent ; and, besides, it is a fluid, and therefore adapted by
  means of currents to carry the heat which it receives from the
  sun to every region of the globe*.
     These results show (although they have reference to only one
  stream) that the general influence of ocean-currents on the dis
  tribution of heat over the surface of the globe must be very great.
  If the quantity of heat transferred from the equatorial regions
  by the Gulf-stream alone is nearly equal to all the heat received
  from the sun by the arctic regions, then how enormous must be
  the quantity conveyed from the equatorial regions by all the
  ocean-currents put together !

nave doubled the actual volume of the stream ; 2nd, that I have
not taken into account the great length of time that the water
requires in order to circulate, and the interference that it has to
encounter in its passage.          Although    I feel satisfied that the
actual quantity of water conveyed from the Gulf of Mexico is as
great, if not greater than what I have estimated it to be, yet the
influence of the stream on climate, as we shall presently see, is
so enormous, that for our present purposes it matters little
whether we adopt Mr. Findlay's estimate or mine as the correct
one.
    In this case I shall adopt Mr. Findlay's estimate, and take the
volume of the stream at one-half what              I
                                                  have concluded it to
be.     The quantity of heat conveyed would still be equal to all
the heat received from the sun within 31^ miles on each side
of the equator, or equal to nearly one-half of the entire heat
received by the arctic regions.
   I   may here briefly consider the second objection, as it will
afford an opportunity of referring to some important conside
rations bearing on the mode by which the heat of ocean-currents
is distributed over the land.
    The objection     is,thata  stream so comparatively small as the
Gulf-stream, after spreading out over such             large area of the
                                                            a
Atlantic, and moving so slowly across to the shores of Europe,
losing heat all the way, would not be able to produce any very
sensible influence on the climate of Europe.
 I    am unable to perceive the force of this objection. Why, the
very efficiency of the stream as      a  heating- agent necessarily de
pends upon the slowness of its motion.             Did the Gulf-stream
move as rapidly along its whole course as            does in the Straits
                                                       it
of Florida,  it   could produce no sensible effect on the climate of
Europe. It does not require much consideration to perceive
this.     (1) If the stream during its course continued narrow,
deep, and rapid,      it  would have little opportunity of losing its
heat, and the water would carry back to the tropics the heat
which  it    ought to have given off in the temperate and polar
regions.      (2) The Gulf-stream does not heat the shores of Europe
by   direct radiation.     Our island, for example,        not heated
                                                                is         by
radiation from    a  stream of warm water flowing along its shores.
The Gulf-stream heats our island indirectly             by
                                                      heating the winds
which blow over       it to our shores.
    The anti-trades, or upper return-currents, as we have seen,
bring no heat from the tropical regions.          After traversing some
2000 miles in         aregion of extreme cold they descend on the
Atlantic as cold current, and there absorb the heat and moisture
            a
which they carry to north-eastern Europe.              Those aerial cur
rents derive their heat from the Gulf-stream, or                 it
                                                                if    is

  88         Mr.  J. Croll    on Ocean-cwrents    in relation to
 from the warm       water poured      into the Atlantic     by the    Gulf-
 stream.
     How, then, are these winds heated by the warm water ? The
 air is heated in two ways, viz. by direct radiation from the water,
 and by contact with the water.           Now, if the Gulf-stream con
 tinued a narrow and deep current during its entire course similar
  to what it is at the Straits of Florida, it could have little or no
 opportunity of communicating its heat to the air either by radia
 tion or by contact.      If the stream was only about 40 or 50
  miles in breadth, the aerial particles in their passage across it
 would not be in contact with the warm water more than an hour
 or two. Also the number of the particles in contact with the water,
 owing to the narrowness of the stream, would be small, and
 there would therefore be little opportunity for the air becoming
 heated by contact.       The same also holds true in regard to radia
 tion. The more we widen the stream and increase its area,
 the more we increase its radiating surface ; and the greater the
 radiating surface, the greater is the quantity of heat thrown off.
 But this is not all ; the number of aerial particles heated by ra
 diation increases iu proportion to the area of the radiating sur
 face ; consequently the wider the area over which the waters of
 the Gulf-stream are spread, the more effectual will the stream be
 as a heating-agent.       And, again, in order that a very wide area
 of the Atlantic may be covered with the warm waters of the
 stream, slowness of motion is essential.
     Mr. Findlay says that fully one-half of the Gulf-stream passes
 eastward and southward from the banks of Newfoundland, and
 supposes that it is only the northern portion of the current that
 can be effectual in raising the temperature of Europe.              But it
 appears  to me  that  it  is  to this south-eastern portion    of the  cur
 rent, and not to the northern, that we, in this country, are
 chiefly indebted for our heat.         The south-west winds, to which
 we owe our heat, derive their temperature from this south-eastern
portion which flows away in the direction of the Azores.                The
 south-west winds which blow          over the  northern    portion  of  the
 current which flows past our island up into the arctic seas cannot
possibly cross this country, but will go to heat Norway and
Northern Europe.          The northern portion of the stream, no
doubt, protects us from the ice of Greenland by warming the
north-west winds which come to us from that cold region.
    Mr. Buuhan, Secretary of the Scottish Meteorological Society,
has shown* that in a large tract of the Atlantic between lati
tudes 20° and 40° N., the mean pressure of the atmosphere is
greater than in any other place on the globe.             To the west of

pressure amounts to 30'2 inches, while between Iceland and
Spitzbergen it is only 29'6, a lower mean pressure than is found
in any other place on the northern hemisphere.          There must con
sequently, he concludes, be a general tendency in the air to flow
from the former to the latter place along the earth's surface.
But the air in moving from the lower to the higher latitudes
tends to take a north-easterly direction, and in this case will
pass over our island in its course.        But it so happens that this
region of high pressure is situated in the very path of the south
eastern branch of the Gulf-stream.             Consequently the winds
blowing   from   this region   of maximum    pressure will carry directly
to Britain the heat of the Gulf-stream.
   It is essential to the heating of our island, as well as the south
ern portion of Europe, that a very large proportion of the waters
of the Gulf-stream should spread over the surface of the Atlantic
and never pass up into the arctic regions, as we shall presently see.
   But even according to Mr. Findlay's own theory, it is to the
south-west wind, heated by the warm waters of the Atlantic, that
we are indebted for the high temperature of our climate. But he
seems to be under the impression that the Atlantic would be
able to supply the necessary heat independently             of the Gulf-
stream.     This, I presume, is the fundamental error of all those
who doubt the efficiency of the stream.           It is a mistake, how
ever, into which one is very apt to fall who does not adopt the
more rigid method of determining heat-results in absolute mea
sure.    When we apply this method, we find that the Atlantic
without the aid of such a current as the Gulf-stream would be
wholly unable to supply the necessary amount of heat to the
south-west winds.
   The quantity of heat conveyed by the Gulf-stream, as we have
seen, is equal to all the heat received from the sun by 3,121,870
square miles at the equator.         Mr. Findlay, however, as has been
stated, thinks that      I   have doubled the actual volume of the
stream.     Assuming that I have done so, the amount of heat
carried by the stream would still be equal to all the heat re
ceived from the sun by 1,560,935 square miles at the equator.
The mean annual quantity of heat received from the sun by the
temperate regions per unit surface is to that received by the
equator as 9-83 to 12*.            Consequently the quantity of heat
conveyed by    the   stream,    taking  Mr Findlay's estimate of its
volume, is equal to all    the heat received from the sun by2,062,960
square miles of the temperate regions.           The total area of the
Atlantic from the latitude of the Straits of Florida, 200 miles
north of the tropic of Cancer, up to the Arctic Circle, including
also the German Ocean, is about 8,500,000 square miles.               In

   90           Mr.   J.  Croll on Ocean-currents    in relation to
   this case the quantity of heat carried by the Gulf-stream into
   the Atlantic through the Straits of Florida, to that received by
   this entire area from the sun, is as 1 to 4*12, or in round num
   bers as 1 to 4.       It therefore follows that one-fifth of all the heat
   possessed by the waters of the Atlantic over that area, even
   supposing that they absorb every ray that falls upon them, is
   derived from the Gulf-stream.           Would those who call in question
   the efficiency     of   the  Gulf-stream be willing to admit that a
   decrease of one-fourth in the total amount of heat received
  from the sun, over the entire area of the Atlantic from within
  200 miles of the tropical zone up to the arctic region, would
  not sensibly affect the climate of Northern Europe ?                 If they
  would     not    willingly   admit   this, why, then, contend that the
   Gulf-stream does not affect climate ? for the stoppage of the
   Gulf-stream, taking it at Mr. Findlay's estimate, would deprive
  the Atlantic of 77,479,650,000,000,000,000 foot-pounds of
  energy in the form of heat per day, a quantity equal to one-fourth
  of all the heat received from the sun by that area.
       How much, then, of the temperature of the south-west winds
  derived from the water of the Atlantic is due to the Gulf-
  stream ?
      Were the sun extinguished, the temperature over the whole
  earth would sink to nearly that of stellar space, which, according
  to the investigations of Sir John Herschel* and of M. Pouillett,
  is not above — 239° F.           Were the earth possessed of no atmo
  sphere,    the  temperature    of its surface would sink to exactly that
  of space, or to that indicated by a thermometer exposed to no
^other heat-influence than that of radiation from the stars. But
  the presence of the atmospheric envelope would slightly modify
  the conditions of things ; for the heat from the stars (which of
  course constitutes what is called the temperature of space)
  would, like the sun's heat, pass more freely through the atmo
  sphere than the heat radiated back from the earth, and there
  would in consequence of this be an accumulation of heat on the
  earth's surface.       The temperature would therefore stand a little
  higher than that of space ; or, in other words, it would stand a
 little higher than it would otherwise do were the earth exposed in
  space to the direct radiation of the stars without the atmospheric
 envelope.       But, for reasons which will presently be stated, we
 may in the mean time, till further light is cast upon this matter,
 take —239° F. as probably not far from what would be the
 temperature of the earth's surface were the sun extinguished.

the Atlantic at, say, 56°*.           Then 239° + 56°=295° represents
the number of degrees of rise due to the heat which it receives.
In other words, it takes all the heat that the Atlantic receives
to maintain its temperature 295° above the temperature of space.
Stop the Gulf-stream, and the Atlantic would be deprived of
one-fifth of the heat which it possesses. Then, if it takes five parts
of heat to maintain a temperature of 295° above that of space,
the four parts which would remain after the stream was stopped
would only be able to maintain a temperature of four-fifths of
 295° or 236° above that of space : the stoppage of the Gulf-
 stream would therefore deprive the Atlantic of an amount of                    \Jf}± _ -j
 heat which would be sufficient to maintain its temperature 59°                    §T
 above what it would otherwise be, did it depend alone upon the
 heat received directly from the sun. It does not, of course, follow
 that the Gulf-stream actually maintains the temperature 59°
 above what it would otherwise be were there no ocean-currents,
 because the actual heating-effect of the stream is neutralized to
 a very considerable extent by cold currents from the arctic regions.               0
 But 59° of rise represents its actual power ; consequently 59°,               3  7
 minus the lowering effect of the cold currents, represents the
 actual rise. What the rise may amount to at any particular
 place must be determined by other means.
     This method of calculating how much the temperature of the
 earth's surface would rise or fall from an increase or a decrease
 in the absolute amount of heat received is that adopted by Sir
 John Herschel in his ' Outlines of Astronomy/ § 369a.
     About three years ago, in an article in the ' Reader/           I endea
 voured to show that this method is not rigidly correct.               It has
 been shown from the experiments of Dulong and Petit, Dr. Bal
 four Stewart, Professor Draper, and others, that the rate at which
  a body radiates its heat off into space is not directly propor
 tionate to its absolute temperature.           The rate at which a body
  loses its heat as its temperature rises increases more rapidly than
  the temperature.         As a body rises in temperature the rate at
  which it radiates off its heat increases ; but the rate of this in
  crease is not uniform, but increases with the                temperature.
  Consequently the temperature is not lowered in proportion to
  the decrease of the sun's heat.           But at the comparatively low
  temperature      with   which  we    have  at present to deal, the error
  resulting from assuming the decrease of temperature to be pro
  portionate to the decrease of heat would not be great.
     It may be observed, however, that the experiments referred to
     * The mean temperature of the Atlantic between the tropics and the
  arctic circle, according to Admiral FitzRoy's chart, is about 60°.    But he
  assigns far too high a temperature for latitudes above 50°. It is probable
  that 56° is not far from the truth.

   92         Mr.  J. Croll  on Ocean-currents     in relation to
   were made on solids; but, from certain results arrived at by Dr.
   Balfour Stewart, it would seem that the radiation of a material
  particle may be proportionate to its absolute temperature.           This
  physicist found that the radiation of a thick plate of glass in
  creases more rapidly than that of a thin plate as the temperature
  rises, and that, if we go on continually diminishing the thickness
  of the plate whose radiation at different temperatures we are
  ascertaining, we find that as it grows thinner and thinner the
  rate at which it radiates off its heat as its temperature rises be
  comes less and less.     In other words, as the plate grows thinner
  and thinner its rate of radiation becomes more and more pro
  portionate to its absolute temperature.         And we cau hardly re
  sist the conviction that if we could possibly go on diminishing
  the thickness of the plate till we reached a film so thin as to
  embrace but only one particle in its thickness, its rate of radia
  tion would be proportionate to its temperature.              Dr. Balfour
  Stewart has very ingeniously suggested the probable reason why
  the rate of radiation of thick plates increases with rise of tem
  perature more rapidly than that of thin.            It is this : all sub
  stances are more diathermanous for heat of high temperatures
 than for heat of low temperatures.            When a body is at a low
  temperature,   we  may suppose     that  only the exterior rows of par
  ticles supply the radiation, the heat from the interior particles
 being all stopped by the exterior ones, the substance being very
 opaque for heat of low temperature ; while at a high tempera
 ture we may imagine that part of the heat from the interior
 particles is allowed to pass, thereby swelling the total radiation.
 But as the plate becomes thinner and thinner, the obstructions
 to interior radiation become less and less, and as these obstruc
 tions are greater for radiation at low temperatures than for ra
 diation at high temperatures, it necessarily follows that, by re
 ducing the thickness of the plate, we assist radiation at low tem
 peratures more than we do at high.
     In a gas, where each particle may be assumed to radiate by
itself, and where the particles stand at a considerable distance
 from one another, the obstruction to interior radiation must be
far less than in a solid.       In this case the rate at which a gas
radiates off its heat as its temperature rises must increase more
slowly than that of a solid substance.          In other words, its rate
of radiation must correspond more nearly to its absolute tem
perature than that of a solid.        If this be the case, a reduction in
the    amount  of heat  received  from    the sun, owing to an increase
of his distance, should tend to produce a greater lowering
effect on the temperature of the air than it does on the tempera
ture of the solid ground.        But as the temperature of our cli
mate is determined by the temperature of the air, it must fol

                  the      Distribution of Heat    over the Globe.                    93
low that the error of assuming that the decrease of temperature
would be proportionate to the decrease in the intensity of the
sun's heat may not be great.
   It may be noticed here, although it does not bear directly on
this point, that although the air in a room, for example, or at
the earth's surface is principally cooled by convection rather than
by radiation, it is by radiation alone that the earth's atmo
sphere parts with its heat to stellar space ; and this is the chief
matter with which we are at present concerned.                 Air, like
all other gases, is a bad radiator ; and this tends to protect it
from being cooled to such an extent as it would otherwise be,
were it a good radiator like solids.      True, it is also a bad ab
sorber ; but as it is cooled by radiation into space, and heated,
not altogether by absorption, but to a very large extent by con
vection, it on the whole gains its heat more easily than it loses
it, and consequently must stand at higher temperature than
                                               a                                      it
would do were       heated alone

which suppositions        probably true.
                             is             The probability         ven  is, I
ture to presume, that the temperature of space           not very much
                                                              is
above absolute zero.      At the time when these investigations into
the probable temperature of space were made, at least as r< gards
that   by Pouillet, the modern science of heat had no existence,
and little or nothing was then known with certainty regarding ab
solute zero. In this case the whole matter would require to be re
considered.     The result of such au investigation in all probability
would be to assigna lower temperature to stellarspace than —239°.
    Taking all these various considerations into account,           pro  it    is
 bable that      we adopt — 239° as the temperature of space, we
                 if
 shall not be far from the truth in assuming that the absolute
 temperature of place above that of space
                      a                            proportionate to the

              Mr. J. Croll  on Ocean-currents     in relation to
                                                              37*
    We may, therefore, in this case conclude that 59° of rise is
probably not very far from the truth as representing the influ
ence of the Gulf-stream.        The Gulf-stream, instead of producing
little or no effect, produces an effect far greater than is gene
rally supposed.
     Our island has a mean annual temperature of about 12° above
the normal due to its latitude.        This excess of temperature has
been justly attributed to the influence of the Gulf-stream.             But
it is singular how this excess should have been taken as the
measure of the rise resulting from the influence of the stream.
These figures only represent the number of degrees that the
mean normal temperature of our island stands above what is
called the normal temperature of the latitude.
     The way Professor Dove constructed his Tables of normal tem
perature was as follows : — He took the temperature of thirty-
six equidistant points on every ten degrees of latitude.               The
mean temperature of these thirty-six points he calls in each case
the normal temperature of the parallel.            The excess above the
normal merely represents how much the stream raises our tem
perature above the mean of all places on the same latitude, but
it affords us no information regarding the absolute rise pro
duced.       In the Pacific, as well as in the Atlantic, there are im
mense masses of water flowing from the tropical to the tempe
rate regions.      Now, unless we know how much of the normal
temperature of a latitude is due to ocean-currents, and how much
to the direct heat of the sun, we could not possibly, from Pro
fessor Dove's Tables, form the most distant conjecture as to how
 much of our temperature is derived from the Gulf-stream.               The
 overlooking of this fact has led to a general misconception re
 garding the positive influence of the Gulf-stream on tempera
ture.    The 12° marked in Tables of normal temperature do not
 represent the absolute effect of the stream, but merely how
much the stream raises the temperature of our country above
the mean of all places on the same latitude.            Other places have
their temperature raised by ocean-currents as well as this country;
only the Gulf-stream produces a rise of several degrees over and
above that produced by other streams in the same latitude.
    At present there is a difference merely of 80° between the
mean temperature of the equator and the poles*; but were each
part of the globe's surface to depend alone upon the direct heat
which it receives from the sun, there ought, according to theory,
to be a difference of more than 200°^           The annual quantity of
    * The mean
                  temperature of the equator, according to Dove, is 79°'7.
and that of the north pole 2° "3. But as there is of course some uncertainty
regarding the actual mean temperature of the poles, we may take the dif
ference in round numbers at 80°,

                the   Distribution of Heat   over the Globe.       95
  heat received at the equator to that received at the poles, sup
  posing the proportionate quantity absorbed by the atmosphere
  to be the same in both cases, is as 12 to 4-98, or, say, as 12 to
  5.    Consequently, if the temperatures of the equator and the
  poles be taken as proportionate to the absolute amount of heat
  received from the sun, then the temperature of the equator
  above that of space must be to that of the poles above that of
  space as 12 to 5.      What ought, therefore, to be the tempera
  tures of the equator and the poles, did each place depend solely
  upon the heat which it receives directly from the sun ? Were
  all ocean- and aerial currents stopped, so that there could be no
  transference of heat from one part of the earth's surface to the
  other, what ought to be the temperatures of the equator and
  the poles ? We can at least arrive at a rough estimate on this
  point. If we diminish the quantity of warm water conveyed
  from the equatorial regions to the temperate and arctic regions,
  the temperature of the equator will begin to rise and the tem
  perature of the poles to sink.     It is probable, however, that this
  process   would  affect the temperature of the poles more than it
  would do that of the equator ; for as the warm water flows from
   the equator to the poles, the area over which it is spread be
  comes less and less.      But as the water from the tropics has to
   raise the temperature of the temperate regions as well as the
   polar, the difference of effect at the equator and poles might
   not, on that account, be so very great.        Let us take a rough
   estimate.    Say that, as the temperature of the equator rises one
   degree, the temperature of the poles sinks one degree and a half.
   The mean annual temperature of the globe is about 58°. The
   mean temperature of the equator is 80°, and that of the poles 0°.
   Let ocean- and aerial currents now begin to cease, the tempera
    ture of the equator begins to rise and the temperature of the
    poles to sink.   For every degree that the equator rises the poles
    sink 14°; and when the currents are all stopped and each place
    dependent alone upon the direct rays of the sun, the mean an
    nual temperature of the equator above that of space will be to
    that of the poles, above that of space, as 12 to 5.     When this
    proportion is reached, the equator will be 374° above that of
    space, and the poles 156° ; for 374 is to 156 as 12 is to 5.   The
    temperature   of space we  have  seen  to be  —239°,  consequently
    the temperature of the equator will in this case be 135°, rec
    koned from the zero of the Fahrenheit thermometer, and the
_jLoles-83° below zero. The equator would therefore be 55°
    warmer than at present, and the poles 83°~ colder.      The differ
    ence between the temperature of the equator and the poles will
   in this case amount to 218°. / i    *-i
       Now,if   we take into account the quantity of positive energy

 96           Mr. J. Croll on Ocean-cu?rents in relation to
 in the form of heat carried by warm currents from the equator
 to the temperate and polar regions, and also the quantity of ne
 gative energy (cold) carried by cold currents from the polar re
 gions to the equator, we shall find that they are sufficient to re
 duce the difference of temperature between the poles and the
jquator from 218° to 80°.
     The quantity of heat received in the latitude of London, for
 example, to that received at the equator is about as 12 to 8.
 This, according to theory, should produce a difference of about
  125°.    The temperature of the equator above that of space, as
 we have seen, would be 374°.        Therefore 249° above that of
 space would represent the temperature of the latitude of London.
 This would give 10° as its temperature.         The stoppage of all
 ocean and aerial currents would thus increase the difference be
 tween the equator and the latitude of London by about 85°.
 The stoppage of ocean-currents would not be nearly so much
 felt, of course, in the latitude of London as at the equator and
 the poles, because, as has been already noticed, in all latitudes
 midway between the equator and the poles the two sets of cur
 rents to a considerable extent compensate each other ; viz. the
 warm currents from the equator raise the temperate, while the
 cold ones from the poles lower it ; but as the warm currents
 chiefly keep on the surface and the cold return-currents are prin
 cipally undercurrents, the heating effect very greatly exceeds
 the cooling effect.    Now, as we have seen, the stoppage of all
 currents would raise the temperature of the equator 55°; that
 is to say, the rise at the equator alone would increase the differ
 ence of temperature between the equator and that of London by
 55°.     But the actual difference, as we have seen, ought to be
 85° ; consequently the temperature of London would be lowered
 30° by the stoppage of the currents.       For if we raise the tem
 perature of the equator 55° and lower the temperature of Lon
 don 30°, we then increase the difference by 85°.        The normal
 temperature of the latitude" of London being 40°, the stoppage of
 all ocean and aerial currents would thus reduce it to 10°. But
 the Gulf-stream raises the actual mean temperature of London 10°
 above the normal.      Consequently 30°+ 10° = 40° represents the
 actual rise at London due to the influence of the Gulf-stream
 over and above all the lowering effects resulting from arctic
 currents.     On some parts of the American shores on the lati
 tude of London, the temperature is 10° below the normal.        The
 stoppage of all ocean- and aerial currents would therefore low er
 the temperature there only 20°.
     It is at the equator and the poles that the great system of
 ocean and aerial currents produces its maximum effects.         The
 influence becomes less and less as we recede from thoee places,

                  the Distribution of Heat  over the Glube.           97
 and between them there is a point where the influence of the
 warm currents from the equator and cold currents from the
 poles exactly neutralize each other.      At this point the stoppage
 of ocean-currents would not sensibly affect temperature. This
 point, of course, is not situated on the same latitude in all me
 ridians, but varies according to the position of the meridian in re
 lation to land, and ocean-currents, whether cold or hot, and
other circumstances.        A line drawn round the globe through
 these various points would be very irregular.      At one place, such
as on the western side of the Atlantic, where the arctic current
predominates, the neutral line would be deflected towards the
equator, while on the eastern side, where warm currents pre
dominate, the line would be deflected towards the north.           It is
a difficult problem to determine the mean position of this line ;
it probably lies somewhere not far north of the tropics.
    Influence of the Gulf-stream on the Climate of the Arctic Re
gions. — Does the Gulf-stream pass into the arctic regions ? Are
the seas around Spitzbergen and North Greenland heated by the
warm water of the stream ?
    Those who deny this nevertheless admit the existence of an
arctic current.      They admit that an immense mass of cold water
is continually flowing south from the polar regions around
Greenland      into the Atlantic.     Then, if it is admitted that
there is a mass of water flowing across the arctic circle from
north to south, it must also be admitted that there is an equal
mass flowing across from south to north.            It is also evident
that the water crossing from south to north must be warmer
than the water crossing from north to south ; for the temperate
regions are warmer than the arctic, and the ocean in temperate
regions warmer than the ocean in the arctic ; consequently the
current which flows into the arctic seas, to compensate for the
cold arctic current, must be a warmer current.
    Is the Gulf-stream this warm current ? Does this compen
sating warm current proceed from the Atlantic or from the Pa
cific ?   If it proceeds from the Atlantic, it is simply the warm
water of the Gulf-stream.        We may call it the warm water of
the Atlantic if we choose ; but this cannot materially affect the
question at issue, for the heat which the waters of the Atlantic
possess is derived, as we have seen, to an enormous extent from
the water brought from the tropics by the Gulf-stream.          Then,
if we deny that the warm compensating current comes from the
Atlantic, we must assume that it comes from the Pacific.           But
if the cold current flows from the arctic regions into the Atlantic,
and the warm compensating current from the Pacific into the
arctic regions, the highest temperature should be found on the
Pacific side of the arctic regions and not on the Atlantic side ;

  98          Mr.  J.  Croll on Ocean- currents in relation  to
  but the reverse is the case.       In the Atlantic, for example, the
  41° isothermal line of mean annual temperature reaches to lati
  tude 65° 30', while in the Pacific it nowhere goes beyond latitude
  57°.    The 27° isothermal of mean annual temperature reaches
  to latitude 75° in the Atlantic, but in the Pacific it does not
  pass beyond 64°.       And the 14° isothermal reaches the north of
  Spitzbergen in latitude 80°, whereas on the Pacific side of the
  arctic regions it does not reach to latitude 72°.
      On no point of the earth's surface does the mean annual tem
  perature rise so high above the normal as in the northern Atlan
  tic, just at the arctic circle, at a spot believed to be in the middle
  of the Gulf-stream. This place is no less than 22°-5 above the
  normal, while in the northern Pacific the temperature does not
  anywhere rise more than 9° above the normal.               These facts
  prove that the warm current passes up the Atlantic into the
  arctic regions and not up the Pacific, or at least that the larger
  amount of warm water must pass into the arctic regions through
  the Atlantic.      In other words, the Gulf-stream is the warm
  compensating current.        Not only must there be a warm stream,
  but one of very considerable magnitude, in order to compen
  sate for the great amount of cold water that is constantly flow
  ing from the arctic regions, and also to maintain the tempe
 rature of those regions so much above the temperature of space
 as they actually    are.
      No doubt, when the results of the late dredging expedition
 in the North Sea are published, they will cast much additional
 light on the direction and character of the currents forming the
.north-eastern branch of the Gulf-stream.
      The average quantity of heat received by the arctic regions as
 a whole per unit surface to that received at the equator, as we
 have already seen, is as 5'45 to 12, assuming that the percentage
 of rays cut off by the atmosphere is the same at both places.
 In this case the mean annual temperature of the arctic regions,
 taken as a whole, would be about —69°, did those regions de
 pend alone for their temperature upon the heat received directly
 from the sun.      But the temperature would not even reach to
this ; for the percentage of rays cut off by the atmosphere in
arctic regions is generally believed to be greater than at the
equator, and consequently the actual mean quantity of heat
received by the arctic regions will be less than s'*s of what is
received at the equator.
     In the article on " Climate " in the Encyclopedia Britannica
there is a Table calculated upon the principle that the quantity
of heat cut off is proportionate to the number of aerial particles
that the rays have to encounter before reaching the surface of
the earth — that, as a general rule, if the tracts of the rays fol

low an arithmetical progression, the diminished force with which
the rays reach the ground will form a decreasing geometrical
progression.      According to this Table about 75 per cent. of
the sun's rays are cut off by the atmosphere in arctic regions.
But if 75 per cent. of the rays were cut off by the atmosphere
in arctic regions, then the direct rays of the sun could not main
tain a mean temperature lOQ3 above that of space                But this is
no doubt by far too high a percentage for the quantity of heat
cutoff; for recent discoveries in regard to the absorption of ra
diant heat by gases and vapours prove that Tables computed on
this principle must be incorrect.         The researches of Tyndall
and Melloni show that when rays pass through any substance,
the absorption is rapid at first; but the rays are soon " sifted/''
as it is called, and they then pass onwards with but little fur
ther obstruction. Still, however, owing to the dense fogs which
prevail in arctic regions, the quantity of heat cut off must be
considerable.      If as much as 50 per cent. of the sun's rays are
cut off by the atmosphere in arctic regions, the amount of heat
received directly from the sun is not sufficient to maintain a
mean annual temperature of — 100°.            Consequently the arctic
regions must depend to an enormous extent upon ocean-cur
 rents for their temperature.
    Influence of Ocean-currents shown by a Second method.
                                                                   — That
the temperature of the arctic regions would sink enormously and
 the temperature of the equator rise enormously were all ocean-
 currents stopped, can be shown by another method, viz. by taking
the mean annual temperature from the equator to the pole along
 a meridian passing through the ocean, say, the Atlantic, and
 comparing it with the mean annual temperature taken along a
 meridian passing through a great continent, say, the Asiatic.
     Professor J.  D. Forbes, in an interesting memoir*, has endea
 voured by this method to determine what would be the tempe
 rature of the equator and the poles were the globe all water or
 all land.    He has taken the temperature of the two meridians
 from the Tables and charts of M. Dove, and ascertained the                 •
 exact proportion of land and water on every 10° of latitude from
 the equator to the poles, with the view of determining what pro
 portion of the average temperature of the globe in each parallel
 is due to the land, and what to the water which respectively be
 longs to it.     He next endeavours to obtain a formula for ex
 pressing the mean temperature of a given parallel, and thence
 arrives at " an approximate answer to the inquiry as to what
 would have been the equatorial or polar temperature of the globe,
 or that of any latitude, had its surface been entirely composed of
 land or water."

100          Mr. J. Croll  on Ocean-currents  in relation to
    The result at which he arrived is this : that, were the surface of
the globe all water, 7\°'7 would be the temperature of the equator
 and 12°-5 the temperature of the poles ; and were the surface all
 land, 109°-8 would be the temperature of the equator and — 25°-6
 the temperature of the poles.
    But in Professor Forbes's calculations no account whatever
is taken of the influence of currents, whether of water or of
 air, and the difference of temperature is attributed wholly to
 difference of latitude and the physical properties of land and
 water in relation to their powers in absorbing and detaining the
 sun's rays, and to the laws of conduction and of convection which
 regulate the internal motion of heat in the one and in the other.
 He considers that the effects of currents are all compensatory.
     " If a current of hot water," he         " moderates the cold of
                                        says,
 a Lapland winter, the counterenrrent,      which brings the cold of
 Greenland to the shores of the United States, in a great measure
 restores the balance of temperature, so far as it is disturbed by
 this particular influence.    The prevalent winds, in like manner,
 including the trade-winds, though they render some portions of
 continents, on the average, hotter or colder than others, pro
 duce just the contrary effect elsewhere.       Each continent, if it
 has a cold eastern shore, has likewise a warm western one ; and
even local winds have for the most part established laws of
compensation.       In a given parallel of latitude all these secon
 dary causes of local climate may be imagined to be mutually
compensatory, and the outstanding gradation of mean or normal
temperature will mainly depend, 1st, upon the effect of lati
tude simply, 2nd, on the distribution of land and water con
sidered in their primary or statical effect."
    It is singular that a ph\ sicist so acute as Professor Forbes
should, in a question such as this, leave out of account the in
fluence of currents, under the impression that their effects were
compensatory.
    If there is a constant transference of hot water from the equa
torial regions to the polar, and of cold water from the polar re
gions to the equatorial (a thing which Professor Forbes admitted),
then there can only be one place between the equator and the
pole where the two sets of currents compensate each other.         At
all places on the equatorial side of this point a cooling effect is
the result.     Starting from this neutral point, the. preponderance
of the cooling effect over the heating increases as we approach
towards the equator, and the preponderance             of the heating
effect  over  the cooling increases as we recede from this point
towards the pole — the cooling effect reaching a maximum at the
equator, and the heating effect a maximum at the pole.
    Had Professor Forbes observed this important fact, he would

                 the Distribution  of Heat  over the Globe.         101
 have seen at once that the low temperature of the laud in high
 latitudes in comparison with that of the sea was no index whatever
as to how much the temperature of those regions would sink
 were the sea entirely removed and the surface to become land ;
 for the present high temperature of the sea is not due wholly to
 the mere physical properties of water, but to a great extent is
due to the heat brought by currents from the equator.             Now,
unless it is known how much of the absolute temperature of the
ocean in those latitudes is due to currents, we cannot tell how
 much the removal of the sea would lower the absolute tempera
ture of those places. Were the sea removed, the continents in
high latitudes would not simply lose the heating advantages
 which they presently derive from the mere fact of their proximity
to so much sea, but the removal would, in addition to this, de
prive them of an enormous amount of heat which they at pre
sent receive from the tropics by means of ocean-currents.         And,
on the other hand, at the equator, were the sea removed, the
continents there would not simply lose the cooling influences
which result from their proximity to so much water, but, in ad
dition to this, they would have to endure the scorching effects
which would result from the heat which is at present carried away
from the tropics by ocean-currents.
    We have already seen that Professor Forbes concluded that
the removal of the sea would raise the mean temperature of
the equator 30° and lower the temperature of the poies 28°; it
is therefore perfectly certain that, had he added to his result the
effect due to ocean-currents, and had he been aware that about
one-fifth of all the heat possessed by the Atlantic is actually de
rived from the equator by means of the Gulf-stream, he would
have assigned a temperature to the equator and the poles, of a
globe all land, differing not very far from what      I have concluded
would be the temperature of those places were all ocean and
aerial currents stopped, and each place to depend solely upon
the heat which it directly received from the sun.
    Influence of Ocean-currents shown by a Third method.
                                                                —The
great influence of ocean-currents in lowering the temperature of
the equator and raising the temperature of the poles can also be
shown in still another way.
    The general influence of land on climate is to exaggerate the
variation of temperature due to the seasons.         On continents the
summers are hotter and the winters colder than on the ocean.
The days are also hotter and the nights colder on land than on
sea.     This is a result which follows from the mere physical pro
perties of land and water, independently of currents', whether of
ocean or of air.      But it nevertheless follows, according to theory
(and    this is a  point which has been overlooked), that the mean

102         Mr.   J.   Croll   on Ocean-currents            in relation to
annual temperature of the ocean ought to be greater than that of
the land in equatorial regions as well as in temperate and polar
regions.      Thi3 will appear obvious for the following reasons : —
  (1) The    gronnd stores up heat ouly by the slow process of con
 duction, whereas water, by the mobility of its particles and its
transparency for heat-rays, especially those from the sun, be
comes heated to a considerable depth rapidly.                The quantity of
heat stored up in the ground is comparatively small ; the quan
tity stored up in the ocean is great.              (2) The air is probably
 heated more rapidly by contact with the ground than with the
ocean ; but, on the other baud, it is heated far more rapidly by
radiation from the ocean than from the land.                The aqueous va
 pour  of  the   air is to a great   extent   diathermanous      to radiation
 from the ground, while it absorbs the rays from water and thus
 becomes heated.         (3) The air radiates back a considerable por
 tion of its heat, and the ocean absorbs this radiation from the air
 more readily than the ground does. The ocean will not reflect the
 heat from the aqueous vapour of the air, but absorbs                      it,
                                                                     while the
 ground does the opposite. Radiation from the air, therefore, tends
 more readily to heat the ocean than              does the land.

heat received from the sun          ; in other words, the land tends to
 lose its heat more rapidly than the sea.               The consequence of

fore follows that, in order that the sea may get quit of its heat
as rapidly as the land,         must stand at a higher temperature than
                               it
the land.       The temperature of the sea must continue to rise till
the amount of heat thrown off into space equals that received
from the sun   ;      when this point       reached, equilibrium
                                                 is                       esta     is
blished and the temperature remains stationary.                But, owing to
the greater difficulty that the sea has in getting rid of its heat,
the mean temperature of equilibrium of the ocean must be higher
than that of the land          consequently. the mean temperature of
                               ;
the ocean, and also of the air immediately over                      it,
                                                                   in tropical
regions should be higher than the mean temperature of the land
and the air over it.
     We find, however, when we examine M. Dove's charts of

               the   Distribution of Heat     over the Globe.          103
mean annual temperature,         that the reverse is actually the case;
for the ocean in tropical regions has        a mean annual temperature
below the normal, and the land a mean anuual temperature
above the normal.         Both in the Pacific and in the Atlantic the
mean temperature sinks to 2°-3 below the normal, while on the
land it rises 4°.6 above the normal.           This can be accounted for
upon   no  other  principle   than   that  the  ocean in tropical regions
is kept at a lower temperature in consequence of the enormous
amount of heat that is being constantly carried away from those
regions into temperate and polar regions, and of cold that is
being constantly carried from temperate and polar regions to the
tropical regions by means of ocean-currents.
    Were there no ocean-currents, it would follow, according to
theory, that the southern hemisphere should be warmer than the
northern, because the proportion of sea to land is greater on that
hemisphere than on the northern ; but we lind that the reverse
is the case.
    Low Temperature of the Southern Hemisphere owing to Ocean-
currents. —The lower mean temperature of the southern hemi
 sphere is due to the amount of heat transferred over from that
 hemisphere to the northern by ocean-currents.
    The great ocean-currents of the globe take their rise in three
 immense streams from the Southern Ocean, which, on reaching
 the tropical regions, become deflected in a westerly direction and
 flow along the southern side of the equator for thousands of
 miles. Perhaps more than one-half of this mass of moving water
 returns into the Southern Ocean without ever crossing the equa
 tor; but the quantity which crosses over to the northern hemi
  sphere is enormous.       Since there is then a constant flow of water
 from the southern hemisphere to the northern in the form of
 surface-currents,     it must be compensated by undercurrents of
 equal magnitude from the northern hemisphere to the southern.
 The currents, however, which cross the equator are far higher in
 temperature     than their compensating           undercurrents ; conse
 quently   there  is a  constant   transference    of heat from the south
  ern hemisphere to the northern.          Any   currents  taking their rise
  in the northern hemisphere and flowing across into the southern
 are comparatively trifling, and the amount of heat transferred by
  them is also trifling.     There are one or two currents of consider
  able size, such as the Brazilian branch of the great equatorial
  current of the Atlantic, and a part of the South Equatorial Drift-
  current of the Pacific, which cross the equator from north to
  south ; but these cannot be regarded as northern currents ; they
  are simply southern currents deflected back after crossing over
  to the northern hemisphere.            The heat which these currents
  possess is chiefly obtained on the southern hemisphere before

 104          Mr.   J.   Croll   on Ocean-currents      in relation to
  Grossing over to the northern ; and although the northern he
  misphere may not gain much heat by means of them,                  on theit,
  other hand, does not lose much, for the heat which they give out
  in their progress along the southern hemisphere does not belong
  to the northern hemisphere.
      But, after making the fullest allowance for the amount of heat
  carried across the equator from the northern hemisphere to the
  southern, we shall find,   ifwe compare the mean temperature of the
  currents from the southern hemisphere to the northern with the
  mean temperature of the great compensating undercurrents and
  the one or two small surface-currents, that the mean temperature
  of the water crossing the equator from the southern hemisphere
  to the northern    is very much higher than the mean temperature
 of the water crossing from the northern hemisphere to the south
 ern.    The mean temperature of the water crossing the equator
 from south to north             probably not under 65°, while the
                                 is
  mean temperature of the undercurrents                probably not over
                                                            is
 39°.     But we must add to them the surface-currents                from
 north to south.       And let us assume that this will raise the mean
 temperature of the entire mass of water flowing from north to
 south to, say, 45°.        Supposing this to be       fair estimate, here
                                                            a
 we have    a  difference of 20°.    Each cubic foot of water which
 crosses the equator will in this case transfer about 1250 units of
 heat from the southern hemisphere to the northern.                we hadIf
 any means of ascertaining the volume of those great currents
 crossing the equator, we should then be able to make                rough a
 estimate of the total amount of heat transferred from the south
 ern hemisphere to the northern         but as yet no accurate estimate
                                        ;
 has been made on this point.         Let us assume, what             is
                                                                 probably
 below the truth, that the total amount of water crossing the
 equator is   at least double that of the Gulf-stream as            passes it
 through the Straits of Florida, which amount we have already
 found to be equal tol33,816,320,000,000 cubicfeet daily. Taking
 the quantity of heat conveyed          by
                                        each cubic foot of water of the
 Gulf-stream as 1500 thermal units,          it found, as we have seen,
                                                  is
 that an amount of heat          is
                                conveyed      by
                                               this   current equal to all
 the heat that falls within 63 miles on each side of the equator.
 Then, if  each cubic foot of water crossing the equator transfers
 1250 thermal units, and the quantity of water             double that of
                                                                 is
the Gulf-stream,     it  follows that the amount of heat transferred
from the southern hemisphere to the northern               equal to all the
                                                                 is
heat falling    within   105   miles on  each side of the equator, or
equal to all the heat falling on the southern hemisphere within
210 miles of the equator. This quantity taken from the southern
hemisphere and added to the northern will therefore make                dif      a
ference in the amount of heat possessed                by
                                                    the two hemispheres

               the  Distribution of Heat over     the Globe.         103
equal to all the heat which falls on the southern hemisphere
within fully 420 miles of the equator, supposing the sun to be
vertical over the whole area.            But even supposing that the
actual difference    is   only  one-half  this amount, still it is nearly
equal to all the heat which is received by the entire area of
the Atlantic Ocean from the tropics to the arctic regions, a
quantity quite sufficient to account for the lower mean tempera
ture of the southern hemisphere.
    Without Ocean-currents the Globe would not be habitable. — All
these foregoing considerations show to what an extent the cli
matic condition of our globe is due to the thermal influences of
ocean-currents.
    As regards the northern hemisphere, we. have two immense
oceans, the Pacific and the Atlantic, extending from the equator
to near the north pole, or perhaps to the pole altogether.            Be
tween these two oceans lie two great continents, the eastern and
the western.      Owing to the earth's spherical form, by far too
much    heat  is received at the equator and by far too little at high
latitudes to make the earth a suitable habitation for sentient
beings.     The function of these two great oceans is to remove
the heat from the equator and carry it to temperate and polar
regions.    Aerial currents could not do this. They might remove
the heat from the equator, but they could not, as we have already
seen, carry it to the temperate and polar regions ; for the greater
 portion of the heat which aerial currents remove from the equa
 tor is dissipated into stellar space : the ocean can alone convey
 the heat to distant shores.       But aerial currents have a most im
portant function ; for of what avail would it be, though ocean-
 currents should carry heat to high latitudes, if there were no
 means of spreading the heat thus conveyed over the land ? The
 function of aerial currents is to do this.         Upon this twofold ar
 rangement depends       the  thermal condition    of the globe. Exclude
 the waters of the Pacific and the Atlantic from temperate and
 polar regions and place them at the equator, and nothing now
 existing on the globe could live in high latitudes.
    Were these two great oceans placed beside each other on one
 side of the globe, and the two great continents placed beside each
 other on the other side, the northern hemisphere would not then
 be suitable for the present order of things : the land on the
 central and on the eastern side of the united continent would be
 by far too cold.
     Ihe foregoing conclusions not affected by the imperfection of the
 data. — It will hardly do to object to the general results at which
  we have arrived in reference to the influence of ocean currents
 on the climatic condition of the globe on the ground of any im
 perfection in the data employed.          It is perfectly true that con

 siderable uncertainty prevails regarding some of the data ; but,
 after making the fullest allowance for every possible error, the
 influence of currents is so enormous that the general conclusion
 cannot be materially affected.      I can hardly think that any one
 familiar with the physics of the subject would be willing to admit
 that it is probable that, owing to errors in the data, the effects have
 been doubled.      But even admitting that they have, still it does
 not materially alter the general conclusion at which we have
 arrived.    The influence of ocean-currents in the distribution of
 heat over the surface of the globe must still be admitted to be
 enormous, whether we conclude that owing to them the present
 temperature of the equator is 55° or 27° colder than it would
 otherwise be, or the poles 83° or 41° hotter than they would
 be were there no currents.
     Yea, more, suppose we should again halve the result ; still we
 should have to admit that, owing to ocean-currents, the equator
 is about 14° colder and the poles about 21° hotter than they
 would otherwise be; in other words, we should have to admit
 that, were it not for ocean-currents, the mean temperature of the
equator would be about 100° and the mean temperature of the
poles about —21°.
     If the influence of ocean -currents in reducing the difference
 between the temperature of the equator and poles amounted to
 only a few degrees, it would, of course, be needless to put much
 weight on any results arrived at by the method of calculatiou
 which has been adopted in this paper ; but when it is a matter
of two hundred degrees, it is not at all likely that the general
 results will be very much affected by any errors which may ever
be found in the data.
     Objections of a paUeontological nature have frequently been
 urged against the opinion that our island is much indebted for
its mild climate to the influence of the Gulf-stream; but, from
what has already been stated, it must, I presume, be apparent
that all objections of that nature are of little avail.      The palae
ontologist may detect, from the character of the flora and fauna
 brought up from the sea-bottom by dredging and other means,
the presence of a warm or of a cold current ; but this can never
enable him to prove that the temperate and polar regions are not
affected to an enormous extent by warm water conveyed from
the equatorial regions.       For anything that palaeontology can
show to the contrary, were ocean-currents to cease, the mean
annual temperature of our island might sink below the present
midwinter temperature of Siberia. What would be the thermal
condition of our globe were there no ocean-currents is a question
for the physicist ; not for the naturalist.

XIII.     Note on an Elementary      Proof of a Theorem of Lagrange's.
            By Professor Robert Stawell Ball, A.M.*
"   IF    a membrane,   extensible or inextensible, be in equilibrium
   -I     under the influence of forces at every point normal to the
surface, then the normal pressure at any point is equal to the
tension of the surface at that point, multiplied into the sum of
the reciprocals of the principal radii of curvature."
    This theorem is at present of great interest, in consequence of
its very beautiful application in the recent discoveries of Professor
Haughton.
    Taking the origin on the surface, the axis of z for the normal,
and the axes of x and y tangents to the principal directions of
curvature, the equation of the surface is
                                    x*     y*

                                   s;     r4
 + terms of the third and higher orders =0.
    But as we shall only deal with points in the immediate vicinity
of the origin, we may neglect all but the three first terms, and
thus                                                                   .
    Now, let a plane parallel to the tangent-plane, and separated
from it by an infinitely small interval p, be drawn ; this will cut
the surface in an ellipse defined by the equations
                                   '

                      a*=2R,/, and      ^=2^.
     Let us fix our attention on the small piece of the surface thus
 cut off.    It may be considered plane, because the greatest devia
 tion of any part of it from the plane is of the second order of
 small quantities.    Hence, if P be the normal pressure per unit of
 area to which the surface is at this point exposed, the total pres
 sure on the piece bounded by the ellipse is
                                 irabV.
 This pressure is counteracted by the tension of the surface which
acts along the margin of the ellipse.

XIV.     On the determination of the size of the Wire which, wound
   upon a Galvanometer or Electromagnet, will produce the maxi
   mum magnetic effect in a circuit of given external resistance, the
   space taken up by the silk or other substance insulating the differ
   ent convolutions from each other being taken into consideration.
   By G.K. Winter, Telegraph Engineer, Madras Railway Com
   pany*.
                              [With  a Plate.]
       is easily proved, and generally known, that if it were not
 IT    necessary to insulate the different convolutions from each
other, or if the ratio between the space taken up by the insula
ting covering and that occupied by the wire itself were constant
for all sizes of wire, the maximum magnetic effect would be pro
duced when the resistance of the galvanometer or electromagnet
coil is equal to the sum of the external resistances in the circuit.
It is evident, however, that the ratio above mentioned varies with
the size of the wire ; the thickness of the silk covering being the
same, or nearly the same, for all sizes of wire.
    Mr. Schwendler, in a paper in the Philosophical Magazine for
January 1867, taking the silk covering into account, proved that
the resistance of the coil should be less than the external resist
ance, and gave formulae for determining what the coil resistance
should be in order to produce the maximum effect.
    It is my purpose in the following investigation, not to calcu
late directly what the resistance of the coil should be, but to
determine the size of the wire when the magnetic effect is a
maximum ; and       I trust the result will prove of practical value
to electricians.
     In winding a magnet or galvanometer coil, the wire may
either be wound in layers alternately backwards and forwards, or
it may be wound in superposed layers, the end of each layer
being connected with the commencement of the next; or if
greater insulation be required, each layer is sometimes separated
from the next above it by a layer of paper, gutta-percha tissue,
or other insulating substance.
    Plate II. figs. 1, 2, 3 represent sections of the coil with the
wire wound in the three methods above mentioned, and will
render what follows more easily understood.
    Space is undoubtedly best economized in the second of these
methods (fig. 2)t; but, unfortunately, in order to coil the wire
in this way, all the layers must be wound in the same direction ;
   *
      Communicated by the Author.
   +  This would be more evident if the size of the wire in the diagram were
not necessarily so exaggerated in proportion to the size of the coil.

 110             Mr. G. K. Winter       on the   Ratio of maximum
and this is only rendered practicable by joining the end of one
layer to the beginning of the next, which is necessarily at the
other end of the coil.         This may be done either by making the
connexion outside the coil (which is only possible when the wire
is thick and the layers consequently not very numerous), or the
wire .may be carried across over the layer just wound ; but the
economy of this plan is doubtful, and it is rarely adopted ; it in
troduces extra resistance into the circuit, and space is lost by
the wire in the next layer having to bridge over the connecting
wire.
    Let   r=    the radius of the wire,
          s= the thickness of the silk or other insulator,
         m= the sectional       area of the space to be filled with wire,
          /=    the average length of one convolution,
          c=    the specific conductivity of the wire to be used, that
                  of pure copper at 0° Centigrade being unity, and
p and    X=     respectively the radius and length of a wire of pure
                  copper equal in resistance to the given external re
                  sistance.
    It  is at once evident that the sectional area taken up by each
convolution,       if the wire be wound according to the first method
(fig. 1), will    be  4(r + *)«.
    It is also equally evident that the sectional area taken up by
each convolution,         if the second method of winding the wire be
adopted, will be
             2(r+*) <U+2713>4(r+*)8-(r + *),=2 */3(r+*)*,
in which the coefficient 4 is replaced by 2 */3 = 3,4641. This
coefficient, which depends entirely upon the method of coiling
the wire, we will call a, either value being substituted for it in
the numerical solution of the problem, according to the circum
stances of the case.
    With regard to the third method of winding the wire (fig. 3),
namely in layers insulated from each other by a layer of paper or
other insulator, it will be sufficiently correct for practical pur
poses if we consider s increased by one quarter of the thickness
of the insulating layer.
   The sectional area taken up by each convolution being a(r + «)*,
the number of convolutions          will  be         ;-„•

    A  few words now with regard to the practical application of
the theoretical results we have obtained may not perhaps be con
sidered out of place.
    It is at once evident that a very large alteration in resistance
will be caused by even a very slight alteration in the size of the
wire ; it is therefore very important, when drawing wire for any
given purpose, to measure the diameter very accurately.                         This
 may easily      be   done     with  a  good    screw-micrometer       ; but the in
strument that I have found most useful for this purpose may be
briefly described as follows (see fig. 4) t.
     Two straight edges, each exactly 10" long, are fastened together
at one end, and separated at the other end by the insertion be
tween them of a small piece of wire exactly 0"-l in diameter. One
of the straight edges is graduated along its length into inches
    * This value of s was obtained by the actual measurement of the thick
ness of the silk on a sample of covered wire.
    t The divisions and numbers on the right-hand side show also the
iliameters and numbers of the wires of the Birmingham wire-gauge, accord
ing to Culley's ' Hand-book of Telegraphy.'

and tenths, zero being where the edges meet. When it is neces
sary to measure the diameter of a wire, a piece is straightened
and slid along the angular opening towards the smaller end until
it will go no further. Its position, as shown on the graduated
straight edge, will then give the diameter in parts of an inch,
with sufficient accuracy for practical purposes, to three places of
decimals*. For instance, if the distance of the wire from the
zero-point be 2"-5, the diameter will be 0"025.
   The thickness of the silk covering is easily measured by halving
the difference between the diameter of covered and that of the
uncovered wire.

   Although in the Table have calculated the radii of the wires
to six places of decimals, yet this is chiefly to show how small
the difference is between the result obtained by solution of the
biquadratic equation (2) and that obtained by solution of the
simple equation (4).   It           is,
                             however, of course, practically quite
unnecessary to carry the calculation beyond three places.
   It must be remembered that the result obtained       the radius         is
of the wire, and of course must be doubled to obtain the dia
meter.

 to purely magnetic means, is in principle subject to a circumstance
 which occasions difficulties — that         is,
                                            the unavoidable execution of
 the two necessary observations (of the oscillations and the deflec
 tions) at different limes.     Since the duration of the oscillations
 and the angle of deflection depend on the horizontal intensity of
the terrestrial magnetism, the variations of the latter must be
 noted down as long as the absolute determination lasts.              At the
same time the variation-instruments must not be set up in the
building in which the absolute measurement                    being made.
                                                             is
Lastly,   the  variations   in the  magnetism      of the   needle   due to
changes    of temperature must be taken into account.
    In an observatory in which continuous terrestrial magnetic
observations are being made, these difficulties are far less per
ceptible than in the case in which the intensity            ascertained for
                                                            is
purely physical purposes, as,        for  instance, for absolute voltaic
measurements.

which Weber introduced has facilitated this part of terres
trial magnetic measurements, so also voltaic determination
greatly simplifies the determination of the intensity, inasmuch
as all observations on which the earth's magnetism has any influ
ence are simultaneously executed.              Amethod shall now be de
scribed which simultaneously effects the absolute measurement
of the magnetic intensity and of voltaic current, and which
                                        a                                      is
characterized       by
                     simplicity and convenience.        Several years ago
Weber tested this method, and, considering the then imperfect
state of the instruments, obtained very satisfactory results, which
encouraged      afurther development of the process.            Hence last
year all the instruments were constructed in more perfect man

ment of intensity and of the current, from which               follows that
                                                                 it

 the latter be determined by measuring the moment of inertia and
 the time of oscillation, the two deflections will give the product iT
and the ratio       in absolute measure, from which i and       T  can be
 determined separately.       Just in this way, we know, the product
 aud quotient of the magnetism of a bar into the earth's magne
 tism are ascertained in Gauss's method.         Since the deflections of
 the tangent-compass and of the bifilar galvanometer are simulta
 neously observed, and the other measurements are independent
 of the earth's magnetism, the result of these determinations gives
 the horizontal intensity for the place and time of observation
 without any further reductions.
    On a further comparison of the magnetic and voltaic me
thods a few other points appear in favour of the latter.             First
of all, the measurements of distance (here consisting of two mea
 surements of the length of wires) only require to be made once,
inasmuch as the coiling of the wires ensures the unalterability of
the dimensions.       Then, again, the difficult comparison of the
magnetism      of the  needle in the meridian (in the oscillations)
with the magnetism of the needle which is at right angles to the
meridian (in the deflections) is quite dispensed with.            In the
third place, the observation of the deflections at two different dis
tances is got rid of, inasmuch as the deflection of the needle is
produced, not by a magnet in which the distribution of the mag
netism is unknown, but by a current the distribution of which is
most accurately known, and which has been brought into the
simplest and most favourable form — that of a circle.               Since
there is only this single determination,        the  needle which is to
be deflected may easily be so short that an approximate estima
tion of the position of the poles will be sufficientfor the correction
required.     Finally, the magnitude of the forces and deflections
are quite at our disposal, inasmuch as the current may have any
desired strength.
    Of the instruments,      I  shall have especially to devote to the
bifilar galvanometer a short description elucidated by some figures.
The suspended        solenoid   is a circular ring 67 centims. in
diameter, formed of eighty-four coils of a covered copper wire
3'2 millims. in diameter.         The ends a of this wire (tig. 1) are
screwed and soldered to brass pins, which move with friction in
a vertical direction in a horizontal axis, aud are fastened above
by means of removeable nuts.          The axis is placed in the rectan
gular hooks of a suspension which is represented in fig. 1 half
its natural size.    All theparts represented in the figure as shaded
are made of vulcanite; the others consist of gilt brass.
    The suspension consists of three disks on the same rod, s,
and turning against each other.         In the middle one the rod is

           Horizontal Intensity of   the Earth's Magnetism.     117
fastened by a quadrangle, the lowest one is held by a nut (not
shown in the drawing).       The object of the lower rotation is to
                             Fig. 1.
test with accuracy whether the plane of the coils coincides when
at rest with the magnetic meridian ; the object of the upper one
is the production of this correct azimuth.
  The rectangular hooks already mentioned are connected with the
lower disk by the supports b. To the middle disk, on the contrary,
the two supports c are fastened, which are seen in the figure as
the continuations of b.      In the arrangement represented, the
middle and lower disks are firmly joined together, inasmuch as
over two pairs of horizontal arms, the lower of which are screwed
and soldered to b and the upper ones to c, tightly fitting hollow
cubes, to, are passed. When the cubes are removed, by turning the
lower disk through 90° the lower arms may be brought into the

with two arms, k, of the middle disk,
which form with the former an exact
rectangular cross.      In the drawing only
one is visible.      Each of these arms is
the metallic continuation of an arm at
right angles to   2, it,
                       as  isseen in the ac
cessory figure        which    represents the
middle disk seen from below. This disk
has, moreover, an index which gives its
position in reference to the upper one.
   To the upper disk are fastened, first, the supports of the upper
hook  e,   and, secondly, two metal sectors of ring,    a   each formingd,
almost  a   semicircle.     They are insulated from each other, but
are each screwed to one of the supports,           so as to form
                                                    e,                 con                 a
ducting whole. Upon each of the half-rings there              small metal
                                                                        is   a
plate,  by  means of which one of the supports,         can be kept fast
                                                                  c,
in any position    in conducting communication with the ring. On
the external surface the half-rings are provided with             scale          a              di
vided into whole degrees, to which the previously mentioned
index points.
    The supports,     e,have    ahooked suspension above, with which
the whole    is suspended to an axis, which       fastened to the bifilar
                                                    is

equal. Each consists of two parts, which
 (as fig.
        3    shows, of the natural size) are
firmly connected with, while insulated
from, each other.         In this section also
the shaded part denotes vulcanite.
    This being premised, the path of the
electricity through the metallic parts of the suspension             easily               is
understood.       A current entering at /passes through                  to           d,

coils in the meridian.
    For the readings the rod        *

for distinctness' sake     is represented on the side of the drawing.
    The bifilar suspension had to be different from the ordinary

          Horizontal Intensity of    the Earth's Magnetism.        1 19
one; for the conducting-wires, in order to ensure suspending-
power and conductivity, had to be copper wires about 1 millim.
in diameter.     As the ordinary mode of suspension is attended
with difficulties in the case of these strong wires, a solid cord
was constructed of the two wires by plaiting them with silk in
the manner represented in fig. 4, so that they were
                                                                  4
firmly connected with, while insulated from, each
other.    In constructing this cord, 170 centims. in
length, to pass the shuttle containing the silk cord
about 5000 times through the wires was a some
what tedious operation.     But the complete cord was
remarkably    firm ; and  while  it was not possible by
repeatedly stretching the two hard copper wires to
get rid of the great curvatures in each, when thus joined they
exhibited an almost faultlessly straight figure.
    In order that the ends of the wire, where they are Fig. 5.
screwed and soldered into the pins of the upper axis,
may not be liable to bend, a sheath is passed over the
rod, the section of which is seen in fig. 5.
    The insulation of the two wires, as well as of all the
parts of the suspension, was tested with an extremely de
licate galvanometer, and was found to be perfect.
    Nothing need be said in reference to the tangent-compass, were
it not that it had been constructed in a manner which is extremely
simple and might be frequently imitated with advantage.              It
consists of a wooden disk of about 800 millims. diameter, upon
two grooves in the rim of which a thick copper wire was wound
in two coils.    Suitable incisions in the disk give space for a small
torsion-circle, the needle with a mirror (for the readings), and a
powerful damper for the latter.        The part of the wire projecting
at the top is twisted to form a cord, as in the bifilar galvanometer,
and, fastened to the ceiling, serves as a support for the whole in
strument, which thus, held also laterally only by two clamps, has
great solidity produced by the simplest means.
    The connecting-wires of both instruments, together with the
wires from the battery, are, everywhere, in order to exclude local
action, placed in pairs near each other, and proceed to a commu
tator near the observing-telescope, by which the current in each
branch of the conduction may be reversed.
    The data which must be ascertained from the instruments
once for all are the following : —
     (1) The surface enclosed within the coils of the bifilar galva
nometer.     It is obtained from the length of the covered wire
(177,318 millims.), and from the number (84) of coils formed
by this length, taking into account that the coils, owing to
gravity, have passed from the original circular shape into ellipses

 120    M. F. Kohlrausch     on the Determination    of the Absolute
 the ratio of whose axes is equal to 1*056, and that the annular
 space occupied by the wire has a circular section of 36 millims.
 diameter.
    Hence it follows that the desired surface
                  F = 29,7 74,300    square millims.
    (2) The semidiameter of the coils of the tangent-compass,
 also determined from the length of the coiled wire, is
                       r= 401 ,606    millims.
    (3) To ascertain by means of oscillations the directive force
of the wires of the bifilar galvanometer, the moment of inertia
of the latter must be known. It was found (determined by
Gauss's method) to be
                          K = 432331.    106.
    (4) The torsion-coefficient of the cocoon -thread to which the
needle of the tangent-compass is suspended, compared with the
directive force of the earth's magnetism, was found to be
                          ^ = 0002528.
    (5) The distance of one pole of the needle from the axis         of
rotation can be takeu with sufficient accuracy as
                            /=20 millims.
    As a specimen of a measurement of intensity and of current,
two successive determinations       made on the 23rd of October,
 1868, are here given.
    The time of oscillation of the solenoid was observed to be : —
         Before the deflections    .   .   = 33*8082 seconds.
         After the deflections     .   .   =33*7963        „
Hence the mean /=33*8023 seconds.
    From this is calculated the directive force of the suspending-
wires,
                     D=         =37344.10*.

The current of a Grove's element (a resistance of three mercury
units being inserted) was simultaneously passed through both
instruments. A special series of experiments had shown that
the directive force of the suspending-wires underwent no change
even with a far stronger current.       The bifilar galvanometer was
deflected 429*78 millims., measured on a scale at a distance
of 3960*8 millims. from the mirror - the needle of the tangent-
compass 458*57 millims., on a scale at a distance of 3681*6

           Horizontal Intensity of                  the   Earth's Magnetism.          121

                       by

tions of the preceding year, the same result within 0*0022 of
the whole amount.       It would scarcely be possible to find a better
example for showing the importance and significance of absolute
measures than the agreement of the two numbers, which are not
only based upon different observations, but even upon different
natural laws.
   The above determinations required for their execution less than
an hour and a half.       If, moreover, as it seems, the accuracy at
tainable is not inferior to that obtained by magnetic means, it
will in future be a question whether the voltaic determination of
T is not altogether to be preferred.        It is undoubtedly so for
voltaic purposes.     Adding to the two galvanometers a Weber's
terrestrial inductor, as in measuring inclinations, voltaic resist
ances may be determined in absolute measure ; and, for most
physical purposes for which no measurement of declination is
needed, we have an adequate magnetic voltaic observatory for
absolute measurements, in which, besides the needles used for
measuring the current, all fixed magnets are avoided.
   I will observe, in conclusion, that the construction of the in
struments used for the above measurements, so far as it required
a mechanical workshop, was executed by Dr. Meycrstein.
               XVI.    Remarks on the Atomic Theory.
                   By W. H. Walenn, F.C.S.*
          WILLIAMSON          has recently brought the atomic theory
DR. again      under the consideration of chemists ; and those who
adopt his views of the theory of combining proportions and of
multiple proportions (in short, his absolute interpretation of the
atomic theory) must also be prepared to give their entire and
unqualified assent to the following points : —
    1. In regard to the indivisibility of so-called "atoms:" — To
use the term " atom
                        " in explaining a chemical combination is to
assume the truth of a theory which has for its basis the real ex
istence of atoms ; and the word atom being derived from arofw;,
a word signifying
                     " indivisible," leaves the atomists no alterna
tive but to suppose that, by the operation of parting or division,
howsoever performed, upon a given mass of matter, a little mass
or lump of the material taken at last remains, beyond which no
division is possible.
   2. In regard to the existence of physical atoms : — Since Dr.
Williamson avows that in chemistry he acknowledges only one
atomic theory, namely that of Dalton, and ignores the efforts of
Lucretius (who was bom B.C. 95) to develope the Epicurean
                  * Communicated     by the Author.

       Mr. W. H. Walenn's Remarks        on the Atomic Theory.    123
tenets respecting the formation of all things from atoms which
existed from all eternity, as well as the moderate views of M.
Laurent, he adheres in the most absolute manner to the belief of
Dalton, that all bodies are composed of atoms which, however
small, have a definite size and weight, and that by the varied
combinations of these atoms all chemical substances may be pro
duced ; further, Dr. Williamson apparently believes this propo
sition   to be incontrovertibly proved.
    3. In regard to the consequences of points 1 and 2 : — The
atomists must be prepared to commit themselves to the conse
quences of their dogmas as well as to the dogmas themselves.
Partly owing to the limited and isolated nature of the atomic
theory, and partly to the inert condition imposed by it upon the
mind, the individual characteristics of different chemical sub
stances are not readily taken into account.           The condition of
matter as a force-carrier, or as a means of manifesting certain
forces, is entirely ignored by the atomic theory, and is thereby
placed beyond the reach of the chemical mind ; the only force
that is recognized is that of gravity, the exponent of which is
weight. The atomic theory comprises only the idea of little
 lumps of various kinds of matter with their relative weights and
combining numbers; it then totally and entirely stops.
     The unity and harmony of true science is a principle which
 the mind of man has always either tacitly admitted or explicitly
 believed.    It is upon this basis, and from a physico-mathematical
 point of view, that the above-mentioned points will now be very
 briefly considered.
     In reference to the first point, it is unfortunate that in many
 parts of his paper Dr. Williamson writes of atoms and atomic
 weights as if the existence of atoms was proved, whereas his
 avowed object is to prove the existence of those atoms.        There
 can be no doubt that Dr. Williamson has served science well and
 has done that which will greatly promote the progress of scien
 tific truth ; he has put forward his ideas in a most definite man
 ner, and in a way which affords a faithful representation of the
 views of a large class of chemists ; but many will fail to find the
 subject logically treated at his hands, his results being isolated
 from the facts from which he deduces them, and the reasoning
 employed being discontinuous and not by any means leading to
 the end he is desirous of establishing.      Any one of the various
 points   of evidence  that is brought  to bear  on the atomic theory
 is sufficient to cast a grave doubt upon its truth ; and the whole
 testimony fully warrants chemists in using the prudent and mo
 derate language of Dr. Roscoe rather than such positive asser
 tions : — " The law of multiple proportions, being founded on ex
 perimental facts, stands as a fixed bulwark of the science, which

 124         Mr. W. H. Walenn's Remarks            on the   Atomic Theory.
  must ever remain true ; whereas the atomic theory, by which we
  now explain this great law, may possibly in time give place to
  one more perfectly suited to the explanation of new facts."
      In mathematical science, as, for instance, in the Differential
  and Integral Calculus, the greatest advantage has been derived
  from reasoning upon quantities that, in relation to other quan
  tities, diminish without limit ; but this diminution, arising as it
  does from a specific operation or repetition of processes upon a
  given quantity, never implies annihilation, as Dr. Williamson evi
  dently infers when, in order to evolve his results, he is obliged to
  represent particles to his mind by supposing the operation of divi
  sion of a sensible mass into parts (by successive steps) to stop at
  a certain point yet undetermined.            Division of a given mass of
                                                                                  it it,
  matter, say, by successively halving          it,  will never annihilate
  but will always leave sufficient of     it    to reason upon, although
  may    by  constant repetition of the process become far too small
 to be recognizable         bythe balance ;    moreover, however small            it
  may    be,  itwill  possess  the   intrinsic properties of the given mass.
  Since this view of the subject never supposes the annihilation of
 matter,     it  always competent for the mind to realize the building
                  is
  up of  a   mass of matter         the multiplication of the particles to
                                     by
 which   it   has been reduced, possibly for the convenience of theo
 retical investigation.       When, again, the measure of comparison
is   weight,      serves no purpose to suppose that matter consists
                  it
 of collection of individual atoms
     a                                    ;    for these are not practically
 weighable, more especially as there           is  no proof to the eye, the
 touch, or other sense of the existence of such atoms             ;  the prac
 tical way in this case         evidently to take
                                is                    a definite and arbitrary
 unit of weight, such as           gramme of hydrogen, for instance, to
                                     a
 start with.
     In reference to the second point,        if  a,, a4, aS) . ..an represent
 certain definite weights of the different kinds of matter repre
 sented   by   A„ A2, Ag,       A„, related to each other in the same way
 as the so-called " atomic
                                 " weights of the said different kinds of
                            .
                            .
                            .
 matter (so that a„ instead of being one indivisible unit of                  hy
 drogen, shall mean one gramme of hydrogen, as sixteen grammes
 of oxygen, &c.), the proportions of these definite weights in rela
tion to each other and in relation to the law of multiple proportions
will be the same as any other definite weights (however small)
                           if
were taken.        It follows that the existence of physical atoms            is
not only not         necessary consequence of the facts that have been
                       a
observed respecting the combining proportions of various sub
stances, or the multiple proportions of pairs of substances, but              is
quite immaterial to thequestion at issue. The assumption of unit       a
independent of the laws of nature         is   not new in science, but       is   a
necessary means of orderly arrangement and of establishing re

       Mr. W. H. Walenn's Remarks      on the Atomic Theory.      125
lative numerical values, — e. g. Hofmann's crith, the British Asso
ciation unit of electric resistance, horse-power as a unit of motive
power, and Sir Benjamin Brodie's a (which is the symbol of that
portion of hydrogen that occupies the volume of 1000 cubic cen
timetres at 0O-C. and a pressure of 760 millimetres of mercury).
In an analogous way, a gramme of hydrogen, sixteen grammes
of oxygen, fourteen grammes of nitrogen, &c. may be conveni
ently taken to realize and apply both theoretically and practically
the combining proportions of various chemical substances.
     In reference to the third point, the circumscribed ideas that
 spring from the atomic theory led to the belief, more or less
established according to the mind that receives the theory, that
 atoms were spherical and separated by space from each other.
 The difficulties of this position in the present state of science are
 so great that even Dr. Williamson disclaims any specific state
 ment about the shape of atoms, thereby removing still further
 from the region of fact the atoms that are dealt with in his paper ;
 for to accept the existence of a certain portion of matter without
 even knowing its form is certainly not impossible, but neverthe
 less adding one more to the points of evidence that may be ad
 duced against its existence at all.       If the train of reasoning
 respecting the inability to annihilate matter by continued divi
 sion be adopted, it follows that however small a particle be taken
 to reason upon, if it be a crystal, for instance, it must have the
 same shape as the mass from which it is derived.             However
 small a piece of chloride of sodium be taken, as crystallized at
 common temperatures, it will be a cube ; if crystallization takes
 place at a temperature below freezing-point, prismatic crystals
 containing water of crystallization will be obtained.   By carrying
 out this line of argument in other cases of crystallization, it will
 be clearly seen that the smallest particles that be can conceived
 at a given temperature are of the same shape as that of the mass
  whence they are derived at the same temperature.       This method
 of analyzing the question dispenses entirely with the inert little
  lumps that the atomic theory presupposes, and may enable crys
  tallization, for instance, to be followed out in all its bearings
  without the encumbering element of weight.       The action of other
  forces upon matter may possibly be investigated thus, without
  the consideration    of weight : these forces doubtless manifest
  themselves by vibrations of a greater or less extent and of various
  configurations ; among them are the mechanical vibrations
  which produce sound, the luminous vibrations which give light,
  and the chemical vibrations which form the actinic force.
      If another argument were required to show that these very
  atoms, which some minds consider so tangible, have only an ex
  istence in the minds of atomists and not a real existence, the fact

126           Prof. W. A. Norton on Molecular Physics.
that some chemists suppose one kind of atom to exist for mecha
nical science and another kind for chemical science would supply
the want.     The chemical and mechanical atoms are supposed in
reality to be identical ; that   is,identicality  predicable of two
                                                  is
things that are not the same.
    The writer believes that    a  false step has been unwittingly
taken  by   some chemists  in  using the word atom without consi
dering that the very foundation upon which they were building
their mental conceptions of the laws of combination was simply
an hypothesis; repetition, combined with an illusive appearance
of reality and certainty, doubtless contributed to the hold which
physical atoms have upon some master minds.          Dalton unques
tionably required the notion of physical atoms to define multiple
proportions to himself but at the present day they are hin
                          ;                                     a
drance, and must be classified with the crystalline spheres of
Ptolemy, the electric fluid of the early electricians, and the
phlogiston of Stahl.

SINCE
   Professor      Bayma in the September Number of the Philo
sophical Magazine, my attention has been diverted to other more
urgent matters, which have left me little time or inclination to
continue the discussion.       This I have little occasion to regret,
as, upon  a  full consideration of the case,I   have come to the con
clusion that the proper point has been reached for bringing the
controversy between Professor Bayma and myself to               a close.
His objections to my theoretical views have been answered as
fully as the case seems to demand, and he has replied at length
to my criticisms of his own views.        We now stand upon the
same ground. Whatever temptation there may be to expose the
futility of many of the arguments urged         insupport of his posi
tions, and call attention to the misconceptions into which he has
fallen,
      I   am willing to rest the case here in the hands of the       in
telligent and candid reader — only entering       a disclaimer against
the position taken   by my learned and agile opponent, at the close
of his reply, that we differ only on " few points of secondary
                                           a
importance," and agree, in the main, in our fundamental views.
The reader who has had the patience to follow us           in this pro
tracted discussion, will not fail to perceive wherein we differ and

 wherein we agree, and that the controversy, so far from having
 been about non-essentials, has been for the most part about ra
 dical differences of doctrine or of scientific method. What actual
 scientific importance this diversity of fundamental views may
have, the future must decide.           In bringing our amicable contro
 versy to a close,    I  must not withhold my acknowledgment of the
courtesy and general fairness manifested by my opponent, both
 in the attacks he has made upon my positions, and in the main
tenance of his own.
               XVIII.     Memoir   on the  Expansion of Gases,
                           By M. V. Regnault*.
        AVE     collected in this memoir the numerous experiments         I
 1Hhave made          during the last twenty years, to determine the
losses of heat which a gas undergoes when it expands under the
very various conditions in which this phenomenon is met with in
nature and in our laboratories.          I  shall briefly indicate the idea
which has led me to undertake these researches ; the reader will
thus more readily understand the successive phases through
which they have passed.
    When in 1842         I commenced my experiments to determine
the calorific capacity of gases,      I  thought I had found a certain
and easy     method    of  determining with the same apparatus and
without any petitio principii : —
    1. The specific heat of a gas under constant pressure and
changing volume ;
    2. Its specific heat under constant volume, the pressure vary
ing so as to leave the volume constant.
    In the Me"moires de VAcadimie, vol. xxxi. p. 58, I have de
scribed the experiments I have made with the view of determining
the specific heat of a great number of vapours and gases under
a constant pressure but with variation of volume; I have no
need to revert to them.         I will merely say that in these experi
ments the heated gas traversed a calorimeter with a constant
velocity, retaining virtually the same pressure.            The heat which
it gave to the calorimeter served for calculating the calorific capa
city of the gas between the limits of temperature which the gas
had attained.        In this mode of working there is only a single,
extremely small correction — that due to the circumstance that
the hot gas arrives at the calorimeter with a far greater molecular
velocity than that with which it emerges.
    To obtain with the same apparatus the specific heat under a
constant volume, I made the heated gas enter the calorimeter

128          M. V. Regnault      on the         Expansion of Gases.
with such an excess of pressure that, when the gas expanded to
the surrounding atmospheric pressure, its volume should remain
constant notwithstanding the change of temperature.
    With the ideas I then had as to the structure of gases, and
which were at that time generally admitted by physicists,                      I
thought I had thus realized the conditions under which the spe
cific heat of a gas under constant volume can be directly obtained.
    I intended to make these new experiments when those which
gave the specific heats under constant pressure had been termi
nated.     But these latter occupied me during several years, and
I decided on the 17th of July, 1848, to deposit in the Academy
of Sciences a sealed packet which contains a complete descrip
tion of my method for determining successively, with the same
apparatus, the specific heat of a gas under constant pressure
and that of this gas under constant volume (Comptes Rendus,
vol. xxvii. p. 77).
    Nevertheless the first experiment which               I
                                               thus made, the 22nd
of October, 1849, gave me a far different result from that which
I expected :    I
                found that the gas undergoing expansion in the ca
lorimeter indicated the same calorific capacity as that which it gave
me when it traversed the calorimeter without undergoing expansion.
    To render this fact more striking,                I
                                              greatly increased the
pressure under which    the heated gas reached  the capillary orifice.
I  then observed that the heat given up by the hot gas when it
undergoes a great expansion in the calorimeter, is even a little
greater than that which is given by the same gas while traversing
this calorimeter and at the same time retaining its elastic force.
    Thus, under the conditions in which my experiments were made,
the specific heat of gas under constant volume is virtually equal
to the specific heat of this gas under constant pressure.          an I
nounced this fact to the Academy on the 18th of April, 1853
(compare Comptes Rendus de I'Acadimie des Sciences, vol. xxxvi.
p. 680).
     Ihad also to conclude from my experiments that, if the com
pressed air enters the calorimeter at the same temperature as the
calorimeter, the expansion should take place tlierein without causing
it   to undergo a sensible   change   of temperature.
    This in fact is what 1 proved by a great number of experiments.
    In 8hort,my researches have shown me that, when a gas expands
under the conditions of my experiments {that is to say, when it
leaves the calorimetrical apparatus with the whole of the motion
which the expansion has given to         the calorific phenomenon  far
                                                                      it is
                                          it)
                                           ,
different from that which obtains for the same gas when
contained in    a state of rest in    cylinder and when its volume
                                      a                                       is is
made   to  vary     by
                     displacing  a piston.
   At the present timC the mechanical theory of heat quite ex

plains these differences : it shows that it is not sufficient to con
sider the initial and final densities of the gas, but that account
must be taken of the changes produced in the motion of trans
lation of the gas, and even in its molecular motions.
    It is easy to define theoretically a certain number of conditions
in which a gas may undergo the same change of density and ex
perience different variations of temperature.       But it is far more
difficult, and often even impossible, to realize these conditions
by experiment, retaining the simplicity of tlie theoretical enuncia
tion. Most frequently secondary phenomena are produced which
cannot even now be clearly defined, and of which it is still more
difficult to measure or calculate the effects. .
    I  shall distinguish in this memoir two kinds of expansion ;
for I have had to employ for each of them a special method : —
    1. Simple expansion, which I shall call statical expansion ; it
is that which a gas at rest undergoes when by the aid of external
work the space it occupies is increased, the gas resuming the
state of rest after the expansion.      There is the same mass of gas
in a state of rest in the calorimetric reservoir at the commence
 ment and at the end of the experiment.
     2, The expansion which I shall call dynamical ; this is when
a gas either at rest or in motion expands in traversing an orifice,
and then enters or escapes from the calorimetrical apparatus with
all its acquired velocity. The mass of the gas contained in the ca
lorimetrical reservoir is not constant during the experiment : one
 portion enters or escapes, with a variable velocity determined by
 the varying excess of pressure.
    I shall commence with the dynamical expansion, although it is
the most complex; but it is that which I first studied, as it fre
quently occurred in all my researches on gases. The numerous
experiments which refer to it may be divided into two parts.
    The first comprises those in which a gas compressed and in
 motion reaches the calorimeter and emerges from it with its ori
 ginal motion modified by the effect of the expansion.          The calo
 rimeter contains then at the commencement and           at   the  end of
the experiment the same very small quantity; its temperature is
modified solely by the calorific      effects that the gas undergoes
which traverses it.
    The second part refers to experiments in which the total quan
tity of gas is contained in a calorimetrical reservoir either at the
commencement or at the end of the experiment.                I  shall here
distinguish    two  cases.
    First case. — The compressed gas is in a state of rest in the
calorimetrical reservoir.     It is allowed to escape by opening a
more or less capillary orifice ; it escapes into the atmosphere
with the varying velocity produced by its successive expansion.

    Second    case. — The calorimetrical   reservoir contains   gas at
rest under     the pressure of the external atmosphere.       The gas
compressed in a large reservoir escapes by a capillary orifice and
passes at a known temperature into the calorimetrical        reservoir,
the gas of which it successively compresses until the elastic force
has become the same in the two reservoirs.
                  Dynamical Expansion. — First Part.
I. Heat    absorbed by the expansion of a compressed gas when it
    traverses a small orifice in a thin plate. (Experiments of 1 850
    to 1854.)
    The gas is compressed in a large reservoir; it traverses a long
 serpentine which keeps it at a constant temperature as far as its
 capillary orifice, through which it expands and becomes in equi
 librium with the external pressure.       The change of temperature
 which it thus undergoes is determined by the calorimetrical me
 thod.    I  have discriminated  two cases.
    First case. — The   compressed gas reaches the capillary orifice
 with a temperature but little different from that of the calori
 meter.     In this case —
    Atmospheric air undergoes a diminution of temperature, which
 amounts to 0o,3176 for a diminution in elastic force of 1 metre
of mercury.
    In  the case of hydrogen, the variation      in temperature is im
perceptible.
    Lastly, for carbonic acid, the lowering of temperature is more
 considerable than for atmospheric air; for it reaches l°-64 for a
 diminution in pressure of 1 metre of mercury.
     These effects are due to several causes acting simultaneously.
     1. Gases which deviate from Mariotte's law in the direction
 ascertained for air and carbonic acid undergo an excess of expan
 sion which gives rise to a lowering of temperature proportional
 to this excess ; as hydrogen deviates from this law in the oppo
 site direction, it probably disengages a small quantity of heat.
    2. The gaseous molecules are at rest in the large reservoir ;
 on passing through the capillary orifice, not only do they expand
 and drive back the external atmosphere, consuming the work ex
 pended by the tranquil gas in the reservoir, but they assume
 successively a great velocity of translation, and therefore a vis
 viva which is produced by their own heat, and which determines
 a lowering of temperature which is frequently greater than that
 due to the first cause.
    3. In proportion as the gas expands in the calorimeter the ve
 locity of translation of the molecules diminishes, and there is a
disengagement of heat which partially compensates for the cool
ing due to the second cause ; but there cannot be exact compen

               M. V. Regnault      on the   Expansion of Gases.        131
 eation, because the gas always emerges from the calorimeter with
 a great velocity.
    For atmospheric air, and especially for carbonic acid, the re
 sultant is a notable cooling.
    For hydrogen, the three causes, acting in contrary directions,
neutralize each other, especially owing to the small atomic weight
 of the gas.
    Second case. — The compressed gas reaches the calorimeter
with a temperature much higher than that of the calorimeter,
 so that there is not merely expansion but also cooling of the
 gas.
    This second     case   is more complicated than the first, because
it comprehends the calorific effects produced by changes of
molecular velocity, the modifications produced in the consti
tution of the gas by change of pressure, and those, moreover,
which arise from change of temperature.                I have been led to
consider a special calorific capacity which comprehends the whole
of these effects.
    For air, this calorific capacity with expansion is appreciably
greater than the calorific capacity of air under constant pressure.
    For hydrogen it is the same.
    Lastly, for carbonic acid it is considerably smaller than the
calorific capacity under constant pressure at high temperatures,
and much greater at very low temperatures.
II.   Experiments to determine the heat which atmospheric air ab
    sorbs when it expands from a high pressure to the pressure of the
    atmosphere, not suddenly as in the preceding chapter, but suc
    cessively.   (Experiments of 1853.)
    In the preceding experiments the air compressed in the reser
voir expands completely on emerging from a single orifice in the
interior of the calorimeter; the expanded gas circulates then in
the superposed boxes of the calorimeter, and acquires the tem
perature of the water of the calorimeter before emerging into the
atmosphere.       I have endeavoured in the experiments I am about
to describe to effect this expansion step by step at several periods
in the interior of the calorimeter, so as to ascertain whether this
circumstance      exerts an influence.
    The special calorimeter which          I used for these experiments,
and which I shall call calorimeter for successive expansions, con
sists of a series of brass tubes A, B, C, D, . . . , 8 millims. in the
clear, connected with each other by tubulures.                These tubes,
twelve    in  number,    are  vertical,  and  form a circular crown in the
interior of the calorimetric vessel.
    The reservoir containing the compressed gas communicates
with a long worm arranged in a bath of water.              The end of this
                                        K 2

132         M. V. Regnault     on the Expansion of Gases.
worm fits somewhat tightly in the tubulure of the first tube A ;
the junction is hermetically cemented.
    When the stopcock of the large reservoir is opened, the
gas circulates in the worm, retaining almost the same pressure
as in the reservoir, but acquiring the temperature of the water
of the bath.     This pressure is in like manner transmitted to the
first tube A of the calorimeter ; expansion only commences as
the gas emerges from the capillary orifice of the first tube A.
A second expansion takes place as the gas passes through the
second capillary orifice, so that the elastic force of the gas is less
in the tube C than in the tube B. On emerging from each of
the vertical tubes, there is an expansion, until the gas reaches the
twelfth and last tube, where it is virtually under the pressure of
the atmosphere.
    The capillary apertures which the gas thus successively tra
verses have gradually larger diameters as they become more dis
tant from the orifice, in order that the relative value of the ex
pansion may be nearly the same for each orifice, notwithstanding
the successive variation which the pressure experiences in each
vertical tube.
    The experiment is otherwise made in exactly the same manner
as when the calorimeter was used with superposed boxes and
a  single expansion.
    Experiments made by means of the calorimeter with successive
expansions gave the following values of yl (that is to say, the
lowering of temperature experienced by the gas for a diminution
in pressure of 1 metre of mercury) : —

                                         Mean of y, = -0-3548
    The last three experiments were made under almost the same
pressure, but with very different velocities of outflow.       They show
that the value of yx is greater the less the velocity of the ex
panded gas on its emergence from the calorimeter.               I give the
reason for this in my memoir.
    In order that the results of various experiments may be per

               M. V. Regnault      on the  Expansion of Gases.          133
  fectly comparable, the velocity of the gas in emerging from the
  calorimeter should be exactly the same.         It would be particularly
  interesting to arrange the apparatus and conduct the experiments
  so that the velocities of transport of the expanded gas were
 the same, on emerging from the calorimeter, as those which they
 possess when they arrive with their initial pressure in the first
 tube of the calorimeter.         For this purpose the sections should
 be inversely as the densities of the gases.          I have not, however,
 attempted to realize this condition in the experiments I have
just described.
     It would also be of great interest to know the value of y, when
 the gas emerges from the calorimeter with an infinitely small
 velocity ; this would be tlie limit o/y.        It is clear that this can
 not be attained merely by a calorimetrical method ; for the con
 ditions cannot be realized in which the gas finally assumes the
 state of rest and remains constantly at the same temperature as
 the calorimeter.       It could only be obtained by determining very
 accurately    the  temperature of the gas on its emerging from the
 calorimeter,    and   the velocity of the current at the place where
 the bulb of the thermometer which gives this temperature is
 placed.     In my memoir many experiments are given in which             I
 have endeavoured to determine the temperature of the gas on its
emergence ; but this determination always presents uncertainties.
 III.   Calorific  effects produced by air which expands in traversing
      more or less long capillary tubes.      (Experiments of 1854.)
     In my first mode of working, the air suddenly expands on
emerging from       a single capillary orifice perforated in a thin plate.
In    the second the expansion was made successively on passing
through twelve orifices in thin plates placed at equal distances
from each other.          In the third method, which I am about to
describe, I wished the expansion to take place in an absolutely
continuous manner, the air traversing a very long capillary tube.
The air reached the entrance of this tube under a pressure very
                                                                            "
little different from that which it had in the large reservoir, and
on escaping from this tube it met a pressure very little different
from that of the atmosphere.           I was especially desirous of ascer
taining    thus  whether    the friction  of the air on a great length of
tube-wall modified to any perceptible extent the calorific effects
produced by the simple expansion of the gas.
    The large reservoir in which the air is compressed is hermeti
cally connected with the end of a long copper worm placed in
a bath filled with water at the surrounding temperature.               The
other end of this worm is hermetically cemented to the com
mencement of the worm placed in the calorimeter.
    The worm of the calorimeter consists of two copper tubes

   134         M. V. Regnault    on the  Expansion of Gases.
  wound on the same cylinder; each of these tubes is 1£ metre in
   length, and their internal section is 6 millions. Between these two
   tubes is intercalated a silver capillary tube, the internal calibre and
   length of which are varied.      This tube is coiled in a spiral on
   the same cylinder as the portions of the copper spiral between
   which it is intercalated, and it is hermetically cemented by means
   of tin-solder. The water of the calorimeter, and that of the bath
    (which gives to the air a known temperature before it reaches the
   worm of the calorimeter), are kept in a perfectly uniform state
   of agitation.    The temperatures are indicated by thermometers,
   each Centigrade degree of which has twenty divisions, and which
   have been accurately compared at the same temperatures as those
   they are exposed to in the experiments.
      When the stopcock of the reservoir with compressed air is
   opened, the air traverses the worm of the bath without sensible
   change of pressure, but assuming the temperature of the water,
   and passes without any change of pressure into the first part of
   the copper worm of the calorimeter.         Expansion commences at
   the entrance into the narrow silver worm ; and on emerging from
   this capillary tube the air flows through the second part of the
   copper worm, where it resumes the pressure of the atmosphere,
   and emerges after having assumed exactly the temperature of
   the water of the calorimeter.
       In four series of experiments the length of the capillary
   tube varied from O09 metre to l-79 metre ; the quantities of gas
   which emerged in a minute varied from 2*2 grnis. to 13*5 grms.,
   while the values of y remained almost exactly the same. Yet,
   from the results of the fourth series, it must be admitted that
   they increase with the velocity of the outflow — that is to say, in
    versely as the length of the tube.       This fact may be attributed
   to heat disengaged by the friction of the gas along the sides;
   but it is far more probable that it arises from the fact that the
   gas retains then a greater velocity on emerging from the calori
   meter, and that it thus carries off a greater quantity of heat in
*
   the state of vis viva.
      In three new series the lengths of the- capillary tube varied
   from 0'07 metre to 1*16 metre; the quantities of gas which
   emerged per minute changed from 12 to 46 grms. ; but the
   values of y only underwent very small alterations : they increase
   with the velocity of the outflow more regularly than in the group
  of the first four series. We arrive therefore at the same con
  clusion.
      In other experiments I suppressed the two pieces of wider
  copper tube between which the capillary silver tube was inter
  calated, so that the air emerged directly from the capillary tube
  into the atmosphere.

             M. V. Regnault       on the    Expansion    of Gases.             135
    The values of y then became for the same pressure much
greater than in the preceding series, in which the expansion of
the gas took place entirely in the calorimeter.   Thus the cooling
is far greater when the silver capillary tube debouches directly
out of the calorimeter into the external air than when the gas
on passing from the capillary tube can expand completely in
the boxes of the calorimeter, and then traverse them with a
small velocity before escaping.     This obviously arises from the
circumstance that in the first case the gaseous molecules con
stantly increase in velocity until their emergence from the calo
rimeter, while in the second case the gas undergoes, on the con
trary, a material loss of vis viva in the boxes of the calorimeter,
to which it thus abandons a considerable quantity of heat, which
diminishes by so much the cooling observed.
    These latter experiments show that the cooling is produced
during the circulation and by the expansion of the gas in the
silver capillary tube, while the end of the expansion on the out
side, with the modifications which are the consequence of     rather it,
gives rise to a disengagement     of heat, owing to the destruction             of
vis viva.   I wished to establish this fact more directly            by
                                                                    expe
riment, and had recourse to an apparatus consisting of two calo
            I
rimeters, A and B.      The first calorimeter, A, small in capacity,
contains the silver capillary tube rolled spirally          the first end
                                                            ;
of this tube fits in the long copper worm immersed in the large
water-bath, and which brings the compressed air from the reser
voir; the other end of the silver tube fits         the lower box of the
                                                    in
second calorimeter B, which           like
                                      is   those    Ihave used to deter
mine the calorific capacity of gases under the pressure of the
atmosphere.      This second calorimeter terminates in               tube
                                                                      a
through which the gas       is liberated.     This latter tube fits in          a
larger tubulure, in which        iskept     very delicate thermometer,
                                            a
and which by a lateral tubulure conducts the gas to            meter.
                                                                a
   Experiments made with this new apparatus led to the follow
ing conclusions —:
   1.  The cooling effect of the expansion         produced almost en
                                                    is
tirely in the silver capillary tube.      Owing  to  the great conducti
vity of silver and the smallness of the section of the tube, the
gas emerges from the capillary tube sensibly at the same tem
perature as the water of the first calorimeter, but with               far a
greater molecular velocity    than      had
                                       it    on entering.
   2.   A new expansion takes place in the superposed boxes of
the second calorimeter; this expansion             much weaker.
                                                    is                The
small lowering of temperature which may be thus produced                        is
more than compensated        by the heat which the gas abandons in
losing the greater part of its vis viva so that the total effect
                                                ;
consists in a  considerable heating of this calorimeter.

132           M. V. Regnault     on the  Expansion of Gases.
     3. The expansion is almost complete on emerging from the
second calorimeter ; but the gas still retains its velocity.        If it
passes into a space of larger section, the velocity of its molecular
transport diminishes ; a disengagement of heat ensues, which
produces an appreciable elevation of the temperature of the gas.
      4. To obtain the true quantity of heat taken from the sur
 rounding medium by the gas which expands under the conditions
 of the experiment, and without change of temperature, the gas
 should emerge from the second calorimeter destitute of vis viva
 (a condition which in practice it is impossible to realize), or with
 a vis viva equal to that which it had on entering.
      In continuation of these long researches I was led to construct
 a single calorimeter in which are performed all the expansions
 which successively take place in the two connected calorimeters.
 I   have definitively adopted this arrangement for atmospheric air
 and for all other gases, because it seemed to combine most
 guarantees for exactitude.          I  have endeavoured to define as
  exactly   as possible the conditions in which the gas undergoes its
  successive expansions.
      Numerous experiments have given for yi a greater value than
  that I obtained in the expansion of air through orifices in a thin
  plate — that is to say, y, = — 0°-377 for a variation in pressure of
  1 metre of mercury.        This is the value  I definitively assume for
  atmospheric air when the expansion takes place under the clearly
  defined conditions of the experiment.
       I have previously spoken of the experiments       I made to deter
  mine the heat absorbed by carbonic acid in         motion   when it ex
  pands without altering its temperature.          This quantity of heat
  is far greater for carbonic acid than for air ; it appears moreover
  to increase sensibly with the pressure.          In these experiments
   the absolute pressure never exceeded 9-9 metres of mercury.
       I was desirous of working with the new apparatus under far
   higher pressures, especially under those which gaseous carbonic
   acid retains in the reservoir of Thilorier's apparatus, in which
   it has been liquefied.     I conducted the experiment as follows.
      The reservoir   of Thilorier's apparatus, containing about4kilogs.
   of liquid carbonic acid, is kept in a large vessel of water at the
   surrounding temperature, which maintains it at a virtually con
   stant temperature.     I assume that the metallic mass of this reser
   voir constantly restores the heat absorbed by the volatilization
   of the liquid acid. A very strong copper tube connects the worm
   of the large bath with the atmosphere of gaseous carbonic acid
   of the reservoir.     The calorimeter is arranged exactly as it was
   for the experiments on atmospheric air ; it is furnished with the
   same thermometers.         A continuous and perfectly regular agita
   tion mixes the layers of water of the calorimeter and those of the
  vessel which contains the large worm.

              M. V. Regnault        on the   Expansion of Gases.            137
    The apparatus being arranged and the stirring having been
continued for a quarter of an hour, I make observations during
the first five minutes, during which the calorimeter is only sub
ject to external disturbing causes; an assistant then suddenly
opens the stopcock of Thilorier's reservoir.                  The gaseous car
bonic acid    bursts    into  the   worm    of  the vessel, where it produces
the pressure of the reservoir, then passes through the capillary
worm of silver, where it expands, and enters the superposed
boxes of the calorimeter with a slight excess of pressure over the
 external air.
     A water manometer, communicating by a tubulure with the
 upper gas-box of the calorimeter, only indicates an excess of pres
 sure of 50 millims., which corresponds to 3-7 millims. of mer
 cury. Thus the gas only retains a very slight excess of pressure
 on emerging from the calorimeter.
     The flow is permitted to last four minutes ; this time is suffi
 cient for the passage of about 120 litres of carbonic acid.                 The
 stopcock   of  the   reservoir  is  then   suddenly   closed,  the  observation
 of the thermometers continued minute uy minute until the tenth
 minute. Finally, the variations of the thermometer of the ca
 lorimeter are followed during the last five minutes, when it is no
 longer subjected to any but external disturbing causes.
     The greatest care must be devoted to the construction and
 preservation of the apparatus ; for it must keep a gas under a
 pressure of about fifty-five atmospheres without the least loss.
     The elastic force of the carbonic acid which reaches the calo
 rimeter is calculated from the temperature t of the water sur
 rounding the Thilorier reservoir, and by the aid of the formula
  which I have given (Mimoires de I'Academie, vol. xxxi. p. 130).
  I assume that this elastic force is maintained from the reservoir
  until the arrival of the gas at the entrance of the silver capillary
  worm.     It is probable that it is really somewhat less; but the
  difference must be very small, for the section of the silver ca
 pillary is but a tenth that of the large worm of the vessel.
      The volume of the carbonic acid used in each experiment is
  indicated by the gas-meter.
      Combining the results thus obtained for carbonic acid under
  high pressure with those        I   previously obtained under lower pres
  sures, I have constructed the following Table : —

 138           M. V. Regnault    on the  Expansion of Gases.
     It will be seen that the cooling increases more rapidly than
 the excess of pressure which produces the outflow.
     The considerable cooling which carbonic acid undergoes by its
 expansion when it retains its acquired vis viva, explains several
 phenomena which have been observed on carbonic acid liquefied
 in Thilorier's apparatus.      Thus, when the liquid acid escapes
 from the reservoir through a narrow orifice, and is received in a
 small open receiver, a great part of the liquid congeals to a snowy
 mass which fills the whole of the receiver.         This effect is ordi
 narily attributed to the heat absorbed by carbonic acid when it
 assumes the gaseous state ; this heat would be imparted to it
 by the carbonic acid which remains liquid, the temperature of
 which thus sinks below its freezing-point.         If this explanation
 were correct, the solid acid should present the appearance of a
 continuous mass applied against the sides of the receiver, and
 not as a snowy mass which completely fills it.         The evaporiza-
 tion of the liquid certainly gives a gas whose temperature is very
 low ; but the subsequent expansion of this gas greatly depresses
 its temperature again ; so that it is really the gaseous carbonic
 acid formed which congeals, and not that which remains liquid.
    When the gaseous acid which forms the atmosphere above the
liquid acid is allowed to escape from the reservoir by a capillary
 orifice, it is observed that the orifice is frequently closed by small
 crystals of solid acid.    To the cold produced by the expansion
is due this momentary congelation.
    In fine, my experiments with capillary silver tubes prove that
when a gas flows, even with considerable velocity, along very
extended sides, there is no appreciable disengagement of heat
which could be attributed to the friction of the gaseous mole
cules against these sides.
    This conclusion is opposed to the view generally held ; and
many facts may be cited which seem to contradict it.               I will
mention the most important.
    A projectile which traverses the air with great velocity becomes
much heated.        This fact is attributed to the heat disengaged
by the friction of the projectile against the molecules of the air
which it traverses.
    Meteorites fall through our atmosphere with extreme velo
city ; they become heated to incandescece, and melt, either en
tirely or merely on their surface. This fact is attributed to the
heat disengaged by friction against the gaseous molecules.
    I think that in both cases the heat comes from another cause,
and is merely due to the heat disengaged by the compression of
the   air.
    When    a body   in motion traverses the air with    a greater velo

              M. V. Regnault   on the Expansion of  Gases.         139
city than that of sound, the effects of the elasticity of the air are
annulled, and the compression produced by the moving body
has not time to reach the adjacent layers before they in their
turn are compressed by the body.       In consequence of this inertia
the air becomes compressed as it would be in a pneumatic sy
ringe.     A great part of the heat which is the result of this com
pression passes into the moving body, the temperature of which
it raises.    Moreover the moving body is not affected by the ex
pansion of the air producing cold ; for this expansion does not
take place till after it has passed.      Thus, in my opinion, the
moving body always, proceeding with the same velocity, collects
 by the compression of the air the heat which it disengages, and
is not affected by the cooling produced by the subsequent expan
sion of the layers of air which it has just traversed.
    It is evident moreover that the compression of the air will be
more energetic the greater the velocity of the moving body ; the
temperature of the moving body will rise then successively until
it is equal to that assumed by a layer of air which instantane
ously undergoes the same compression in the pneumatic syringe.
Thus is well explained the very high temperature which a me
teorite assumes when traversing the air with a far greater velocity
 than that of the propagation of sound.
    A heating of the same kind, but less, would be produced in
 a moving body which traversed the air with a lower velocity
 than that of sound.     In this case also the moving body would
 be  more   influenced by the heat disengaged by compression than
 it would be by the absorption of heat by expansion.        The two
 effects would virtually compensate each other when the velocity
 was very small.
    In my opinion there is no heat disengaged by the friction of
 two bodies, except when the molecules of at least one of them
 are not quite free — that is to say, when they are under the influ
 ence of some force of aggregation.      From our observations this
 absolute liberty would only be met with in the imponderablefluids,
 such as the aether which transmits the luminous vibrations.      It is
 not perfect in our gases; and from this fact alone the motion of a
 gas against a solid must disengage a certain quantity of heat, which
 results solely from the transformation into heat of the loss of vis
 viva undergone by the molecules in overcoming their internal
 resistances.     My experiments prove that this quantity of heat
 is so small for atmospheric air that it escapes our means of ob
 servation.
    Liquids have always more or less viscosity, which proves that
 their particles have not perfect mobility.    The passage of a liquid
 through a tube must therefore disengage by friction an appre
 ciable quantity of heat; and this quantity must vary with differ

  140          M. V. Regnault     on the  Expansion of Gases.
  ent liquids.    I have several times made experiments in this direc
  tion, but they are not yet complete enough for publication.
     In solids, lastly, especially in those which are very hard, the
  molecules have very little mobility ; the friction of these bodies
  against each other must, then, produce considerable disengage
  ment of heat, even when there is no disaggregation.           In all cases
 the disengaged heat arises from the transformation of a percep
  tible external motion into a molecular vibratory motion about the
 position of equilibrium, which is only manifested by its calorific
 effects ; so that the disengagement of heat by friction always cor
 responds to a loss of vis viva.
     Mathematical theory supposes that bodies possess perfect elas
 ticity ; this is implicitly assumed in establishing the primordial
 equations.     It is supposed, moreover, that the motion cannot
 change its nature nor be communicated to other media.               Lastly,
 no account is taken of the materiality of bodies ; for no allowance
 is made for the modifications which gravity introduces into mo
 lecular motions.     In the case of the aether its gravity need not be
 taken into account ; but the modification is recognized which the
 elasticity of the aether undergoes in transparent material sub
 stances, because it is necessary to admit this in order to explain
refraction.
     Hence the laws deduced from the mathematical theory of elas
ticity should only be capable of absolute verification in the case
of media which possess perfect elasticity ; and we only observe
 this in the case of the aether which transmits luminous vibra
tions.     Experiment shows us that the velocity of propagation in
the aether is excessive as compared with what we observe in mate
rial bodies.     May we not conclude thence that in a medium of
absolutely perfect elasticity the velocity of propagation would be
infinite?     According to this, the aether alone approaches far
towards this perfection ; but there still remains to it some mate
riality, which leaves it under the influence of material bodies, and
in virtue of which it offers an appreciable resistance to the motion
of the stars which traverse it.
     However this may be, I think that the degree of elastic perfec
tion of a body may be appreciated by the velocity with which it
transmits a disturbance.        The velocity of propagation is greater
in solids than in liquids, and greater in liquids than in gases.
Hence gases should deviate from the mathematical laws of elas
ticity more than solids and than liquids, which in fact is what
experiment proves.

ture and elastic force in the various parts of a current of gas when
it undergoes sudden or successive modifications of its density,
we should have a simple means of determining the quantities of
heat which are lost or gained in the various parts of its course.
My memoir contains a great number of experiments made in.
this direction.
    I  have employed in succession mercurial thermometers, air-
thermometers,       and thermoelectric    elements.   The expansion
sometimes took place through an orifice in a thin plate, some
times through a capillary tube, and sometimes through porous
plates.     It is impossible to give an account of these experiments
within the limits to which 1 must confine this extract.
    A large reservoir contains air under a pressure of 8 metres of
mercury which is maintained virtually constant.         It is enclosed,
as usual, in a large vessel of water, the temperature of which re
 mains unchanged during an experiment.             The reservoir com
 municates with a worm placed in the same vessel ; its length is
 12 metres, and internal section 20 millims.
    The end of the worm just projects from the side of the large
 vessel, and is closed by a metal plate in which is perforated a
 small orifice.    A tube of thin brass, the length of which can
 be varied, tits, with some friction, on the projecting part of the
 worm.
    The temperature of the air after its escape through the capil
 lary orifice is determined by a mercurial thermometer, the bulb
 of which can be brought more or less near the orifice.
    When the bulb of the small thermometer is at about 10 mil
 lims. from the capillary orifice, it marks l°-8 less than the ther
 mometer of the large vessel.       If it be gradually removed from
 the orifice, the temperature rises rather rapidly, and the differ
 ence of temperature is only some tenths of a degree when the
 bulb of the small thermometer approaches the orifice of the
 large terminal tube.
     If from the distance of 10 millims., at which there was a dif
 ference in temperature of l°-8, the bulb of the small thermo
 meter is gradually brought nearer the orifice, the difference of
 temperature, in tead of increasing, diminishes very briskly; it
 even changes in sign when the bulb of the thermometer is
  brought almost into contact with the sides of the orifice.
     Thus in this experiment the small thermometer shows the
  greatest cooling when its bulb is 10 millims. from the orifice.
 The cooling diminishes as the bulb is removed from the capil
 lary orifice, because the velocity of the gas diminishes; it also di
  minishes, and that very rapidly, when the distance is made less
  than 10 millims.      And the cooling changes into an apparent
  heating when the bulb almost touches the orifice.

   ] 42        M, V. Regnault    on the  Expansion of Gases.
       These results are not in discordance with those observed by
   Messrs. Joule and Thomson under analogous conditions.            But
   I  explain them   otherwise, and  I  draw from  my experiments very
   different conclusions from those which the English physicists
   have deduced from theirs.
       Thomson and Joule's experiments on the passage of air
   through an orifice in a thin plate gave far more considerable di
   minutions of temperature than those I obtained under analogous
  circumstances.      This may in a measure arise from the fact that
  the velocity of outflow was greater in their experiments, but
  especially, I think, from the fact that in their experiments the
  air is directly compressed by the pump in the long tube of uni
  form section, where it circulates rapidly as far as the small orifice
  through which it diffuses into the atmosphere.        But 1 think in
  this case the temperature is far from being uniform in the various
  parts of the tube.
      The air arrives greatly heated by the working of the pump :
  I  admit that it loses this great excess of heat during its long pas
  sage through the double worm ; but the layers of air near the
  orifice furnish directly the work which drives the gas outwards,
 losing thus a certain quantity of heat which they have not time
 to take from the fresh layers which arrive to replace them.         In
 short, I think we cannot assume for a natural gas in motion the
 principles which are propounded theoretically for the ideal gas,
 even when they would be almost true for the natural gas in a state
 of rest. As to the vis viva which the molecules assume in ex
 panding, inasmuch as its creation only takes place at the passage
 of the orifice, it certainly only takes place at the expense of the
 heat of the emerging gas, the temperature of which should thus
 be much lowered.
                             I
     In previous memoirs have frequently dwelt on the slowness
 with which air enclosed in a metal reservoir, surrounded by a
 large mass of water, reacquires the temperature of this water
 when it has been cooled by the expansion it experiences when a
 portion escapes.      When this reservoir is cylindrical, and its
 diameter is only 20 centims., from ten to fifteen minutes elapse
before the open air-manometer          which communicates with this
 reservoir resumes the stationary condition.
     Messrs. Joule and Thomson speak of a considerable disengage
 ment of heat which they have observed when air strikes against
 an obstacle opposed to its emergence, especially when it grazes
the bulb of a thermometer which is kept in the conical space of
a gutta-percha funnel, thus greatly diminishing the section which
remains free for the passage of the gas, &c.        I have never suc
ceeded in observing such a phenomenon ; and the fact appears
to me contradictory to the experiments         I have made with the

             M. V. Kegnault    on the Expansion of Gases.           143
worms formed of silver capillary tubes, where I could uever ob
serve any heat disengaged by friction.
     In my experiments on the flow of air through an orifice in a
thin plate, 1 observed that the thermometer indicated an increase
of temperature when its bulb was placed almost in contact with
the capillary orifice ; but I attributed this fact to an alteration
in shape of the bulb arising from the unequal pressures which
the current of air impressed upon it.      The following experiment
proves that this is the true explanation.
     I emptied the mercury of my thermometer and replaced it by
alcohol.     The instrument thus became far more sensitive to va
riations in temperature, owing to the greater expansibility of
alcohol, but the variations produced by external pressure remain
the same.      Now the thermometer which had thus been modified
never indicated a higher temperature than that of the bath, even
when I brought the reservoir into contact with the capillaryorifice.
 These experiments showed, moreover, that we should not use
 mercurial thermometers to determine temperatures in rapid cur
 rents of gas ; and I have had recourse to air-thermometers,         on
 the action of which the compression of the envelope exerts no
 appreciable influence.
      Now the first fact I have thus observed is that, in all positions
 of the thermometer placed in expanded air, this thermometer
 indicates a lower temperature than that marked by the thermo
 meter placed in compressed air.        The difference in temperature
 is greater the nearer the bulb is to the capillary orifice ; the maxi
 mum is attained when the bulb is pressed against this orifice,
 the surfaces not being sufficiently even to produce complete
 closing.
      This latter fact is completely opposed to the elevations of
 temperature noted by Messrs. Thomson and Joule.
      In a second series of experiments the bulb of the air-thermo
  meter placed in the expanded air had a larger diameter, so that
 it entered the tube with slight friction, and remained there.
 There was then a very narrow interval between this bulb and
 the tube which surrounded it.        I hoped thus to realize the con
 ditions in which the English physicists observed a great rise of
 temperature.
      Now it is precisely under these circumstances that I obtained
 the most cold ; it is then that the difference of temperature be
  tween the two thermometers varies least with the distance of the
  bulb from the orifice.    The explanation of these facts appears very
  simple  : in the present arrangement the air undergoes two suc
  cessive expansions — the first on emerging from the capillary ori
  fice, the second in the very narrow annular space of great dia
  meter which exists between the bulb of the thermometer and

144        M. V. Regnault     on the  Expansion    of Gases.
the tube surrounding it.      Owing to this second expansion and
the increase of vis viva, there is a great diminution in the tempe
rature of the air before and around the thermometer, of the ex
panded air ; and that explains the excess of cold indicated by this
thermometer.
   In my experiments the first expansion was greater than the
second ; but this might have been easily reversed by increasing
the section of the capillary orifice.
   The experiments I have made with thermoelectric elements
have led to the same results ; they have, moreover, enabled me to
follow far more easily the variations in temperature which the
gaseous current undergoes.       I  shall only mention a few.
   The expansion takes place in a capillary glass tube 4 centims.
in length, terminated by a glass tube 30 millims. in internal
diameter, in which is arranged one of the elements, which can
thus be brought more or less near the capillary orifice ; and the
soldering may even be placed in this orifice.
   1. The thermoelectrical solderings exhibit differences of tem
perature which are gradually smaller in proportion as one of the
solderings is removed from the orifice of the capillary tube.
   2. The greatest difference of temperature is observed when
this soldering is quite in the interior of the capillary tube, the
section of which it considerably diminishes.        It is evident, more
over, that, if the section were diminished beyond a certain limit,
the difference of temperature would, on the contrary, be dimi
nished ; for if the orifice were entirely closed, the two solderings
would be at the same temperature.
   To realize still more closely the conditions in which Messrs.
Thomson and Joule observed a great increase of temperature, I
arranged the following experiment.
    In the tubulure of the large worm          I   fit a thick disk of
gutta percha, perforated    in  the  centre  by  a  small aperture sur
mounted by a hollow cone. The thermoelectric element is sealed
in the axis of a gutta-percha cylinder terminated by a projecting
cone, which exactly fits in the hollow cone of the thick disk. The
soldering of the element is just level with the apex of the cone.
It is needless to say that the disk of gutta percha is supported by
a metal plate with a large aperture, which prevents it from being
deformed and even torn by the pressure of the compressed air.
   We here again see the lowering of temperature rapidly dimi
nish as the soldering is removed from the aperture of the disk.
It rapidly increases, on the contrary, when the cone which enve
lopes the soldering is pressed into its position.
   The greatest degree of cooling is obtained with a certain ap
proximation of the two cones. When they are brought nearer,
the cooling diminishes ; it also diminishes when they are moved

further apart.    But in neither case is the difference in tempera
ture inverted, as would be the case if there were a considerable
disengagement of heat produced by the friction of the air against
the sides.
    I shall not speak here of experiments         I have made on the
passage of air through porous plates ; in order to make them in
telligible, it would be necessary to describe apparatus, give nu
merical results, and enter into details inconsistent with the limited
extent of this extract.
                Dynamical Expansion. — Second Part.
   In the first part of this memoir I endeavoured to determine
the calorific effects produced by a gas which readies a calorime-
trical apparatus under a great pressure, which there expands to
the external atmospherical pressure, and emerges with the tem
perature of this calorimeter.     Thus the gas subjected to the ex
periment only traverses the calorimeter, in the conditions I have
mentioned, and no part of the gas remains there.          The calorific
effect is mainly produced by variations of the vis viva.
    In the second part the gas subjected to experiment is origi
nally contained in the calorimeter in a state of rest, or arrives
successively in the calorimeter under the influence of an excess of
pressure, to remain there at rest until the end of the experiment.
We thus work alternately by compression and expansion.
    In this mode of working, the statical expansion plays the prin
cipal part in the effect produced ; but the dynamical expansion
intervenes, in conditions resembling those realized in the experi
ments of the first part of this memoir. Clement and Disomies' s
method, with the modifications it has recently undergone on the
part of several experimenters, comes within the same category.
The essential difference in my mode of working consists in the
fact that the quantities of heat are determined by the calorime-
tric method, while my predecessors sought the differences in
temperature.
   These researches occupy the greater part of my memoir ;             I
have repeated them several times, altering the arrangement of
the apparatus, which here exerts a very great influence.      It is im
possible for me to give an idea by a short extract        and  without
the aid of figures.
                         Statical Expansion.
   In the third part of my memoir       I have endeavoured to realize
experimentally the conditions of      the statical expansion of gases,
measuring simply the changes of temperature produced.             I am
again obliged to refer to my complete memoir, which will soon
appear ; for the mere statement of my method would involve
lengthy explanations.

    The Chlorides of Vanadium. —Three chlorides of vanadium have
 been prepared, viz. —       :

(H=l). — This chloride formed as dark reddish brown volatile
                                      is                   a
liquid, when metallic vanadium or the mononitride            burnt in excess    is
of chlorine.   The first method adopted' for the preparation of this
chloride was to pass dry chlorine over the mononitride heated to
redness    the whole of the nitride volatilizes and
             ;                                                reddish-brown      a
liquid comes over.      In one operation 44 grammes of the crude tetra
chloride was thus prepared        the liquid
                                           ;    purified     distillation first

On fractionating,   the  liquid was  found   to boil at  154° C.   (corrected)

under 760""° of mercury.         The second method depends upon a fact
already noticed in the preceding communication, that the oxytri-
chloride (VO Cl3), prepared, according to the directions of Berzelius,
by passing dry chlorine over a mixture of the trioxide and charcoal,
possesses a port-wine colour instead of the canary-yellow tint of the
pure substance.        This dark colour is due to the formation of the
tetrachloride of vanadium ; and if the vapours of the oxytrichloride,
together with excess of dry chlorine, be passed several times over a
column of red-hot charcoal the whole of the oxygen of the oxychlo-
ride can be removed, and at last perfectly pure tetrachloride, boiling
constantly at 154°, is obtained. This reaction, it will be remembered,
served first to demonstrate the existence of oxygen in the oxytrichlo
ride.    In each distillation of the tetrachloride a peachblossom-co-
loured solid residue remained in the bulbs ; this substance is vana
dium trichloride, and it slowly burns away in excess of chlorine when
heated, forming tetrachloride.
    The composition of the tetrachloride was established by six well-
agreeing analyses, made from several different preparations.              The
mean result is : —
                                      Calculated.            Found.
             V = 51-3                   26-54                 26-87

    Owing to the facility with which the tetrachloride splits up into
trichloride and chlorine, a solid residue was left in the vapour-density
bulb, and the density of the vapour (at 219°) was found by Dumas' a
method to be 99-06 (or 6-86) instead of 96-6 (or 6-69).             By volati
lizing the liquid in a small bulb, and allowing the vapour to pass
into a large bulb already heated above the boiling-point of the liquid,
this deposition of trichloride was avoided, and the density was found
to be 90-6 or 6 69 at 205°, and 93 3 or 6-48 at 215°, the last deter
mination indicating that a partial decomposition into VC13 and CI
had occurred.        The specific gravity of the liquid tetrachloride at 0°
is 1-8584 ; it does not solidify at —18°, nor does it at this or any
higher temperature undergo change of properties on treatment with
chlorine. It not only undergoes decomposition on boiling, but at the
ordinary atmospheric temperatures it splits up into VC1, and CI.
Tubes in which the liquid tetrachloride had been sealed up have burst
by the pressure of the evolved chlorine.              Thrown into water, the
tetrachloride is at once decomposed, yielding a blue solution identical
in colour with the liquid obtained by the action of sulphurous or
sulphydric acid on vanadic acid in solution, and containing a varia
tions salt, derived from the tetroxide V304.         In order to prove that a
vanadous salt     is  formed  when  the   tetrachloride  is thrown into water,
the solution   thus   obtained was  oxidized    to vanadic  acid by a standard
permanganate       solution.   The   calculated    percentage of oxygen thus
needed according        to the formula    2VCl1 + 0 + 4HJ0=VJ04 + 8HCI

148                           Royal Society:    —
is 4*14; the percentage          of oxygen found by experiment was
4-11.
    The solution of the tetrachloride in water does not bleach ; but
if the vapour be led into water a liquid is obtained which bleaches
litmus.     Vanadium tetrachloride acts violently on dry alcohol and
ether, forming deep-coloured       liquids.   The author is engaged upon
the examination of this reaction.
     Bromine and vanadium tetrachloride, sealed up and heated toge
ther, do not combine ; on the contrary, trichloride is deposited.
 Hence it is clear that vanadium does not readily form a pentad com
pound with the chlorous elements.
     2. Vanadium Trichloride,        VC13= 157-8.— The trichloride is a
 solid body, crystallizing in splendid peachblossom-coloured shining
tables, closely resembling in appearance the crystal of chromium
sesquichloride.     It is non-volatile in hydrogen, and, when heated in
the air, it decomposes, glowing with absorption of oxygen, and form
ing the pentoxide.        Heated in hydrogen the trichloride first loses
one atom of chlorine, forming the dichloride (VC12), and afterwards,
on exposure to a higher temperature, loses all its chlorine, leaving
metallic vanadium as a grey lustrous powder.               The trichloride is
extremely hygroscopic, deliquescing on exposure to air to a brown
liquid.     The trichloride is best prepared by the quick decomposition
of the tetrachloride at its boiling-point, or by its slow decomposition
at the ordinary temperature of the air.             The crystalline powder
obtained by either of these methods only requires freeing from ad
hering tetrachloride by drying in carbon dioxide at 1 60° in order to
yield good analytical results.
                                 Calculated.        Mean of 4 analyses.
           V = 51-3                   32-5               32-57

    The trichloride thrown into water does not at once dissolve; but as
soon as the crystals get moistened, a brown solution is formed, which
becomes green on addition of a drop of hydrochloric acid, and con
tains a hypovanadic salt in solution.           This green tint is identical
with that got by reducing a solution of vanadic acid in presence of
magnesium. According to the equation 2VCl3 + O2-f-3H2O=VJ0J
 + 6HC1, the solution of the trichloride requires 10" 14 per cent. of
oxygen to bring it up to vanadic acid, whilst analysis showed that
 1 0" 1 per cent. was necessary.      The specific gravity of the trichloride
at 18*13 3-00.
    3. Vanadium Bichloride, VC13= 122-3. — The dichloride is a solid
crystallizing in fine bright apple-green micaceous plates.            It is pre
pared by passing     the  vapour  of   vanadium   tetrachloride   mixed     with
hydrogen through        a  glass tube    heated  to  dull   redness.     If  the
heat be pushed further a blackish crystalline powder, consisting of
a mixture of lower chloride and metal, is obtained.            The dichloride,
when strongly heated in hydrogen, loses all its chlorine, leaving

       Vanadium dichloride is extremely hygroscopic       ; when thrown into
   water a violet-coloured solution is formed, identical in tint with the
   liquid containing a hypovanadous salt obtained by reducing vanadic
   acid in solution in presence of zinc- or sodium-amalgam ; and like
   this latter liquid, the solution of dichloride in water bleaches strongly
  by reduction.
      Oxidized by permanganate this liquid required 1878 per cent. of
   oxygen (on the dichloride taken) to bring it np to vanadic acid,
  whereas the equation 2VCI, + O3 + 2H30=V30,+4HC1 requires
   19-6 per cent.     The specific gravity of vanadium dichloride at 18° is
  3 23.
      Metallic Vanadium, V=51-3. — Although from what we now know
  of the characters of vanadium it appeared unlikely that any com
  pound containing oxygen would yield the metal by direct reduction,
  the author has repeated the experiments of other chemists on this
 subject, but without success.         There is no doubt that the metal
  cannot be obtained by any of the processes described in the books.
 The only methods which promised possible results were : —
      1. The reduction of    a vanadium chloride (free from oxygen) in
            hydrogen   gas, either with or without sodium.
      2. The reduction of the mononitride at a white heat in hydrogen.
      The first of these methods has proved to be successful, whilst the
 second does not appear to yield metal, inasmuch as the nitride ex
 posed for 3£ hours in a platinum tube to the action of hydrogen
 at a white heat, lost only 8 per cent., whereas it must lose 21-4 per
 cent. on conversion into metal.
      Notwithstanding the apparent simplicity of the method, the author
 has found it exceedingly difficult to obtain the metal perfectly free
from oxygen.        This arises from the fact that, whilst vanadium is quite
 stable   at the  ordinary temperature, it absorbs oxygen with the great
est avidity at a red heat, and that therefore every trace of air and
moisture must be excluded during the reduction. Another difficulty
consists in the preparation of the solid chlorides in large quantity
and free from oxygen or moisture, as also in the length of time
needed to reduce these chlorides in hydrogen, during which time un
avoidable diffusion occurs and traces of oxygen enter the tube.
Again, the reduction can only be effected in platinum boats placed
in a porcelain tube, as the metal acts violently on glass and porcelain,
and tubes of platinum are porous at a red heat.
     A description of the apparatus employed is then given, the main
points being to guard against diffusion, and to introduce the powdered

dichloride into the platinum boat in such a way that it shall not
for an 'instant be exposed to moist air.          After all precautions are
taken, the tube is heated to redness, torrents of hydrochloric acid
come off, and the evolution of this gas continues for from 40 to 80
hours, according to the quantity of dichloride taken.          After the evo
lution of any trace of hydrochloric acid has ceased to be perceptible,
the tube is allowed to cool, and the boat is found to contain a light
whitish grey-coloured powder, perfectly free from chlorine.
    Metallic vanadium thus prepared examined under the microscope
reflects light powerfully, and is seen to consist of a brilliant shining
crystalline metallic mass possessing a bright silver-white lustre. Va
nadium does not oxidize or even tarnish in the air at the ordinary
temperature ; nor does it absorb oxygen when heated in the air to
 100°.    It does not decompose water even at 100°, and may be
moistened with water and dried in vacuo without gaining weight.
The metal is not fusible or volatile at a bright red heat in hydrogen ;
the powdered metal thrown into a flame burns with the most bril
liant scintillations. Heated quickly in oxygen it burns vividly, form
ing the pentoxide ; but slowly ignited in air it first glows to form a
brown oxide (possibly V2O), and then again absorbs oxygen and
glows, with formation of the black trioxide and blue tetroxide, till
it at last attains its maximum degree of oxidation. The specific
gravity of metallic vanadium at 15° is 5 "5.           It is not soluble in
either hot or cold hydrochloric acid ; strong sulphuric acid dissolves
it on heating, giving a yellow solution ; hydrofluoric acid dissolves
it slowly with evolution of hydrogen ; nitric acid of all strengths
acts violently on the metal, evolving red nitrous fumes and yielding
a blue solution ; fused with sodium hydroxide the metal dissolves
with evolution of hydrogen, a vanadate being formed.
    One sample yielded on oxidation a percentage increase of 77*94,
whereas that calculated from metal to pentoxide is 77'98.            Another
preparation gave a percentage increase of 70 8, showing the presence
of a small quantity of oxide.        On treatment in a current of chlorine,
metallic vanadium burns and forms the reddish black tetrachloride ;
 heated in a current of pure nitrogen, the mononitride is formed.
    The properties of the compounds of vanadium with silicon and
 platinum are then described in the memoir.
    " On   the Continuity    of the Gaseous   and  Liquid  States  of Matter.
 — Bakerian Lecture."         By Thomas Andrews, M.D., F.R.S. &c.
    In 1863 the author announced, in a communication which Dr.
 Miller had    the kindness to publish in the third edition of his ' Che
 mical Physics,' that on partially liquefying carbonic acid by pressure,
 and gradually raising at the same time the temperature to about 88°
 Fahr., the surface of demarcation between the liquid and gas became
 fainter, lost its curvature, and at last disappeared, the tube being
 then filled with    a fluid which, from its optical and other properties,
 appeared to be perfectly homogeneous.          The present paper contains
 the results of    an  investigation  of this subject, which has occupied
the author     for   several years.   The   temperature at which carbonic

       Continuity of the Gaseous and Liquid States of Matter.           151
acid ceases to liquefy by pressure he designates the critical point, and
he finds it to be 30°'92 C.        Although liquefaction does not occur
at temperatures    a little above this point, a very great change of
density is produced by slight alterations of pressure, and the flick
ering movements also described in 1863 come conspicuously into
view. In this communication, the combined effects of heat and
pressure upon carbonic acid at temperatures        varying from 13° C. to
48°    C, and at pressures ranging from 48 to 109 atmospheres, are
fully examined.
    At 13°-1 C,   and under a pressure, as indicated approximately by
the air manometer, of 48 89 atmospheres, carbonic acid, now just on
the point of liquefying, is reduced to          of the volume it occupied
under one atmosphere.         A slight increase of pressure, amounting to
g1^ of an atmosphere, which has to be applied to condense          the first
 half of the liquid, is shown to arise from the presence of a trace of
air (-f^xr part) in the carbonic acid.      After liquefaction, the volume
of the carbonic acid, already reduced to about               of its original
volume, continues to diminish as the pressure'~ang1fnents, and at a
 much greater rate than in the case of ordinary liquids.             Similar
 results were obtained at the temperature of 21c\5. A third series of
 experiments was made at 31°-1, or 0o-2 above the critical point. In
 this case the volume of the carbonic acid diminished steadily with the
 pressure, till about 74 atmospheres were attained. After this, a rapid
 but not (as in the case of liquefaction) abrupt fall occurred, and the
 volume was diminished to one-half by an additional pressure of less
 than two atmospheres.        Under a pressure of 75-4 atmospheres, the
 carbonic acid was reduced to .i-f-y of its original volume under one
 atmosphere.     Beyond this point it yielded very slowly to pressure.
 During the stage of rapid contraction there was no evidence at any
 time of liquefaction having occurred, or of two conditions of matter
  being present in the tube.       Two other series of experiments were
 made, one at 32°-5, the other at 35°-n, with the same general re
  sults, except that the rapid fall became less marked as the tem
 perature was higher.       The experiments at 35°-5 were carried as far
  as 107 atmospheres,    at  which pressure the volume of carbonic acid
  was almost the same as that which it should have occupied if it had
  been derived directly from liquid carbonic acid, according to the law
  of the expansion of that body for heat.
     The last series of experiments was made at 48°'l, and extended
  from 62-6 to 109-4 atmospheres of pressure. The results are very
  interesting, inasmuch as the rapid fall exhibited at lower tempera
  tures has almost, if not altogether, disappeared, and the curve re
  presenting the changes of volume approximates closely to that of a
  gas following the law of Mariotte.       The diminution of volume is at
  the same time much greater than if that law held good.
     The results just described are represented in a graphical form in
  the figure (p. 152).     Equal volumes of air and carbonic acid, mea
  sured at 0° C. and 760 millimetres, when compressed at the tempera
  tures marked on each curve, undergo the changes of volume indicated
  by the form of the curve.      The figures at the top and bottom indi

                                                      ;
   The author has exposed carbonic acid, without making precise
measurements, to higher pressures than any of those mentioned, and
has made it pass, without breach of continuity, from what is uni

      Continuity of the Gaseous and Liquid States of Matter.                  158
versally regarded as the gaseous to what            is,
                                                     in like manner, univer
sally regarded as the liquid state.      As     adirect result of his experi
ments, he concludes that the gaseous and liquid states are only widely
separated forms of the same condition of matter, and may be made
to pass into one another      by   series of gradations so gentle that the
                                   a
passage shall nowhere present any interruption or breach of conti
nuity.    From carbonic acid as        aperfect gas, to carbonic acid as        a
perfect liquid, the transition may be accomplished by           a  continuous
process, and the gas and liquid are only distant stages of                along
series of continuous physical changes.          Under certain conditions of
temperature and pressure, carbonic acid finds itself,               true, in
                                                               it

state of instability, and suddenly passes, without change of pressure
or temperature, but with the evolution of heat, to the condition
which,    by the continuous process, can only be reached        by   along and
circuitous route.
   The author discusses the question as to what           is the condition or
state of carbonic acid when    it passes,  at  temperatures above 31°, from
the ordinary gaseous state down to the volume of the liquid with
out giving any evidence during the process of the occurrence of lique
faction, and arrives at the conclusion that the answer to this ques
tion is  to be found in the intimate relations which subsist between

ON THE      SIMULTANEOUS OCCURRENCE OF A s0LUBLE LEAD-SALT
   AND FREE SULPHURIC ACID IN SHERRY WINE; WITH OBSER
   VATIONS ON THE SOLVENT ACTION OF ALCOHOLIC SALINE
    SOLUTIONS UPON SULPHATE OF LEAD.                BY PROFESSOR F. H.
    STORER.
OEVERAL           years since,  I  was called upon by a wine-merchant of
O       this city to examine a sample of pale sherry taken from a cask
which had been returned to him, on the certificate of a chemist that
the wine contained lead.          The sample in question was perfectly
transparent and clear. There was nothing in the appearance or taste
of the wine to indicate the sophistication to which it had really been
subjected.
    On submitting this sherry to chemical analysis, I found not only
that it held in solution a considerable proportion of lead, but also a
decided trace of free sulphuric acid, besides an abundance of the
same acid combined with some alkaline base. When a portion of
the wine was evaporated in contact with slips of paper, the latter
soon became crumbly and friable.
    Regarded merely from the chemical point of view, without refer
ence to its manifest bearing upon questions of hygiene and jurispru
dence, the simultaneous occurrence of a lead-salt and of free sul
phuric acid in alcoholic solution is a fact sufficiently important to
merit close attention.       Unfortunately the small sample of wine given
me was completely exhausted in the severe confirmatory tests by
which the results above mentioned were controlled, and I have had
no opportunity to determine the precise manner in which the lead
was held in solution in that particular case.       Several conjectures as
 to the cause of the phenomenon will be discussed below.
    That lead compounds should still be employed in the treatment of
 wine will surprise no one familiar with the tenacity with which tra
 ditions are held by successive generations of operatives in many of
 the chemical arts.       According to Taylor*, "litharge was formerly
 much used to remove the acidity of sour wine and convey a sweet
 taste.    Acetate of lead, or some other vegetable salt of the metal, is
 in these cases formed, and the use of such wine may be productive
 of alarming symptoms.          Many years since, a fatal epidemic colic
 prevailed in Paris owing to this cause ;             the adulteration was
 discovered by Fourcroy, and was immediately suppressed."
    Beckmann, in his ' History of Inventions 'f, dwells at some length
 on the antiquity and enduring character of the practice of neutralizing
 the acid which spoils wine by means of litharge.        According to this
 author, the practice was forbidden by legal enactment in France as
               *

by litharge was taught in England as a method perfectly free from
          "
danger *.
    The sulphuric acid in the sample of wine examined by me was pro
bably added with the view of removing the dissolved lead resulting
from the previous use of litharge.      It is not unlikely that the addi
tion of the free acid was preceded by that of a solution of sulphate
of ammonium.
    In seeking for an explanation of the fact that a certain proportion
 of lend may remain dissolved in wine, even in presence of free sul
phuric acid, the following hypotheses suggest themselves: —
     1st. It seemed not impossible, in case a mixture of weak alcohol,
 dilute sulphuric acid, and sulphate of lead was left to itself for along
 time, that a part of the lead-salt might be changed to sulphovinate
 of lead and pass into solution.    This idea was sufficiently improbable
 in view of the known facta that dilute alcohol and weak sulphuric
 acid are unfit for making sulphovinic acid, and that but little, if any,
 of the acid can be formed, even from tolerably concentrated liquids,
 unless the mixture of alcohol and sulphuric acid be heated artificially.
 The idea was nevertheless put to the test of experiment, as follows: —
     100 cubic centime. of alcohol of 59 per cent., 5 cubic centims. of
 oil of vitriol, and a quantity of recently precipitated sulphate of lead
 were placed in a stoppered bottle, and the mixture was frequently
  shaken during an interval of three months. The clear liquid was
 then decanted, diluted with water, and saturated with sulphuretted
  hydrogen gas.      Not the slightest coloration indicative of lead was
 produced.
      100 cubic centims. of similar alcohol mixed with sulphuric acid,
  sulphovinic acid, and sulphate of lead, gave no reaction for lead when
  tested after the lapse of three months.
      2nd. Though the idea seemed highly improbable, it was still pos
  sible that the sugar in the wine might in some way exert a solvent
  action upon sulphate of lead.      It was found, however, when 100
  cubic centims. of alcohol of 59 per cent., and 5 cubic centims. of oil
  of vitriol, together with a quantity of sugar and of precipitated sul
  phate of lead, were left to themselves for three months, that the clear
  supernatant liquid held no trace of lead in solution.      For that mat
  ter, it was found that a mixture of sulphuric acid and much sugar-
   water was capable of precipitating ail the lead even from an aqueous
   solution of acetate of lead.    The filtrate from the sulphate of lead
   thus precipitated gave absolutely no indication of lead when tested
   with sulphuretted hydrogen, not even when a considerable quantity
   of the liquid was evaporated to dryness, incinerated, treated with
   nitric acid, and again evaporated before applying the reagent.
      3rd. The most probable hypothesis of all, however, was, that a

   Herbs.' London, sixth edition.

  certain proportion of lead could be held dissolved in presence of sul
  phuric acid, even in an alcoholic solution like wine, by the action of
  various soluble alkaline salts capable of decomposing and of being
  decomposed by sulphate of lead ; for it is a well-known fact that very
  considerable quantities of sulphate of lead can be held dissolved in
  -water by means of many acetates, citrates, and tartrates, and by va
  rious other salts.
     To test this idea, the following set of experiments has been carried
  out at my suggestion by Mr. A. H. Pearson, of Haverhill, a student
  in the Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
     A considerable quantity of dilute alcohol, of the usual strength of
  sherry wine (18 per cent.), having been prepared, standard solutions
  of acetate of lead, of sulphuric acid, and of sulphate of ammonium
  were made by dissolving weighed quantities of these substances in
  portions of the 18 per cent, alcohol.   Each of the solutions was made
  of such strength that 500 cubic centims. of the liquid contained one-
  tenth of an equivalent of the salt or acid, reckoned in grammes, on
  the hydrogen scale.
     Alcoholic solutions of several salts of ammonium and of the fixed
  alkalies were also prepared, as will be described below.
     In each experiment, equal quantities of the standard solution of
  sulphuric acid, or of sulphate of ammonium, and of the saline solu
  tion to be tested, were mixed in a glass flask, and the standard solu
  tion of acetate of lead was made to fall from a burette drop by drop
 into the mixture until a persistent precipitate of sulphate of lead was
 perceived.    The burette was graduated so that two drops from it
 were equal to one-tenth of a cubic centimetre ; and the flask was
 constantly shaken while the drops of acetate of lead were falling
 into it.
     The results of the experiments are as follows : —
     Acetate of Ammonium was prepared by neutralizing ordinary acetic
acid with ammonia-water ; and the strong aqueous solution thus ob
 tained was mixed with alcohol.         It appeared, however, that this
alcoholic solution of the acetate exerted no solvent action upon sul
phate of lead ; for a permanent precipitate of the latter was produced
in the mixture of acetate of ammonium and normal sulphuric acid
by the first drop of the standard solution of acetate of lead.        The
same negative result was obtained in several repetitions of the ex
periment, even when new portions of dilute alcohol and a second set
of the standard solutions were employed.
    When, however, the solution of acetate of ammonium was mixed
with an equal bulk (10 cubic centims.) of the standard solution of
sulphate of ammonium instead of the sulphuric acid, a considerable
quantity of sulphate of lead was held in solution by it. In two di
stinct trials, the precipitate formed by dropping acetate of lead into
the mixed solution of acetate and sulphate of ammonium continued
to redissolve until 3 cubic centims. of the standard solution of acetate
of lead had been added to the liquor.       These 3 cubic centims. of the
standard solution contained 0*1 137 grm. of acetate of lead, corre

                  Intelligence  and Miscellaneous Articles.              157
spending to 0*0909 grm. of sulphate of lead.          To hold dissolved one
part of sulphate of lead in the dilute alcohol charged with sulphate
of ammonium, there was consequently required 1 10 cubic centims.
of a tolerably strong solution of acetate of ammonium.
    Still another experiment with sulphuric acid was made, by mixing
10 cubic centims. of an entirely new preparation of acetate of ammo
nium with a similar quantity of the standard solution of acetate of
lead, and dropping the standard sulphuric acid into the mixture. No
persistent precipitate was produced in this case until 5 cubic, cen
tims. of the acid had been added.        This quantity of the standard acid
 contained 0'049 grm. of sulphuric acid, corresponding to 0*1515
grm. of sulphate of lead ; hence only 33 parts of the solution of ace
tate of ammonium were required to dissolve 1 part of sulphate of
lead.     It is to be observed that the insolubility of tartrate, citrate,
 and succinate of lead in alcohol prevents the application of this mo
 dified form of the experiment in the examples given below.             With
 the exception of the acetates of ammonium and sodium, none of the
 salts experimented with can be mixed with the acetate of lead and
 subsequently tested with sulphuric acid or sulphate of ammonium.
     Acetate of Sodium, whether mixed with the normal sulphuric acid,
 with sulphate of ammonium, or with acetate of lead, seemed to have
 no solvent action upon sulphate of lead.
     Neither Oxalate of Ammonium nor normal Oxalate of Potassium
 exerted any solvent action either in presence of the sulphuric acid or
 the sulphate of ammonium.
     Tartrate of Ammonium. — Normal crystallized tartrate of ammonium
 was dissolved in alcohol of 18 per cent., in such proportion that 500
 cubic centims. of the solution contained one-tenth of an equivalent
 (18"4 grms.) of the salt. 25 cubic centims. of the solution was mixed
 with an equal volume of the normal sulphuric acid, and normal ace
 tate of lead was added to the mixture until a permanent precipitate
 was produced.        To effect this result, there was required of the stan
 dard solution of acetate of lead 2 cubic centims. or 0'0758 grm. of
 the acetate, corresponding to 0'0606 grm. of sulphate of lead.           The
  25 cubic centims. of the solution of tartrate of ammonium contained
  0-92 grm. of the dry salt.       Hence something more than 15 parts of
 tartrate of ammonium are required to hold 1 part of sulphate of lead
  dissolved in dilute alcohol containing free sulphuric acid.
     In two other experiments, where the tartrate-of-ammonium solu
 tion was mixed with the sulphate of ammonium instead of with free
  sulphuric acid, 3 cubic centims. of the acetate-of-lead solution had
  to be added before a permanent precipitate could be formed.
     That sulphuric acid is a more efficient precipitant of lead in pre
  sence of tartaric acid than sulphate of ammonium was shown in an
  other way.       30 cubic centims. of the standard alcoholic acetate of
  lead were mixed with an equal volume of the standard solution of
  tartrate of ammonium.        The precipitated tartrate of lead was filtered,
  and the filtrate mixed with a quantity of the sulphate-of-ammonium
  solution.    No precipitate was produced, though on the subsequent

 158             Intelligence  and Miscellaneous    Articles.
addition of sulphuretted hydrogen a slight precipitate of sulphide of
lead was formed.        In a similar experiment, where sulphuric acid was
substituted for sulphate of ammonium, a slight precipitate was pro
duced by the sulphuric acid, and no precipitate could be obtained
afterwards with sulphuretted hydrogen.
    In two other experiments, where 5 cubic centims. of the acetate-
of-lead solution were mixed with 30 cubic centims. of the tartrate of
ammonium, no precipitate was produced by sulphate of ammonium
in the filtrate from the tartrate of lead, while sulphuric acid gave a
slight precipitate as before.        In this case, however, sulphuretted
hydrogen gave       a  slight precipitate after sulphuric acid, as well as
 after sulphate of ammonium.
    Normal Tartrate of Potassium mixed with the solution of sulphuric
 acid exerted no solvent action on sulphate of lead.
    Succinate of Ammonium, prepared by neutralizing a solution of
 succinic acid with ammonia-water, exerted no solvent action when
 mixed with the free sulphuric acid ; but when mixed with the solu
 tion of sulphate of ammonium, 6 cubic centims. of the acetate-of-lead
 solution were added to the liquor before a permanent precipitate fell.
    Normal Citrate of Ammonium was prepared by neutralizing a
 weighed equivalent portion of crystallized citric acid with ammonia-
 water.    10 cubic centims. of the solution were mixed with an equal
 volume of the standard sulphuric acid, and the standard solution of
 acetate of lead was dropped into the mixture in the usual way.         No
 permanent precipitate was formed until 16 cubic centims. of the lead
solution had been added.        These 16 cubic centims. contained 0"6064
 grm. of acetate of lead, corresponding to 0*4848 grm. of sulphate of
 lead. The 10 cubic centims. of citrate-of-ammonium solution con
 tained 0-42 grm. of crystallized citric acid.       Hence 1 part of sul
 phate of lead was held dissolved in the mixture of alcohol and dilute
 sulphuric acid for every 0-S663 part of citric acid in the liquor.
    On repeating the experiment, a precisely similar result was ob
 tained : 1 6 cubic centims. of the standard lead solution had to be
 added to the mixture of alcohol and sulphuric acid before the preci
 pitate ceased to redisolve as fast as it formed.
    In two other experiments, where, instead of free sulphuric acid,
  10 cubic centims. of the standard solution of sulphate of ammonium
 were mixed with 10 cubic centims. of the citrate-of-ammonium solu
 tion, 30 cubic centims. of the standard lead solution had to be added
 in each case before any permanent precipitate formed.
    Dicitrate of Ammonium (Ci2 H" (NH4)2 O'4) was prepared in crys
 tals, and 22'6 grms. of the salt were dissolved in 500 cubic centims.
 of the 18 per cent, alcohol.      25 cubic centims. of the solution were
 mixed with an equal volume of the standard sulphuric acid, and the
 acetate-of-lead    solution was dropped into the mixture in the usual
 way.     After the addition of 8 cuhic centims. of the standard acetate
 of lead, a permanent precipitate was produced.         These 8 cubic cen
 tims. contained 0"3032 grm. of acetate of lead, corresponding to
 0"2424 grm. of sulphate of lead.       The 25 cubic centims. of dicitrate

                 Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.            159
of-ammonium solution contained 1*13 grm. of the dry salt. Hence
1 part of sulphate of lead was held dissolved     for every 4'6617 parts
of the dicitrate.
     Tricitrate of Potassium. — 25 cubic centims. of a standard solution
of ordinary crystallized citrate of potassium mixed with an equal
volume of the standard sulphuric acid gave no permanent precipitate
until 2 cubic centims. of the solution of acetate of lead had been
added to it.
    Sugar. — A standard solution of cane-sugar mixed with an equal
volume of the sulphuric acid gave a permanent precipitate on the ad
 dition of the first drop of the acetate of lead.
     These experiments show clearly that very considerable quantities
 of sulphate of lead can be held in solution by weak alcohol charged
 with various salts. It may therefore reasonably be inferred that
 wines sometimes retain lead in solution in consequence of this action
 of the acids and salts peculiar to wine upon lead compounds igno-
 rantly employed to correct acidity. — Communicated by the Author,

 ON AURORAL APPEARANCES           AND THEIR CONNEXION WITH THE
      PHENOMENA         OF TERRESTRIAL     MAGNETISM.       BY BALFOUR
      STEWART, F.R.S., F.R.A.S.
     Some years since, I ventured to suggest that auroral displays
 might be secondary currents due to small but rapid changes, caused
 by some unknown influence, in the magnetism of the earth.         In de
 veloping this idea, the earth was compared to the core of a Ruhm-
 korff machine, and the moist upper strata of the earth, as well as the
 upper strata of the atmosphere, to secondary conductors, in which
 currents will take place whenever the magnetism of the earth changes
 from any cause.        These views would appear to be confirmed by the
 very interesting records of earth-currents obtained by Mr. Airy at
 the Greenwich Observatory, in which it is found that during times
  of very great magnetic disturbance there are strong earth-currents
 alternating from positive to negative, the curves lying nearly equally
  on both sides of the zero.
      A further development of this idea has lately occurred to me, in
  consequence of a remark of my friend Mr. Lockyer, that the zodiacal
  light may possibly be a terrestrial phenomenon, and may therefore
  be somehow connected with the phenomena of terrestrial magnetism.
  For not only will secondary currents be caused in a stationary con
  ductor in presence of a magnetic core of variable power, but also in
  a conductor moving across the lines of force of a constant magnet.
  The question arises, have we on the earth such moving conductors ?
  In answer to this, let us reflect what takes place at the equator.
  When once the anti-trades have reached the upper regions of the
  atmosphere, they will become conductors from their tenuity ; and as

160             Intelligence and Miscellaneous     Articles.
they pass rapidly [over the lines of the earth's magnetic force we may
expect them to be the vehicles of an electric current, and possibly to
be lit up as attenuated gases are when they conduct electricity. May
not these form the zodiacal light ?
   Such moving currents will, of course, react on the magnetism of
the earth.   We may therefore suppose that somewhat sudden and
violent changes are likely to take place in the earth's magnetism at
those seasons at which the earth's great wind-currents change most
rapidly.   May not this account for the excess of disturbances at the
equinoxes ?
   Besides the anti-trades there are also, no doubt, convection-cur
rents, caused by the daily progress of the sun, taking place in the
upper regions of the earth's atmosphere.      May not these also be the
vehicle of currents as they cross the lines of the earth's force, and
account, to some extent at least, for the daily variations of terrestrial
magnetism ? and may not this be the reason of the likeness observed
by Mr. Baxendell between the curves denoting the daily progress of
the wind and those denoting the variation of the declination magnet ?
Such currents (in as far as they are electric conductors), taking place
in the upper regions of the atmosphere, would not be felt by the
earth-current wires at Greenwich, and I think Mr. Airy has noticed
that this is the case.     But the tidal wave represents a motion of a
conductor on the earth's surface, with two periods in one lunar day.
This motion cannot produce a very great secondary current ; but may
it not be sufficient to account for the lunar-diurnal magnetic varia
tion, which is also very small ?
   Such a current taking place in a conductor electrically connected
with the earth's upper surface ought to be felt by the Greenwich
wires ; and, if I am not mistaken, Mr. Airy has detected a current of
this nature.
   May we not also imagine that there are two varieties of aurora —
one corresponding to stationary conductors under a very rapidly
changing core, and the other to rapidly moving conductors under a
constant core ? And might not an aurora of the latter kind indicate
the approach of a change of weather ?
   These remarks are thrown out in order to invite comment and
criticism, and they will have served their purpose if they direct
attention to the part that may be played by moving conductors in
the phenomena of terrestrial magnetism.          It will be noticed that
these remarks do not touch upon the mysterious and interesting
connexion believed to exist between magnetic disturbances and the
frequency of solar spots.
   P.S. — Since writing the above, Sir W. Thomson has called my
attention to a paper by him in the Philosophical Magazine for De
cember 1851, in which it is suggested that moving conductors may
play a part in the phenomena of terrestrial magnetism, — Monthly
Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, December 10, 1869.

  XXI.      On the Deadening of the Sounds      of Solid Bodies by Internal
                    Resistances.    By Dr. E.   Warburg*.
  IT gradually
         is a well known fact that the sound-vibrations of solids
                     become extinguished when they are not sustained
  by   external   force.   The causes of this extinction are partly ex
          —
  ternal resistance of the surrounding medium, friction against
  the points at which the bodies are fastened, and communication
  of motion to them — and partly internal, depending on the nature
  of the solid itself. The existence of such internal causes was
  originally demonstrated by VVilhelm Weber in the torsion vibra
  tions of a silk thread ; for he found that they became extinguished
<
  in a short time even in vacuo.         There can here be no appreciable
  communication of motion to the point of suspension, so that the
  forces which in this case produce the extinction must be sought
  in the structure of the vibrating thread.
      The forces which, acting in the interior of solids, bring about
  the extinction of their vibrations, will be denoted in the sequel
  as the internal resistance     of solids.
      In reference to the internal resistance of solids, Helmholtz
  remarkst     : — " More   perfect elasticity seems peculiarly to favour
  the continuauce of the higher tones ; for more rapid vibrations
  are in general more quickly deadened by imperfect elasticity and
  friction than slower ones."
     The author is not aware of any experimental proof that higher

  tones  are more strongly deadened by internal resistance than
  deeper ones, nor of any investigation of the cause of this phe
  nomenon.
     The first part of this research contains experimental proofs of
 the phenomenon in question, the second part an investigation
 of the causes which produce it.
                                 Part I.
     When a bar of any material is connected with a solid source
 of sound, soundrwaves are transferred to it. If the duration of
 the tones which the source of sound emits is adequate as com
 pared with the time within which the waves traverse the bar
  (which is the case in the following experiments), direct and
 reflected waves frequently pass through one another, and the bar
 assumes a condition of stationary vibrations.       The forward and
 back waves, however, undergo a diminution of their amplitude in
 consequence of the deadening forces which act upon the vibra
 ting particles ; and owing to this, the intensity of the motion of
 sound in the bar diminishes with increasing distance from the
 source of sound.
     Hence the author, in order to investigate the action of the
 deadening forcesof solids upon tonesof varying heights, conducted
 to the ear, through bars of various material, the sound of an in
strument which simultaneously emitted tonesof varying height;
the instrument in question was a musical box.         It was before all
things necessary that the sound should reach the ear through
the conducting- rod only.       The following method of insulation
was adopted with this view.
    A circular cylindrical bag of thin caoutchouc 250 millims. in
height, open above and filled to the top with water, was sus
pended in a thick cylindrical glass vessel by drawing the edge
of the bag over the rim of the glass cylinder.
    When the musical box, protected by a caoutchouc case and sus
pended by a thread, was sunk nearly to the bottom, the sound
could not at all be heard by a bystanding observer; only by
holding a funnel close over the edge of the water could a few of
the highest notes be heard; these, however, were so feeble that
the height of the note could not be clearly distinguished.
    The sound of the box is powerfully imparted to the water,
which results, among other things, from the circumstance that,
when sunk in a glass vessel filled with water, it communicates a
powerful motion to the surrounding media through the inter
vention of the water and the glass.      The sides, too, of the bag are
set in powerful vibration ; for if the bag be freely suspended in the
air, a considerable amount of sound is imparted to it. As in this
case the free air, so also, when the caoutchouc bag is suspended in

               of Solid Bodies by Internal Resistances.            163
the cylinder, the volume of air between the glass and the bag is
powerfully agitated by the sides of the latter ; but as this volume
of air does not communicate with the external air, and as, more
over, it cannot appreciably agitate the thick glass sides, none of
the motion imparted is transmitted to the surrounding air.
    If while the bag is freely suspended (the musical box oscilla
ting at some depth) the ear be moved along the sides, a great
decrease of the sound is observed as the ear is moved upwards.
This experiment gives the reason why so little sound reaches the
air through the surface of the water.       Suppose a vessel, open at
the top and with absolutely rigid sides, filled with water, and that
in any part whatever an impulse be given to the water (by a sound
ing body for instance), this impulse will be transmitted in all di
rections, but, owing to reflection from the rigid sides, escape prin
cipally at the free surface.    But if the sides are pliable they will
give way laterally, and in proportion to this pliability will impart
a certain amount of motion to the air ; hence, if the vessel is
deep enough and the impulse be produced in a deep part, only a
 small amount of motion will reach the free surface of the water.
    The conductors to be investigated are suitably connected at one
end with the musical box suspended in water ; th^ other end is
fastened to a sounding-board, to which the ear is applied.
    In this way the sound of the box was transmitted to the ear
through a caoutchouc rod 460 millims. in length and 6 mil-
lims. in diameter : the deep accompaniment of the small piece
of music which the box played was exclusively heard.        If various
 parts  of the rod  be examined,  it will be found that only near the
source of sound is any thing to be perceived of the highest notes.
    To investigate whether the resistance of the air has an influ
ence on these phenomena, the musical box was suspended by a
 strip of caoutchouc in a vacuous vessel. Through the point of sus
 pension and the vessel deep tones only reached the support ;
 when the caoutchouc rod was replaced by a lead tube, high as
 well as deep tones were heard by an observer who applied his ear
 against the support.
    Hence it must be concluded that the weakening of the tones
 by conduction through caoutchouc does not arise from the resist
 ance of the air, but has its foundation in the nature of the caout
 chouc itself.
    Rods of wood, steel, glass, lead, wax, of the same dimensions as
 that of caoutchouc, propagated high and deep tones in sensibly
equal proportion.      Even in the conduction of sound through a
slightly stretched copperwire0-2 millim.in diameter and 30metres
in length, no difference could be discriminated in the propagation of
                                                      \
high and of deep sounds. But when a lead wire \ inillim. in dia
meter and 1 1 metres in length was interposed between the sourc? of
                                   M 2

164         Dr. E. Warburg         on the Deadening     of the Sounds
sound and the ear, nothing more could be perceived of the higher
notes, while the deep accompaniment was perfectly distinct.
   A slightly stretched hemp cord 4 5 metres in length exhibited
the same deportment as the caoutchouc and the longer lead con
ductor; when it was somewhat more tightly stretched, the higher
notes were superadded to the lower ones ; the caoutchouc rod,
on the contrary, had to be very strongly stretched (that  drawn     is,
out to about three times the length) for the highest tones to
be propagated in    it   to somewhat greater distances.
    Connected with these experiments              the unequal enfeeble-
                                                   is
ment which notes of various height undergo on conduction
through the air which enclosed in caoutchouc tubes.
                              is                                   Near to
that end of     awooden rod connected with the         musical  box which
projected from the water, one end of an open glass tube was ap
proached.     When the other end of the tube was introduced into
the ear, the entire piece of music was heard, with the exception
that, especially with short tubes, certain notes were rendered par
ticularly prominent      by  resonance. When the glass tube was re
placed     by
            acaoutchouc tube, provided the length of the conduction
was adequate, only the deeper notes could be perceived.            For the
same   thickness    of the sides of the caoutchouc    tunes, the enfeeble-
ment of the tones on conduction, especially of the higher ones,
diminishes with     a  decrease in the internal diameter.         To show
this, it    sufficient to introduce simultaneously into the two ears
           is
two tubes of different diameters, and to bring the free ends near
the source of sound.        If now either one or the other tube be
compressed, the difference in the strength and composition of the
sound propagated        by the two conductions can be judged, and            it
will be ascertained that the higher tones pass more readily through
the narrow tube than through the wider.
    This deportment shows that the enfeeblement of sound              these
                                                                        in
experiments must first of all be ascribed to imperfect reflection
from the caoutchouc sides          for, ceeteris paribus, they yield to
                                    ;                                        a
greater extent the greater the internal diameter of the tube.            It
was therefore to be expected that considerable degree of sound
                                              a
was to be imparted       by conduction to the external air, of which the
author has convinced himself             by
                                        special experiments.
    We must accordingly conceive the conduction through air in
caoutchouc tubes to take place                by
                                           the caoutchouc tube being
 made to vibrate transversely         Ihe vibrations of the air.
                                        by                           These
 transversal vibrations of the solid caoutchouc are enfeebled as
they advance, and, according to the experiments first described,
 the higher-tone vibrations much more rapidly than the deeper
ones.     Hence the higher tones are lost from the system more
rapidly than the lower ones, and the deeper ones are maintained
for longer time.
      a                  The question remains open whether also there

               of Solid   Bodies by Internal Resistances.          165
is a difference in the intensity of the reflection by the caoutchouc
sides of sound-vibrations of different heights.
    Helmholtz* explains in a similar way the softer tone of wooden
as compared with metal pipes, " inasmuch as the sides of the
former do not so well resist agitation by the sound-waves, by
which the higher-sound vibrations seem more easily destroyed
by friction."
    Hence the phenomena in the conduction of sound through
the air in caoutchouc tubes are to be referred to the phenomena
of the conduction of sound through solid caoutchouc ; and the
question now arises as to the explanation of the unequal enfee-
blement of sounds of different heights when conducted through
solids.
                                 Part II.
   When vibrations are entirely and alone sustained by elastic forces,
a  diminution of the wave-length (vibrating portion), and there
with an increase of the mean molecular displacement for the
same amplitude of maximum vibration, must be inseparably con
nected with a diminution of the duration of vibration in one and
the same body.        Hence the author, in order to separate these
two influences, has combined magnetic with elastic forces, and
has had recourse to torsion vibrations sufficiently prolonged to be
capable of definite measurement.            If a magnet be suspended
by  a  thread, only by changing the directive force of the magnet
by another magnet suitably placed can we alter the duration
of the torsion vibrations of which this system is capable.        The
thread, on the other hand, can be shortened, and the change
in the time of oscillation of the system thus produced can be
compensated by a suitable displacement of the external magnet.
   This idea was executed by means of a kind of torsion-balance.
To be able to alter at will the length of the threads, they were
fastened at the top to a rod which could be moved vertically in the
tube ; at the other end was a scale-beam which bad a groove to
hold the magnet, and was moreover provided with a silvered
vertical glass mirror.      In this system, suitably protected against
disturbance,    torsion  vibrations   could be produced by means of
external magnetic influences.          Through a plane parallel glass
inserted in the vessel of the balance, the deflections of the beam
could be observed by means of a scale and telescope.           Caout
chouc threads and fine silk, glass, and metal threads were inves
tigated.
   It was ascertained in this manner that within elongations of
6° and 2° from the position of equilibrium, to which hmits the
observations were restricted, the series of deflections may be

166        Dr. E. Warburg      on the Deadening     of the Sounds
very accurately represented by a geometrical series
                                                              — a law of
decrease which Gauss and Weber had already observed for thin
metal and silk threads, and which by the author's experiments
is extended to caoutchouc threads 1 sq. millim. in section. When
the exponent of the series (whose logarithm is the logarithmic de
crement) was suitably deduced from a number of observed deflec
tions, and by its means another number of deflections was calcu
lated, the differences of the observed and calculated values were
throughout within the limits of possible errors of observation,
which, corresponding to one division of the scale, amounted to
Y^jf of the smallest and            of the greatest elongation.
     Hence the motion     of the system is represented by the formula
                           x=A     . e~*'cos nt,
in which
x is the elongation from the position of equilibrium in angular
     degrees,
A    the elongation at the time t=0,
n the number of vibrations in the time 2ir,
 e is a magnitude which is a constant for each experiment.
     In this formula    the magnitude      e is inversely proportional to
 the time within which the amplitude  r        is reduced from a to    - a.
                                                                       n
 and is the measure of the deadening.          The law above-mentioned,
 as is known, presupposes a deadening force proportional and
 opposite to the velocity ; the measure of the deadening force referred
 to the unit of velocity is the product eM, in which M is the
 moment of inertia.       Now, as in these experiments the length
 only of the threads was changed, the balance with its belongings
 being always the same, the moment of inertia was sensibly con
  stant in all the experiments.         Hence the magnitude e may be
 considered a measure of the actual deadening, as well as a mea
  sure of the deadening force.
      The relative magnitude of the deadening force (to ascertain
  which was the object of these experiments) might be deduced by
  directly observing the time within which the amplitude of a is
  reduced to   - a.   That magnitude may more certainly         be deduced
  from the logarithmic decrement by dividing it by the duration of
  vibration. In this manner the author determined the magni
  tude e.
      It was the first aim of the author to investigate the dependence
  of the deadening on the duration of vibration ; and with this
  view observations were first made with the space filled with air.
  These experiments gave the following result : — For caoutchouc

              of Solid Bodies by Internal Resistances.                167
threads the deadening increases in general considerably with
increase in the duration of vibration.
   Only, for the longest caoutchouc thread examined (of 323
millims.) no increase occurred for small values of the duration of
vibration, but even a small decrease.
   All the other threads investigated (fine silk, glass, metal
threads) exhibited the same deportment, in reference to all pe
riods of vibration examined, as did this longest caoutchouc thread
for small values of the duration of vibration ; for in all was
there a decrease in the deadeuing with increase in the duration
of vibration.
   This complication of the phenomena might arise from the cir
cumstance that e (the magnitude observed) is a compound one.
The deadening forces to which the vibrating system is subject
are partly to be sought outside       in the resistance of the air,
                                        it,
and partly within       it,
                        in the thread itself.  The results obtained
seemed to indicate that both parts of which the deadening con
sists varied inversely as the duration of vibration.  This supposi
tion was confirmed        experiments being made in vacuo.
                          by                                    The
apparatus was suitably changed for this purpose, so that the
pressure of the air could be reduced to       millims., and during
                                                5
one experiment did not increase         by
                                      more than      millims. From
                                                     2
this modification*     resulted that
                        it            —  :
   1.  In the case of all threads, that part of the deadening (y)
arising from the internal resistance increases with the increase of
the duration of vibration.     There was obtained, for instance —    :
                                   Metal.

Hence, with the same length of thread, the slower vibrations are
more powerfully deadened           by
                                  the internal resistance than the
quicker ones.

of the air decreases with increased duration of vibration t. There
was obtained, for instance —   :

but  issufficient for the present object.
                                                                             r

   Hence, by the resistance of the air, the quicker vibrations are
more powerfully deadened than the slower ones.
   It must be remarked in reference to (2) that, according to
Stokes*, the quicker vibrations of solids in air are more power
fully deadened than slower ones.
   The first result recalls to mind the view of W. Weber t as to
that cause of the decrease in the amplitude of oscillation which
has its origin in the nature of the body itself. W. Weber shows
that the phenomenon which he discovered, the elastic reac
tion, must produce a diminution in the amplitude of vibration.
Now it is a priori probable that this reaction must manifest
so much the stronger effect the slower the vibrations — which is
in accordance with the author's experiments, according to which
the slower torsion vibrations of a thread are more powerfully
deadened by the internal resistance than more rapid ones.
   We have hitherto been concerned alone with the dependence
of the deadening arising from the internal resistance on the time
of vibration, the length of the thread remaining constant.        To
ascertain the dependence of this deadening on the length of the
thread, it is unnecessary to eliminate the resistance of the air ;
for an alteration in the deadening with a change in the length
of the thread, the time of vibration remaining constant, can only
be ascribed to the thread.       It has now been found that the
deadening   increases with a decrease in the length of the thread —
that      is,
         that, for the same duration of vibration, shorter threads
produce stronger deadening than longer ones.
   To apply vibration-experiments to experiments on the conduc
tion of sound, the assumption must be made that the deadening
arising from the internal resistance,       the sound-vibrations of
                                                in
solids, must depend in the same manner on the duration of                 vi
bration and the magnitude of the vibrating divisions as has been
established in the case of slow torsion vibrations.
   On this assumption, the reason that the higher tones when
conducted through solids are more powerfully deadened than
the deeper ones cannot arise from the fact that with the higher
notes the vibrations are more rapid for, according to the vibra
                                            ;
tion-experiments,        itjust the slower vibrations which for the
                              is
same wave-length are more rapidly deadened           the internal re

sistance than the quicker ones.        This cause can only be that,
in the higher notes, smaller vibrating divisions (wave-lengths)
are formed    for, according to the vibration-experiments, greater
                ;                                                   a
deadening force       developed in shorter waves (for the same du
                        is
ration of vibration) than in longer ones         J.

   As in one ami the     same body higher tones correspond to smaller
wave-lengths, so     in two  different substances the smaller velocity of
sound corresponds for the same pitch to smaller wave-lengths.
Hence, of two different bodies, for the same specific internal re
sistance and under circumstances in other respects similar, the
deadening of tones of equal height must be greater for the
body with tbe smaller velocity of sound.
    In the vibration-experiments all the threads used exhibited
qualitatively the same deportment in reference to deadening ; in
the experiments on the conduction of sound, a difference was
so far observed in the behaviour of the various conductors used,
that only in a small number (caoutchouc rod, slightly stretched
hemp cord, thin lead wire) was there any difference in the dead
ening for the higher and lower tones. This may have arisen from
the fact that the specific internal resistance in the case of the other
bodies of which the conductors were formed had too small a value.
Probably, however, it only arose from the fact that the velocity
of propagation of the waves in the other conductors was too great.
Hence, with an increase in the velocity of propagation of the waves
in the experiments on the conductivity of sound, the difference
in the intensity of sound at the two ends of the conductor must
decrease, for two reasons : — first, according to what has been above
said, because with the velocity of propagation the wave-lengths
increase ; and, secondly, because with an increase in the velocity
of propagation, for the same length of path which conducts the
sound, the time during which the deadening influences act is
diminished.

    c = charge remaining at end of time t.
    Ishowed in a former communication      that R will not be the
exact resistance of a core or cable at the end of time t, in con
sequence of electrification on charging, and that this electrifica
tion will be proportional to the loss of charge during the first
unit of time.
   The first proposition is to show that the rates of loss for static
charge, and also the resistances, are as the Napierian logarithms
   C                                                  C
of — , and not       as the simple       multiples of —
                                                                          Q
    First (/ and K being the same in both cases), let                     —   corre
spond to a loss of 5 per cent.
    Let      t=60   seconds,    K = *5   farad,
                                    60
                                              = 2449milli°ns-
                      R=-5^0W0
                      Q
    Secondly, let     —
                          correspond      to a loss of 20 per cent., or four
times as great in the same time t,
                      R= —                    =538 millions.
                           •5   x -22314.
   Thus, although the loss is four times as much in the one as in
the other, the resistance is 4 55 times less ; that     the resist  is,
ances are not proportional to the simple multiples of loss in the
same time      t.
   This may appear at first sight anomalous, but can be shown
to be correct as follows and from

these values   of t will be proportional to the Napierian logarithms

             •5 x 04908 T-5 x 22314
    From this it is evident that, for reliable comparisons between
cores or cables which have different rates of loss, the times should
be noted when they each lose the same proportion of charge. It
is incorrect to state the comparison by percentages of loss for the
same time.
    In the formula    K is  a function of length and thickness of      di
electric
         (og})       so that,    log
                                     º being   constant,    R will vary as
the length of the cable or core; consequently if K represent the
 total capacity of a long length of cable, or that of a single mile
of the same cable, R will be the resistances of these respective
lengths.
    Suppose a loss of 5 per cent. in these cases; and first, the
 length being one mile, K being the same for each unit of length
 and equal to 5 farad, t being one minute,
                          60                  ----
              R=                    =2449 millions.
                    75x-04908
 Next, let the length be 1000 miles;
                              60                       ----
              R=                           = 2 449 millions,
                    75x1000 × 0.1908
 and
               2,449   x 1000=2449 millions        per mile.
  Hence in the formula K enters as the function of length in terms
 of the capacity per unit of length.
    The next proposition is to show that whatever interval t be
 taken, if the correct loss corresponding to that time be known,
 the value for R is constant.
    The 1866 Atlantic Telegraph cable fell to half tension in 66
  minutes 40 seconds. K=-3535 farad per nautical mile. Length
  = 1896 nautical miles.

 172 Mr. T. T. P. B. Warren        on Prof. Fleeming Jenkin's Formula.
     The calculated loss corresponding to one minute is rather
 more than 1 per cent. (10096) ;
                               60

              9 x 1896=17,000 millions per nautical mile.
     Mr. Latimer Clark says (Culley's 'Handbook/ p. 231) that
 the Atlantic cable when laid had a resistance equal to 2437 mil
 lions B.A. units per nautical mile, which after 30 minutes' elec
 trification rose to 7000 millions. We must therefore consider
 the cable to have been highly electrified when Mr. Clark's elec
 trometer tests were taken.         The calculated fall in these tests
 does not agree     so  well with the observed fall as may be wished ;
for whatever be the interval for t, K will be constant if the
                     C
 correct value of    —  corresponding to the time / be taken.
     Thus, the fall to half tension being 4000 seconds, we find by
            .    c

                 ^n=nt, that 1640 seconds arc required to fall to

must be understood that / is the time for which a core is held
free, and that no provision for the time occupied in charging is
made without introducing the value corresponding to it for the

 we require the rate of loss for the same core or cable at any other

          XXIII.       Popular Difficulties in Tide Theory.
                       By E. Lacy Gaebett*.
         paradoxical   fact that, on a rapidly rotating earth, the
THEplaces of high and        low water (friction apart) are contrary
to those that would exist on a non-rotating earth, seems brought
by Professor Abbott for the first time within easy popular ap
prehension — which was necessary to remove a certain stigma of
             i
unreality from the current elementary teaching about tides.
This lucid explanation seems to be such as may enable a child
to see that if the waters have their diurnal rotary velocity in
creased and diminished in the four quadrants, according to the
arrows of his diagram, the result must be " low water under the
moon," or high water at moonrise and moonset, and earlier the
more friction.    But the popular difficulty is now the antecedent
one, to make clear (what              is,
                                 of course, familiar to all who have
considered perturbations) that those arrows do express the direc
tions of tangential force, not only iu the hemisphere next the
moon, but in the other also.
   The only simple way to do this, appears to be                by
                                                         recurring to
the old diagram of an equilibriated earth, with its two high
waters, one towards or under the moon, and one away from or
over the moon    ;where the consideration of the decrease of lunar
attraction from the nearer surface to the centre, and thence to the
further surface, makes clear that on globe behaving to the moon

be trifling compared to the earth's rotation.      Now let the earth
and waters rotate together     eastward, as they do, with a speed im
mensely exceeding these waterflows, and it is seen they must act
as accelerations in the quadrants coming to the moon's meridian,
and retardations in those leaving it.     The separation and crowd
ing of the  arrows  in the third earth-figure may, therefore, express
the water's rotary speed, exceeding the earth's in the nearest aDd
furthest quadrants, and falling short of it in those of moonrise
and moonset ; whence the new places of high and low water,
just contrary to those in the equilibriated earth, become plain.
For a child must see that, as in pouring out treacle the down
ward acceleration makes the stream grow thinner, and in an up
ward jet retardation makes it thicker, so here the sea, wherever
its rotation is being accelerated, must grow shallower (that                                 is,
the tide be falling), and the contrary where its rotation       being              is

apart) to have low water permanently under the moon, there
must be an intermediate state, rate of rotation quicker than

give her that same final speed.

new,I   happened in 1853 to make the first English mention that
tidal friction must increase the length of the day (in the article

and masked the shortening due to thermal contraction, so as to
account for the non-diminution (or, as now admitted, lengthening)

represented to have done, that tides would
                                                " stop the earth's ro
tation "3, but only retard it ; and of what either he or his prede
cessor Kant really said on the matter I was and remain quite
ignorant *. As an obvious consequence of the established view of
tide-causation,     I
                  supposed it common property, — the loss of vis
viva seeming to be a plain truism, from the mere fact that corn has
been ground by tide-mills, the power spent having no possible
source but the earth's original rotary spin.
   The chief difficulty, however, about tide theory has always
struck me as lying in its involving tides obviously the greatest
at the equator, where in fact they are smallest on the whole.
The exceptionally high tides of the British seas, which seem
equalled only in a few areas yet smaller, lead us to form far too
high an estimate of the phenomenon at large, and to doubt
whether Newton's deductions as to the average lunar and solar
effects (say 7 and 2 feet) suffice for the known phenomena ; when
in fact they far more than suffice.       Remembering these school
common-places, and going from our high-tided shores to the
 Caribbean Sea, no part of which has tides exceeding, or barely
exceeding, a foot, and further, learning from navigators that
they regarded such barely sensible tides as general to nearly all
the tropical zone, especially its Pacific half,          I
                                                      was puzzled to
know what becomes of the theoretic neap waves of 5 or 6 feet,
and springs of 9 or 10. In their proper nursing-ground, between
the tropics, or at least the lunar tropics (which enclose, let us
remember, as nearly as we can know, just half the unfrozen earth5,
and probably more than half its watery surface), any approach
even to this theoretic average seems, by Romme's Tables, to be
known only in a few local river bores ; while all the cases deci
dedly exceeding       fluvial or marine, are in high latitudes — our
                        it,
whole British plateau being such an exception, perhaps the most
extended of any, but as trifling on the earth's watery surface as
the two extreme areas of 40 feet tide, in the Severn and near
St. Malo, are upon itself. On the other hand, vast extents of the
tropical Pacific must, as appears from the case of islands like the
Tahiti group (said to have " always high water at noon, and low
at midnight"), be sensibly titleless — all lunar effect being masked
by  the mere heaping-up and withdrawal of coast-water             dayby

and night breezes, in the very region where theory plainly
gives the attractions freest play ! Now, on reviewing the popular
expositions, I presently saw a flaw whose correction would just
tend, and is the only thing I can conceive tending, to explain this
general fact — the confinement of all extra large, and even of the
majority of decidedly sensible tides, to high, or at least extra-
tropical latitudes.
     In all theories the " solid " mass of the earth is regarded as
absolutely unyielding to the forces that deform its waters.            This
involves attributing to it not merely solidity, but a wholly ima
ginary strength or degree thereof, one of whose existence matter
nowhere gives us any trace of evidence. A glance at experiments
on the strongest materials, made for engineering data, shows
how small, compared with geographic distances, is the highest
precipice, for instance, that any known solid could form with
out crushing its own base : — for ice, it is said, but 710 feet6;
chalk and freestone little more than the highest of our cliffs of
them ; and uo stone or metal probably over one mile.                In the
experiments of M. Tresca, cold metals flow perfectly under pres
sures less than exist at the first league or two underground7; so
that a few miles below us an unfilled cavity could no more sus
tain itself in cold iron or cold granite than in water.          Now, is a
body transmitting pressure in all directions, or wherein no cavity
 can exist, to be called a solid or fluid ? In short, what definition
of a " solid " can we give apart from scale ?8 Is not cold butter
or cold asphalt a solid on the scale of inch cubes, and a liquid
on the scale of the " pitch lake " in Trinidad ? Viewed on a ter
 restrial scale, what is the practical difference between the " soli
       " of calvesfoot
 dity                   jelly, whereof a precipice 3 feet high might
 stand, and that of granite, wherein one of three miles might per
 haps be possible ? It is a question, you see, of the depth of
 " superficial viscosity," as Van de Mensbrugghe and Mr. Tomlin-
 son would say.       The " solid " globe that all tide theories assume,
 then, is seen to require some form of matter bearing to quartz
 or diamond the relation that these bear to water; in short,
 we are assuming what inductive reasoning has no right to,
 something s«pernatural, i. e. a quality exalted to a degree not
 approached in known nature. With her solids, or the utmost
 solidity known of, we can get no globe whose behaviour to the
 tidal forces will differ otherwise from that of the sea than in

a degree that leads us to call them solid or only fluid9.
    All this is apart from plutonic heat, and would apply if we
knew the temperature to be icy all through.             Of course there
are two quite general facts (earthquakes and strata-dislocations)
that disprove the existence of any " crust," a term implying
something capable, in parts at least, of self-support as a vault
or shell.    The " solidity " really belongs to what can but be
compared to the silk of a balloon, or the finest grapeskin ; and
talking, in the face of geological facts, of mathematically dedu
cing from precession or nutation, an adamantine "crust," some
hundreds of miles thick, is equivalent to producing mathema
tical proofs, when a frozen pond is momentarily being roughened
with dislocatory cracks (and these only a foot long), that the
ice is so many fathoms thick ! The three newest dislocations of
which we have accounts, those in Cutchi0and that in north New
Zealand n, barely extend a hundred miles each, and did not sen
sibly shake places within a very few degrees of them. What
would be the least length of crack and area of shock in the "crust"
supposed to be deducible from precession ? To illustrate the
possibility of such deductions, Mr. Denison, in his Astronomy

without Mathematics/ observes that a pendulum formed of a
hollow globe filled with quicksilver would have a quicker rate
than if solid, and by the swinging the thickness of shell might be
found. I cannot see that there is any analogy ; for the difference
of rate would depend on the fluid slipping and escaping the in
terrupted rotary movements of the shell.         But in the continuous
rotations of the earth (partaken also by her external fluids) there
is no ground for assuming a slip of any part; and if none is
supposed even as to the rapid diurnal rotation, much less may it
be in the slow nutation and precession movements.
    In any case, however. seeing the earth must (unless we make
preternatural assumptions)        undergo deformation by the same
forces as the sea, only as much less as a thin " surface visco
sity
      " might oblige,    I perceived that the earth-tides must be as
simple as those of a hypothetic uniform sea.             Their summits
cannot travel out of the tropical zone, nor have we reason to
assume any such anomalies as the land-barriers and varying
depths cause in the water-tides.       Hence, though these latter pre

0 to 12 hours, and every " age of the tide," from 1 or 2 hours
about Juan Fernandez to some 60 at Tide-end-town (Tedding-
ton), the earth-tides    must everywhere have sensibly the same
establishment ; and this between 0 and 6 hours, or almost cer
tainly between 2 and 4. Between these limits also fall doubtless
the establishments of the great majority of oceanic surface, at
least within the tropicsi4. The main body, tben, of the tides of the
globe's warmer half,         I
                         regard as the mere difference between a
sea and an earth-tide, and hence their smallness.          There seem
even large districts, quite pelagic, where the minimum of skin
or " surface viscosity " allows the earth -tide so nearly to equal
the marine as to leave the latter insensible, as at Tahiti, and also
the Virgin Isles, where I found, at St. Thomas in 1845, not a
range of four inches during the day after a full moon.            And
these are, as we might expect, the regions giving otherwise most
evidence of instability — in the latter case the evidence from fre
quency of earthquakes being less striking than the numerous
records of shocks, in most of the Caribbean islands, immediately
following or accompanying their chief hurricanes ; that            as              is,   I
suppose, the mere removal, from        wide surface, of about

the greater the tides ; and a few degrees north or south, where
it varies to near its average of 3 hours, they are recorded as
" irregular " or " barely sensible." A similar contrast occurs be
tween the two sides of Madagascar.           On its east coast, where,
from a wide ocean, the sea-wave and earth-wave arrive together,
the tides never anywhere equal 3 feet (or a third of Newton's
and Airy's calculated average for spring tides).           But on the
landward side they are " considerable," and larger the nearer 17°

    In short, conclude the tropical tides are only differential,

tarded     bylocal circumstances as to correspond nearly to low earth.
 But to high latitudes the earth-tides of course do not sensibly
 reach, thus leaving the derived sea-tide to acquire the magni
 tudes familiar to us.         good test of this view might be found

ought, instead of the character of progressive waves, to show
rather that of stationary or see-saw ones, their summits rising
at fixed places, and having between every two            place of mini      a
mum tide, namely, where the water establishment               the same           is
that  I  suppose the ground to have everywhere.

of North     Greenland at the present day; and were the warm
currents of the North Pacific also at the same time stopped, the
northern hemisphere would assuredly be under a state of general
glaciation.
   Suppose also that the warm currents, havingbeen withdrawn from
the northern hemisphere, should flow into the Southern Ocean.
What then would be the condition of the southern hemisphere ?
This transference of heat from the northern hemisphere to the
southern would raise the temperature of the latter hemisphere
about as much as it would lower the temperature of the former.
It would consequently raise the mean temperature of the antarctic
regions much above the freezing-point, and the ice under which
those regions are at present buried would, at least to a great ex
tent, disappear.     The northern hemisphere, thus deprived of the
heat from the equator, would be under a condition of things similar
to that which prevailed during the glacial epoch, while the other
hemisphere, receiving the heat from the equator, would be under
a condition of climate similar to what we know prevailed in the
northern hemisphere during a part of the Upper Miocene period,
when North Greenland enjoyed a climate as mild as that of
England at the present day.
    This is no mere picture of the imagination, no mere hypo
thesis devised to meet a difficult case ; for if what has already
 been stated be not completely erroneous, all this follows as a ne
 cessary consequence from physical principles.        If the warm cur
 rents of the equatorial regions be all deflected into one hemi
 sphere, such must be the condition of things.            But how can
 such a deflection as this take place ? Upon what principles
 could the warm water of the equatorial region ever have been
 deflected all, or even nearly all, upon one hemisphere ? What
 are the physical agencies or conditions that could possibly affect
 the great currents of the globe to such an extent ?
     The Physical causes which deflect Ocean-currents. — Some of
 these have been discussed at considerable length on former occa
 sions ; but I shall here endeavour to state them in a more brief
 and concise form.     A clear apprehension of them is necessary for
 the proper understanding of what follows in reference to the in
 fluence of ocean- currents on the distribution of plant and animal
 life on the surface of the globe during geological epochs.
     Secular displacements from the one hemisphere to the other
 of the great system of ocean -currents take place indirectly from
 an astronomical cause.     The cause to which I refer is the change
 in the eccentricity of the earth's orbit.     Directly, the eccentri
 city of the orbit can have no possible influence on ocean-currents ;
 but indirectly it has, as we shall presently see.       Change of ec
 centricity, although it cannot directly affect    the  currents of the

182        Mr.  J.  Croll  on Ocean-currents     in relation to the
ocean, yet brings into operation physical agencies which can
and do affect such currents to an enormous extent.
   With the eccentricity at its superior limit and the winter
occurring in the aphelion, the earth would be 8,641,876 miles
further from the sun during that season than at present. The re
duction in the amount of heat received from the sun owing to his
increased distance would, upon the principle we have already
stated, lower the midwinter temperature, other things being
equal, about 46°.       In temperate regions the greater portion of
the  moisture    of the  air is at present precipitated in the form of
rain, and the very small portion which falls as snow disappears
in the course of a few weeks at most.           But in the circumstances
under consideration, the mean winter temperature would be low
ered so much below the freezing-point that what now falls as rain
during that season would then fall as snow.             But this is not all ;
the winters would then not only be colder than now, but they
would also be much longer.          At present the winters are nearly
eight days shorter than the summers ; but with the eccentricity
at its superior limit and the winter solstice in aphelion, the
length of the winters would exceed that of the summers by no
fewer than thirty-six days.         The lowering of the temperature
and the lengthening of the winter would both tend to the
same effect, viz. to increase the amount of snow accumulated
during the winter; for, other things being equal, the larger the
snow-accumulating period the greater the accumulation.                I  may
remark, however, that the absolute quantity of heat received du
ring winter is not affected by the decrease in the sun's heat* ; for
the additional length of the season compensates for the decrease
in the sun's heat. As regards the absolute amount of heat re
ceived, increase of the sun's distance and lengthening of the
winter are compensatory, but not so in regard to the amount of
snow accumulated.
   The consequence of this state of things would be that, at the
commencement of the short summer, the ground would be covered
with the winter's accumulation of snow.
   Again, the presence of so much snow would lower the summer
temperature and prevent to a great extent the meltingof the snow.
   There are three separate ways whereby accumulated masses of
snow and ice tend to lower the summer temperature, viz. : —
   First. The snow and ice lower the temperature by means of
direct radiation.       No matter what the intensity of the sun's
rays may be, the temperature of the snow and ice can never rise
above 32°.      Hence the presence of the snow and ice tends by
   * When the eccentricity is at its superior limit, the absolute quantity of
heat received by the earth during the year is about one three-hundredth
part greater than at present. But this docs not affect the question at issue.

direct radiation to lower the temperature                           of all surrounding
 bodies to 32°.
    In Greenland, a country covered with snow and ice, the pitch
 has been seen to melt on the side of a ship exposed to the direct
 rays of the sun, while at the same time the surrounding air was
far below the freezing-point ; a thermometer exposed to the direct
 radiation of the sun has been observed to stand above 100°, while
 the air surrounding the instrument was actually 12° below the
freezing-point*.      A similar experience has been recorded by tra
 vellers on  the snow-fields of the Alpst.
    These results, surprising as they no doubt appear, are what
we ought to expect under the circumstances.          The diathermancy
of air has been well established by the researches of Professor
Tyndall on radiant heat.       Perfectly dry air seems to be nearly
incapable of absorbing radiant heat.        The entire radiation passes
through it almost without any sensible absorption. Consequently
the pitch on the side of the ship may be melted, or the bulb of the
thermometer raised to a high temperature by the direct rays of
the sun, while the surrounding air remains intensely cold.           "A
joint of meat," says Professor Tyndall,
                                             " might be roasted before
a fire, the air around the joint being cold as ice            The air is"J.
cooled by contact with the snow-covered ground, but is not
heated by the radiation from the sun.
    When the air is humid and charged with aqueous vapour, a
similar cooling effect also takes place, but in a slightly different
way.     Air charged with aqueous vapour is a good absorber of
radiant heat, but it can only absorb those rays which agree with
it in period.    It so happens that rays from snow and ice are, of
all others, those which it absorbs best. The humid air will ab
sorb the total radiation from the snow and ice, but it will allow
the greater part of, if not nearly all, the sun's rays to pass unab-
sorbed.     But during the day, when the sun is shining, the ra
diation from the snow and ice to the air is negative ; that           the               is,
snow and ice cool the air              by
                                 radiation.    The result      the air           is,           is
cooled    byradiation from the snow and ice (or rather, we should
say,  to the  snow and ice) more rapidly than            heated    it the
                                                                        is              by
sun   ; and, as    consequence, in country
                     a                       a like Greenland,   covered
with an icy mantle, the temperature of the air, even during sum
mer, seldom rises above the freezing-point.
    Were  it  not for the ice, the summers of North Greenland,
owing to the continuance of the sun above the horizon, would be
as warm as those of England; but, instead of this, the Greenland

summers are colder than our winters.        Cover India with an ice-
sheet, and its summers would be colder than those of England.
    Second. Another cause of the cooling effect is that the rays
which fall on snow and ice are to a considerable extent reflected
back into space.     But those that are not reflected, but absorbed,
do not raise the temperature, for they disappear in the mecha
nical work of melting the ice.       The latent heat of ice is about
142° F. ; consequently in the melting of every pound of ice a
quantity of heat sufficient to raise one pound of water 142° dis
appears, and is completely lost, so far as temperature is con
cerned.    This quantity of heat is consumed, not in raising the
temperature of the ice, but in the mechanical work of tearing the
molecules separate against the forces of cohesion binding them
together into the solid form.      No matter what the intensity of
the sun's heat may be, the surface of the ground will remain per
manently at 32° so long as the snow and ice continue unmelted.
    Third. Snow and ice lower the temperature by chilling the
air and condensing the vapour into thick fogs.             The great
strength of the sun's rays during summer, due to his nearness at
that season, would, hi the first place, tend to produce an increased
amount of evaporation.       But the presence of snow-clad moun
tains and an icy sea would chill the atmosphere and condense the
vapour into thick fogs.     The thick fogs and cloudy sky would
effectually prevent the sun's rays from reaching the earth, and
the consequence would be that the snow would remain unmelted
during the entire summer.       In fact we have this very condition
of things exemplified in some of the islands of the Southern
Ocean at the present day. Sandwich Land, which is in the same
parallel of latitude as the north of Scotland, is covered with ice
and snow the entire summer ; and in the island of South
 Georgia, which is in the same parallel as the centre of Eng
land, the perpetual snow descends to the very sea-beach. The
 following is Captain Cook's description of this dismal place: —
" We thought it very extraordinary," he says, " that an island
between the latitude of 54° and 55° should, in the very height
 of summer, be almost wholly covered with frozen snow, in some
 places many fathoms deep              The head of the bay was ter
minated by ice-cliffs of considerable height ; pieces of which were
continually breaking off, which made a noise like a cannon. Nor
 were the interior parts of the country less horrible.     The savage
 rocks raised their lofty summits till lost in the clouds, and valleys
 were covered with seemingly perpetual snow.         Not a tree nor a
 shrub of any size were to be seen.     The only signs of vegetation
 were a strong-bladed grass growing in tufts, wild buraet, and a
 plant-like moss seen on the rocks           We are inclined to think
that the interior parts, on account of their elevation, never enjoy

beat enough to melt the snow in such quantities as to produce a
river, nor did we find even a stream of fresh water on the whole
coast *.
        "
    Captain Sir James Ross found the perpetual snow at the sea-
level at Admiralty Inlet, South Shetland, in lat. 64° ; and while
near this place the thermometer in the very middle of summer
fell at night to 23° F. ; and so rapidly was the young ice form
ing around the ship, that " began," he says, to have serious

tively low latitude of 59° S., in long. 171° E. (the corresponding
latitude of our Orkney Islands), snow was falling on the longest
day, and the surface of the sea at 32° J.             And during the mouth
of February (the month corresponding to August in our hemi
sphere) there were only three days in which they were not assailed
 by snow-showers §.
     In the Straits of Magellan, in 53° S. lat., where the direct heat
of the sun ought to be as great as in the centre of England,
 MM. Churrca and Galcano have seen snow fall in the middle of
 summer ; and though the day was eighteen hours long, the ther
 mometer seldom rose above 42° or 44°, and never above 51°||.
     This rigorous condition of climate chiefly results from the rays
 of the sun being intercepted by the dense fogs which envelope
 those regions during the entire summer ; and the fogs again are
 due to the air being chilled by the presence of the snow-clad
 mountains and the immense masses of floating ice which come
 from the antarctic seas.          The reduction of the sun's heat and
 lengthening of the winter, which would take place when the
 eccentricity is near to its superior limit and the winter in aphe
 lion, would in this country produce a state of things perhaps as
 bad as, if not worse than, that which at present exists in South
 Georgia and South Shetland.
      If we turn our attention to the polar regions, we shall find
 that the cooling effects of snow and ice are even still more marked.
 The coldness of the summers in polar regions is owing almost
 solely to this cause.         Captain Scoresby states that, in regard
 to the arctic regions, the general obscurity of the atmosphere
  arising from fogs or clouds is such that the sun is frequently in
 visible during several successive days. At such times, when the
 sun is near the northern tropic, there is scarcely any sensible
 quantity of light from noon till midnight^]. "And snow," he says,
  " is so common in the arctic regions, that it may be

      On the north side of Hudson's Bay, for example, where the
   quantity of floating ice during summer is enormous, and dense
   fogs prevail, the mean temperature of June does not rise above
   the freezing-point, being actually 13°-5 below the normal tem

  where there is comparatively little ice, the mean temperature of
  June is as high as 60°.

 Here the summer is only 2°-4 above the freezing-point.
     The condition of things in the antarctic regions is even still
 worse than in the arctic.      Captain Sir James Ross, when between
 lat. 66° and 77°-5, during the months of January and February
 1841, found the mean temperature to be only 26°-5 ; and there
 were only two days when it rose even to the freezing-point.
 When near the ice-barrier on the 8th of February, 1841, a
 season of the year equivalent to August in England, he had the
thermometer at 1 2° at noon ; and so rapidly was the young ice
forming around the ships, that it was with difficulty that he
escaped being frozen in for the winter.

of young ice as far as the eye could discover from the masthead.
   Lieutenant Wilkes, of the American Exploring Expedition,           .
says that the temperature they experienced in the antarctic re
gions surprised him, for they seldom, if ever, had it above 30°
even at midday.
   These extraordinarily low temperatures during summer, which
we have just been detailing, were due solely to the presence of
snow and ice. In South Georgia, Sandwich Land, and some other
places which we have noticed, the summers ought to be about
as warm as those of England ; yet to such an extent is the air
cooled by means of floating ice coming from the antarctic regions,
and the rays of the sun enfeebled by the dense fogs which pre
vail, that there is actually not heat sufficient even in the very
middle of summer to melt the snow lying on the sea-beach.
   We read with astonishment that a country on the latitude of
England should in the very middle of summer be covered with
snow down to the sea-shore, and the thermometer seldom rising
much above the freezing-point.          But we do not consider it so
surprising that the summer temperature of the polar regions
should be low, for we are accustomed to regard a low tempera
ture as the normal condition of things there. We are, however,
mistaken if we suppose that the influence of ice on climate is less
marked at the poles than at such places as South Georgia or
Sandwich Land.
   It is true that a low summer temperature is the normal state
of matters in very high latitudes, but it is so only in consequence
of the perpetual presence of snow and ice. When we speak of
the normal temperature of a place we, of course, as we have
already seen, mean the normal temperature under the present
condition of things. But were the ice removed from those
regions, our present Tables of normal summer temperature
would be valueless.      These Tables give us the normal June tem
perature   while the   ice  remains, but they do not afford us the
least idea as to what that temperature would be were the ice re
moved.     The mere removal of the ice, all things else remaining
the same, would raise the summer temperature enormously.
The actual June temperature of Melville Island, for example, is
37°, and Port Franklin, Nova Zembla, 36° 5 ; but were the ice
removed from the arctic regions, we should then find that the
rammer temperature of those places would be about as high
as that of England.        This will be evident from the following
considerations : —

    The calculations, of course, are made upon the supposition that
the quantity of rays cut off in passing through the atmosphere
is the same at the poles as at the equator, which, of course, is
not exactly the case.          But, notwithstanding the extra loss of
solar heat in high latitudes from the greater amount of rays cut
off, still, if the temperature of the arctic summers were anything
like proportionate to the quantity of heat received from the sun,
it ought to be very much higher than it actually is. Column               III.
represents the actual mean June temperature, according to Prof.
Dove, at the corresponding latitudes.             A comparison of these two
columns will show the very great deficiency of temperature in
high latitudes during summer.            At the equator, for example, the
quantity of heat received is represented by 100 and the tempe
rature 80°; while at the pole the temperature is only 27°-4,
although the amount of heat received is 136.                  This low tempe
rature during summer, from what has been already shown, is due
chiefly to the presence of snow and ice.               If by some means or

other we could remove the snow and ice from the arctic regions,
they would then enjoy a temperate, if not a hot summer.                   In
Greenland, as we have already seen, even in the very middle of
summer snow falls, more or less, nine days out of ten*; but re
move the snow from the northern hemisphere, and a snow-
shower in Greenland during summer would be as great a rarity
as it would be on the plains of India.
     Other things being equal, the quantity of solar heat received
at Greenland during summer is considerably greater than in
England.        Consequently, were it not for snow and ice, it would
enjoy    as  warm    a climate during summer as that of England.
 Conversely,     let the polar snow and ice extend to the latitude of
 England, and the summers of that country would be as cold as
 those of Greenland.        Our summers would then be as cold as our
 winters are at present, and snow in the very middle of summer
 would perhaps be as common as rain.

     How   the foregoing   causes deflect Ocean-currents.   — We   shall now
 see the consequences to which all this leads.            A  high condition
 of eccentricity tends, we have seen, to produce           an accumulation
 of snow and ice on the hemisphere whose winters occur in aphe
 lion. The accumulation of snow in turn tends to lower the
 summer temperature, cut off the sun's rays, and retard the
 melting of the snow.         In short, it tends to produce on that he
 misphere     a state of glaciation.   Exactly opposite effects take place
 on the other hemisphere, which has its winter in perihelion.
 There the shortness of the winters and the highness of the tem
 perature, owing to the sun's nearness, tend to prevent the accu
  mulation of snow.        The general result is that the one hemi
 sphere   is  cooled  and  the other heated.       This state of things now
  brings into play the agencies which lead to the deflection of the
  Gulf-stream and other great ocean-currents.
     Owing to the great difference between the temperature of the
  equator and the poles, there is a constant flow of air from the
  poles to the equator.         It is to this that the trade-winds owe
  their existence.      Now as the strength of these winds will, as a
  general rule, depend upon the difference of temperature that
  may exist between the equator and higher latitudes, it follows
  that the trades on the cold hemisphere will be stronger than
  those on the warm.         When the polar and temperate regions of
  the one hemisphere arc covered to a large extent with snow and
  ice, the air, as we have just seen, is kept almost at the freezing-
  point during both summer and winter. The trades on that he
  misphere will of necessity be exceedingly powerful ; while on
  the other hemisphere, where there is comparatively little snow
  and ice and the air is warm, the trades will, as a consequence, be

190        Mr.  J. Croll on Ocean- currents in relation to the
weak.   Suppose now the northern hemisphere to be the cold one.
The north-east trade-winds of this hemisphere will far exceed
in strength the south-east trade-winds of the southern hemi
sphere.    The median line between the trades will consequently
lie to a very considerable distance to the south of the equator.
We have a good example of this at the present day.           The dif
ference of temperature between the two hemispheres at present
is but trifling to what it would be in the case under considera
tion ; yet we find that the south-east trades of the Atlantic blow
with greater force than the north-east trades, and the result is
that the south-east trades sometimes extend to 10° or 15°
N. lat., whereas the north-east trades seldom blow south of the
equator.     The effect of the northern trades blowing across the
equator   to  a great distance will be to impel the warm water of
the tropics over into the Southern Ocean.        But this is not all ;
not only would the median line of the trades be shifted south
wards, but the great equatorial currents of the globe would also
be shifted southwards.
   Let us now consider how this would affect the Gulf-stream.
The South-American continent is shaped somewhat in the form
of a triangle, with one of its angular corners, called Cape St.
Roque, pointing eastwards.          The equatorial current of the
Atlantic impinges against      this corner ; but as the greater por
tion of the current lies a little to the north of the corner, it flows
westward into the Gulf of Mexico and forms the Gulf-stream.
A considerable portion of the water, however, strikes the laud
to the south of the Cape and is deflected along the shores of
Brazil into the Southern Ocean, forming what is known as the
Brazilian current.
   Now it is perfectly obvious that the shifting of the equatorial
current of the Atlantic only a few degrees to the south of its
present position — a thing which would certainly take place under
the conditions which we have been detailing — would turn the
entire current into the Brazilian branch, and instead of flowing
chiefly into the Gulf of Mexico as at present, it would all flow
into the Southern Ocean, and the Gulf-stream would conse
quently be stopped.      The stoppage of the Gulf-stream, com
bined with all those causes which we have just been considering,
would place Europe under a glacial condition, while at the same
time the temperature of the Southern Ocean would, in conse
quence of the enormous quantity of warm water received, have its
temperature (already high from other causes) raised enormously.
   And what holds true in regard to the currents of the Atlantic
holds also true, though perhaps not to the same extent, of the
currents of the Pacific.
   But there is still another cause which must be noticed : — A

           Physical Theory of Secular Charges of Climate.          191
strong undercurrent of air from the north implies an equally
strong upper current to the north.           Now if the effect of the
undercurrent would be to impel the warm water at the equator
to the south, the effect of the upper current would be to carry
the aqueous vapour formed at the equator to the north ; the
upper current, on reaching the snow and ice of temperate re
gions, would deposit its moisture in the form of snow ; so that
it is probable that, notwithstanding the great cold of the glacial
epoch, the quantity of snow falling in the northern regions would
be enormous.       This would be particularly the case during sum
mer, when the earth would be in the perihelion and the heat at
the equator great.      The equator would be the furnace where eva
poration would take place, and the snow and ice of temperate
regions would act as a condenser.
    The direct effect of eccentricity is to produce on one of the
hemispheres a long and cold winter.         This alone would not lead
to a condition of things so severe as that which we know pre
vailed during the glacial epoch.         But the snow and ice thus
produced    would  bring  into operation,   as we have seen, a host of
physical agencies    whose  combined   efforts would be perfectly suffi
cient to do this.
    A remarkable Circumstance regarding those Causes which lead to
Secular Changes of Climate. —There is one remarkable circum
stance connected with those physical causes which deserves
 special notice.    They not only all lead to one result, viz. an ac
cumulation of snow and ice, but they mutually react on one
 another.    It is quite a common thing in physics for the effect
to react on the cause. In electricity and magnetism, for example,
cause and effect in almost every case mutually act and react upon
 each other.     But it is usually, if not universally, the case that
 the reaction of the effect tends to weaken the cause.       The weak
 ening influences of this reaction tend to impose a limit on the
 efficiency of the cause.     But, strange to say, in regard to the
 physical causes concerned in the bringing about of the glacial
 condition of climate, cause and effect mutually reacted so as to
 strengthen each other.        And this circumstance had a great
 deal to do with the extraordinary results produced.
     We have seen that the accumulation of snow and ice on the
 ground resulting from the long and cold winters tended to cool
 the air and produce fogs which cut off the sun's rays. The rays
 thus cut off diminished the melting-power of the sun, and so
 increased the accumulation.      As the snow and ice continued to
 accumulate, more and more of the rays were cut off; and on the
other hand, as the rays continued to be cut off, the rate of accu
mulation increased, because the quantity of snow and ice melted
 became thus annually less and less.

192        Mr. J. Croll   on Ocean-currents   in relation to the
    Again, during the long and dreary winters of the glacial
epoch the earth would be radiating off its heat into space.    Had
the heat thus lost simply gone to lower the temperature, the
lowering of the temperature would have tended to diminish
the rate of loss ; but it was the formation of snow and ice
more than the lowering of temperature that was the result.
   And, again, the formation of snow and ice facilitated the rate
at which the earth lost its heat ; and on the other hand, the
more rapidly the earth parted with its heat, the more rapidly
were the snow and ice formed.
   Further, as the snow and ice accumulated on the one he
misphere,    they at the same time continued to diminish on
the other.    This tended to increase the strength of the trade-
winds on the cold hemisphere, and to weaken those on the warm.
The effect of this on ocean-currents would be to impel the warm
water of the tropics more to the warm hemisphere than to the
cold.   Suppose the northern hemisphere to be the cold one,
then as the snow and ice began gradually to accumulate on          it,
the ocean-currents of that hemisphere would begin to decrease
in volume, while those on the southern, or warm hemisphere,
would pari passu increase.    This- withdrawal of heat from the
northern hemisphere would tend, of course, to lower the tempe
rature of that hemisphere and thus favour the accumulation of
snow and ice. The more the snow and ice accumulated, the less,
on this account, would 'grow the ocean-currents         and on the
                                                        ;
other hand, the less the ocean-currents        became, the greater
would become the accumulation of snow and ice, — the two effects
mutually strengthening each other.
   The same must have held true in regard to aerial currents.
The more the polar and temperate regions became covered
with snow and ice, the stronger would become the trades
and anti-trades of the hemisphere; and the stronger those winds
became, the greater would be the amount of moisture transferred
from the tropical regions     by
                               the anti-trades to the temperate re
gions ;  and on the other hand, the more moisture those winds
brought to temperate regions, the greater would be the quan
tity of snow produced.
   The same process of mutual action and reaction would take
place among the agencies in operation on the warm hemisphere,
only the result produced would be the diametrically opposite of
that produced in the cold hemisphere.          On this warm hemi
sphere  action and  reaction would  tend  to raise the mean tempe
rature and diminish the quantity of snow and ice existing in
temperate and polar regions.

which we have been considering to produce its direct effects

without influencing the other agents, or being influenced by
them, its real efficiency in bringing about either the glacial
condition of climate or the warm condition of climate, as the
case may have been,       would not have been so great.
    The primary cause that set all those various physical agencies
 in operation which brought about the glacial epoch, was a high
state of eccentricity of the earth's orbit.  When the eccentricity
is at a high value, snow and ice begin to accumulate, from the
increasing length and coldness of the winter, on that hemisphere
whose winter solstice is approaching toward the aphelion.      The
accumulating snow then begins to bring into operation all the
 various agencies which we have been describing ; and, as we have
just seen, these, when once in full operation, mutually aid one
another.     As the eccentricity increases century by century, the
temperate regions become more and more covered with snow and
ice, first on account of the continued increase in the coldness
and length of the winters, and secondly, and chiefly, from the
continued increase in the potency of those physical agents which
have been called into operation.        This glacial state of things
goes on at an increasing rate, and reaches a maximum when the
solstice point arrives at the aphelion.    After the solstice passes
the aphelion, a contrary process commences.        The snow and ice
gradually begin    to diminish  on   the  cold  hemisphere and to
make their appearance on the other hemisphere.            The gla
ciated hemisphere begins to turn warmer and the warm he
misphere colder, and this continues to go on for a period of
ten or twelve thousand years, until the winter solstice reaches
the perihelion.     By this time the conditions of the two hemi
spheres are reversed; the formerly glaciated hemisphere has
now become the warm one, and the warm hemisphere the gla
ciated.   The transference of the ice from the one hemisphere
to the other continues so long as the eccentricity remains at a
high value.
    The Mean Temperature of the whole Earth should be greater
in Aphelion than in Perihelion. — When the eccentricity becomes
reduced to about its present value, its influence on climate is
but little felt.   It is, however, probable that the present exten
sions of ice on the southern hemisphere may, to       aconsiderable
extent, be the result of eccentricity.    The difference in the cli
matic conditions of the two hemispheres        just what should be
                                               is
according to theory   : —  (1) The mean temperature of that hemi
sphere is  less than that of the northern. (2) The winters of the
southern hemisphere are colder than those of the northern.
 (3) The summers, though occurring in perihelion, are also com
paratively cold ;    this, as we have seen,   what ought to be ac
                                             is
cording to theory.        (4) The mean temperature of the whole

  earth is greater in June, when the earth is in aphelion, than in
   December, when it is in perihelion.         This, I venture to affirm,
   is also what ought to follow according to theory, although this
   very fact has been adduced as a proof that eccentricity has
  at present but little effect on the climatic condition of our
  globe.
      That the mean temperature of the whole earth would, during
   the glacial epoch, be greater when the earth was in aphelion
  than when in perihelion will, I think, be apparent from the fol
  lowing considerations : — When the earth was in the perihelion,
  the sun would be over the hemisphere nearly covered with snow
  and ice.    The great strength of the sun's rays would in this
  case have little effect in raising the temperature ; it would be
  spent in melting the snow and ice.        But when the earth was in
  the aphelion, the sun would be over the hemisphere compara
  tively free, or perhaps wholly free, from snow and ice.         Conse
  quently, though the intensity of the sun's rays would be less
  than when the earth was in perihelion, still it ought to pro
  duce a higher temperature, because it would be chiefly em
  ployed in heating the ground, and not consumed in melting
  snow and ice.
      The present difference between the climatic condition of the
  two hemispheres is exactly what it ought to be on the supposi
  tion that it is produced by eccentricity.      From what has already
 been stated, I presume that the low temperature of the southern
  hemisphere cannot be referred to the mere distribution of sea
  and land, unless we admit that an enormous amount of heat is
 constantly being "transferred by means of ocean-currents from
 the southern hemisphere to the northern.           For, as we have seen,
  the physical properties of water, statically considered, ought to
 produce a higher mean temperature than that of land.             And if
 it be admitted that the present lower mean temperature of the
 southern hemisphere is owing to the transference of heat by
 ocean- currents, the question arises, to what extent is this trans
 ference due to eccentricity ?
     An objection answered. — A very common misconception re
 garding the physical cause of the motion of ocean-currents will
 no doubt suggest to the minds of some readers an objection to
 the conclusion arrived at in reference to the displacement of the
currents from the cold to the warm hemisphere.               In order to
meet this objection, it will be necessary to consider at some length
the misconception to which I refer.

 cipal section coincided with the longer dimension.      Let us sup
 pose we have prepared forty-eight plates.      Half of this number
 is to be used to pile up a flight of steps, so to speak, ascending
 in the order 1, 2, 3 from left to right, as shown in fig. 1 ; the
 other half is to be employed to build up a flight of steps ascend
 ing from right to left, as shown in fig. 2.     Prior to laying an
 additional film on the one already in position, a small drop of
 thick copal varnish is to be laid upon the latter, and the fresh
 film is to be pressed down thereon lightly.    By this means there
 are prepared two arrangements or systems, the plates whereof in
 the one marked R (tig. 1), to an observer who looks at the stairs
 from the side, ascend towards the right, and in the one marked
 L (fig. 2) ascend towards the left. Botanists, who in order to
 determine the direction of a spiral imagine themselves placed in
 its axis, would, it is true, and perhaps with more propriety, look
 upon the system marked R as a left-handed one, and the one
 marked L as being right-handed ; in what follows, however, I
 shall abide by what is technically and in the language of common
 life held to be a right-handed and a left-handed screw.
     Now, in the central regular hexagonal portion where the super
 position occurs, the systems R and L behave very nearly like a
 right-handed or left-handed rock-crystal.      Even with not more
 than from four to six turns of mica not excessively thin, the direc
 tion of the rotation may be ascertained upon turning the upper
 Nicol's prism round : in Norremberg's polarizing microscope
 with a wide field one observes the system of rings with a bluish
 central cross ; and on employing both arrangements together
 superposed, very satisfactory indications of Airy's spirals are ma
 nifested.
     Precisely similar results are arrived at by the use of two ar
 rangements in which four systems of plates are stacked up, form
 ing a right-handed and left-handed series crossed at an angle
 of 45°.
     The arrangements that I constructed in the first instance con
 sisted in part of films not very thin, and the thickness of which
 was not completely uniform ; in part, too, the number of turns
 was but limited (from three to six); and I therefore addressed
 myself to Mr. Steeg, from whom I speedily received two pairs of
 systems crossed at an angle of 60°.     They are surprisingly large
 and are executed with extraordinary perfection, and exhibit with
 brilliancy the change of colour on the upper Nicol being turned.
 One pair consists, in each combination, of thirty films of \ X, the
 other of no less than thirty-six films of even a less thickness.
 The first pair gives for red light a rotation of 150°, correspond
ing to a thickness of quartz of about 8 millims.      As a proof of
the great precision and skill with which Mr. Steeg manipulates

                  Prof. Reusch   on Mica-combinations.             197
mica,   I may state that the seventy-two films of the second pair,
12 millims. in width and 30 milhms. long, were all cut from the
same plate.      From a thin plate (^X), for which      I am indebted
to Mr. Steeg's special kindness,       I  have subsequently prepared
systems with four films crossed at 45° which showed Airy's spiral,
whereas my original preparations exhibited, it is true, a slight
change of colour when the Nicol was turned, but gave when su
perposed a confused image of the rings.
    If a mica-combination of this construction is turned round in
its plane in converging light, the planes of polarization being
crossed, the rings indeed remain, but the arms of the black cross
undergo modifications ; and we observe that at the ends of the
diameters of the innermost ring, those diameters being situated
in the planes of polarization, dark patches enter and withdraw.
In like manner, in parallel light, the colour undergoes slight
changes on turning the Nicol round, but the modification takes
place rather in the intensity than in the tone of the colour.
    I have found that these properties of a mica-combination may
be imparted to a quartz by inserting both above and below it an
consequently to be looked upon as elliptically right and left po
larizing media, which approximate all the closer to quartz the
thinner the films are and the greater the number of the turns is.
    In like manner, the modifications of the black cross in Nbr-
remberg's combination (treated of in paragraph 1) may be pro
duced with a plate of calc-spar cut at right angles to the axis
when combined in the manner described with eighth-of-undula-
tion films, the whole arrangement being turned round in its
plane.     Hence we see in the mica-combination the phenomenon
as though a non-rotating uniaxial crystal were elliptically pola
rized and analyzed.
    3. In forming the layers of the films at an angle of 60°, there
are produced on the sides of the central hexagon equilateral tri
angles in which only two systems of films alternately cross at
 60°.    It is easy to convince oneself that in these triangles, ac
 cording to their position, one has to do with elliptical right or
 left rotation. I was thereby led to investigate, as a preliminary
 step, the conduct of two plates of any thickness whatever, the
principal sections of which were crossed at an angle differing from
 90°.    Speaking generally, such a combination gives right or left
 elliptically polarized light ; that is to say, upon turning the upper
 Nicol, one arrives at determining the direction of the rotation, but
 upon turning the combination in its plane, the intensity of the
 colour is changed, and also its tint as well.       The experiment is
 successful, not only with any two mica or sclenite plates, but with

a combination  of mica and selenite, provided only that their      co
lours do not belong to too high an order.
               Fig. 3.                                 Fig. 4.
  In what follows   I occupy  myself solely with mica plates of equal
thickness.   Two such plates, wherein, as before, the principal
section is to correspond with the longer dimension, can be com
bined to form either a right-ascending stair, A (fig. 3) , or a left-
ascending one, B (fig. 4) .    Two such stairs possess in any case
opposite optical rotation, but the direction of the rotation is deter
mined by the thickness of the plates.     If, for instance, the plates
give green of the second order, then the right-ascending stair A
gives also right-handed rotation ; with plates that give yellow of
the first order the contrary is the case.     The angle of the prin
cipal sections is without effect with regard to the direction of the
rotation ; it must, however, differ to a suitable amount from 0°
and 90°.     For instance, if two stairs formed of plates crossing
at an angle of 60° (A and B) are placed on each other with pa
rallel principal sections, there always remains a rotation in the
direction of the uppermost stair.    When the stairs are crossed at
right angles, no kind of action is produced in the central super
posed portion, and this whatever the azimuth of the combined
stair may be.    The two arms of the cross arising from the super
position of plates of various stairs are possessed of opposite
rotation.
  A   case of higher interest, however, is presented when many
equal stairs consisting of very thin films of mica are stacked up
to form a right- or left-ascending combination.      In that case the
rotation of the right-ascending combination is right-handed, and
that of the left-ascending combination is left-handed.       We find
therein, therefore, at once the explanation of the triangles a, b, c
of the combination crossing at 60°, as represented in fig. I. The
first two belong to a right-handed combination, the last to a left-
handed one.      The triangles       a',   b',
                                         act, of course, as opposite
                                                 c'
corresponding    ones.   By  the same rule  are determined the    di
rections of the rotation in the external points of the star of four
systems of plates in   a   combination       crossing at 45°.

                  Prof. Reusch    on Mica-combinations.            1<J9
    These stacked- up combinations, or piles, exhibit also another
 peculiarity : in converging light there is seen through the su
 perposed portion a biaxial system, the principal section of which
 bisects the acute angle of the principal sections of the mica films,
 and the angle subtended by the axis of which is less than that of
 the mica employed.     The black hyperbolas, however, appear only
 when the principal section of the mica-combination         forms an
 angle of 45° with the planes of polarization ; in the case of its
 coinciding with either the one or the other, the innermost rings
 exhibit merely black spots.
    The effect of a pile thus built up may be imitated with some
 thing like approximation by means of a thick plate of mica so
inserted between two eighth-of-undulation plates, whose axes
 are crossed at a right angle, that the principal section of the
 mica plate makes an angle of 45° with them ; and this combina
 tion has a different direction of rotation in parallel light accord
ing as the principal section of the plate bisects the one or the
other pair of the vertical quadrants formed by the principal sec
 tions of the eighth-of-undulation plates.      This reminds one of
 an arrangement described by Dr. John Muller, in the seventh
 edition of his ' Natural Philosophy ' (vol. i. p. 906), wherein, by
 means of an analogous combination of a selenite plate with two
quarter-undulation mica places, the effect of quartz is imitated,
at least in parallel light.
    4. The optical effects of the mica- combinations above described
admit of mathematical treatment ; and it is to be presumed the
phenomena in parallel light will not present anything like the
difficulty which those will offer when converging liyht is used.
Perhaps some competent calculator may be induced to occupy
 himself with this not altogether thankless problem.
    The future will teach us whether these combinations are cal
culated to afford us an explanation, or at least hints, respecting
the connexion of particles endowed with circular polarization.
At present in this respect      I  can only adduce a feeble analogy
and a few suggestions, to which 1 would direct the attention of
those who are learned in such matters.
    In a former communication upon the so-called lamellar pola
rization of alum (see General Meeting of the Academy, July 11,
1867), I have endeavoured to establish that what we have to do
with here is a feeble double refraction due to internal tensions,
which must be conceived to be so acting in the planes of the
octahedron that the optical elasticity is equal in those planes in
all directions, but less than at right angles thereto.        I  haev
further shown how the effect of an optically active octahedron of
alum, or of a preparation therefrom in the direction of two pa
rallel planes of the cube, may be perfectly imitated in the four

200             Prof. Reusch   on Mica-combinations.
distinct quadrants     by four thin films of mica.       In this mica
arrangement, however, there occur      no  superpositions, whereas in
the new arrangements it is precisely upon superpositions            that
the entire matter is founded.      Hence there arises conversely the
question with respect to that crystalline structure which corre
 sponds to a mica-combination with superpositions.
   An idea that naturally suggests itself is as foHows — namely,
that in the ideal active octahedron of alum the planes of tension
parallel to any plane of the octahedron extend only up to the
three rectangular axial planes ; but it is also conceivable that
the derangement brought about in the original structure of a
crystal by means of internal tensions and contractions may be
referred to one or to several planes of tension inclined to the di
rection of the transmitted light, and which always traverse the
entire crystal in a constant direction.     Now we know, it is true,
but very little respecting the normal structure of crystals, and
consequently even much less with regard to the derangements
thereof actually met with ; so that if one chooses to take the
matter up at all, one finds oneself confined for the present to a
few instinctive conjectures.
   In the regular system, in the octahedron of the active alum
octahedron, we meet with the case of individual planes of tension
that do not pass totally through.      The optical phenomena must
become more complicated when other planes, those for instance
of the leucitoid, occur as distinct planes of tension (leucite, anal-
cime  ?).  The circular polarization of chlorate of soda, discovered
by  Marbach,    ispossibly the result of tensions in the direction of
the planes of the dodecahedron, combined with secondary tensions
in the direction of those of the right or left tetrahedron          ;the
mica-combination     of four systems of plates at an angle of 45°,
when the effect of the separate turns     isextremely feeble, affords
perhaps     representation thereof.
            a
   The same mica-combination corresponds perhaps also to the
case of circular polarization      the tetragonal system.
                                   in                          Of the
four systems of plates,    1  and   3would to   a certain extent re
present the structure of       auniaxial non-rotating crystal; the
systems of plates    2  and4   would be the equivalent of tensions
traversing the crystal in totality in the direction of the planes of
the right or left hemioctahedron.        The occurrence of      asingle
plane  of tension  inclined to the axis, or the unequal intensity of
the individual tensions, would be manifested        bythe biaxial cha
racter of the optical phenomena (the dislocation of the black
cross in beryl, in ferrocyanide of potassium, &c.).
   Circular polarization in the rhombohcdral system        isprobably
the result of three planes of tension inclined at equal angles to
the axis and traversing the entire crystal, these planes agreeing

                     Sir James Cockle   on Criticoids.              201
perhaps with those of the one or the other of the two fellow hemi-
scalenohedrons.        The idea of the possibility of internal tensions
of this nature does not suggest itself respecting any substance
so readily as with regard to silica.        If the three tensions are
perfectly equivalent, we shall obtain the normal right- or left-
rotating effect of quartz ; if all the three tensions are wanting,
or when they are balanced reciprocally,         there will remain the
simple uniaxial effect without rotation, as we have it in many
amethysts at some portions.        There yet remains the possibility
that, according to circumstances, those three tensions are of un
equal intensity or are reduced to two ; and we should then have
the biaxial elliptical right- or left-rotating polarization met with
in such a marked manner in various quartzes, and as it is ob
served in the built-up piles above described, or in arrangements
wherein one of the three systems of plates consists designedly of
somewhat thicker or thinner mica.
    With regard to the various phenomena in quartz and amethyst,
I beg leave to refer to the copious and well-arranged observations
contained in Dove's Farbenlehre (pp. 247-260).
    In conclusion,   I  must add that an acquaintance with the effects
of mica-combinations       may possibly be of some value also for the
due appreciation of certain phenomena in mica itself.        The trans
formations of the system of rings in twins, as well as also the
frequent very considerable changes in the angle of the optic axes
in the same specimen, are rendered to a certain extent intelligible
if we assume the existence of regular penetration and intersection
on the part of different individuals.      For my acquaintance with
these phenomena       I  am principally indebted to the communica
tions   I  have received from G. Rose, and to the numerous pre
sents of mica which he has kindly made me, and the possession
of which originally gave rise to my formation of the new mica-
combinations.

XXVI.       On Criticoids. By Sir James Cockle, F.R.S., the Chief
   Justice of Queensland, and President of the Queensland Philo
   sophical Society *.
1.   TN      continuing to use the term critical function, instead of
     -1   seminvariant peninvariant or leading coefficient or source
of covariant, I do so, not from any predilection, but to avoid
words which might lead to the inference that the analogies, here
pointed out, between algebra and the differential calculus, are
susceptible of a greater extension than       I  am now prepared to
            * Communicated by the Rev. Robert Harley, F.R.S.

   show that they admit of.       By a critical function of the roots or
  coefficients   of an  algebraical equation             I
                                                 mean a function which
  remains unaltered when each of the roots is increased or dimi
  nished by any (the same) quantity whatever, or which remains
  unaltered when x + h is substituted for a? in a given equation
  in x. The forms of these functions* are well known. The re
  searches of Spence in connexion with them are not, however, so
  well known t. As semin variants or as invariants, critical functions
  play a conspicuous part in the grand theory of a later period,
  the theory of covariants.
     2. A criticoid stands in the same relation to a factorially
 transformed linear differential equation that a critical function
 fulfils with respect to a linearly transformed algebraical equation.
 I retain the word quantoid to signify the sinister of a linear dif
 ferential equation whereof the dexter is zero ; and that a general
 quantoid has a quadricriticoid and a cubicriticoid      have already! I
 shown.      Illustrations of the use of the quadricriticoid will be
 found in places mentioned below §. The object of this paper                        is,
 not to apply the theory, but to show the existence of criticoids
 of higher degrees and actually to deduce expressions for quarti-
criticoids.
   3. In attempting to obtain quarticriticoids various courses
presented themselves.     First,   deduced them, as in the lower
                                        I
cases,    byelimination. This course has its advantages.  Its dis
advantages are want of directness and of generality, and failure                a
of proof of the existence of criticoids other than those actually
obtained or deducible therefrom                by
                                         combination.   Secondly,                   in
conformity with the analogies of ihe theory of algebraical equa
tions, I  assumed that the coefficients of     quantoid whereof the
                                                          a
second term      made to vanish are criticoids. This course, though
                is
not devoid of advantage, labours under the same disadvantages
as the first, with the additional one that the results require test
ing. Thirdly,      Ifollowed    new course whifih gives
                                    a                          direct      by   a

facilitates the definition of a semicriticoid.

conducted      to (56).   Thus, as the transformation of the quantic
by the linear substitution left the critical functions unaltered, so
the transformation of the quantoid by the factorial substitution
leaves the criticoids unaltered.     In either case the primary trans
formation is such     as to deprive the quantic or quantoid of its
second term ; and the critical functions and criticoids so obtained
are what   I  term primary.     I do not continue the development
commenced in (55), because the criticoids of the second, third,

     11. Independently, then, of the resolution of a quantic into
linear factors, or of a quantoid into linear symbolical factors,
and whether such resolution be theoretically possible or not,
there are certain functions of the coefficients possessing characte
ristic properties.    Such functions are obtained by means of the
primary transformation, and are invariable under the appropriate
 (linear or factorial as the case may be) substitution. They admit
of a third definition, which may be expressed as follows.

critical function    is  function wherein the substitution for each

the function, from which, indeed, u disappears.           Again,    we              if

 §  \.r\BJECT          of this Paper. — In    a paper "On the Mecha-
               niral Action of Heat,"' which I sent to the Royal
 Society of Edinburgh in December 1849, and which was read
in February 1850, it was shown that if sensible or thermometric
heat consists in the motion of molecular vortices supposed to be
arranged in a particular way, and combined in a particular way
with oscillatory movements, the principles of thermodynamics,
and various relations between heat and elasticity, are arrived at
by applying the laws of dynamics to that hypothesist.                   The
object   of the   present paper   is to  show   how  the  general equation
of thermodynamics and other propositions are deduced from the
hypothesis of molecular vortices, when freed from all special
suppositions as to the figure and arrangement of the vortices
and the properties of the matter that moves in them, and reduced
to the following form : — That thermometric heat consists in a mo
tion of the particles of bodies in circulating streams with a velocity
either constant or fluctuating periodically.         This, of course, im
plies that the forces acting amongst those particles are capable
of transmitting that motion.

    § 2. Steady and Periodical Component Motions. A vortex, in
the most general sense of the word, is a stream or current which
circulates within a limited space.         Conceive a closed vessel of any
figure and volume to be filled with vortices or circulating streams,
the mean velocity of circulation in each such stream being the
same ; and let the velocities of the moving particles be either
constant or periodic.         How complex soever those motions may
be, they may be resolved into the following component motions —
a motion of steady circulation with the uniform velocity already
mentioned as the mean velocity, and a motion consisting in pe
riodical. fluctuations of velocity.       Those two component motions
may be called respectively the steady circulation and the dis
turbance.

round in an endless tube with tbe uniform velocity w let de                 ;            p
note the density of the stream, do- the sectional area.    Consider
two cross sections of the stream at which the directions of motion
of the particles are contrary   and consider what resultant forces
                                       ;
are exerted   bythe stream on the two parts into which those two
cross sections divide the tube.   The mass of matter which flows
through each cross section of the tube        unit of time    in   a                is
                                        pwda    ;
and in each unit of time     mass of matter of that amount has its
                                   a

reversal of velocity   of the following amount in absolute units,

and such     isthe amount of each of the pair of inward pressures
which the tube exerts on the stream, and of each of tbe pair of
equal and opposite outward pressures exerted by the stream on
the tube, tending to pull       to pieces.

trifugal tension of an elementary stream.
    The velocity of the particles flowing in the stream may undergo
periodical fluctuations, positive and negative alternately; these
will cause periodical variations in the centrifugal tension           but            ;
the mean value of that tension will continue to be that given                                 by
the formula.
    The mean intensity        the centrifugal tension, in

                                            dividing the amount given
in the preceding expression                by
                                   the collective area, 2do-, of the two

                                           pw%.
    Suppose now that the stream         cut    an oblique sectional
                                                  is               by

   Next, suppose    vessel of any invariable volume and figure to

steady circulation being w, and the mean density p.    The cen

trifugal force will cause a pressure to be exerted in all directions
against the inside of the vessel.   To determine the mean inten
sity of that pressure irrespectively of periodical variations, con
ceive the contents of the vessel to be divided into two parts by
an imaginary plane, and consider what will be the mean inten
sity of the force with which the circulating streams tend to drive
asunder the portions of matter at the two sides of that plane.
The plane will cut the streams that flow across     some normally,             it,

     § 5. Vortices with Heterotopic Action.
                                               — It is conceivable that,
 in solid bodies, molecular vortices may be so arranged as to pro
 duce centrifugal pressures of different intensities in different
 directions.    In such cases it is to be recollected that the sum of
 the mean values of cos2 0 for the obliquities of any set of lines to
 any three planes at right angles to each other is =1 ; whence it
 follows that if jo', p", and p"' be the mean intensities of the centri
 fugal pressures in any three orthogonal directions, we have
                            p'+f+f'^pw*;                                 (4)
 that is to say,   the sum  of the mean intensities of the   three centri
fugal pressures in any three orthogonal directions is equal to twice
 the energy of the steady circulation in a unit of volume.             This
 proposition was not in the paper of 1849-50, which was confined
 to an isotropic arrangement of vortices.
     § 6. Energy of the Periodical Disturbances.
                                                     — In the paper of
 1849-50, p. 152, equation x., the energy of the periodical
 disturbances was taken into account by multiplying the energy
 of the steady circulation by a factor k greater than unity, thus
 giving for the total energy in a unit of volume the following
 expression,
                               pv1
                                    = kpw*
                               T      ~2"
 in which v* denotes the mean of the squares of the resultant
 velocities of the particles with their combined motions.               The
 values of the factor k, being the ratio which the total energy of
 the molecular motions bears to the energy of the steady circula
 tion, are to be deduced in each case from the results of experi
 ments on specific heat.
    Thus the energy of the disturbances in a unit of volume is
 expressed by
    It may now be observed, in addition, that the energy of the
 disturbances may, and indeed must, be at times partly potential
 as well as actual — in other words, partly due to displacement as
 well as to fluctuation of velocity.
     Let + u be the greatest fluctuation of velocity ; then a particle
                                        w*
 of the mass unity has the energy g- due to that fluctuation, in
 addition to the energy due to the steady circulation.           It is only
 at the instants of greatest disturbance of velocity    that   the energy

                      of Molecular Vortices.                        215
is all actual ; at every other instant the energy is partly poten
tial. Hence v*=kur may be taken to denote, not the square of
an actual velocity common to all the particles, but the value to
which the square of the velocity of the particles would rise if all
the energy of the disturbances, actual and potential, were ex
pended in increasing the velocity of steady circulation.

   § 7. Total Energy of Thermal Motions. The total energy of
the motion compounded of steady circulation and periodical dis
turbances, in a unit of volume, is expressed, as in the paper of
 1849-50, by the following equation, which also shows its rela
tion to the centrifugal pressure,
                         kpw*     3k
in which (to recapitulate the notation) p is the mean density,
w the velocity of steady circulation ; the centrifugal pressure p
is expressed in absolute units of force on the unit of area; and
the proportion k, in which the total energy of thermal motions
exceeds the energy of steady circulation, is a quantity whose
values and laws are left to be deduced from the results of ex
periment.
   § 8. Determination of Centrifugal Pressures.
                                                    — The external
pressure exerted by any substance, as we find it in nature, is a
complex quantity, being compounded of the centrifugal pressure
already mentioned, and of forces which may be classed together
under the name of cohesion.       To enable us to distinguish these
components of the total pressure from each other, we have the
principle that the centrifugal pressure varies as the density sim
ply ; whereas pressure or tension, or stress (to use a general
terra), arising from cohesive forces, must vary as some function
of the density, of a higher order than the first power.
   The perfectly gaseous state is an ideal state in which the sub
stance exerts no external pressure except that which varies as the
density simply — that   is,centrifugal pressure.    It     is
                                                          impossible
to obtain a   substance absolutely in the state of perfect gas; but
the cohesive stress diminishes with increase of temperature and
diminution of density in such     a manner that  it    possible, as
                                                      is             is
well known, to obtain substances approaching very nearly to the
perfectly gaseous state, such as atmospheric air and various other
gases ;  and the actual pressures of such nearly perfect gases may
be used, either as approximate values of the pressures in the ideal
state of perfect gas, or as data for calculating the latter kind of
pressures  by  the method of limits. We thus have the means of
determining, to  a   close approximation, the centrifugal pressure
of given substance at
  a                           given temperature and density

    § 9. Temperature and Specific Heat.
                                              — It is shown in the paper
of 1849-50, that temperature, according to the hypothesis of
molecular vortices, is a function of the quotient found by dividing
the energy of the steady circulation in a unit of mass by a con
stant depending on the nature of the substance ; which constant
may be defined as the value which the energy of steady circula
tion in a unit of mass of the given substance assumes at a
standard temperature, such as that of melting ice.           The energy
of the steady circulation in a unit of mass is

whence it appears that the principle stated as to absolute tem
perature is expressed by equation (7), already given in §8. The
total energy of the thermal motions in a unit of mass is expressed
by dividing equation (6) of § 7 by the density p ; hence that quan
tity of energy (denoted for shortness by Q) is given in terms of
the absolute temperature by the following equation,

stant for a given substance in all conditions ; and that is the part

this part of the specific heat is constant or variable.               Experi

but that its values for the same substance in the solid, liquid,
and gaseous conditions are often different*.
    The apparent specific heat contains other terms, depending on
the expenditure of energy in performing external and internal
work, according to principles of thermodynamics which are now
well known.

    §11.    General Equation of Thermodynamics. — In the paper of
 1849-50, pp. 158-164, the general equation of thermodynamics
 (equation 6 of that paper, p. 161) is deduced from the hypo
 thesis of molecular vortices, on the supposition of a special form
 and arrangement of the vortices.            In a subsequent paper, " On
 the Centrifugal Theory of Elasticity," read to the Royal Society
 of Edinburgh in December 1851 (Transactions, vol. xx. pp. 433-
 436), the same general equation (being equation 25 of the
 latter paper, p. 436) is deduced from the hypothesis of molecular
 vortices, without any special supposition as to the form and
 arrangement of the vortices, but with certain assumptions as to
 the laws of the elasticity of the matter which moves in them. In

a  paper read to the British Association in 1865, and published
 in the Philosophical Magazine for October of that year, a further
 generalization is effected ; and it is shown that the general equa
tion of thermodynamics follows from the supposition that sensible
 heat consists in any kind of steady molecular motion within
 limited spaces, without any assumption either as to the figures
of vortices, or as to the special properties of the matter that
 moves in them.       The object of this section of the present paper
is to show how the same general equation is deducible from the
hypothesis of molecular vortices »s stated at the commencement
of the paper — that        freed from all special suppositions except
                             is,
that of   a steady circulation, combined with periodical disturb

of mass of the body, of the nature of strain, such as dilatations
and distortions; and let X, Y, Z, &c. denote the forces, of the
nature of elastic stress, which the body exerts in the respective
directions of such changes, so that while the thermodynamic
function undergoes the change d<j, the external work done by
unity of mass of the body is

XXVIII.    On Illumination and Polarization in Transparent                 Sub
                     stances. By L. Soret.
     My DEAR Tyndall,                        Geneva, Jan. 24, 1870.
              been somewhat long in replying to your kind letter
 1HAVE
   of the     5th of December ; numerous occupations have pre
vented me from communicating to you my idea of how, by the pre
sence of particles diffused in a transparent medium, we may theo
retically explain the various phenomena of illumination and of
polarization which are observed when a pencil of light passes
through a transparent substance.        I am far from believing that
my theory is not open to objection, and I should be at no loss to
criticise it myself and to raise doubts in respect of it. You know,
moreover, how many delicate points are involved in all that
concerns the theory of reflection.      I   think, nevertheless, that
my views on this subject will not be uninteresting to you.
   Let us see, then, how we can account for the action exerted
by these particles.
   I. The first hypothesis would be to assume that the vibratory
motion of the aether is communicated to those minute parti
cles which occur in the path of the pencil of light pretty much
as sound -vibrations in air are communicated to solids, such as
strings or membranes.        The corpuscles would thus become cen
tres of disturbance, sending in all directions vibrations of the
same kind as those which constitute the pencil of light ;            if,
                                                                  more
especially,  this pencil  were  polarized, the  waves emitted      the by
particles   would  consist  of rectilinear vibrations parallel  to the
incident vibrations.     The explanation of the phenomenon would

222          M. L. Soret   on Illumination and Polarization
be the    same as tbat given by M. Lallemand, except in what
concerns the origin of these waves.
    I confine myself here to mentioning this first hypothesis : as it
has not hitherto been supported by any experimental proof, nor
even by any analogy with other phenomena of light, it would be
useless to discuss it at present.
    II. A second hypothesis would assume that a phenomenon of
diffraction is produced analogous to that of gratings. Let (is
imagine the transparent medium divided into layers perpendi
cular to the pencil of light ; in each of these layers there are
particles which should act like a very fine powder deposited
on a transparent plate ; that is to say, part of the light is no
longer propagated in a right line, but diffuses itself in various
directions.    The vibrations producing this scattered light re
tain the form and the direction of the vibrations of the illu
minating pencil ; hence, if this is polarized, the scattered light
will consist of rectilinear vibrations parallel to those of the pencil.
    I am inclined to think that this diffraction really takes place,
and contributes to the production of the phenomena observed,
especially in directions which differ little from the direction of
the illuminating pencil ; but in any case the particles should
also reflect light, and this effect ought to predominate over that
which has been mentioned.
  III.  Let us, then, consider the reflected light. Let abed (fig. 1 )
be a body illuminated by a pencil of parallel rays,        b, sa, s" c.
                                  Fig. 1.
Suppose the observer's eye placed in any position o, looking at
the body abed.          For shortness' sake let us call Ike angle of
vision the augle o a s formed by the visual ray and the inci

                         in Transparent   Substances.                  223
dent pencil.     Let the plane of vision be the plane o as com
prising the pencil of light and the visual ray.
     If
      the dimensions of the body abed are large as compared
with the wave-lengths of the light, according to the ordinary laws
of reflection the eye in the position o will only receive the rays
reflected by a point a, such that the normal a n to the surface
of the body at this point is situated in the plane of vision, and
that the angle of incidence saw is equal to the angle of reflec
tion nao.      The reflected light will in general be partially po
larized ; and if the eye is in such a position that the visual
angle is double the angle of polarization,     the ray a o will be
totally polarized, the plane of polarization coinciding with the
plane of vision.
   But we know that if the reflecting surfaces are not very great
as compared with the wave-lengths        of the light, the ordinary
laws of reflection are no longer applicable, and each point of the
reflecting surface may be considered as a centre of disturbance
from which waves are really emitted — or, in other words, that
the motion of the aether in all directions other than that of the
reflected ray in the ordinary case of reflection is no longer an
nulled by interference.      This is what results from the reason
ings   and  experiments    of Fresnel.      then, the body abed
                                             If,                           is
very small and has dimensions comparable to the wave-lengths,
the eye will receive more or less intense reflected rays pro
ceeding from all points of the illuminated surface of the body.
Thus, for instance, the visual angle being double the angle of
polarization, the eye no longer receives merely the light totally
polarized in the plane of vision reflected from the point a, but also
non-polarized light, or light partially polarized, emitted        the by
other points of the surface illuminated            by
                                                the incident pencil.
There      no longer any reason why the maximum polarization
           is
should be exhibited when the angle of vision        twice the polari
                                                        is
zing angle.
     It  clear that this reasoning applies to all the corpuscles
          is
which are illuminated        by
                           the luminous pencil thus   first source
                                                        ;    a
of difficulty   removed, that, namely, which you mentioned in
                    is
your communication to the Royal Society on the 16th of De
cember 1868.
    IV. Let us now suppose that the pencil of light sa,         (fig.
                                                                 s'
                                                                 c         2)
is polarized in horizontal plane perpendicular to the plane of the
                     a
figure    ;  illuminates the very small particles, which first of all we
               it
will suppose to be spherical. Let us now examine what takes place
in  the case of one of these particles, abed. The plane of polar
ization    being horizontal, we will assume that the incident
vibrations of the aether are rectilinear and vertical, and there
fore parallel to the plane of the figure.      The vibrations will be

224         M. L. Soret  on Illumination and Polarization
reflected by each point of the illuminated part of the sphere ;
and as the dimensions of this sphere are very small, each
                                  Fig. 2.
point will become     a centre of disturbance or of waves.       The
reflected vibrations forming the system of waves which proceed
from one of the points of the spherical surface will be rectilinear,
and their direction will be given by the laws of reflection of po
                                I
larized light. (You see that assume the direction of the reflected
rays in these conditions to be the same as that which Fresnel
assumes in the case of light reflected from large surfaces.      The
tenability of this hypothesis might in certain cases be contested ;
but  I  think that even if it ought to be modified, that would
make no change in the considerations I am about to develope,
except for a part of those laid down in § VIII.)
    Each reflected vibration may be regarded as resulting from
three component vibrations — one vertical, the second horizontal
and parallel to the luminous pencil, the third horizontal and
perpendicular to the pencil.
    Suppose the eye placed in the horizontal plane passing through
the centre of the sphere.      There is no reason why the vertical
components of the various reflected waves should not reach the
eye, which thus receives light polarized in a horizontal plane and
proceeding in greater or less quantity from all the illuminated
points of the reflecting corpuscle.
    Let us pass to the horizontal components parallel to the pencil.
Consider, for instance, the point m on the vertical great circle of
the sphere parallel to the pencil, the normal at this point making
an angle of 45° with the direction of the pencil.       The incident
vertical vibrations give rise at the point a to reflected waves en
tirely formed of vibrations horizontal and parallel to the pencil ;
that is to say, the other components are null for this point.
These vibrations are propagated in all directions, and therefore
also in the direction of the eye placed in the horizontal plane

                     in Transparent Substances.                          225
passing through the centre of the sphere.          But, on the other
hand, the point in', which is symmetrical with the point m, also
gives rise to waves of equal intensity formed of horizontal vibra
tions parallel to the pencil ; only there will be a difference of
phase of half a wave-length between the waves arising from the
point nJ and those from the point m. In fact the incident wave
formed of vertical vibrations reaches the points m and ml in
the same phase.      Hence, if the molecules of tether in the in
cident vibration approach the reflecting surface at m, they are
at the same time moving away from this surface at ml; hence the
motion will be from right to left in the vibration reflected by
the point wi, while it will be from left to right in the vibration
reflected by the point ml.     The reflected waves will therefore be
in opposite phases, and will destroy each other in all points at
equal distance from m and ml — that is to say, in all points of
the horizontal plane passing through the centre of the sphere :
thus the eye placed in this plane will not be affected by the ho
rizontal vibrations proceeding from m and ml. In other corre
sponding points the effect will be the same (excepting that it
will not be to the whole of the reflected vibrations, but merely
to the horizontal component parallel to the beam that the rea
soning applies).     In fine, the horizontal components parallel to
the luminous pencil proceeding from the illuminated part of the
sphere situated above the plane of vision will be destroyed by
interference with the same components proceeding from the part
of the sphere which is below the plaue of vision.
    The same reasoning applies to the third components, horizon
tal and perpendicular to the pencil of light. Thus the effect
produced by the point n will be destroyed by that of the cor
responding point n' fur the eye placed in the horizontal plane
passing through the centre of the sphere.
    In short, the eye in the position in question only receives
light formed by the first components — that              composed of
                                                       is is,
vertical vibrations.    In other words, the light       polarized in        a
horizontal plane.
  It   iseasy to understand that, if    the spherical corpuscles arc
small enough, this destruction    by   interference will be produced
even outside the horizontal plane which passes through the
centre of the sphere, provided the observer       is not too far off.
Thus when the plane of vision coincides with the plane of polar
 ization of the pencil of light (which I     will suppose to be very
 thin), all the illuminated corpuscles will transmit to the eye
light consisting only of vertical vibrations.      This     confirmed
                                                                is
 by   experiment.
   V. Always assuming that the corpuscles are spherical, let us
examine     what ensues when the horizontal pencil               of light   is

                                                                             '
22G                M. L. Sorct     on       Illumination and Polarization
polarized in a vertical plane — that is to say, when the vibrations
of the incident light are horizontal.
   For the eye placed in the horizontal plane which passes through
the centre of the sphere, the first vertical components will de
stroy each. other by interference.    Let us, in fact, take two symT
metrical points, n and       the incident horizontal vibrations will
give rise to vertical reflected vibrations (or at least to vertical
components); but, the inclination of the reflecting surface in
reference to the horizontal vibrations being in opposite directions
for the points n and      the reflected motion must also be in the
                                 n',
opposite direction.
    The second components, which are horizontal and parallel to
the pencil, may reach the eye         there-     no reason why they
                                                 ;             is
should interfere.    The intensity of the light due to these com
ponents must be very feeble, as we shall subsequently see.
    Nor will the third, horizontal components perpendicular to
the pencil neutralize each other.
    Thus the eye placed in the horizontal plane passing through
the centre of the sphere will receive light from the second and
 third components.     If the visual angle         90°, the third com
                                                                   is
ponents   will  produce  no  effect   upon   the  eye, since they act
longitudinally.     Thus the eye   in  this  position will only receive
 the impression of the horizontal components parallel to the
 pencil, which, as we have already said, are very feeble, and often
quite imperceptible.
   "We readily deduce from this the explanation of the experi
ment which was suggested to you         Mr. Stokes*.      by
   If the visual angle     greater or less than 90°, the eye will

receive the combined effect of the second and third components                        ;
but the direction of the resulting vibrations will be alwaya
parallel to the horizontal plane passing thro/Ugh the incident
pencil. This result     also quite in accordance with experiment.
                                 is

shall easily find what takes place       regarding        by

 from the pencil polarized perpendicularly to the plane of vision.
      *
          In   a   private note Professor      Stokes suggested to me the employment
 of polarized light to illuminate the actinic cloud, and  feel pleasure in
                                                                        I
 giving him the credit of the suggestion.    Had the suggestion not come
 to me, however, the result would have been substantially the same,              —
                                                                                 J.   T.

Now,   aa we  have already said and as we shall show, these com
ponents are very feeble.
   If the angle of vision is less or more than 90°, then the hori
zontal components perpendicular to the pencil, proceeding from
the pencil polarized perpendicularly to the plane, begin to act,
and the polarization ceases to be at its maximum.
   VII. Let us still suppose the plane of vision to be horizontal,
and that the illuminating pencil is formed of natural light — that is-
to say, of two pencils polarized at right angles, one in the hori
zontal plane, the other in the vertical plane.        Let us inquire
why in the reflected light the components parallel to the pencil
are very feeble as compared with the vertical components.
   In the first place, even if the sphere had an absolute reflecting
power, there would be a considerable predominance of the ver
tical components.      In fact, on the vertical great circle aec, the
pencil polarized in a horizontal plane will give rise to reflected
vertical components at all points, except the two points at 45°
from e.    The pencil polarized in the vertical plane, on the con
trary, will not produce at any part of the great circle components
parallel to the pencil; the same is the case with the great circle
a be.    As regards the horizontal great circle b e, the first pencil
will everywhere produce only vertical components, while the
second pencil will produce no components parallel to itself at b,
nor will it at e ; it is only between these points that it will pro
duce any.
   But, further, this preponderance of the vertical components
will be greatly increased by the fact that the reflecting power of
the sphere is not perfect.     Thus on the horizontal great circle
h c (which in the case of perfect reflecting power would pro
duce most components parallel to the pencil), the intensity of
the vertical components will be least at b, where its value will
be  proportional to             , n being the refractive  index of the
corpuscles   as compared     with the transparent medium ; from
b this intensity will continually increase, up to e, where its
value is proportional to 1.       On the other hand, the intensity of
the components parallel to the pencil will be zero at b, zero again
at the point for which the angle of incidence is equal to the
angle of polarization, zero again at the point e. Passing three
times through zero, the intensity of these components must
nowhere be considerable on the great circle be, &c.
   The exact calculation of these intensities is very complicated.
M. Cellerier has been kind enough to do it at my request for
several values of the refractive index, and he has found that the
vertical components greatly predominate over those parallel to
the pencil.
                                   Q2

228   On Illumination and Polarization in Transparent Substanees.
             I
   VIII. have hitherto always supposed that the corpuscles
were spherical.    Is this condition necessary for the explanation
which I have given of the phenomena of illumination ?         think       I
not.   For, ou the one hand, whatever be the shape of the parti
cles, the surface is always tarnished, and the phenomena of in
terference which             I
                     have pointed out will always be partially pro
duced.    On the other hand, we have not to consider a single par
ticle. In a layer perpendicular to the luminous pencil there is
a large   number of particles ; there must, then, in general be
in this layer as many surfaces in a certain position as in the
position symmetrical with it. These symmetrical surfaces will
produce the interferences of certain components of the reflected
vibrations,        as   if   they belonged to the same particle.
   This is the summary of my theory, or rather of my attempt at
a theory.
   Although this letter is already long, will you permit me to
add a few words? You will have seen that M. Lallemand
has answered (Comptes Rendus, Dec. 20) the note        communi     I
cated to the Academy (Comptes Rendus, Dec. 6), and that he
still thinks the illumination of liquids and of solids should be
attributed to a lateral propagation of the motion of the aether,
and not to particles difFused in the transparent medium.     The
reasons which he adduces in support of his opinion do not seem
to me conclusive ; but I will not dwell upon this subject.                    I
will merely mention that I have recently made a series of ex
periments by taking water and producing light precipitates in it
by means of certain reagents.               Whenever the precipitate was
formed of particles so fine that they were not visible to the
naked eye, and in such small quantity that the transparency of
the water was not sensibly diminished in diffused light, I ob
served a great increase in the illuminating power of the line of
light, with the same phenomena of polarization.
    Thus    Itake water from the Lake of Geneva which has quite
settled, and which has very little illuminating power; it con
tains some traces of chlorides in solution ; I add to              it,   by
                                                                          means

                                      is   a
tint of the indigo of the spectrum).
    It appears to me probable that this incomplete polarization               is
due, at least partially, to multiple reflections when the particles
in suspension become very numerous.                    If water containing

       Prof. A. De la Rive     on the Organic Dust of the  Air.     229
 chloride of silver is exposed to the sun's light, the precipitate
 changes its nature, the line is extremely distinct, but the phe
 nomena of polarization are far less definite than before.
    I do not see how these facts can be due to any other cause
 than that of particles in suspension.

that the current Number of Fraser's Magazine contains a brief
historic summary of this subject, to which           I would refer the
reader.     I look forward with extreme interest to the publication
of M. De la Rive's photometric observations.

   February 24, 1S70.
       My   DEAR TYNDALL,                     Geneva, February 22, 18/0.
    I have read with great interest the analysis of your lecture at
the Royal Institution on the 21st of January, and admired the
experiments by which you succeed in demonstrating that all the
dust floating in the air of London is of an organic nature. Your
conclusions as regards the probable cause of epidemic diseases
remind me that I had announced the same consequences in an
inquiry in which, by a process different from yours,        I sought to
prove the presence of organic dust in atmospheric air.           Permit
me to state in a few words the results of this inquiry.
    I had followed with care the labours of Pasteur, who, like you,
had deprived the air of its organic matter, sometimes by passing
it through a red-hot tube, and sometimes by the employment of
cotton wool.      I had been struck by the fact that the air on high
mountains, and more particularly on the summits covered with
snow, does not contain any such matter.         I  was thus led to be
lieve that the remarkable transparency of atmospheric air when
it is charged with humidity, both before and after rain, arises
from the fact that the organic particles which float constantly in
the air, at least over plains, become transparent by absorbing

230      Prof. A. De la Hive    on tlw Organic   Dust of the Air.
water, or fall to the earth on becoming heavier by the fact of
that absorption.    Finally, I found in the observations of De Saus-
surc, and those of Humboldt, facts relative to the transparency
of air which seemed to indicate that the clearness always exists
in those places where organic matters are absent, or where the
humidity annuls their influence.
   These considerations led me to believe, as stated in the memoir
communicated to the Acad emy of Sciences in Paris ( Comptes Rendus,
vol. lxiv. p. 1221, and Ann. de Chim. et de Phys. vol. xii. p. 243),
that it would be interesting to embrace the transparency of the
atmosphere in the number of meteorological elements which are
subjected to regular determination, and thus to connect it in a pre
 cise manner with the other elements, such as the pressure, the
 temperature, the degree of humidity, the direction of the wind,
 and, above all, the hour of the day, the period of the year, or
 the seasons.   This class of observations,     I added, possessed in
 terest, not only for science properly so called, but perhaps also
 for medicine, as regards the hygiene of epidemic diseases.       It is
 very probable   indeed,   I  said,  that miasmas,   the  hydrogenous
 nature of which was demonstrated in 1834 by M. Boussingault,
 are due to these organic germs, whose presence would be thus
established in a manner tolerably exact by the degree of trans
parency, more or less, of the air.
    I expressed myself thus in 1867 ; but for the purpose of veri
fying my conclusions,      I  had previously sought to appreciate
the variations of transparency by a photometer of a new construc
tion, the description of which was given at the Meeting of the
 Soci^te Helvdtique in Geneva in 1865.         (See my discourse on
 opening the Society, August 23, 1865, Ann. de Chim. et de
 Phys. vol. xxiv. p. 55.)     This instrument, the detailed descrip
 tion of which is to be found in the memoir above referred to,
has since served me in my regular observations.            It confirms
the idea which     I  entertained regarding the influence on the
 transparency of the air of organic matter, which floats in greater
or less quantity according to the hour of the day, the period of
the year, &c., and the effect of which is more or less abolished
by the humidity of the air.
    I intend to publish immediately the result of these obser
vations, which continue to be regularly made at the Observa-
vatory of Geneva. Perhaps the Editors of the Philosophical Ma
gazine would be good enough to make them known.            They might
be preceded by a description        of the instrument which    I  name
an atmospheric photometer, and by means of which the observa
tions were made.

  June    17, 1869. — Lieut. -General Sabine, President, in    the Chair.
  PHE      following communication was read         : —
        "On the Refraction-Equivalents           of the Elements."   By    J.
H. Gladstone, Ph.D., F.R.S.
   This   paper is a continuation of the researches on refraction which
have   been already published by the author in conjunction with the
Rev.  T. Pelham Dale*.
   It is divided into two parts — the data, and the deductions. The
data   consist of the refraction-equivalents of some simple and many
compound bodies, calculated from the indices observed by various
chemists and physicists, or by the author himself, together with a
series of observations on about 150 salts in solution.        The method
of examining these, and the nature of the inferences to be drawn from
such experiments, have already been explained in the Proceedings of
the Royal Society, 180S, pp. 440-444.
   The deductions consist ot a comparison of the evidence bearing on
each elementary substance, beginning with carbon, hydrogen, and
oxygen, which were in the first instance determined by Landolt.           In
the case of some elements all the means of calculation lead to the
same number within probable errors of experiment ; but in the case
of others two or more different equivalents are indicated. Thus iron
has one value in the ferrous and another in the ferric salts ; and the
more highly oxidized compounds of sulphur, phosphorus, arsenic,
and nitrogen give different numbers from those given by their sim
pler combinations.      The refraction-equivalent of potassium is esti
mated from a variety of sources, and the number thus arrived at is
employed for the calculation of the other metals that give soluble
salts, and for the radicals with which they are combined.
   The following Table (p. 232) gives the general results of these de
ductions. The equivalents that have been deduced from only one
compound, or of which the different determinations arc not fairly
accordant, are marked 1 in the Table.
   The specific refractive energy of a body is in some respects worthy
of more consideration than the refraction-equivalent, since, being
only the refractive index minus 1 divided by the density, it is a phy
sical property independent of chemical theories as to the atomic
weight. Among suggestive facts are noticed : — the extreme energy of
hydrogen ; the existence of pairs of analogous elements having the
same, or nearly the same, energy — as bromine and iodine, arsenic
and antimony, potassium and sodium, manganese and iron, nickel and
cobalt ; and that among the metals capable of forming soluble salts

     ON COMETS     AND METEORS.       BY DANIEL K1RKYVOOD         LL.D.,
                 PROFESSOR IN INDIANA UN1VERSTITY*.
'"PHE     comets    which passed their perihelia in August 1862 and
        January   1866 will ever be memorable in the annals of science,
as having     led to the discovery of the intimate relationship between
comets and meteors.         These various bodies found revolving about
the sun in very eccentric orbits may all be regarded as similar in
their nature and origin, differing mainly in the accidents of magni
tude and density.       The recent researches, moreover, of Hoek, Le-
verrier, and Schiaparelli have led to the conclusion that such objects
exist in) great numbers in the interstellar spaces, that in consequence
of the sun's progressive motion they are sometimes drawn towards
the centre of our system, and that if undisturbed by any of the large
planets they again pass off in parabolas or hyperbolas. When, how
ever, as must sometimes be the case, they approach near Jupiter,
 Saturn, Uranus, or Neptune, their orbits may be transformed into
ellipses. Such, doubtless, has been the origin of the periodicity
of the August and November meteors, as well as of numerous
comets.
    In the present paper it is proposed to consider the probable con
 sequences of the sun's motion through regions of space in which
 cosmical matter is widely diffused, to compare these theoretical
 deductions with the observed phenomena of comets, aerolites, and
 falling stars, and thus, if possible, explain a variety of facts in
 regard to those bodies which have hitherto received no satisfactory
explanation.
     1. As comets now moving in elliptic orbits owe their periodicity
 to the disturbing action of the major planets, and as this planetary
 influence is sometimes sufficient, especially in the case of Jupiter and
 Saturn, to change the direction of cometary motion, the great majority
 of periodic comets should move in the same direction with the pla
 nets.    Now, of the comets known to be elliptical, 70 per cent, have
 direct  motion.   In this respect, therefore, theory and observation are
 in striking harmony.
     2. When the relative positions of a comet and the disturbing
 planet are such as to give the transformed orbit of the former a small
 perihelion distance, the comet must return to the point at which it
 received its greatest perturbation — in other words, to the orbit of
 the planet. The aphelia of the comets of short period ought there
 fore to be found, for the most part, in the vicinity of the orbits of
 the major planets.       The actual distances of these aphelia are as
 follows : —

to find   it collected in cosmical clouds similar to the visible nebula?.
Now    thi3, in fact, is precisely what has been observed in regard both
to comets and meteors.             In 150 years, from 1600 to 1750, sixteen
comets were visible to the naked eye*, of which eight appeared in the
twenty-five years, from 1664 to 1689. Again, during sixty years, from
1 750 to 181 0, only five comets were visible to the naked eye, while in
the next fifty years there were double that number.                  The probable
cause of such variations is sufficiently obvious.               As the sun in his
progressive motion approaches a cometary group, the latter must, by
reason of his attraction, move toward the centre of our system, the
nearer members with greater velocity than the more remote. Those
of the same cluster would enter the solar domain at periods not very
distant from each other — the forms of their orbits depending upon
their original relative positions with reference to the sun's course,
and also on planetary perturbation.              It is evident also that the pas
 sage  of   the   solar    system through     a  region of space comparatively
destitute of cometic clusters would be indicated by a corresponding
 paucity of comets.            By the examination, moreover, of any complete
Table of falling stars, we shall find a still more marked variation in
 the frequency of meteoric showers.
    Previously to 1833, the periodicity of shooting-stars had not been
 suspected.       Hence the showers seen up to that date were observed
 accidentally.       Since the great display of that year, however, they
 have been regularly looked for, especially at the November and
 August epochs.          Consequently the numbers recently observed can
 not properly be compared with those of former periods. Now, accord
 ing to the Catalogue of (luetelet, 244 meteoric showers were observed
 from the Christian era to 1833. These were distributed as follows: —

    A remarkable secular variation in the number of showers is ob
 vious from the foregoing Table.               During the five centuries from
  700 to 1200, 116 displays are recorded; while in the five succeed
 ing, from 1200 to 1700, the number is only 25. It will also be ob
 served that another period of abundance commenced with the eigh
 teenth century.         A catalogue of meteoric stonefallt indicates also a

 corresponding increase in the number of aerolites, which cannot be
 wholly accounted for by the increased number of observers.               Now
 there are two obvious methods by which these variations may be ex-
plained.      Either (1) the orbits of the meteoric rings which intersect
 the earth's path were so changed by perturbation towards the close
 of the twelfth century as to prevent the appulse of the meteoric
groups with the earth's atmosphere, or (2) the nebulous matter is very
unequally diffused through the sidereal spaces.          That the former has
not been the principal cause is rendered extremely probable by
the fact that the number of epochs of periodical showers was no
greater during the cycle of abundance than in that of paucity.             We
conclude, therefore, that during the interval from 700 to 1200 the
 solar system was passing through, or near, a meteoric cloud of very
 great extent, that from 1 200 to 1 700 it was traversing a region
 comparatively destitute of such matter, and that about the com
 mencement of the eighteenth century it again entered a similar ne
bula of unknown extent.
    The fact that the August meteors, which have been so often sub
sequently observed, were first noticed in 811 renders it probable that
the cluster was introduced into the planetary system not long pre
 viously to the year 800.        It may be also worthy of remark that the
elements of the comet of a.d. 770 are not very different from those
 of the August meteors and the third comet of 1862*.
    Adopting Struve's estimate of the sun's orbital velocity, we find
the diameter of the nebula traversed in 500 years to be fourteen
 times that of Neptune's orbit.
    It is remarkable that, with the exception of Mars, the perihelia of
 the orbits of all the principal planets fall in the same semicircle of
 longitude — a fact which can hardly be regarded as accidental. Now,
 if the orbits were originally circular, the motion of the solar system
 through a nebulous mass not of uniform density would have the ob
 vious effect of compelling the planets to deviate from their primitive
 orbits and move in ellipses of various eccentricities.          It is easy to
 perceive, moreover, that the original perihelion points of all the or
 bits would be on that side of the system which had passed through
 the rarer portion of the nebulous mass.           We have thus a possible
 cause of the eccentricity of the planetary orbits, as well as of the
observed distribution of their periheliat.
    4. The particles of a cometic mass, being at unequal distances
 from the sun, will tend to move at different rates and in somewhat
 different orbits.    This tendency will gradually overcome the feeble

                                             passage of 770 and that of 1862
 is equal to nine periods of 121-y6 years.    Oppolzer's determination of the
 period of 1862 III. is 121*5 years. Hind remarks that the elements of the
 comet of 770 arc
                    " ratlicr uncertain," but says " that the
                                                              general character
 of the orbit is decided."      It may be worthy of remnrk that a great me
 teoric shower, the exact date of which has not been preserved, occurred
in 770.

attractive force between the particles themselves.         The most distant
parts will thus become separated from the nucleus, and move in
independent orbits.         The motion of such meteoric matter will be in
the same plane with that of the parent comet — the orbit of the
former, however, being generally exterior to that of the latter.
The connexion recently discovered between comets and meteors,
and especially the fact that the period of the November group is
somewhat greater than that of the comet of 1 866, are in striking
harmony with the views here presented.
   5. Owing to this loss of matter, periodic comets mu3t become less
brilliant, other things being equal, at each successive return, a fact
observed in regard to the comets of Halley and Biela.
   6. The line of apsides of a large proportion of comets will be ap
proximately coincident with the solar orbit.            The point towards
which the sun is moving is in longitude about 260°.          The quadrants
bisected by this point and that directly opposite extend from 215°
to 305°, and from 35° to 1 25°.       The number of cometary perihelia
found in these quadrants up to July 1868 (periodic comets being
counted but once) was 159, or 62 per cent., in the other two qua
drants 98, or 38 per cent.
   This tendency of the perihelia to crowd together in two opposite
regions has been noticed by different writers.
   7. Comets whose positions before entering our system were very
remote from the solar orbit must have overtaken the sun in its pro
gressive motion ; hence their perihelia must fall for the most part
in the vicinity of the point towards which the sun is moving ; and
they must in general have very small perihelion distances. Now,
what are the observed facts in regard to the longitudes of the peri
helia of the comets which have approached within the least distance
of the sun's surface? But three have had a perihelion distance less
than O'Ol. All these, it will be seen by the following Table, have
their perihelia in close proximity to the point referred to : —

             ON A POSSIBLE CAUSE OF THE GULF-STUEAM.
                              BY KOBERT GILL,             ESQ.
    In every part of the equatorial oceans where the waters are free,
a current is observed to set from east to west, or against the diur
nal motion of the earth.             The waters of the Atlantic in proximity
to the equator are         thus      impelled with a certain velocity upon the
eastern coast of South America ; a portion of the equatorial current
 deviates towards the south, the remaining portion runs along the
 north-eastern coast of South America and enters into the Gulf of
 Mexico, whence it finally flows as the Gulf-stream.                        It appears,
therefore, that the Gulf-stream may be considered as a deriva
tion of the equatorial current, and that the latter may be a suffi
 cient cause of the former.                 The direction in which the Gulf-
 stream   flows    (from     south-west        to north-east) is accounted for by
 the fact that, in advancing towards the north, it brings with it the
velocity it possessed when further south, and consequently runs faster

                 Intelligence and Aliscellaneous Articles.            239
than the zones of diminishing radius it successively meets ; it thus
describes a sort of spiral, through the composition of its own velo.
city with that of the parallels over which it flows.      A similar devia
tion of the equatorial current towards the poles is also observed
upon the eastern coasts of Africa and of Asia ; so that in general we
may say that in the rotation of the globe the waters of the equato
rial regions tend to lag behind, and are in consequence deflected by
the eastern coasts and impelled towards the poles.        This flow of the
waters towards the poles gives rise to counter-currents which restore
them again to the equatorial zones.
    If the superficial temperature of the globe were everywhere uni
form, and if there were no friction between the waters and the earth,
nor between portions of water moving with different velocities, this
circulation, once begun, would last for ever, the globe would lose a
certain quantity of mechanical work through the effort of the equa
torial coasts, which would be communicated to the waters in the
 act of imparting to them the earth's velocity ; but, on the other
 hand, the waters, being impelled upon the western coasts moving
 with a less velocity as their distance from the equator increases,
 would communicate to those coasts its acquired impetus, thus resto
ring the work expended upon them by the eastern coasts towards the
 equator. A continual interchange of force would thus be taking
 place between the solid globe and the waters on its surface ; but in
 the supposed circumstances the compensation would be perfect, so
 that the general routine of the phenomena would remain constant.
     But friction does in reality act in the phenomena, and consequently
 the compensation cannot be complete ; the waters having lost
 through friction a part of the work which they contained, cannot
 restore entirely the force they absorbed in acquiring increased ve
 locity ; the equatorial current will therefore be retarded ; conse
 quently a greater expenditure of work will be required to impel it
 forwards, so that the motion of the whole system will gradually
 diminish, the force stored up in it being at length expended in fric
 tion. To maintain the motion of the currents and of the globe un
 impaired, it is necessary that some exterior source of work be con
stantly in action capable of compensating that power which is changed
 through friction into heat or other forms of energy.
     The temperature of the waters in the vicinity of the equator is
 always higher than that of the waters of the polar regions, for the
 reason that the sun's rays fall more copiously, surface for surface,
 towards the equator. The currents which flow towards the poles
 are therefore continually      cooled, and those which return to the
  equator  are  continually  heated  ; it follows that the waters flowing
 towards the poles gradually shrink in bulk, aud that those which are
 returning gradually expand. As was stated above, if the tempera
 ture were uniform over the whole surface, there would be a perfect
  balance between the power abstracted by the currents in the vicinity
 of the equator and that restored by them in moving towards the
 poles (always supposing there were no friction); but the local differ
 ences of temperature give rise to notable effects.      When the waters
  from the poles flow towards the equator, they not only slacken their

240             Intelligence and Miscellaneous   Articles.
apparent velocity because they pass over regions moving more
rapidly than themselves, but they undergo a further retardation and
from a different cause: in expanding they are raised, they recede
from the centre of the globe, and assume a greater radius ; and this
must evidently retard their angular velocity as the actual speed with
which they moved is transferred from a less to a greater circum
ference.    The expansion of the waters as they approach the equator
thus causes an increase of rapidity in the equatorial current, which,
as was said above, is caused by the slower relative speed of the
water as compared with that of the earth. If the temperature of the
waters flowingtowards the poles remained constant, they would restore
to the globe the stored-up energy acquired from the impulsion of the
equatorial coasts ; but as they approach the poles their temperature
gradually falls and they shrink in bulk.    This gives rise to a pheno
menon contrary to that which happens in the currents flowing
towards the equator : the water in shrinking approaches to the
centre of the globe, it therefore transfers its actual velocity from a
larger to a smaller circumference, and consequently its motion is
increased relatively to that of the earth. Hence the waters flowing
towards the poles tend to impart to the globe more mechanical work
than they abstracted from it at the equator, and consequently
to impel it forwards more than they retarded it.           The heating
of the equatorial regions thus tends to render the currents more
rapid, and, ns a consequence, to increase the earth's diurnal motion ;
and might be a means of compensating, in the manner described, the
losses from friction &c., and of maintaining the motion of the waters
and of the globe, which, as we have shown, would be gradually dissi
pated without a continual influx of mechanical work from without.
   The source of such mechanical work, tending to maintain the mo
tion of the waters and of the globe, is evidently the solar heat ; but
in what manner does it produce the dynamical effect ?                 .
   The water is expanded by the solar heat ; in the act of expanding
it recedes from the earth's centre, that is to say, it is raised ; and
this operation requires an equivalent expenditure of work, us it im
plies the lifting of a weight. The solar heat not only heats the
waters, but at the same time it imparts to them a certain quantity of
potential energy in consequence of having lifted them. A portion
of the solar heat is thus transformed into potential energy, which, as
the waters cool and shrink in flowing towards the poles, takes the form
of motion and communicates a greater velocity to the current, tending
to compensate the loss of motion and of power which the currents
and the globe are continually undergoing from the effects of friction.
    According to this idea a portion of the solar heat received by the
equatorial regions of the globe is converted into potential energy, in
expanding and consequently raising the waters flowing from the
poles towards the equator ; and this potential energy, assuming the
active form in the shrinking and consequent lowering of the waters
as they flow towards the poles, tends to restore to the currents the
motion lost through friction, and may be a means of supplying mo
tion to the globe, or of maintaining its velocity of rotation.

THEscribed           by    M. Guyot, in the year 1838. The following
is his account of         it,
                      as he saw    on the glacier of Gries, which
                                       it                                       I
translate from the work of M. Hubert —
    " saw under my feet the entire surface of the glacier covered
                                                     :

with furrows an inch or two wide cut        snowy ice, and separated
                                                    in
from one another           by
                       ridges of harder and more transparent ice.
It was evident that the mass of the glacier was here formed of these
two different kinds of ice the former (that of the furrows) was
                                   :
white and melted more rapidly; the other (that of the ridges)
was more perfect, crystallized, transparent, and hard.       The un
equal resistance to melting of these two kinds of ice was the
obvious cause of these depressions and elevations.       After having
followed them for several hundreds of metres      reached I  crevassea
20 or 30 feet wide, which, cutting the furrows at right angles,
exhibited down to the depth of 30 or 40 feet an admirable
transverse section of this structure.      As far as my eye could
reachI   saw the mass of the glacier composed of layers of the
 [opaque] white ice separated from one another                  by
                                                        layers of the
 transparent ice, the whole forming      mass as regularly stratified
                                                a
 as certain calcareous rocks."     This      the veined structure of
                                                    is

   The surfaces of the laminae of transparent ice, of which the
transverse sections are seen, as veins, on the sides of the crevasses,
are of a curved form, rudely resembling the hollow of the bowl
of a spoon* cut across at its widest part, whose edge is to be sup
posed in contact with the surface of the glacier.        If the lip be
supposed to be more and more compressed in front, it will show
the conoidal forms which the curved surfaces of transparent ice
affect higher and higher up the glacier ; and if it be sharpened
and elongated, it will show those towards which these curved
surfaces tend lower and lower down. Their forms have been well
represented by the late Principal James Forbes in a woodcut at
                   '
page 247 of his Occasional Papers on the Theory of Glaciers/
which, by permission of his publisherst, I have copied (Plate III.
fig. 6).   The outcrop of these conoidal lamina; is most clearly
seen in respect to those of them which are marked and distin
 guished from the rest by sand or dirt entangled in their edges,
the softer white ice between which has been melted away.
These are the (so-called) dirt-bands, first observed by the late
 Principal Forbes J. They display (though in a manner requi
ring some attention to discover) the exact course of the veined
structure where it intersects the surface of the glacier.       Fig. I
 represents   these  dirt-bands as  they appear    on the  Glacier  du
 Geant.    It  is copied (by  his  permission)   from   one  given by
Professor Tyndall in his paper "On the Veined Structure of
 Glaciers," in the Philosophical Transactions for 1859 (part i.
p. 305).
    At the terminal face or end of a glacier the frontal inclination
or inward dip of the spoon-like end of the surface of the blue
transparent ice is very small — at first only perhaps 5°, but rising
to 10°, 20°, up to 60° or 70°, if we follow the medial line of the
glacier, or axis parallel to its length.   The veined structure is
most energetically developed at the sides of the glacier; in the
central portions it is comparatively feeble.      " It is not to be
regarded as a partial phenomenon, or as affecting the constitu
tion of glaciers to a small extent only.       Vast masses of some
glaciers are thus  affected : by far the greater part of the Mer de
 Glace, and its tributaries, is composed of this laminated ice"§.

of the true glacier, modified according to its length and breadth."
Various explanations have been given of this characteristic
veined structure of glaciers.      It has been supposed that the strata
formed horizontally by successive falls of snow and intervening
thaws in the neve or half-frozen snow out of which glaciers form
themselves, are by the unequal motions of the different depths of
the glacier tilted up into vertical positions and then over, so as
to incline forwards, and that the plane surfaces of these plates so
tilted are moulded by the pressure of the ice into the hollow
conoids of the veined structure.        Mr. John Ball (than whom, in
Alpine questions, there       is no greater authority) advocates this
theory, called that of stratification.
    The late Principal James Forbes attributes the veined struc
ture to the same cause as the ripple in a stream of water, and
claims it in proof of the viscous theory of the descent of glaciers.
He formed " a viscous fluid of plaster of Paris mixed with glue
and ran it along an irregular channel or model valley which he had
constructed for the purpose. The relative velocities of the top and
bottom, and the sides and centre, of this pasty mass were shown
by alternating layers of two coloured pastes,            lie observed the
boundaries of the coloured pastes to be squeezed by their mutual
pressures into greatly elongated curves whose convexities were in
the direction of the motion ; and in a medial section the retar
dation of the bottom and the mutual actions of the posterior and
anterior parts shaped the bounding surface of the colours into a
spoon-Jike    form"*.
    Dr. Whewell seems to have thought that the retardation of the
 borders of a glacier would produce a tendency of the adjacent
 molecules to move towards its centre, and that the curved form
of the veined surface is due to this tendencyt.
    Professor Tyndall has propounded a theory of the veined struc
 ture which, to distinguish it from the viscous theory of Forbes,
he has named the " pressure theory."             He has illustrated it as
follows :  —
     " If a plastic substance, such as mud, flow down a sloping
 canal, the central portions will flow more quickly than the lateral
 ones, which are held back by friction.         Now the flow may be so
 regulated that a circle stamped upon the central portion of such
 a mud-stream shall move downwards without sensible distortion,
 thus proving that the central mud is neither compressed nor
 stretched longitudinally; for if the former, the circle would be
  squeezed to an ellipse with its major axis transverse to the axis
 of the stream ; and if the latter, it would be drawn out to an
 ellipse with its major axis parallel to the line of flow.      A similar

absence of longitudinal compression exists in many glaciers ; and
in such ice- streams there is no transverse central structure deve
loped.     But let a circle be stamped upon the mud-stream near
its side ; owing to the speedier flow of the centre, this circle must
be distorted to an ellipse, because the part of the circle furthest
from the side moves more quickly than the part nearest the
side.    Hence we shall have an ellipse formed with its major axis
iuclined downwards, indicating that the mud is compressed in
one direction and expanded in another.            An exactly similar state
of things occurs in many glaciers : the ice near the sides is sub
jected to a presure and tension like that here indicated ; and we
 have marginal crevasses as the result of tension, while the veined
structure        is,
                at all events, associated with the pressure"*.

246          Canon Moseley     on the "Veined Structure"
of the Mer de Glace at Les Ponts moves at the same rate as that
of the side of the Geant does near the Tacul ; E 1 0 10' 1 0 D, fig. 3,
will then represent the side of the ice at A, fig. 2, or rather along
the neighbouring line 112 3; D 10 being the top or surface-
line, and E 10 the bottom one.
    We can have no observations on the motion of the bottom ice
elsewhere than at the sides of the glacier.     Supposing, however,
that it bears elsewhere the same proportion to the surface-motion
as it does at the sides, it may be calculated that the mean annual
motion of the bottom ice at stations 12 and 13, where the sur
face-ice moves fastest, is 457 links.     In fig. 4 I have set off, on
the same scale as before, the depth G H of the glacier in links,
and from H the distances H 1, 12, 2 3, &c., each of 457 links,
to represent the mean annual motions of the bottom ice in suc
cessive years at the stations 12 and 13, and, from G, G 1, 1 2, 2 3,
 &c. to represent the corresponding motions of the top ice, and
from K corresponding distances to represent the motion of the
ice at 35 feet from the bottom.       The curved lines 1 1, 2 2, 3 3,
 &c. represent, therefore, on this figure, as the corresponding
lines did ou the preceding, the positions of the ice at the ends of
ten successive years which at the beginning of them was in GH;
 so that if a boring had been made at that time at station 12 and
filled with sand, then the sand would at the end of one year have
 been drawn out into the curve 1 1 (fig. 4), at the end of two
 years into the curve 2 2, &c., and at the end of ten years into
the curve 10 10.       And if a cut had been made across the gla
 cier in the line A B and filled with sand, or with water which
 had frozen into a plate of transparent ice, then at the end of the
first year that sand or that transparent ice would have arranged
itself into a conoidal surface, of which 1 1 represents a hori
 zontal section at the surface (fig. 2), and II 1 1 (fig. 4) represents
 a vertical section parallel to the axis of the glacier at station 12,
and E 11 a section at the side A, and so of succeeding years;
and at the end of ten years the plate of sand or of trans
parent ice, which at the beginning filled the vertical cut at
A B, would have been drawn out and attenuated into the
surface whose horizontal section at the top is 10 C 10 (fig. 2),
its vertical section at the point of fastest motion 10 10 (fig. 4),
and its section at the side 10 10 (fig. 3).
    It will be observed of these surfaces, that they are of that
spoon-shape which Principal Forbes has described as character
istic of the veined structure, that, as in that structure, their
frontal dip continually diminishes as they descend the glacier,
and that the surface indications of the structure are more ener
getically developed at the edges than in the centre.        If we con
ceive a point in the channel of a glacier where such a cut is from

                           of the Ice of Glaciers.                      247
 time to time made in it as it passes through that point, and if
 we conceive this cut to be constantly filled up with water which
 freezes to a plate of transparent blue ice inserted into the white
 opaque ice of the glacier, and, entering into the economy of its
 motion, is slowly drawn out and attenuated by the extension of
 the transverse plate into a conoidal surface of greater area from
 year to year, the extent of which attenuation may be estimated
 by a comparison of the lengths of the successive curved lines 1 1,
 2 2, 3 3, 4 4, &c. in the diagram (fig. 2) with the straight line A B
 forming the base of the diagram, then we shall,           Ithink, have
 conceived the formation of a structure identical with the veined
 structure.  I  do not think this filling of a cut with water the means
by which a plate of blue ice is actually inserted transversely into
 the mass of the glacier.     It may be effected by an extraordinary
 thrust to which the ice is somewhere subjected, by which the white
opaque ice is melted across a transverse section, and then, when re
 lieved of the thrust, frozen again into transparent ice, on Sir W.
 Thomson's principle ; or we may conceive a transverse fissure to
 be filled with ice-debris or snow, and this ice-debris or snow so in
troduced into the substance of the white opaque ice, by dint of the
 tearing asunder, thinning out, extension, and kneading which it
thus undergoes, to be converted into transparent ice*, whilst the
 mass in which it is imbedded retains its character of white ice.
    Professor Tyndall has shown that a process not unlike this
 takes place at an ice-fall.     The ice pushed over the edge of the
 fall opens, as the leaves of a thick book open when it is placed
 on its back.    These openings of the ice get filled with ice-debris,
 snow,   and sometimes mingled dirt, as wool or any other compres
 sible substance might be inserted between the leaves of the book.
As the ice reaches the bottom of the fall, the force, whatever it           is,
which presses    it  forwards closes these openings, shuts up the
book,    and the  inserted ice and snow, compressed into the sub
stance of the glacier, submits to its law of the differential motion,
and thins itself out and stretches and prolongs itself into the
conoidal laminae of the veined structure.
    Such an ice-fall  is represented in fig.    5,which    by
                                                            the permis
sion of Professor Tyndall    I  have copied from his paper " On the
Veined Structure," in part       i.of the Philosophical Transactions
for 1859, p. 286.
    Professor Tyndall thus describes      it,
                                            as seen   byhim on the ice-
fall of one of the branches of the lower glacier of Grindelwald —       :
    "The glacier, descending from its neve, reaches the summit of

 scends the fall as u succession of broken cliffy ridges with trans
 verse hollows between them.          In these latter the ice-debris and
 dirt collect, partially choking up the fissures formed in the first
instance. Carrying the eye downwards along the fall, we see, as
we approach the base, these sharp ridges toned down, and a little
below the base they dwindle into rounded protuberances which
 sweep in curves across the glacier.         At the centre of the fall
 there is not a trace of the true [veined] structure to be observed.
At the base of the fall it begins to appear —at first feebly, but
 soon becomes more pronounced, until finally, at a short distance
below the fall, the eye can follow the structural grooving right
across the surface of the glacier, while the mass underneath
 has become correspondingly laminated in the most beautiful
manner"*.
XXXIII.       On the Structure of the Human Ear, and on the Mode
    in which it administers to the Perception of Sound. By R. Moon,
    M.A., Honorary Fellow of Queen's         College, Cambridge.
                   [Continued  from vol. xxxviii. p. 376.]
 On the Functions     of the Membranous      Labyrinth and of   the Semi
                              circular Canals.
        my previous papers I have proceeded on the assumption
 IN     that, in those animals whose auditory apparatus includes a
cochlea, the perception of aerially conveyed sounds is occasioned
by the alternate ebb and flow of the liquor Cotunnii from the
cochlear aperture, along the scalae, to the vestibular aperture, and
vice versd ; and my efforts have been mainly directed to pointing
out the mode in which this alternate motion of the aural liquid
is mechanically effected.
    It is clear that this motion can in no degree be dependent
upon the action, or even upon the existence, of the membranous
labyrinth or of the semicircular canals. Whether it is capable of
affecting the nerves expanded within the former is a different
question, and one which will require consideration ; but up to
             I
this point have made no attempt towards explaining the func
tions, or accounting for the strange form exhibited by the mem
branous labyrinth.        To this part of the subject      I now propose
to address myself.
    Upwards of forty years have elapsed since the late M. Flourens
demonstrated in the most conclusive manner, by means of expe
riments performed upon living subjects, that the semicircular
canals in birds and in mammalia have functions totally uncon
nected with the sense of hearing.

      Labyrinth and Semicircular        Canak in   the Human Ear.        249
    The researches to which I refer are contained in two memoirs
read to the French Academy of Sciences in the year 1828, and
inserted in the Memoires of that body published in 1830 ; the
first of which memoirs relates to the case of birds, the second to
that of mammalia.         Of the first, a Report* was drawn up by the
illustrious Cuvier, to whom, with MM. Portal and Dumeril, the
memoir was referred, and in whose presence the various experi
ments were repeated.
    It results from M. Flourens's experiments, that in birds and
in mammalia the nerves of the semicircular canals, whatever
other functions they may possess, unquestionably exercise this,
viz. of regulating the motions of the head, and of the animal
 generally, of enabling it to preserve its equilibrium and to
 move steadily in a given direction.              No general description,
however,      can give an adequate    idea  of the remarkable phenomena
developed in these memoirs.
     I shall therefore in the first place describe in considerable
 detail the experiments and their results, which appear to have
 attracted very little attention from writers on aural anatomy t-
     I  shall next show how the effects described may be accounted

 for a branch of the subject upon which M. Flourens has not
 entered.
     I shall finally consider the question whether the functions
 thus shown to be possessed by the part of the animal economy
 under consideration are or not exercised concurrently with others
 of a totally different character — whether, in short, the semicir
 cular canals are to any, and what, extent operative in producing
 perception     of sound.
     I.  The   semicircular canals in birds, as in mammalia, are three
 in number, two vertical and one horizonal, of which the largest
 is vertical and superior.      " The smallest is situated
                                                                horizontally.
 The canalis minor, or third of the series, is vertical.           They con
 tain corresponding tubes of vascular membrane ; and they also
 possess enlarged ampullae, on which the nerves are distributed
 in the same manner as in mammalia." (Cyclopaedia of Anatomy
 and Physiology, vol. i. p. 308.)
     The superior vertical canal is described as directed from be-

    t I find no mention of them in the admirable and very complete resume'
 of the subject drawn up by Mr.Wharton Jones for the ' Cyclopaedia of Ana
 tomy and Physiology' eight years after the publication of Cuvier's Report ;
 and I do not find the omission repaired in any later treatise on the subject
 which has come under my notice.         Mr. Jones appears to have been ac

 250        Mr. R. Moon    on the   Functions of the Membranous
 hind forwards, while the inferior canal takes the opposite          di
 rection.
     All   the canals are enveloped in a thin bony coating (tunique
 osseuse mince).
     When the horizontal canal on the left side of a pigeon was
 cut, a slight movement of the head from right to left and from
 left to right exhibited itself.      This motion continued only for a
 short time, after which the animal recovered its usual demeanour
  (allure).   Its senses, its intelligence, and the equilibrium of its
 movements remained perfect.
     When the horizontal canal of the right side of the same bird
 was cut, the horizontal motion of the head suddenly reappeared,
 but with a rapidity and impetuosity such that the animal, entirely
 losing its equilibrium, fell, and for a long time rolled upon itself
 without being able to stand erect.
     The violent motion of the head ceased after a time, and so
 long as the animal continued in repose its head continued in re
 pose also; but the moment the animal moved, the motion of the
 head recommenced,, and that motion always became stronger
 in proportion to the rapidity with which the animal attempted
 to move itself.
     Thus, when standing still, the animal preserved its equilibrium ;
 it lost it when it tried to walk ; it lost it still more when it tried
 to walk. quickly ; it lost it entirely when it tried to fly.      The
 animal feared to move : it saw well ; it could still hear ; it pre
 served all its instincts and all its intelligence ; it ate and drank
 spontaneously,    though with great pain.
     M. Flourens observed this bird for      a whole year.  The wound
 in the head healed completely ; the bird became very fat ; but
 the motion of the head, the rolling upon itself, and the loss of
 equilibrium upon any sudden movement, however slight, always
 exhibited themselves.
     When the inferior vertical canal on the left side of another
 pigeon was cut, there immediately ensued a slight but rapid
 movement of the head from below upwards and vice versd ; but
 this only continued an instant. The animal, when left to itself,
could hold itself erect : it walked and flew regularly, except that
it experienced from time to time a sharp and sudden motion of
the head backwards, which for the moment disturbed its equili
brium and went sometimes almost to the point of throwing it
over on its back ; at the end of some moments, however, this
movement dissipated itself, or only reappeared after longer in
tervals.
    When the inferior vertical canal on the right side of the
same bird was cut, the vertical movement of the head reappeared
with a violence and impetuosity in all respects similar to those

     Labyrinth and Semicircular        Canals in the Human   Ear.       251
exhibited by the horizontal movement when the horizontal canal
on both sides was cut.        The movement up and down was almost
continual : sometimes the head bent a little from one side to the
other, as if to make a turn half round (comme pour faire un demi-
tour) ; but the dominant direction of the movement was always
from below upwards and vice versd.
   When the pigeon was stationary, its equilibrium was main
tained ; and the better to preserve       it,
                                            the animal rested its head
on the ground   ;   and      itwas always  the  top of the head bent
back (sommet de     la  tele renversie) which was so supported.
   The motion of the head always increased in activity along
with the other motions of the body, and, on the other hand, dis
ordered the latter to such an extent that all regular movement
was impossible.
   In this experiment, unlike what occurred in the former when
the two horizontal canals were cut, the animal could neither
walk nor fly.     When thrown into the air, after some incoherent
movements of its feet and wings, its whole frame stiffened, and
it fell like an inert mass.
   The animal never turned upon itself as when the hori
zontal canals were cut but often, in its own despite,
                             ;                               it fell over
backwards upon      its  tail, and  sometimes   rolled  fora  long time
in this direction.
   This pigeon was kept for nearly       ayear.      ate and drank vo
                                                     It
luntarily (de lui-minie), although      ithad infinite difficulty in go
verning its head for     a  moment so as to seize its food and drink.
It could never fly when tried to walk at all fast, fell and
                    ;             it                           it
rolled on its back.        Almost always       remained in the same
                                                it
place, the top of its head turned back resting on the ground or
against the bars of its cage.          The vertical movement of the
head was always maintained, and always with almost equal in
tensity.
   When the superior vertical canal on the left side of third       a
pigeon was cut, there immediately resulted        slight but rapid
                                                      a
movement     of the head from above   downwards,    and vice versd.
This movement was of short duration, but soon recurred.        Left
to itself, the animal walked steadily or held itself erect; though
liable from time to time to tumble forward.
    When the corresponding canal on the right side of the same
bird was cut, there instantly occurred    quick and violent move
                                                a
ment of the head from above downwards and vice versd.         This
movement was accompanied, as in the former case,               by
                                                          disturb
ance of equilibrium, which, in like manner, ceased when the
animal was in   a state of repose, and recurred with its motion,
increasing iu rapidity when the latter was accelerated.
    In all the experiments, when two corresponding canals were

  252      Mr. R. Moon on     the Functions of the Membranous
  cut, there resulted rolling of the eyeball and a convulsive motion
  of the eyelids.
     When the third pigeon was operated upon, it did not roll
  sideways as in the case of the first, or tumble backwards as did
  the second, but tumbled forwards.
     This bird was also preserved for a year.
     A fourth pigeon had all the canals cut in both ears. There
  resulted immediately an impetuous [fougueux) and confused
  luotion of the head in every direction — from above downwards,
  from below upwards, from right to left, and from left to right.
      " Ce mouvemcnt etait d'une violence inouie."         It so dis
  turbed the equilibrium of the animal that it could only obtain
  some moments of repose by resting its head on the ground.
     M. Flourens tried the effect of removing the osseous covering
  of the canals, leaving,  I presume, in each case the lining mem
  brane untouched, so as to prevent the lymph contained in the
  labyrinth from making its escape.         None of the effects before
  described occurred in this case ; but they exhibited themselves,
  though in a less degree, when the membranous labyrinth of the
 respective canals was pricked, the phenomena in each case being
 the same in character as when the corresponding part of the ap
 paratus was cut through — thus showing that the phenomena
 above described were owing entirely to the action upon the [so-
 called] acoustic nerve expanded upon the membranous canals.
     The same experiments were repeated upon other pigeons, upon
 pullets, sparrows, finches, yellow-hammers, linnets, tom-tits, &c.
 The results, though varying in intensity, were always identical
 in character.
     After adverting to the circumstance of the experiments having
 been repeated in the presence of M. Dumeril and himself, M.
 Cuvier gives his testimony concerning them in the following
 terms : —
     " La section de chaque caual a produit effectivement les mouve-
 mens bizarres qui sont annonces dans le memoire. Quelque sur-
 prenans, quelque inexplicables que sont ces faits, nous ne pou-
vons les revoquer en doute."
     The semicircular canals in mammals are enclosed in the pe
trous bone, the hardest and the most compact which their struc
ture exhibits.     In order that experiments similar to those prac
tised upon birds might be extended to mammals, it was neces
sary in part to remove this bone ; and on this account M. Flou
rens selected as the subject of his experiments young rabbits,
animals which possess from birth the faculty of locomotion, at
the same time that the bony envelope of their canals does not
attain at that early stage of their career its full hardness.
    For operating on the horizontal and posterior vertical canals,

     Labyrinth and Semicircular   Canals in the Human   Ear.    253
rabbits of two months old were selected.        In the case of the
anterior vertical canal, which presented greater difficulty, the age
had to be reduced to fifteen days.
    In the first two cases the results of the experiments, with
some unimportant variations, were the same in character as those
of the corresponding experiments upon birds.
    When one horizontal canal only was cut, th a head of the animal
in repose was always to the side of the section ; but when both
horizontal canals were cut, the head resumed its natural position.
In the latter case, not merely the head, but the fore legs, and,
indeed, the entire fore part of the animal, partook of the oscilla
tory movement from right to left and vice versd.
    It was found difficult to operate on the anterior vertical canal
without injuring the brain, by which the results of the experi
 ments were complicated with those flowing from the lesion of
the latter.    In the few cases in which thi3 cause of error was
avoided, the results of the experiments were precisely similar to
those of the corresponding experiments on birds.
    It is consolatory to think that the rabbits experimented upon
 did not seem to suffer the pain which was experienced by the
pigeons ; nevertheless M. Flourens does not appear to have
succeeded in keeping alive the former beyond a month in one case,
and a week in another.
    II. Assuming that experiments operated on the semicircular
 canals of the human ear resembling in character those performed
 by M. Flourens upon pigeons and upon rabbits would be at
 tended by like results, I now proceed to explain how the occur
 rence of such results may be accounted for.
    The membranous labyrinth, I conceive, must be regarded in
 the light of a delicate balance, which, being suspended in the
 perilymph contained in the vestibule and semicircular canals,
 upon each movement of the head chauges its position in the
 irregularly shaped bony cavity within which it is confined, and
 is thus enabled, in a manner presently to be described, to trans
 mit to the mind or subordinate directing principle such intelli
 gence respecting the motions of the head as may be necessary
 with a view to their regulation, variation, and maintenance.
     The membranous labyrinth is supported by nervous filaments,
 which, leaving the inner wall of the osseous labyrinth, after tra
 versing the perilymph, penetrate within as well the membra
 nous vestibule (sinus communis) as the ampullae, with one of
 which each canal is provided, and diffuse themselves over these
 parts of the membranous labyrinth to the exclusion of every
 other.
     The experiments of M. Flourens show that motion of the
head forwards is governed by the anterior vertical canals, mo

  254       Mr. R. Moon        on the Functions      of the Membranous
  tion backwards by the 'posterior vertical canals, while motions
  to the right and left are governed by the horizontal canals.
       I apprehend that these effects are produced through the ex
  clusive agency of the ampullae, each of which (in form, as in
  function, resembling the bubble of a spirit-level) by its position
  indicates the motion of the head in the direction to which it has
  reference.
       When the head moves, the membranous labyrinth will not
  implicitly follow its motion, but will lag somewhat behind, on
  account of the superior specific gravity of the endolymph as com
  pared with the perilymph.
      Thus, if the head move to the left, that end of the membra
  nous ampulla of the left horizontal canal which is nearest to the
  vestibule will be forced into the corresponding portion of the
  surrounding osseous ampulla, the hard bony substance of which,
  pressing on the flexible integument of the membranous am
  pulla near its flask-like termination, will constrict the latter so
  as to cause the liquid contained within it to move in the direc
 tion of its length.          Such a motion of the endolymph in the am
  pulla   will  necessarily excite the nerves expanded within it*; and
  we can thus see how the change in the position of the head will
 be at once signalled to the brain.
      The movement of the head (to the left) which we have been
 considering will produce in the right ear effects opposite to those
 which have just been described.                 In this case the end of the
  membranous ampulla of the right horizontal canal which is
furthest from the vestibule will be forced into the correspond
  ing portion of the surrounding bony ampulla.                     Consequently
  the end of the membranous               ampulla which is furthest from
  the vestibule will in this case become constricted, and the flow
  of the endolymph will take place in a direction (with respect
 to the vestibule) opposite to that which it took in the former.
      A  second contemporaneous signal may thus be expected to
 be transmitted,         which, although effected in a somewhat differ
ent manner, will have the same object as the signal from the left
ear which we have just been considering, viz. to indicate that an
 exertion of the muscles by which the head is bent to the right
will be necessary in order to restore the head to an erect position.
      Such   I  conceive to be the mode of operation, and the special
     *  " The  filaments form a fine network on the outside of the ampullae,
 and then piercing their parietes, are raised up within into a kind of eres-
 centic screen, in order probably that they may be more exposed to the
 impulse of the vibrations descending along the aqueous eudolympb of the
 semicircular tubes." — Penny Cyclopaedia, 1837, vol. ix. p. 238.              This
 description     applies  primarily to cartilaginous  fishes, but is given as illus
trative of what occurs in the case of the "superior animals, man in
cluded."

function, of the horizontal canals in the perfect organ when the
head is moved to the left.
    The application of the same principle of explanation to the
same canals when the head moves to the right, and to the ver
tical canals when the head moves backwards or forwards, is so
obvious that it need not now be dwelt upon.
    When the head is held erect, or probably when recumbent in
a horizontal position,   I  apprehend that each membranous am
pulla will occupy the centre of its osseous envelope, so that at
neither extremity of the former will pressure be exerted upou it
by the latter.
     If under these circumstances the horizontal membranous
canal of the left ear were cut,            I
                                     apprehend that the severed por
tions would overlap each other ; so that the extremity of the
membranous ampulla of the same caual which is furthest from
the vestibule would be forcibly driven into the corresponding
portion of the osseous ampulla.        If this view be correct, it will
be seen, by reference to the foregoing argument, that the same
signal will have been conveyed to the brain as if the head had
                                 warning will have been given to the

to the right, to bring themselves into action        whence we might
                                                             ;
expect that    a motion of the head to the left would ensue.         As
soon as this motion has been completed, however,              to be an
                                                                 it   is
ticipated that the sudden and perhaps violent motion of the
poor animal under the pain of the operation would make this
part of the membranous labyrinth oscillate          the contrary direc
                                                            in
tion, so as to drive the membranous ampulla of the same canal
into the opposite extremity of its osseous sac, and thus the signal
to move the head to the right would be given.
    In this way, think, may be accounted-for the alternate mo
                   I
tion of the head from right to left and from left to right which
is  stated to have resulted from cutting the left horizontal canal
of the pigeon.      We may see also how that further result of the
experiment might be anticipated which              related to have oc
                                                        is

                    that the pigeon would              by
                                                 degrees learn to dis
regard the anomalous indications of its left ear, and rely wholly
on those of the right ear alone, which preserved their normal
character.
    On the other hand, the cutting of both the horizontal canals
 would destroy all the means with which nature has provided
the animal for ascertaining and measuring the direction and ex
 tent of the motions to right and left of its head, and would thus
leave     in that state of incapacity to control those motions which
          it
is  described  by  M. Flourens.
    The effect of cutting the several vertical canals was, for the

256       Mr. R. Moon     on the  Functions of   the Membranous
most part, similar in kind to that of cutting the horizontal canals,
though more violent in degree ; and the explanation in all the
 different cases is in its main features the same.
    When the ears are perfect, the effect of throwing the head
 back, upon the principles already explained, would be to force
 the extremity nearest to the vestibule of each posterior vertical
 ampulla into the corresponding portion of the surrounding os
 seous ampulla, and thus would be given a signal upon which,
subject to the disposition of the controlling will, the muscles by
which the head is moved forwards would be called into play.
    On the other hand, when either of the last-named membra
nous canals is cut, on the principles above laid down, the effect
 would be to throw the end furthest from the vestibule of its
ampulla into the corresponding portion of the osseous envelope;
 so that in the latter case a signal would be given of a character
 opposite to that given in the former ; i. e. the tendency would be
to make the animal fall backwards.
    The mode in which, when both the posterior vertical canals
were cut, the animal showed a disposition to turn its head upside
 down so as to rest the top of it on the ground, may be accounted
for by supposing that in this way it placed in equilibrium the
membranous ampullae of the canals in question.
    The mode of explanation in the case of the anterior vertical
canals is obviously the same, mutatis mutandis, as in the case
last considered.
    If the views above set forth be correct, it is evident that we
may look upon the membranous labyrinth in the light of a seventh
sense*, by which intelligence of the amount and direction of
the motions of the head are communicated to the mind or sub
ordinate governing principle.        That there is a necessity for some
such special provision as regards the motion of the head is suf
ficiently obvious when we reflect that we cannot judge of the
position of the head with regard to surrounding objects in the
way in which we can judge of that of the hand, the foot, or
any part of our frame which can be contemplated by the eye.
It might have been anticipated that the muscular effort neces
sary to move the head in a given direction would have afforded
a sufficiently accurate measure of the effect produced by such
effort.    I think that M. Flourens's experiments prove conclu
sively that this is not so, and that a much more refined mode of
measurement and adjustment has been provided for us —one, in
fact, which takes cognizance of the effects actually produced, and
not merely of the efforts made to produce them.
    It will probably have been observed, however, that the mode
of adjustment, so far as hitherto explained, is in one respect de-

      Labyrinth and Semicircular    Canals in the Human      Ear.    257
 fective.    To indicate fully motion in space, regard must be had
to six directions, viz. right,' left, backwards, forwards, upwards,
 downwards.       Admitting that the membranous canals satisfy our
requirements as to the first four directions, how are those for the
 last two provided for ?
    Upon this point     I observe that the head cannot be moved up
or down without a corresponding motion of the whole or of a
large part of the body, for which a very considerable muscular
effort is necessary in order to counteract or control the effect of
gravity. It may very well be that such increased effort affords a
satisfactory measure of the motion up and down, although a
similar criterion as regards the horizontal motions would not be
 sufficiently exact.
    I  am inclined to think that it is at least one function of the
nervous filaments expanded within the membranous sac and
utricle to indicate the fact of motion generally, and that they
may aid in measuring the vertical movements of the head — their
operation in this respect being superseded, as regards the ho
rizontal motions, by the more delicate apparatus afforded by the
ampullae.      Any such action of the nerves of the sac and utricle
must, of course, be enhanced by the cretaceous otolithes attached
to them.
    My remarks on this branch of the subject I shall conclude by
pointing to the two following cases illustrative of it.
    Every one who has had opportunity to observe the development
of children in early infancy, must be aware that there is a time at
which, although the child is able to maintain its head erect for a
few moments, any attempt to change its position is followed by
a wild movement of the head, partaking of the character of that
described as taking place in M. Flourens's pigeons when all the
canals had been cut.
    The explanation of this circumstance    I take to be, that although
the child is able to keep its head erect, and has strength to move
the head in different directions, yet it has not so mastered the
indications afforded by means of the semicircular canals as to
enable it to regulate the motion.
    On the other hand, it is not uncommon to meet with persons
of middle age, and, still more, with those advanced in life, who are
subject to a nervous affection, under the influence of which,
although ordinarily they can command the motions of the head
like other persons, yet occasionally,    and for a brief interval, they
appear    to lose control over them,  tbe head moving involuntarily.
    In explication of this peculiarity, I give from M. Flourens's
second memoir his account of the demeanour of a rabbit, one of
whose canals had been cut : —

    Affections such as those last referred to               I
                                                      conceive to arise

     III.
        I   now propose to consider the question whether the func
tions above described exhaust the purposes of the membranous
labyrinth —in other words, whether the membranous labyrinth
actually forms part of the organ of hearing.
    That, in man and those animals which possess cochlea, all        a
aerially conveyed sounds are perceived through the agency of the
cochlea alone      think there cannot be the smallest doubt.
                      I                                             The
construction of the tympanal membrane, the bones of the ear,
and the two foramina opening from the tympanal cavity into the
labyrinth, abundantly prove that motion of the fluid in the cochlea
from the round aperture towards the oval aperture, and vice versa,
is  the special effect which aerially conveyed waves are calculated
to produce     and even
                 ;         the nervous filaments of the membranous
                                if
labyrinth hung loose in the perilymph which surrounds the latter,
I  cannot see that they would be in any way affected               such       by
motion of the fluid in the cochlea.     Still less can this be the case
in the actual position of the extremities of the nervous filaments
within the membranous labyrinth.
    But     itnot so clear that the nerves within the membranous
                 is
labyrinth are not affected           by
                                 undulations propagated through the
bone of the skull —as, for instance, when        musical box
                                                        a        placed   is
on   the top  of the head   or  rather
                                ;           not
                                              it
                                              isso clear whether these
nerves do not, under the circumstances supposed, aid in the pro
duction of that sensation which we attribute to sound.
 I    am strongly inclined to take the negative view of the ques
tion last stated, and to regard the cochlea on the one hand,
and the canals and membranous labyrinth on the other, as totally
independent organs which, for constructive and,            may be, for
                                                                     it
other purposes, are locally connected —just in the same way as
the ear and the nostril are connected, though the former          in no
degree ancillary   to the sense  of smell*.    This, no  doubt,     tan       is is
tamount to the assumption that animals destitute of             cochlea   a
are incapable of the perception of sound.        It to be observed,
                                                                is
however, that         not denied that when
                      it   is                   sounding body

cited, animals in its neighbourhood which are possessed of sac
and utricle only, or of those appendages and semicircular canals,

                                          a
nerves of the cochlea and those of the membranous labyrinth.          do not
                                                                          I
desire, however, to urge too far this consideration.

      Labyrinth and Semicircular        Canals in the Human         Ear.     259
receive a signal by which their conduct is regulated.                 All that is
contended for is that such creatures are destitute of any thing
corresponding to that affection of the mind which we designate
as the hearing of sound.
     Some writers, indeed, maintain that the sense of hearing is
merely a refinement of the sense of touch.               To this view of the
subject    I cannot subscribe.       A table may vibrate under the in
fluence of undulations which, when brought to bear upon the
ear by means of a rod resting on the table, will produce the sen
sation of hearing.        If, under the same circumstances, the table
be touched with the finger, the nerves of the finger will be excited
by the same vibrations ; nevertheless we do not hear through the
tips of our fingers.
     As regards the effect produced by sounding bodies upon the
nerves of the membranous labyrinth, whether in animals provided
with a cochlea or those destitute of that adjunct — as, for instance,
              I
in fishes — am quite disposed to admit that it may be merely a
refined example of the sense of touch* ; but the perceptions ex
cited in the human subject through the ear— and the same no
doubt must in a degree apply to all animals endowed with a
cochlea — appear as distinctly sui generis as are those derived
 through the eye, the nostril, or the palate.

     P.S. — The following account relating to the nervous apparatus
 of the ampullae strikingly illustrates their adaptation to the per
 formance of the delicate functions I have ascribed to them : —
      " Dans les ampoules, Max Schultzc a decouvert, s'elevant hors
 de la surface interne de cet Epithelium [that of the lining mem
 brane of the ampulla; through which the nerves penetrate], des
  crins elastiques roides tout-a-fait particuliers                Us sont beau-
  coup plus longs que les crins ciliaires         des cellules   de  mica,  ....

     * The fact of the antenna: of certain classes of Art iculata, through which
 they are endowed with an exquisite sense of touch, being connected with
 what have hitherto been regarded as the organs of hearing, is strongly
 confirmatory of this view.

     From the   same work    I take  this further extract    : — " La  théorie
des sensations auditives qui précède a été confirmée d'une manière
intéressante par les observations et les expériences de V. Hensen
sur les organes de l'ouïe chez les Crustacés.          Ces animaux ont de
petits sacs moitié fermés, moitié ouverts à l'exterieur, où les
otolithes nagent librement dans une humeur aqueuse, et qui sont
surmontés de petits crins rigides particuliers, reliés par leurs
extrémités aux otolithes, formant une série ordonnée par ordre
 de grandeur. . . . On trouve aussi, chez beaucoup de crabes, de
 petits crins tout-à-fait analogues sur les parties libres du corps,
 et qui doivent être considérés comme les organes de l'ouïe.
 Ce qui le prouvent pour les crins extérieurs c'est en partie l'ana
 logie de leur construction avec les crins des otolithes, en partie
 la circonstance qu'ils se relient aux nerfs de la même manière, et
 partent de la même souche que dans les otolithes.                Enfin Hen
 sen a trouvé que l'ouïe persistait après l'extirpation des sacs des
 otolithes dans le Mysis [the Opossum Shrimp], l'animal ne con
 servant que les crins extérieurs des antennes"*.
      Without questioning the action of sonorous undulations upon
 the organs referred to,      I  would suggest a doubt as to whether
 the sensations so produced can in any correct sense of the term
 be designated as sensations of hearing.
      Recurring to the subject of the human ear,           I   would remark
  that the aerial waves emanating from a sounding body must ne
  cessarily produce an oscillation to and fro of the head in a vertical
  plane passing through the source of sound.               Upon the princi
  ples  I have above endeavoured to unfold, it is conceivable that
  this oscillation, however minute, may produce such an effect
  on the nerves of the ampullae as in some degree to indicate the
 direction from which the sound proceeds — a view which many
  have entertained — although these nerves, as           I  conceive, do not
  in any way contribute to the sensation of hearing.

   Although for the latter reason the theory of tides contained
in the January Number must be pronounced to be erroneous,

   It will be supposed, as before, that the solid part of the earth
is  spherical, that      it wholly covered
                              is                        by
                                                  water, the depth of
which  is  uniform and small compared with the earth's radius,
and that the attracting body revolves about the earth in the
plane of the equator at its mean distance and with its mean an
gular velocity. In order to abstract from the earth's rotation,
an equal angular velocity will be supposed to be impressed on
the earth and the body in the opposite direction, so that the
earth will have no motion.       Centrifugal force will not be taken
into account, because the waters under the action of this force
alone would move as          they were solid, and consequently its
                               if

to, cannot be included         an investigation

udx + vdy + wdz       an exact differential.
                        is                      Also the only periodic
effect of centrifugal force     that which arises from the periodic
                                    is
motion of the water in latitude, and, under the circumstances
supposed,    isso inconsiderable in amount that, to avoid complexity,
it will be disregarded.      For the same reason the small effect of
the spheroidal form of the earth       left out of account.
                                             is                   evi   It   is
 dent, since the motion consists of small oscillations proper to                    a
fluid, that we may put (d<p) for udx + vdy + wdz.
    This being understood, let the earth's centre be the origin of
rectangular coordinates, and,        being the north latitude, and

total attraction of the solid and fluid portions towards the centre
at any point within the fluid at the distance r will be very nearly
G(   1   +   k          ), k being a certain constant depending on the ratio
of the density of the water to the earth's mean density.  If this
ratio be one-sixth, which is known to be about its actual value,

the numerical coefficients being expressed in feet.                 Hence it fol
lows that the tide consists of two parts — one of which is the
 same for all longitudes, and varies as the square of the cosine of
the latitude, and the other varies as the square of the cosine of
the distance of any position from the point to which the moon
is vertical.   So far as the form of the ocean-surface depends on
 the latter part, it is that of an oblate spheroid the axis of which
 always passes through the position of the moon, low water being
under the moon.
    Now, although this solution satisfies all the hydrodynamical
 equations as well as the given conditions of the problem, there is
 a circumstance to be taken into account which shows that it can
 not be the true solution. It will be seen that for a certain value
of b the denominator of the expression for C might become zero,
in which case this quantity and the vertical velocity would be
infinite. This inference is indicative of a breach of continuity
in the formula, to which there can be nothing corresponding
in the movement of the      fl*uid.     The value of     - which satisfies the
                                                         a

                 a—b=ax 0 002121 = 8-47                 miles.
Accordingly, if the depth of the ocean exceed 8£ miles, the maxi
mum height of the tide passes through an infinite value, the

                              of Oceanic Tides.                                      267
directions of the tidal motions are reversed, and the low water
under the moon is changed to high water.          But clearly these

to be of the same character as that given by the Astronomer
                                                                    '

(April 13, 1866), to which adverted in my former article in the
January Number.         He finds that under the moon it is low water
" unless the depth of the sea exceed 12 miles," the denominator
of the expression for the tidal elevation vanishing for this parti
cular depth.     The difference between 12 miles and 8£ miles
is probably to be accounted for by the circumstance that the
former depth applies to an " equatorial canal," whereas the other
was obtained without any such restriction.         To find that the
tidal elevation would be indefinitely great if the ocean had a
depth so small as 12 miles compared with the earth's radius,
is a fatal difficulty, indicating failure of the reasoning, and not
in any degree got over by saying that this depth " far exceeds
 any supposed real depth of the sea."
    When in consequence of the above-mentioned results           had             I
 almost despaired of being able to discover the right method of
 treating this problem, it occurred to me to adopt the process of
 reasoning  I now proceed to explain. On the principle announced
 in the former article, that any general integral of the equation
 (a) which can be obtained prior to the consideration of a given
case   of motion (such           integral V = ~j^r) b&sj to a particular
                            as the
solution applying to given circumstances of the motion, the same
kind of relation as that of the general integral to the particular
solution of a differential equation between two variables, it appears
that such particular solution, instead of satisfying the equation
(a), will satisfy a variation of this equation obtained by giving
indefinitely small increments to the coordinates.        The reason for
this assertion    is,
                    that the particular solution coincides with the
general integral at     agiven time only through an indefinitely small
space.    In fact, unless this principle be true,         seems hardly
                                                            it
possible  to  account   for  the   failure of the solution  above tried,
which satisfied the equation («) together with all the given
conditions.                             *
   For conducting the proposed course of reasoning             will nowit
be convenient to employ, in place of the equation (*), the equi
valent one obtained         by
                            transforming the rectangular coordinates

So far as the first and last terms of the second form of the equa
tion indicate, the surface, since c, is positive, is that of a prolate
spheroid, the axis of which is always directed to the place of the
attracting body.    The other term gives the amount of deviation
from this form.
   The first form of the equation shows that there is a constant
elevation of the waters, varying when the body is in the equator,
as the square of the cosine of latitude, and that the maximum
variation from this elevation, or difference between high and low
water at a place whose latitude is X, is
                                     -J-^l-^cos«X.
  This formula may be tested by applying it to the case in which
p=Q, that     the case of equilibrium of the waters, for which,
                          is,

whence        it      follows that in the          case      of equilibrium the difference
between the greatest and least values of                            r   is                     818   i8

verified when /*=0, but we have also c2=0.          Consequently
the expressions obtained for u, v, and w severally vanish, as
plainly should happen in the case of equilibrium.
 I    proceed now to calculate the numerical values of the coeffi
cients in the expressions for height of tide and the vertical and
horizontal velocities, the attracting body being supposed to be
the moon, and the depth of the ocean three miles.       From the

waters is 0*001552 ft., and the equation of the exterior surface                      is

 Consequently the velocities at the ocean-surface have the follow
 ing values : —

               m= +0-011126 sin 2X sin 2(0—
    What is chiefly noticeable in these results is the small amount
 of the change of elevation of the water at a given position. It is
 even less than that which resulted from my first attempt, which
 I thought to be conclusive against it. It now, however, appears
to me that this objection was not valid, and that the error of that
method consisted solely in not making use of the equation (a).
As this equation is taken into account in the present method,             I
can perceive no reason why the results should not be admissible.
The small tide is consistent with the values of the velocities v
and w, the latter in particular tending always to diffuse the ele
vation or depression of the waters over a larger area.            The mode
of action conceived of by Newton in Props. 36 and 37 of Book
III. is in accordance with this theory, especially if the ocean be
of very great depth, the amount of tide being greater as b is
less.
    If the foregoing reasoning be good, the large amounts of tide
observed on sea-shores must be produced by the obstacles which
continents and islands present to the free horizontal movement
of the waters, as well as by the contraction of the channel of
the tidal stream by the configuration of the coasts, and in no
¦mall degree, it may be, by the inequalities of the bottom of the
ocean.     This view appears to receive confirmation from facts
stated by Whewell in Series XIII. of his " Researches on the
        "                               viz. that " the tides of islands in

 Tahiti and the Sandwich Islands " (p. 6) ; and that " the tides
 over a great portion of the Pacific are so small that we may con
 sider the lunar tide as almost vanishing " (p. 18).      It is evident
 that the conditions supposed in the theory are likely to be more
 approximately fulfilled at the central portion of this large ocean
  than at any other part of the earth's surface.
     Further, it may be remarked that the principal term in the
 expression for r, which varies as cos4 \, is constant for a given
 latitude only because the moon was supposed to be in the equa
 tor. If the problem were treated more generally, and the moon's
 declination were taken into account, it may be presumed that
 there would be a corresponding term varying with the declina
 tion ; and as the variation would be continuous, and the term
 would represent the principal amount of tidal elevation, the
 effect might be exhibited as a sensible diurnal variation of the
 tide.    Whewell has, in fact, made mention, in the memoir above
 cited, of
             " a diurnal inequality following the changes of the
 moon's declination."
     At the end of my communication on this problem in the Ja
                    I
 nuary Number said (as it now appears, on insufficient grounds)
 that the solution it contained was " strictly based on the neces
 sary principles of hydrodynamics."      My object in both attempts
 has been to point out a course of reasoning by which this great
 desideratum in the theoretical treatment of tides might be at
 tained.    The present mathematical theory, by clearing up a dif
 ficulty relating to the logical method of applying the general
 equation (a), has, I think, materially contributed towards ac
 complishing this object.      The difficulty  I refer to consisted in
 obtaining impossible results by applying that equation in a
 manner accordant with received hydrodynamical principles.           As
 the proposed explanation of it introduces a new and important
 principle in the application of analysis to hydrodynamics,           I
 have thought it worth while to call attention to the reasoning
 employed by stating it here again as succinctly as possible.
     Since the general equation (a), or <I>= 0, is applicable to all
 parts of the fluid at all times, it would still be true if to given
 values of x, y, z, and t the small independent variations hx, By,
 Sz, and St were added.      That     we shall have <& 8<£, =
                                     is,                 +       0,  as
 well as <& = (), for the same values of x, y, z, and  /.    Hence we
have      new general equation 8<t,=0.      The general integral of
 <t, =0, aobtained independently of any particular case of motion,
must satisfy both 3,=0 and 8<I,=0.          But particular solution.

which applies to the circumstances of      a given case of motion     is
only required to satisfy 8<3?=0 because        it  coincides with the
general integral only through an indefinitely small space for an
indefinitely small time; and  ifit also satisfied the equation 4,=0,

it would not be distinguishable from             a particular form of the
general integral.
                    I
   There would, think, be no difficulty in extending the method
of solution adopted in this communication so as to take into
account the change of the moon's declination, and to include also
terms of the second order.          But I am not prepared to undertake
the labour of going through the details of the analytical and
numerical calculations which would be required.

 "KTATROBOROCALCITE                     in distinct Crystals.— Uke many
         other minerals of complex composition, natroborocalcite,
as  I have called it in former papers (Ulexite of Dana*, from the
name of its first analyst), has engaged the attention of many in
quirers, who have expressed different opinions as to the compo
sition of the species. In addition to the fourteen analyses given
by Dana, who furnishes a ratio from the results of Rammelsberg
and one from mine, others have been published, from which dis
cordant conclusions have been drawn.                 "With regard to Ram-
melsberg's formula, Dr. Lunget says
                                                    " it cannot be denied
that the percentage of boracic acid found falls much too short
of that required by his formula, and agrees better with that of
Kraut." This formula, attributed to Kraut, is really mine by
priority, as not overlooked by that gentleman ; but it received
his name from Dr. Lunge because of his endeavours to show
its general validity from many other analyses than minef.
When the circumstances under which the mineral occurs are re
viewed, the reason of the want of agreement among analysts is
manifest.     The most abundant supply is obtained from Southern
Peru, where, known as tiza, it is in the closest association with
nitrate of soda, Pickeringite, Glauberite,             salt, gypsum,  chlo

this region have been used for the greater number of known
analyses.     I have seen no mention of the mode of occurrence
in Western Africa; but salt is given as an ingredient there.
Nevada affords it in a salt-marsh — in layers alternating with salt,
and in balls in the salt.     In Nova Scotia we have it associated
occasionally with Glauber salt, calcite or Arragonite, and sele-
nite, but most frequently imbedded in gypsum in what have
hitherto been known as its only form, viz. nodules or rounded
 balls of closely packed fibres, which are capillary or acicular
crystals.    In the analysis made of the specimens first noticed
here   I found very little impurity, consisting of a small quantity
of sulphate of sodium and of magnesium and a trace of chlo
rine, which was readily removed by cold water, so that a pure
material was without difficulty obtained for examination ; and          I
was led to propose the formula which Dr. Kraut subsequently pre
ferred as expressing most satisfactorily, in view of all the pub
lished analyses, the composition of the mineral, and which, as
shown in a former part of these Contributions*, does not appear
to me to be set aside by his later results and those of Dr. Lunge,
— an opinion evidently shared with Dana, who has not, in the last
edition of his ' Mineralogy ' (loc. cit.), accepted the conclusions
of the last-named chemist.       It was with reference to the vary
ing formulas given from time to time that Mr. Walker, a late
observer of the conditions under which the
                                                    " so-called borate of
lime" is found in Peru, felt himself called upon in 1868 to se
lect seven specimens representing so many distinct deposits oc
curring in different basins, and to show, by analysis t, that they
were most dissimilar admixtures of various substances.                For
these he (doubtless with great self-restraint) would not attempt
to deduce a formula ; and in this forbearance he offered an ex
ample to those who, as he said,
                                    " seemed to delight in racking
their brains to construct a formula that will agree with their
particular analysis." It is obvious that the analyses given by
Dana are those of a definite substance, varying, however, in
purity, and that the Nova-Scotian specimen is the purest, with
one exception, of those mentioned as actually found ; so that
Mr. Walker's seven carefully selected muds really do not mili
tate against the existence of this well-marked and interesting
species.

tively, the largest known previous annual exportation*, I had
an excellent opportunity of examining varieties of the rock from
mauy quarries, and I became acquainted with additional locali
ties for its accessory minerals.        One place in Newport, about
six miles from Windsor,        furnished  specimens of natroborocalcite
of an entirely novel character.         Besides the compact hard no
dules formerly noticed t, in which structure was scarcely appa
rent to the naked eye, imbedded in solid gypsum, others, of
looser texture, were found in small cavities of the same rock
made up of tufts of needles pressed close together at the centre
and radiating out in divergent needles, while others were formed of
crystals separate almost to the common central point of attachment.
Larger cavities exhibited isolated delicate prismatic crystals half
an inch long or more ; these were perfectly colourless and trans
 parent, and appeared under the microscope to be four-sided
 (and possibly square) prisms.        The only associate was selenite,
 of which equally colourless and transparent crystals were not
 unfrequently observed overlying the borate in tufts, and also
 standing up among its isolated prisms.           The specimens of na
 troborocalcite now described are not nearly so frequently found
 as the well-known nodules ; the examination of many hundreds
 of tons of gypsum did not furnish by any means a large number
 of good ones ; and they do not appear to be present in any other
 rock than that from one particular locality in Newport. They
 have a remarkably close resemblance to some forms of " needle-
 stone" found in trap, and, when freshly exposed, they are very
  beautiful in contrast with the old form : they require careful
 handling for the preservation of their characteristic appearance.
     There are other interesting circumstances connected with re
  cent observations of this borate.       Apart from the crystals just
  mentioned,    there  is a close resemblance    in the forms met with
  at different localities, which are now known to be several within
  the area of a few square miles.
     In addition to the forms already mentioned, flattened masses
  are sometimes found, nearly an inch thick and three or four inches
  across, affording most brilliant surfaces when broken. Still flatter
  and much smaller masses, mere splashes, as it were, are occa
  sionally seen dotted over some two or three square feet of grey
  translucent selenite ; as this is seen covering with a thin layer
  whole sides of " stones

                                             gypsum, these surfaces are
  probably very considerable in the bed ; these splashes are so
  thickly strewn as scarcely to leave a square inch of selenite un
  covered.    The nodules present curious parallelisms in their

mode of occurrence with the borate and chloride of magnesium,
called boracite, found at Stassfurt. When they occur with the
salts of sodium before specified, they exhibit the position of an
insoluble borate associated with soluble salts occupied by bora-
cite in carnallite and other chlorides at Stassfurt.           The distri
bution of the nodules of Ulexite in gypsum in this vicinity is
described exactly in the words used* with reference to the mag-
nesian borate, viz.,
                         " the nodules of boracite have the appearance
of having been shot at random from a park of artillery ; so irre
gularly are they scattered and so firmly are they imbedded."
Further, the latter is also found in beds of anhydrite and gyp
sum ; and though Ulexite has not been met with here in anhy
         I
drite, have seen it in a very thin vein of gypsum in that rock.
It is important to remember in this connexion that boracite is
anhydrous, while Ulexite is largely hydrated.

have also added to the mineralogical history of this species,
Howlite of Danat. A pupil of mine, Mr. Keating, brought me
last May a nodule made up of pearly scales, which proved to be
the mineral in question.          I  subsequently obtained several spe
cimens myself, and have quite recently had others, some being
larger than any previously seen by me, and the largest weighing
about two ounces, sent me from the same place.              I  had already
on one occasion noticed, as mentioned in my original descrip
tion of the species j, a single nodule of similar characters from a
locality in Newport, the usual forms (found elsewhere) having
been at the same time described as dull and amorphous.                Those
lately    met   with  were   from   Winkworth,     about two    miles from
Windsor ; they were imbedded in gypsum, which also contained
Ulexite, most frequently alone, but sometimes underlying How-
lite ; the nodules were of irregular form, well rounded, and,
when removed, left a smooth cavity in the rock; they were
seamed with gypsum and selenite in some instances, like the
amorphous nodules originally found : none of these were met
with in the Winkworth gypsum.               The pearly scales were per
fectly transparent     under   the  microscope, and consisted apparently
of plates breaking with oblique cleavage-planes.              In one form
or other Howlite has now been met with, always in gypsum or
anhydrite, at four localities lying from two to thirty miles apart,
and reported from two others, all in Hants county.

 the original surface, and from 2 to 5 feet below a level which
 had been a surface for two or three years and is now covered
 with dirt, a road was made through solid gypsum ; and on
 both sides of this- road was observed a crust covering a consider
 able area of the rock. When first exposed it was transparent, and
 it became opaque and powdery on exposure to the dry air ; there
"were also observed here and there tufts of small prismatic crys
 tals.   The crust consisted essentially of Glauber salt ; an ana
 lysis of some transparent portions, left a night only in the labo
 ratory, gave—

 Pure Glauber salt contains 56 per cent. of water ; the impurity
 noticed consisted of sulphate of lime and magnesia and perhaps
 chloride of sodium, as a trace of chlorine was found in some of
 the crust.    The tufts of needles were sulphate of magnesia.         It
 is a most interesting fact that the crust contained a minute
quantity of boracic acid ; several trials with turmeric paper in
the regular way brought out a distinct reaction, not on a single
dipping and drying, but on repeating this process once or more.
With regard to magnesia,         I  have found it a pretty constant in
gredient in our gypsum, sometimes to a notable amount ; I have
also proved the existence of probably a considerable percentage
in limestone in contact with gypsum at one place.
    The Borates as Fluxes in Welding. — As was to be expected
from the fusibility of Ulexite and Howlite, they have both been
found most perfect substitutes for borax in welding. The joint
of a piece of hard cast steel welded with a specimen of Howlite
proved perfect when the edges were beaten with a sledge-ham
 mer ; and both steel and iron have been welded with Ulexite.
    Variable loss of Water by Forms of Crystallised Gypsum on
Heating. — In the course of researches on gypsum           I have become
acquainted with some curious facts respecting the loss of water
on heating its varieties.      I  found that when a specimen of fibrous
gypsum     and  one   of tabular   selenite were heated side by side in
an air-bath, the latter began to lose water at 190° F. ; in about
thirty minutes it had lost 0*94 per cent. ; as the temperature
rose, during three hours, continued loss ensued, till it amounted
to 6*39 per cent. at 209° V., while the fibrous gypsum remained

unchanged in weight.           At 212° F. tabular selenite lost in about
an hour 2*41 per       cent.  ; fibrous gypsum      lost nothing the first
half hour, and only 0-55 per cent. during about an hour. On
continued heating at this temperature loss increased rapidly iu
both cases and became pretty uniform ; at least the tabular lost
in about six hours 14*1 per cent., while the fibrous lost from
12 to 15 per cent. in different specimens.               On heating at a
higher temperature, the total loss was 20* 77 by the tabular and
20*82 by one specimen of fibrous gypsum, both numbers which
agree with 20*88, the percentage of water in pure gypsum.
    Regaining of Water by Dried Gypsum. — Tabular gypsum
which had lost 20*77 per cent. water regained in about two
days, when left in a room, 5*47 per cent. of its weight ; fibrous,
which had lost 20*71 per cent., regained in about thirty-six
hours only 002 per cent.; fibrous which had lost 20*21 per
cent. regained in two days 3*97 per cent. ; and exposure for
three hours at an open window on a damp October day gave
 scarcely any perceptible increase in either of these two cases.
 Fibrous gypsum which had lost 5*37 per cent. at 212° F. re
gained only *07 per cent. of its weight during exposure for some
days in a room, and for three hours of the time to the damp
open air.       Hence it appears that tabular selenite both loses
 water more readily than fibrous gypsum,                and regains more
quickly that which has been expelled by moderate heat. "What
light these and other results, obtained by experiments of an allied
nature, may throw on the mutual relations of gypsum and an
hydrite, and the supposed derivation of the former from the
latter, before touched upon*, remains to be seen.

       the Philosophical Magazine'for Novemberl835 the late Prin
 IN cipal Forbes       gave an account of the experiments by which he
 demonstrated the polarization of non-luminous heat. He first ope
 rated with tourmalines, and afterwards, by a happy inspiration,
 devised piles of mica plates, which from their greater power of
 transmission enabled him more readily and conclusively to esta
 blish the fact of polarization.        The subject was subsequently fol
 lowed up by Melloni and other philosophers.              With great saga
 city  Melloni     turned  to   account   his own   discovery, that the ob-

scurc rays of luminous sources were in part transmitted by black
glass. Intercepting by a plate of this glass the light emitted by his
oil lamp and operating upon the transmitted heat, he obtained
effects exceeding in magnitude any that could be obtained by
means of the radiation from obscure sources.           The possession
of a more perfect ray-filter and a more powerful source of heat
enables us now to obtain, on a greatly augmented scale, the
effects obtained by Forbes and Melloni.
    Two large Nicol's prisms, such as those employed in my experi
ments on the polarization of light by nebulous matter, were placed
in front of an electric lamp, and so supported that either of them
could be turned round its horizontal axis.         The beam from the
lamp, rendered slightly convergent by the camera-lens, was sent
through both prisms. But between them was placed a cell con
taining iodine dissolved in bisulphide of carbon in quantity suf
ficient to quench the strongest solar light.        Behind the prisms
was placed a thermo-electric pile, furnished with two conical
reflectors.    The hinder face of the pile received heat from a
platinum spiral through which passed an electric current regu
lated by a rheostat.
    The apparatus was so arranged that, when the principal sec
tions of the Nicols were crossed, the needle of the galvanometc
 connected with the pile showed a deflection of 90° in favour of
 the posterior source of heat. One of the prisms was then turned
 so as to render the principal sections parallel. The needle imme
 diately descended to zero, and passed on to 90° at the other
 side of it.   Reversing, or continuing the motion, so as to render
 the principal sections again perpendicular to each other, the ca
 lorific sheaf was intercepted, the needle descended to zero and
 went up to its first position.
     So copious indeed is the flow of polarized heat that a prompt
 rotation of the Nicol would cause the needle to spin several
 times round over its graduated dial.
     These experiments were made with the delicate galvanometer
 employed in my researches upon radiant heat.           But the action
 is so strong as to cause a coarse lecture-room          galvanometer,
 with needles 6 inches long and paper indexes a square inch
 each in area, to move through an arc of nearly 180°.
     Reflection, refraction, dispersion, polarization (plane and cir
 cular), double refraction, the formation of invisible images both
 by mirrors and lenses, may all be strikingly illustrated by the
  employment of the iodine filter and the electric light.
     Take, for example, the following experiments : —The Nicols
 being crossed, the needle of the galvanometer pointed to 78°
  in favour of the heated platinum spiral behind the pile. A
  plate of mica was then placed across the dark beam with its prin

cipal section inclined at an angle of 45° to those of the Nicols.
The needle instantly fell to zero, and went up to 90° on the other
side.
   And, for circular polarization : — The Nicols being crossed and
the needle pointing to 80° in favour of the platinum spiral, a
plate of rock-crystal cut perpendicular to the axis was placed
across the dark beam.     The needle fell to zero, and went to 90°
on the other side.
   The penetrative power of the heat here employed may be in
ferred from the fact that it traversed about 12 inches of Iceland
spar, and about 1£ inch of the cell containing the solution of
iodine.

   The first notion of power     a  arrived at in arithmetic as the

                                                 is
whatever extensions are afterwards given to the word power.
   The first of these extensions results from the larger meaning

   The next extension of the meaning of the word power, which
it is necessary for our present purpose to consider, is that by
which fractional indices are explained. According to the defini
tion adopted for this purpose, every power may be considered as
having for its index a numerical ratio as a?1 ; and such a power is
defined as being that ratio multiplication by which q times is
equivalent to multiplication p times by x, the need for a separate
definition of the word root being thereby dispensed with.
   It is on account of this extension that an inconsistency first
arises   in the theory of exponents.                      Theoretically x'i should be
                                       Sp                                                  p
an exact equivalent for x11; whereas                      if   q be an odd number, x*
has but one sign, whereas a1* is ambiguous ; so that                           it might be
                                                                                           a
that the true answer to a question might appear in the form                            a?3",
                              p
whereas the form xi would be incorrect. Such an inconvenience
can only be guarded against by a consideration of each particular
case, contrary to the principle which should be arrived at in ma
thematical processes generally.
   The next step is to give a meaning to the expression x" when
the index n is any ratio whatever, commensurable or incommen
surable.    This gives rise to the conception of the exponential
function, of which, however, there may be several definitions.
One definition       that
                        is,   x" where n
                                       by    any ratio we mean the
                                                               is
function which satisfies certain functional equations, as that
<f)(x,    x<f,(x, m)=<f,(x, m
         n)                        &c.    The other
                                            +   n)       that    x"      is,          by
where n      incommensurable,
              is                 we mean the limit of xm where m
is   a commensurable ratio, when m approaches to equality with n.
The former or functional definition      the one we shall adopt. In
                                                          is
either case we are compelled, for the sake of writing, to consider
all powers as having ambiguous signs, so that xl=+x. This
is  not always made apparent      but that  ; really   the case may
                                                                it     is

(— 1)* and + 1)* are both of them +1. As, however,
                   (                                        would                it
be inconvenient entirely to dispense with the ordinary algebraical
definition of power on account of its connexion with the process
                    a
of multiplication, we have to use two different definitions of
powers at the same time, one of which includes the other.'      To

XXXVIII.            On the Action       of the Alkali-metals on        the      Ethers   of
      theFatty Acids.               By J. Alfred Wanklyn,             Corresponding
      Member of the Royal Bavarian Academy*.
                  with which Frankland and Duppa close their
                 remark
THErecent     communication to the.Royal Society t induces me to
place on record the following statement.
   In Lowig's Organischen Chemie, which is now an old book,
there are several accounts of his and Weidmann's work on the
action of potassium and sodium on different ethers of the fatty
acids, and also on benzoic ether, — the papers from which these
accounts arc taken having been published in and about the
year 1840.
   The general drift of this work was that the alkali-metals form
compounds from which alcohol is liberated by the action of water
(i. e. ethylates), and complex salts of new acids derived from the
fatty acid        by
                  process of reduction.
                       a                      In particular the action of
potassium on acetic ether         was    investigated,   and the result
arrived at that there       no disengagement
                                  is             of permanent gas, but
that ethylate of potassium and the potash salt of               complex    a
organic acid      reduced acetic acid)

                                              produced.
   In this state the subject remained until comparatively recently,
when      was investigated
            it                         by
                                Geuther, Greiner, Frankland, Duppa,
and myself.          would not, however, be right to pass over
                        It                                                               a
note, which        to be found under Acetic Ether in the English
                       is
translation   of Gmelin   (vol. viii. p. 499), wherein the very happy
suggestion       made that the reaction probably consists in the
                   is
formation of ethylate         potassium and acetylide
                                    of                                of

"With this solitary exception, no attempt either at explanation
or at further investigation          recorded until the appearance of
                                            is
Geuther's paper in 1864.
   Geuther investigated the                 salt of the complex organic acid, and
deduced the formula C6 H9                   NaO3 from his analyses, and prepared
the hydrogen, ethyle, and                    methyle derivatives of it.   He ex

gagement of hydrogen took place daring his experiment.
   Frankland and Duppa confirmed Geuther's formula by pre
paring the ethyle derivative of the soda-salt, and asserted most
explicitly the evolution of hydrogen. A marked feature of their
investigation is the great prominence given to products of secon
dary action, and the mistaking of them for the primary products.
   It was next pointed out by me that the formula C6 H9 NaO3
is equal to three atoms of acetyle and one atom of sodium.     It
was further shown by me that, during action of alkali-metals
on acetic ether, one quarter of the metal enters into a new form
of combination, and three quarters form ethylate of the metal.
 (This was shown both for potassium and for sodium.)       It was
also shown that, when proper care is taken to employ pure acetic
ether and not to allow secondary products to be produced, there          is,
as Lbwig had found in 1840, no disengagement of permanent gas.
   These experimental data warrant, and are expressed by, this
equation,

    Although my demonstration of the non-evolution of hydrogen
was published so long ago as the summer of 1868, and although
I  read the paper to Dr. Frankland, who was President of the
Chemical Section of the British Association at the time, still no
step was taken     by Frankland and Duppa until February 1870,
when the communication which occasioned the writing of this
notice was made to the Royal Society.
    From this communication    I  gather that Frankland and Duppa
are not prepared to withdraw the account which they have pub-,
lished of the course of the action of sodium on acetic ether, and
that they still maintain that changes do take place in which free
hydrogen    isdirectly evolved.   Their original account, published
in 1866, in which they wrote        number of equations, each one
                                     a
expressing   an  evolution  of an  equivalent of free hydrogen for
every equivalent   of sodium   consumed,        is,
                                              however, so far modi
fied that they now appear to admit the occurrence of an accom
panying reaction not involving free hydrogen. So far as          am  I
able to understand their recent paper, they appear to say that at
high pressures one kind of reaction takes place between sodium
and acetic ether, and at low pressures another kind of action
takes place.    According to them, my reaction occurs at high
pressures   and theirs at low pressures.
    However,  none   of my experiments were conducted at high
pressures  ; some of them were at the ordinary atmospheric pres
sure;   andI  am at loss to comprehend how such an explanation
                    a

288     The Rev.   J.   M. Heath on    the    Variation of Temperature
can have been attempted.      Moreover, the question whether or
not hydrogen is a product of the action of sodium on acetic
ether is a plain question of fact; and I will content myself with
the simple statement, based on my experiments, that neither
acetic ether nor any analogous ether evolves hydrogen by action
on metallic sodium, and that every trace of that gas obtained by
Frankland and Duppa was derived from alcohol and not from
acetic ether.   Sodium is now cheap, so is acetic ether ; let those
who desire other information make the experiment for themselves.
XXXIX.   On the Circumstances which determine the Variation of
  Temperature in a Perfect Gas during Expansion and Condensa-
  tion. By the Rev. J. M. Heath *.
          constancy of the total energy (potential energy + actual)
THEof a given      weight of gas during any changes in its condi
tion caused by the internal forces by which its particles act
upon one another, depends upon two conditions — that the in
ternal forces or energies do all the internal work that is done,
and that they do no otlier.      When these conditions do not
     —
hold that is to say, when either external forces do any part of
the internal work that is done, or when any part of the internal
forces (potential energy) is spent upon work external to the
system — then the total energy of the gas will be altered — by
augmentation in the one case, by diminution in the other. When
the denomination of the forces (external or internal) is the same
as that of the work they do, the total energy of the same name
is unaltered by their action.    When the /orce is of a different
name from the work it does, the total energies of both names
are altered, but in opposite ways.
   The internal forces of a gas consist of pairs of equal and
opposite forces, by which each of two particles acts upon and is
acted upon by the other.      And as the external surface of the
gas would consist of particles acted upon by the interior particles
but not reacting upon them in return, the reaction of the vessel
which bounds this surface in every part is necessarily included
in the calculation of the sum of all the internal forces acting
among the particles of the gas.
^ A gas, then,    confined in a vessel and reacted upon at the
surface of the vessel by a pressure equal and opposite to its
own pressure upon the vessel, is to be taken as acted upon by
internal forces and no other.
  If,  now, internal work    done in this gas subject to the condi
                              is
tion last mentioned, that the reaction of the containing vessel

 shall remain always strictly equal to the pressure of the elasti
 city of the gas, no external force will be introduced, and no ex
 ternal work will be done; and consequently the total energy
 of this gas will remain unaltered.              These conditions will be
 fulfilled if the gas is contained in a cylinder, of which it may
 occupy the height v, and compressed by a weight P placed
 upon the (weightless) piston, which is supported at the height
 v by the upward pressure of the gas, p = V.                So long asp and
 P are always equal, it does not matter whether they remain con
 stant, or whether they alter in any manner whatever.                Let P be
 a vessel of water allowed to run off gradually, so as to become
 less and less, or allowed to be filled up gradually by water flow
 ing into      it,
                so as to become greater and greater.            Any infinite-
 simally small variation of            either way will necessarily be in

 nishes, the gas will expand, and             will diminish also and so,

neous difference between            and p.  P  There will be      swelling or

a   contraction of the gas; but while              remains as nothing but
                                                         P
the equal and opposite reaction to p, no external force will be
 in action throughout the gas.           Moreover the work done            the          is
                         —
 swelling of the gas strictly internal work, the enlargement of
 the distance of the particles from one another.             It must be con
cluded that in this experiment internal forces alone have done
all the internal work, and, therefore, that there has been no va
riation of total energy.         The total energy          known to vary as
                                                                   is

                     it      that  the  piston    has  risen  with    uniform   a

that whenever weight  a          made to move upwards with
                                       is                             uniform   a

done at the expense of the heat or potential energy of the gas.
    Let us now pass to another form of the experiment, and in
stead of the gradual influx or efflux of water, suppose                 to be
                                                                                It P

pletion of the change in the gas's density, hy which a new posi
tion of equilibrium will be obtained — during this time we shall
have the gas acted upon by an external force +7r; or, to keep
to the language of the first part of this article, we shall have an
external force doing internal work and increasing total energy
if 7r is positive; and if ir is negative, we shall have a part of our
internal force, or potential energy, consumed in doing external
work, generating vis viva in outside particles, and therefore a loss
in total energy.     Temperature is raised within the gas in the
first place, it is lowered in the second.       It is to be observed
that it (that is, +(P— p)     and  not  +P)  is the  measure, accord
ing to my estimate, of the force which, by a given compression,
will develope a given quantity of heat. In neither of these cases
is the motion of the piston uniform ; and we shall conclude that
when a weight is raised or lowered, by changes in the density or
temperature of a gas, by a motion other than uniform, the forces
are not of the same name with their effects, and the total energy
or the temperature of the gas is altered. But another thing must
also be remarked which appears to follow from this, and which,
if true, is subversive of a great deal in the modern speculations
upon this subject which has hitherto been hardly called in ques
tion. It is this: the alteration of temperature caused by the
action of forces of different name from their works must be of
very short duration ; and the whole effect, whether of heating
or cooling, is neutralized as soon as the piston attains a second
position of equilibrium.     A good instance of this is given in Mr.
Joule's experiments on the cooling of gas by explosion.            In
those experiments, as soon as the communication was opened
between the full and the empty vessels, the full vessel was an
example of the internal forces of the gas doing external work.
The gas was necessarily cooled in consequence.          The empty
vessel was a case, as soon as there was any gas in       it,
                                                         of external
force doing work within that gas, which was therefore warmed.
But as soon as the density had become uniform throughout,
which  it  does in an exceedingly short time, there was found to be
no loss or gain of heat.

          in their Relations    to Composition and   Luminosity.   291
   In fact, our studies of the subject have led us in the di
rection   of the general conclusion that, all other conditions
being equal, the temperature in a given flame is the main factor
of luminosity.    This, however, may as yet be regarded merely
as an hypothesis, in consequence of the imperfection of our pre
sent means of actual experimental demonstration of the tempe
rature of flames ; it ia an hypothesis, nevertheless, which is in
general accordance with known facts.         By the spectroscope, for
example,   which  can  recognize only    luminous   rays, we find that
the higher the temperature    the  greater the number    of these lumi
nous rays.    The recent results of Frankland upon the develop-
                                      pressure in flames which are
non-luminous under atmospheric pressure, are in accordance
with this view, increase' of temperature necessarily following in
crease of pressure.
   Very vague views have been rife, even among chemists, with
regard to the temperatures of luminiferous flames. Somehave been
satisfied with believing crude hypotheses, such as that the heat-
power of a flame is always proportional to the density of the gas
or vapour undergoing combustion, or that it is proportional to
the amount of oxygen consumed by a given volume of the gas,
and so on.    This latter hypothesis has been one of very common
acceptation.    A view which is even now entertained by some
skilful chemists (than which, however, nothing, as will be shown
below, could be more fallacious)         is,
                                        that those individual gaseous
compounds     which  impart  the  highest  luminosity under ordinary
conditions,  are also the  most  productive of heat.
   The admirable researches of the great gas-chemist, Bunsen,
of Heidelberg, placed in our possession some years ago the
means of computing, at least with approximate accuracy, the
heat of flames of gases of known composition.           Few, however,
have properly and successfully applied Bunsen's methods in
practice.    We consider      quite time that these methods should
                               it
be introduced to the knowledge of gas-engineers in forms avail
able to them.
   Bunsen's formulae for these computations are based upon the
actual experimental determinations of the total amounts of heat
developed     bythe combustion of different pure combustible gases
with pure oxygen made               by
                                 Favre and Silbermann, and upon
Regnault's   determinations   of the specific heats of gaseous pro
ducts of combustion.
   It not to be maintained that Favre and Silbermann's num
      is
bers are strictly correct but they are doubtless approximate, and
                          ;
at least proportionally correct among themselves        at any rate
                                                          ;
they are the best data we have.      Those employed here are in
cluded in the following Table.       They are usually given in the

    The meaning of this Table is simply that equal weights of
 water would be heated by the several gases to temperatures pro
 portional to the numbers in the first column when equal weights
 of the gases are burned, and proportional to those in the second
 column when equal volumes are burned.
    A cursory glance at the figures in the second column of this
 Table might seem to justify the notion hitherto entertained by
 many, of the comparatively low calorific powers of hydrogen and
 carbonic oxide ; and it was doubtless as a consequence of such a
 comparison as this that statements have been put forth and
 widely accepted among American gas-engineers to the effect that
 the weight of water heated from the freezing- to the boiling-
 point by one cubic foot of the four main components of illumi
nating gas, respectively, is as follows : —
            Hydrogen
                              ....             2-22 lbs. water.

            Olefiant gas                     10*74!       „
the figures here being obviously about in the same ratio as those
in the second column of Table I. Several most grave errors,
however, are here involved.       To get at the true relative calorific
effects of the above gases when burned in the open air in heating
water below its boiling-point, deductions must be made, not only
for the specific heats of the products of combustion of the gas, but
also, more important still, for the specific heat of the nitrogen of
the air required to burn the gas.        In fact, when we consider that
for each volume of oxygen required to burn a given volume of a
gas about four volumes of nitrogen must be heated up to the
temperature of the flame, it becomes easy to conceive, what

           in their Relations to Composition and Luminosity.                           293
is actually the fact, that, within certain limits, the waste of heat
due to this cause alone counterbalances altogether the advantage
that would be supposed to result from the crowding of combus
tible matter into so condensed a form as in the illuminating hy
drocarbons.     An inevitable result of our investigations of this
matter         is,
             that the powers of the flames of pure hydrogen

to heat water below its boiling-point are almost or quite identical.
   In this discussion we have occasion to use the numbers repre
senting the specific heats of but three gases (the three, namely,
which remain after complete combustion) — steam, carbonic acid,
and nitrogen — as we must assume that in the hottest and most lu
minous zone or shell of the flame there   no oxygen in excess to be
                                                         is
heated. These three numbers are, according to Regnault's latest
determinations, for equal weights of

  This means that the amounts of heat which would raise one
pound of water and steam to the same degree are in the ratio of
04805 for the pound of steam, and    for the pound of water.

 Calculation         of   the    Calorific Effect   of      Hydrogen burning in      Air.
   Let us take, first, the simplest case possible, that of hydrogen
                                                                                        is, it,

would heat     certain weight of liquid water to this temperature.

In order to find the actual amount of heat contained in the pro
ducts of combustion, we must first take into account the fact that
one pound of hydrogen burns to nine pounds of steam, and then
obtain the ratio between the above number (31462), and the
amount of heat necessary to heat nine times the weight of steam —
that     is,
         nine times the specific heat of steam. Calling the total
residual heat in the produced steam x, we have the simple pro
portion —  :

                           '                 '
this number as 8061° C, the difference being due to the use       him of        by          a
different number for the specific heat of steam, namely 0-475, apparently
an earlier determination of Regnault.    Bunsen makes here the singular

 294     Messrs. B. Silliman and H. Wurtz on Flame Temperatures,
 a  number which, we may add, represents the maximum of heat
 capable of being imparted to liquid water by the flame of Hare's
oxyhydrogen blowpipe.
    Still we have by no means here the actual temperature of the
 free or open flame of Hare's blowpipe, which is generally lower
 than this figure, as we have not yet taken into account the
 " latent heat," or heat of vaporization, of the 9 lbs. of steam
 formed. The Centigrade temperature necessary to convert 1 lb. of
 water into steam being 537°, to*get the actual temperature of the
 oxyhydrogen flame we must modify the above equation, so that
          mm  Mtfyxwn =68510 c =12364o

 which is the temperature actually possible in the flame of the com
 pound blowpipe, were the combustion instantaneous and complete.
    When hydrogen gas burns in air, however, as has been before
 stated, another deduction of enormous amount must be made
 from the above figures, due to the heat required to expand the
 nitrogen. This is obtained simply by adding to the divisor, as
 above, the weight of the nitrogen of the air employed, multiplied
 by its specific heat.     The weight of the nitrogen in air =3*318
 times the oxygen, so that the latter of the above equations
becomes

    We have here a full explanation of the extraordinary rate of
 degradation of illuminating gas by admixture of air, which we
have discussed elsewhere.        The nitrogen of such air is not merely
 a diluent or even a mere deductive quantity, its specific heat is
 an actual divisory function in diminishing the flame-temperature.
    This, then, is the actual temperature to which the flame of
 hydrogen gas burning in the atmosphere might attain to, sup
 posing complete and instantaneous combustion.             If it is desired
 to obtain instead the total calorific effectiveness, as in heating
 water below its boiling-point, in which case the latent heat of
 the steam of combustion becomes also available, the above expres
 sion is changed by simply omitting the subtrahend in the nu
merator   :

necessary in this case for the latent heat of steam of combustion, as is ex

                                        in Air.
  As the product of combustion is here solely carbonic acid, no
latent heat of steam enters, and the calorific effectiveness is the
same under all circumstances in air.      In the numerator we sub
stitute, of course, the calorific equivalent of one volume of car
bonic oxide from Table I., and in the denominator, for the spe
cific heat of 9 lbs. of water, that of 22 lbs. of carbonic acid,
being the weight of the latter formed by the combustion and
combination of 14 lbs. (weight of a volume of carbonic oxide on
the hydrogen-scale     by third column of Table         of carbonic
                                                                 I.)

                          Marsh-gas and defiant Gas.
  In   these two cases we have as products of combustion both
carbonic acid and water     and therefore, when the calorific effects
                                 ;
are sought for, we have not only the latent heat of steam enter
ing as a  subtrahend into the numerator, but also into the deno
minator (as divisors) all three of the specific heats of steam, car
bonic acid, and nitrogen.
   Then, as  8  lbs. of marsh-gas consume 32 lbs. of oxygen and
produce 22 lbs. of carbonic acid and 18 lbs. of steam, and as
14 lbs. of defiant gas consume 48 lbs. of oxygen, producing
44 lbs. of carbonic acid and 18 lbs. of steam, the equations for
the calorific powers of their flames in air become —         :

           Computation       of Calorific Effects of Mixed Gases.
    The above Table renders the calculation of the calorific effects
of any given gaseous mixture, whose centesimal composition is
known, a matter of extreme simplicity.                 It is only necessary to
obtain the sum of the multiples of the percentage of each com
ponent gas into its calorific capacity, as given in this Table, and
divide by 100*.
    To serve as examples of these modes of computation, we
here cite, in tabular forms, the results of some analyses of a
number of gaseous mixtures made by us during the past winter
 (1868-69).         [These analytical results, it may be remarked,
possess points of novelty and importance, both scientific and
practical, which will bring them up again hereafter in other con
nexions.       They are here placed on record.]
    Table III. gives the results of two analyses of gaseous mixtures
obtained by passing steam superheated to incandescence upwards
through a mass of anthracite coal heated to a high degree in a
clay retort of a novel construction, according to what is now
known as the " Gwynne-Harris,"                  or American Hydrocarbon
Gas System.           In this Table the results are calculated without
carbonic acid and sulphuretted hydrogen, which, with traces of
nitrogen and sometimes of oxygen, are found in the unpurified
anthracite gas.
    * Professor Bunsen, in the masterly discussion of the subject presented
        '
in bis Gasometry,' not having in view the exact object we propose, has
used a train of reasoning and a mode of formulation of some complexity,
to follow which requires some little mathematical skill, — part of his object
having been to construct a formula so general and comprehensive as to
cover the direct computation, from any gaseous mixture independently, of
its special calorific intensity. We have here aimed at so simplifying as to
bring the wnoie subject within the capacity of all.            Our above tabulation
of the individual gaseous components, as a starting-point, seems to us to
accomplish this most effectually, so far as illuminating gases are concerned.

     compelled by the results of the above investigations are some
     what remarkable, so that we feel diffident regarding them.     It

    XLI.     Solar Radiation in connexion with Cloud and Vapour.
                        By J. Park Harrison, Esq.
     To the Editors      of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       Gentlemen,
   HHE       results of some observations of solar radiation as af-
  JL      fected by cloud, which were communicated to the Royal
Society at their last Summer Meeting in 1869, having been
thought of sufficient interest to be reprinted in
                                                           " The Proceed
ings of Societies
                       " in your Journal for January, will you permit
me to explain          that they were intended to be followed by
details of experiments with smaller screens, on perfectly cloud
less days ?       It was hoped they might have been completed in the
autumn of last year, and some progress was made in uly ; but      J
the close and continuous examination of the state of the sky up
to the very edge of the sun's disk, which was requisite in order
to detect the existence of any light form of cloud, proved so
trying to the sight, that a complete cessation for some time of
all work of this description was found to be absolutely necessary.
    From a few observations made in October and January, how
 ever,    I  believe I may state that the accession of heat from
 glare in our atmosphere 5° to 8° round the sun, compared with
 the heat received from direct solar radiation, is very nearly in the
 ratio 1:3; but this must be taken subject to correction when the
 sun is in higher altitudes.        The experiments were made in these
 months under very equal conditions, with the solar thermometer
 raised several inches above short grass and on perfectly calm
 days*.
     The increase of insolation observed when light clouds approach
 the sun was shown in the paper above referred to to be very
 much greater ; whilst diffused light and heat, from white cloud
 and vapour beyond 20° from the sun, causes no perceptible differ
  ence in the readings of an exposed black-bulb thermometer.
     When the relation of insolation to humidity which was
  brought before the Royal Society by H. v. Schlagintweitt (with
  out bis being aware that Mr. Forbes had noticed the same thing
  some years previously at Edinburgh) was found to be supported
  by observations of the actinorncter and solar thermometer at
  Greenwich, I too hastily concluded that effects which appeared
  to be undoubtedly connected with cloud and vapour were due
  wholly to counterradiation of heat received from the bulb of the
  solar thermometer and the ground generally, as in the case of a
    * The disks used as screens were placed 6 inches from the bulb of a solar
  thermometer     Jf inch in diameter.  A disk \\ inch diameter, at the above
  distance, was assumed to be amply sufficient to screen the sun.

radiation-thermometer at night*. With the data, however, now
afforded by the experiments with screens, and the eye-obser
vations of cloud with which they were associated, it cannot,                I
think, be doubted that the peculiar stinging sensation experi
enced by H. v. Schlagintweit in India (apart from the high read
ings of insolation which he observed in regions of great relative
humidity) must have been owing to the diversion of rays of
small obliquity by light cloud high up in the atmosphere;
they consequently reached the bulb of his solar thermometer
almost in a direct course and with little loss of heating-power.
    I  am not aware whether the fact that so great an accession of
heat is attributable to the near approach of light cloud to the
sun has previously been observed.             Certainly, as regards my
own experience, the not uncommon              sensation of a sudden in
crease of solar heat under a partially clouded sky was always as
sumed to be due, not to light- cloud approaching the sun, but
to its passing off from it — or, if the sky appeared, on a superficial
view, to be clear and cloudless, to some possible outburst of heat
in the sun itself.
    The question whether the direct rays of the sun are more
intense in proportion as they pass through a limited extent of
atmosphere is scarcely an open one.             But it will be seen that
the admission of loss of heat from absorption in no wise mili
tates with the fact that a high degree of insolation may be, and
sometimes is obtained, even at comparatively low altitudes of
the sun, under atmospheric           conditions which favour counter-
radiation, or, in the case of cloud near the sun, by complete
reflection of the solar rays.

rriHIS work has been "entirely rewritten and enlarged, the additions

fuel and on ventilation." It consists of a short historical account of
open fireplaces, and of the various recent projects for improving
them. The author's principal suggestions are made under the fol
lowing heads : — (1) The best form of grate should be used — that,

ing surface to the room.        (2) The most suitable materials must be
used for the construction of the grate.        The back and sides should
be made of fire-bricks, fire-lumps, or fire-stones, not on any account
of cast iron. For ordinary use, Welsh are better than Stourbridge
fire-bricks ; for though they do not stand intense heat, they are less
liable to be broken by a blow of a poker.           (3) The best form of
fire-bars must be used ; our author, however, does not make it plain
which form is the best, straight bars having one advantage, curved
bars another.        He tells us that for a room 10 feet each way (con
taining, therefore, 1000 cubic feet) 12-inch bars are long enough ;
 and there should be two additional inches for every additional thousand
 feet of cubic contents.       (4) The fire should be kept in a basket of
 fire-brick, and the supply of air from below should be checked.        (5)
 The escape of the warm air of the room into the chimney should be
 checked. This is to be done by improving the form of the chimney,
 and by placing in the chimney a door that can be opened or shut by
 hand, instead of the ordinary register- valve, which in practice is rarely
 used.      By these means no more air is allowed to pass up the chim
 ney    than  is needed for carrying off the smoke.     (6) Air for combus
 tion should be supplied from a source near the fireplace instead of
 from the doors and windows.           This may be done by bringing an
 air-channel under the floor from the outside wall to the hearthstone,
 the mouth of the channel being capable of being closed by a sliding
 valve.      By this means the fire is fed by cold air from without
 instead of by the warm air of the room.         It may be added that the
 author urges that windows should be double glazed, and that the
 heat which escapes by the chimneys should be utilized.
     Any one engaged in building a house or refitting a house with
  stoves, will find the book well worth looking into, both for the many
  useful hints which it contains, and for the diagrams with which it
  is illustrated.    In this view the book is the more to be relied on, as
  we believe that Mr. Edwards is practically engaged in stove-making,
  and, we may add, he has clearly paid great attention to the princi
 ples of his art.      He states in his preface that " the matter of the "
 volume     "  has been due to his own investigations ;" but we suppose
  he would allow that mai - of his suggestions have been made by
  others as well as by himself.
     Regarded from a literary point of view, the book contains several
  passages which are somewhat curious specimens of style and senti.
  ment. That on p. 16 is too long to quote, where the author pays
  his tribute to the memory of the bellows, the warming pan, the fold
  ing screen, and the eight-day clock.          Another, on p. 35, which
  describes the extinction of      hobs,  runs as follows : — " Housewives
  regretted the departure of the       hob, but became reconciled to the
  brass footman or hanging trivet.       The time-honoured hob, however,
  struggled to hold its own.       It came out ornamental and put lower
  down, and was cleverly recessed in corners ; but nothing could save
  its gradual departure, and it is now becoming rapidly unknown."

     of Physics  in  the Lehigh   University, Bethlehem, Pa. — Part I. Phi
     ladelphia: from the Journal of the Franklin Institute, 1868 (pp.
     112).
     This is scarcely to be called a book, it is much more nearly a
 synopsis of the subject, with disquisitions inserted on the points
  of chief interest, as well as extracts from other writers. The sub
 jects discussed in this first part are the following : — Introduction
  to the Inductive method, Instruments for precise measurements.
 Methods of Precision (e. g. the method of least squares), Methods of
 determining the laws of phenomena, the General Properties of Mat
 ter, and Capillary Attraction.       The author gives a very good risumi
 of the leading facts under each of these heads, and, more than that,
 gives many references that may be useful to those who wish to go
 further into the subject than he is able to take them. The follow
 ing short extract will perhaps convey a better notion of the form of
 the book than an elaborate description.         Under the head of instru
 ments for measuring lengths, the author gives an account of the
 micrometer-screw.        This he does as follows : —
    " Micrometer-screw
                            (from Greek fwcpos small, and fttrpov a mea
 sure)  consists  of  a screw   with a large circular head, whose circum
 ference is divided into a certain number of equal parts.          Suppose
 the screw has fifty threads to the inch, and that its circular plate,
 -which rotates with   it,   isdivided into two hundred parts then the

inch.

    We have only to add that, allowance being made for the imper
fections necessarily arising from the form of the book,        it seems to
us well done, and to be the work of        a man who has an accurate and
extensive acquaintance with his subject.

                                                       is
the author regards as prevalent errors about the laws of motion and
other fundamental points of mechanical philosophy.    He aspires to
take the same place with respect to Newton and Laplace that Galileo
took with respect to the Aristotelians of his day. How the author
may deal with the General Theory of Existence, when he gets to it,
we do not know    ; but his power of dealing with elementary dyna

                     Notices respecting New Books.                   303
mical questions may be judged of by the following indication.        His
definition of velocity runs thus : — " The velocity of a body is deter
mined by multiplying the weight of the body by the space passed
over in a given time
                        "          Now not only is there a want of pre
                          (p. 1).
cision in the statement (a serious fault in such a matter), but what is
determined in the way stated is not what is generally termed velo
city.    The author might possibly object that this is a question of
words ; yet it is a strange use of language which implies that the
velocity of a horse is many times greater than that of his rider ; and,
moreover, a few pages after, he expresses the velocities of bodies in
the usual way of so many feet per second (p. 7, p. 26, &c).
    A large portion of the volume is taken up by a statement of" the
laws which determine the results of collision ;" and these statements
are applied to what may in courtesy be called a criticism of Newton's
laws of motion.        As a specimen of our author's laws, we will
quote the first in the book (p. 3) : A and B, it must be premised,
are two spherical bodies, the weight of A being less than, or equal
to, that of B.    The former moving with a given velocity along the
line of centres impinges on the latter at rest, then: — "Law I. A
will be reflected back from the point of collision in the same line
that it moved in before collision.     Both the velocity and momentum
of A, as compared with the velocity and momentum of A before
collision, will be proportional to the difference q£ the respective
weights of A and B."
    A good many points are suggested by this "law:" e.g. First, it is
assumed as an ultimate fact, without any reason assigned.       Secondly,
it is not stated, though incidentally it is assumed, that the colliding
bodies are perfectly elastic (case 100, p. 10).     Thirdly, the "law,"
as it stands, means that
constant  X A' s velocity of  rebound = (B— A) x A's velocity of impact.
As   the constant must be finite, it follows that if a boy drops a marble
on    a pavement it rebounds with an indefinitely         great velocity.
Fourthly, the words of the
                                  " law," however, do not convey the
author's meaning ; that, as appears from his treatment of particular
cases (pp. 4, 5), seems to be,
    B X A's velocity of rebound= (B— A) x A's velocity of impact.
This, however,      does not much mend      the matter, for it is not the
true law. It is not necessary      to continue our remarks ; if it were,
they could be continued indefinitely.      What we have said will show
the reader that to buy the book is waste of money, to read it waste
of time.

gradual longitudinal disturbance to convert itself by degrees into a
wave   of sudden disturbance.    But although suddenness of disturb
ance may be approximated to, it cannot be absolutely and permanently
realized ; whence it follows that the propagation of waves of longitu
dinal disturbance of absolutely permanent type for an indefinite dis
tance is impossible ; and this may be the cause of the absence of
longitudinal vibrations from rays of light.
   The laws of the advance of adiabatic waves are investigated — that
is,  waves of longitudinal disturbance     which there

of the equation marked (B) in this abstract, that the compressed parts
of those waves tend to gain upon and at last overtake the rarefied
parts, just as the crests of rolling waves in shallow water gain upon
and at last break into the troughs, the consequence being a gradual
conversion of the adiabatic waves into waves of sudden disturbance,
followed        mutual interference of the compressed with the rarefied
               by   a
parts, which leads to the energy of the waves being spent in molecular
agitation.
    It   also shown that the extreme values of the pressure and of
          is
the bulkiness are constant during the change of type, and conse
quently that the respective velocities with which the plane of greatest
compression gains upon and the plane of greatest rarefaction falls
behind the plane of undisturbed density are uniform.
   The values of the linear velocity of advance, mS, found for various
modes of finite disturbance, all approximate, when the disturbance
becomes indefinitely small, to the well-known value of the velocity
of sound, viz.                      ,   the relation between         P   and   S   being de

      "On Approach caused by Vibration." By Frederick Guthrie.
     The author observes that when a vibrating tuning-fork is held near
  to a piece of cardboard, the latter has a tendency to approach the fork.
  Starting from this experiment, a series of experiments are described
 having for their object the determination of the cause and conditions
 of the fundamental observed fact.
     It is shown that no sensible permanent air-currents, having their
 source at the fork's surface, are established — and hence that the ap
 proach of the card to the fork is not due to the expansion of such
 currents, as in M. Clement's experiment.
     The modifications are examined which Mr. Faraday's surface-
 whirlwinds on a vibrating tuning-fork undergo when the fork vibrates
 in the neighbourhood of a sensibly rigid plane.
     It is shown that a delicately suspended card approaches the fork
when either of the three essential faces of the fork is presented to the
 card, and that the approach takes place from distances far exceeding
 the range of Mr. Faraday's air-current. That the action between the
card and fork is mutual is shown by suspending the latter.            Also
one vibrating fork tends to approach another in whatever sense their
planes of vibration may be towards one another.
     The mean tension of the air surrounding a vibrating fork is ex
amined by enclosing one limb of the fork in a glass tube. It ap
pears that the vibrating fork displaces air.
    The question whether the equilibrium between two equal and op
posite forces acting on a body is disturbed by submitting one of the
forces to successive, rapid, equal and opposite alterations in quantity,
is answered in the negative by an experiment which shows that the
 equilibrium of a Cartesian diver is not disturbed by submitting the
water in which it floats to vibration.
    Various modifications are introduced into the nature of the sur
face which receives the vibrations, such as making it a narrow cylin
der with one end closed, making it of cotton-wool, &c.        It is found
that in all cases the suspended body approaches the vibrating one.
    The author concludes that the effect of apparent attraction is due
to atmospheric pressure, and that this pressure is due to undulatory
dispersion.     It is suggested that the dispersion of the vibrations
which constitute radiant heat may cause bodies to approach, being
pushed not pulled.

Acetic Ether."      By E. Frankland, F.R.S., and B. F. Duppa, Esq.,
F.R.S.
    In a paper by Mr. J. Alfred Wanklyn, bearing          the above  title,

310      Royal Society     : — Messrs. Frankland and Duppa    on the
and published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, vol. xviii.
p. 91, the author refers to our memoir on the same subject printed
in the Philosophical Transactions for 1866, vol. clvi. p. 37, and ex
presses his opinion that our interpretation of the nature of the re
action must be erroneous because it involves the disengagement of
hydrogen.       This opinion is founded upon certain experiments which
Mr. Wanklyn has himself made, and which are described in the
                                  '
number of Liebig's * Annalen for January 1869, and in the Chemical
Society's Journal, vol. ii. p. 371.
     In reference to this opinion we have to remark, first, that it is
founded upon experiments which differ essentially from our own, and,
second, that even the results obtained in those experiments by the
author do not warrant the conclusion, at variance with ours, which
he has drawn from them, viz. that the evolution of hydrogen in this
reaction is inadmissible.
     The reaction, the theoretical explanation of which Mr. Wanklyn
seeks to controvert, is described in the Philosophical Transactions,
vol. clvi. p. 38, as follows: — "When acetic ether is placed in con
tact with sodium it becomes hot, and a considerable quantity of gas is
evolved, which, after being passed first through alcohol and then
through water, burns with a non-luminous flame, and the products of
combustion do not produce the slightest turbidity on agitation with
baryta- water. In fact the gas is pure hydrogen. When the action is
complete, the liquid solidifies on cooling to a mass resembling yel
low beeswax.       By putting the sodium into the acetic ether as just
 described,    it is difficult to conduct the operation to completion,
 owing to the liquid gradually assuming such a thick and pasty con
 dition as to prevent the further action of the sodium."       Owing to
 the difficulty of carrying the reaction far enough in this way, we
 frequently employed a modification of this process, which is mi
 nutely described in the same memoir.         The modification consisted
 in placing the sodium in a separate vessel and causing the acetic
 ether to distil continuously over it ; thus the portions of acetic ether
 still unacted upon were brought, again and again, into contact with
 the sodium, whilst the non-volatile product of the operation was re
 tained in a lower vessel.     As we acted upon several pounds of acetic
 ether at once, the operation frequently lasted several days, and
 during the whole time tofrents of hydrogen were evolved.            The
 temperature of the liquid in the distillation vessel was allowed to
 rise to 130° C, and the amount of sodium consumed was not much
  less than one atom for each molecule of acetic ether employed.
      We have made several attempts to determine quantitatively the
 volume of hydrogen given off from a known weight of sodium, and
  also from a known weight of acetic ether ; but in neither operation
  could we obtain a trustworthy result :— in the first case because the
  sodium, which fuses during the reaction, breaks up into a vast num
 ber of very minute globules, the final disappearance of which in the
 highly coloured and pasty product it is impossible to verify ; in
  the second case because the thickening of the liquid prevents the
 reaction being pushed far enough to decompose the whole of the

       Action of Sodium and Ethyl-iodide      on Acetic Ether.      311
acetic ether employed.     In a quantitative experiment, in which 4*857
grammes of acetic ether were acted upon hy sodium in slight excess,
344*79 cub. centims. of hydrogen at 0° C. and 760 millions, pressure
were obtained.     If one molecule of acetic ether had lost one atom of
hydrogen, 615*9 cub. centims. of gas ought to have been collected.
It was evident, however, that a large proportion of acetic ether still
remained unattacked at the close of the experiment.
   Such, then, was our mode of operating : the hydrogen evolved
was allowed freely to escape, the whole process was conducted at the
ordinary atmospheric pressure, and the temperature varied from the
boiling-point of acetic ether to 130° C. Moreover the acetic ether
used was prepared with the greatest care, so as to ensure the absence
of alcohol and water. By our method of preparation, described in
the memoir already cited, no traces of the former could be detected
even in the crude ether ; nevertheless it was first placed for several
days over fragments of fused calcic chloride, which apparently re
mained perfectly dry and unaffected ; it was then in some cases
boiled for ten days or a fortnight upon many pounds of sodium-amal
gam, which we find to be entirely without action upon pure acetic
ether, whilst it rapidly attacks and removes alcohol, if the latter be
added even in very small proportion to the acetic ether.          When
acetic ether, so treated and then distilled from the sodium-amalgam,
was brought into contact with the sodium, an abundant evolution of
hydrogen immediately commenced, and continued during the entire
treatment, which, as already remarked, frequently lasted several days.
The general impression, however, produced upon us by the whole of
our operations was, that the evolution of hydrogen was not quite so
great as that theoretically required by the reactions which we believe
to take place ; nevertheless it was obvious that no equations from
which free hydrogen was excluded could possibly express correctly
the chemical changes effected in this action.       Certain experiments
were undertaken to trace the missing hydrogen ; but as they have
not hitherto been completed, we will not further allude to them here.
   We now turn to Mr. Wanklyn's mode of experimenting.             This
is not stated in his communication to the Royal Society, but is
given in the Journal of the Chemical Society, vol. xvii. p. 371, and
in the Ann. Chem. u. Pharm. for January 1869, as follows: — -
    Exp. 1 . "I  sealed up a quantity of sodium with acetate of ethyl,
which had been very carefully deprived of alcohol and water, and
weighed the tube containing these materials.         I then heated the
tube to 1 30° C. for some time, until the contents had changed from
liquid to solid.    After opening the tube and allowing any gas that
 might have formed to escape, I weighed it again. The loss amounted
 to 0*5 in 100 parts of acetic ether."
    Exp. 2. " 5 cub. centims. of good acetate of ethyl and 0*3 grm. of
sodium were sealed up in a small glass tube and heated in a water-
bath to 100° C. until all the sodium had disappeared. The tube
 was then opened under water ; the evolved gas measured 25 cub.
 centims. at ordinary temperature, but at 0° C. and 760 millims. pres
 sure and dry it measured 23 cub. centims.     If the volume of hydro

312                          Royal Society.
gen be calculated which is equivalent to 0-3 grm. sodium, it will be
found to be 140 cub. centims."
   Exp. 3. " Another specimen of acetic ether, which was prepared
with greater care, evolved no gas by the action of potassium or
sodium."
    It is thus evident that, whilst we allowed all evolved gas freely to
escape, Mr. Wanklyn operated in sealed tubes under great pressure
 — an alteration in the conditions of the experiment which might well
lend to a modification of the result.    Mons. L. Cailletet has recently
shown that the evolution of hydrogen from zinc and hydrochloric
acid is gradually diminished and finally stopped under increasing
pressure ; and the same chemist also finds that the evolution of hy
drogen from sodium-amalgam and water is diminished and finally
stopped in a sealed tube.      It follows from these experiments that
pressure retards or even interrupts a reaction in which a permanent
gas is evolved, whilst it is known to exercise little or no influence
 upon other chemical changes in which no evolution of gas takes
place. This influence of pressure upon certain kinds of chemical
 action affords an explanation of the difference between the results of
 Mr. Wanklyn's experiments and our own, as regards the evolution of
 hydrogen during the action of sodium upon acetic ether. We can
 confirm his observation that sodium dissolves in valeric ether, under
 ordinary atmospheric pressure, without the evolution of any gas.       A
 reaction, whatever its nature may be, which thus proceeds readily
 with ethylic valerate can scarcely be impossible with its homologue,
 acetic ether, and it is probable that this reaction goes on side by side
 with those which we have described in our memoir ; but when the
 pressure is moderate those changes chiefly take place which involve
the disengagement      of hydrogen, whilst under the great pressure
 arising in sealed tubes these changes are more or less suppressed,
 and the reaction observed by Mr. Wanklyn comes into prominence.
     Lastly, Mr. Wanklyn's own experiments scarcely justify his un
 qualified opinion that "equations which assume evolution of hy
 drogen in these reactions are inadmissible."     In two out of three of
 his experiments, hydrogen in considerable quantity was evolved ; and
 although in experiment No. 2, given above, he attributes the hydro
 gen to the presence of alcohol, yet in experiment No. 1 its origin
 cannot be so explained, as he states expressly that the acetic ether
 employed "had been very carefully deprived of alcohol and water ;"
 yet the proportion of hydrogen evolved in this case was much larger
 than in experiment No. 2.
     We reserve our observations upon Mr. Wanklyn's views regarding
 the changes which take place when sodium acts upon acetic, butyric,
 and valeric ethers, until the publication of the experimental data
 upon which those views are founded.

    1. " On some of the results arising from the bedding, joints, and
spheroidal structure of the Granite on the Eastern side of Dartmoor,
Devonshire."      By G. Wareing Ormerod, Esq., ALA., F.G.S.
    After noticing the apparent bedding of the granite, the author
stated that in various places, as at Scarrey and Belstone Tors on the
north, Kestor and Middleton near Chagford, Blackingatone near
Moreton, and Houndtor near Dsington, the beds dipped, and the
contour of the country was there caused by these curves. The joints
ran in directions mostly from N. to S. and E. to W. The N. and S.
joints were generally nearly perpendicular ; the E. and W. often in
 clined to the N. or S. Descriptions of the chief forms of joints and
 peculiarities connected with them were given ; and it was stated that
 decay acted along these lines, and that to them the forms of the Tors
 may be traced. Examples were given showing the effect of joints in
 the large massive tor and in the insulated rock pillar. A spheroidal
 structure was shown to exist in the coarse granite south of the
 Teign, and the possible connexion of the Rock Basins with it was
 noticed. Various localities were mentioned where the structure was
 to be seen in cuttings, and in masses like boulders but actually in
 situ. To this cause the form of rounded insulated rocks was attri
 buted. In conclusion, the author stated that these three causes had
 acted frequently together, and that he considered that to them the
 origin of the Logans, or Rocking-stones, was often to be attributed.
 The Logans at Belstone and Thornworthy he attributed to the action
  of these three causes ; and that at Bippon Tor to bedding and joints.
  The Drewsteignton Logan he considered a transported block, and
  the " Nutcrackers

  perforations seemed to be irrespective of any differences in the
   hardness of the rock, and hence, and from the regularity and smooth
   ness of the cavities, he argued that they could not be the result of the
   chemical and mechanical action of the atmospheric moisture.           The
   perforations were  said  to occur chiefly in groups, often ramifying from
   a common entrance ; and where the actual entrance is preserved,
   this is narrower than the more deeply seated portions.        The author
   maintained that the hollows described by him had been ground out

of  the rock ; and he expressed his belief that they were made by
some animal when " the land was submerged to the extent indicated
by the altitudes at which they occur."              From their position he
supposed    their formation to have taken place during,            or imme
diately  before  the Glacial epoch.
   Mr. J. Gwtn Jeffreys remarked that Mr. A. Tylor had already
called attention to the same subject three years ago. He could not
agree in regarding the markings as lithodomous borings. The borings
of Saxicava and Gastrochcena were not parallel, but enlarged to
wards the base into a pear-shaped form.            They were also compara
tively straight,  and   not curved   or   bifurcated   as in the limestones
exhibited.     The range in 'height was also against their being the
work of marine mollusks. He thought the perforations were more
probably due to atmospheric agency.
   3. " On the Parallel Eoads of Glen Roy." By Prof. James Nicol,
F.E.S., P.G.S.
   The author briefly noticed the two principal hypotheses which
have been advanced to account for the formation of these terraces,
and asserted his own belief in their marine origin.            He rested his
argument against      the  hypothesis   of   their  lacustrine origin chiefly
on the ground that if their formation be due to successive pe
riods of repose alternating with sudden drainings of a lake occupy
ing the present valley of Glen Hoy, we ought still to find traces of the
violent debdeles occasioned by these drainings, or of large rivers in
the gorges through which the waters must have flowed. The author
stated that no such appearances        presented themselves ; on the con
trary, he adduced certain characters exhibited by these gorges,
which, he considered, were strongly in evidence of long-continued
sea-action, and seemed to indicate that the gorges in question had
been occupied, at the time of the formation of the terraces, by arms
of the sea.
    Mr. H. M. Jettkins objected to the supposition of the sudden
alteration in the level of the water adopted by the author. Ho
 thought the gradual sinking of the water was quite compatible with
the formation of the roads.       He instanced the formation of terraces
 in gravel-pits filled with water.
    Sir H. James announced that the Ordnance survey of the district
in question was now complete.

 longing to the Millstone-Grit are, as stated by the author: — 1.

                    RESEARCHES ON SOLAR RADIATION.
                   BY MM. F. DESAINS AND E. BRANLEY.
        E   have the honour of laying before the Academy an account
  * »      of  some experiments we have made this summer with the view
of solving certain questions relative to solar radiation.       These ques
tions are    : —
    1 . The influence of altitude on the intensity of the calorific action
exerted by the sun at points whose projections on the ground are
not very distant from each other.
    2. The influence of the altitude of a point on the composition of
the sun's rays which strike it.
    3. How the composition of the heat sent to the same point varies
with the height of the sun above the horizon when the quantity of
vapour contained in the air does not vary during the experiments.
    The apparatus we used had been previously constructed by M.
Duboscq and M. Ruhmkorff under the direction of one of us (M.
Desains). We will give a rapid description of it.
    The first part is a parallactic apparatus consisting of a Silbermann's
heliostat, the clockwork of which moves not as usually a mirror, but
a tube whose axis follows the sun in its daily course.
    This tube has a double envelope ; and its inner chamber has a ther
moelectric pile, on one face of which the sun's rays strike when a
stop is removed which closes the corresponding end of the tube in
which it is placed.          In the tube itself, between the end and the
pile,   diathermanous      screens  may be placed so as to act on the inci
dent rays.
    The second apparatus used in our researches is more easily trans
 portable than that we have just described. One of its principal parts
is a leg with a double movement, which supports at the top a copper
tube about 0'06 metre in length by O05 metre in diameter. The
 movements with which the apparatus is furnished render it possible
 to keep its axis continually pointing to the centre of the sun ; and,
 thanks to a system of lateral sights, it is always possible to judge
 whether the condition is fulfilled.
    In this tube or moveable support a thermoelectric pile may be fixed,
provided with an envelope identical in all respects with that we have
 described above.
    Instead of the pile it is sometimes advantageous to introduce
 the blackened bulb of a thermometer, the stem of which projects
 through an aperture constructed for that purpose.
    It is also possible to introduce a spectroscope of a particular kind,

  316              Intelligence and Miscellaneous   Articles.
  the object of which is to estimate the influence which various causes
  may have upon the position of maximum heat in the solar spectrum.
  We shall not give a detailed description of its construction, but
  merely remark that it consists essentially of a bent tube which has
  at one end a stop with a rectilinear aperture the width of which may
  be varied, in the middle a lens and a prism of rock-salt or of fluor
  spar, and, finally, at the other end a line thermopile, the direction
  of which may always be made parallel with that of the spectral rays
  investigated.     A micrometric screw renders it possible to move this
  pile slowly in a plane perpendicular to the axis of that part of the
  tube which supports it, and thus bring it into all parts of the spectrum.
     Our experiments on the influence of altitude on the intensity and
  composition of the sun's heat were made simultaneously from the 8th
  to the 15th of last September — on the one hand at the Schweizerhof
 at Lucerne, and on the other at the Rigi-Kulm hotel, about 4756 feet
 above the lake.       They have shown that, at the same time and all
 other things being equal, the solar radiation was more intense on the
 top of the Rigi than at Lucerne, but that it was far less transmissible
 through water and alum. The following are some of the numbers : —
     On Monday, September 13, at 7h 45m a.m., in fine weather, the
 sun's rays at the top of the Rigi produced a deflection of 27°'2 of
 the needle of the instrument which was set up there.          At Lucerne,
 at the same time, the deviation was 30o-3. Now the second apparatus
 was more delicate than the other in the ratio of 277 to 204; this
  we determined on the spot at Lucerne.        Hence the Lucerne appa
 ratus, if it had possessed the same delicacy as that on the Rigi, would
 have given 22°"5 when the latter gave 27°2.             Expressing these
 results in hundredths, we come to this result, — that on Monday
 the 1 3th, at a quarter to 8 in the morning, the sun's rays, in tra
 versing under an angle of about 70° the layer of air between the
 level of the top of Rigi-Kulm and that of Lucerne, experienced a
 loss of 1 7 - 1 per cent.
     The transmissibility of the radiation was less on the Rigi than at
 Lucerne. Through a glass trough 0'08 metre in length, full of water,
 the rays on the Rigi passed in the proportion of 0*685, and at Lu
 cerne in the proportion 0 73.     Many other experiments made, on the
 10th, 12th, 13th, and 14th, led to results which agree with those we
 have just announced.
    In the experiments of the 1 3th of September, the tension of aqueous
 vapour in the air on the top of the Rigi was 0'0063 metre, and at Lu
cerne 0"0086. We cannot, however, conclude thence that the mean
tension of the aqueous vapour contained in the layer of air between
the two stations is the mean of these numbers ; for the tension on
the Rigi close to the ground might be very different from what it
was in air at the same altitude but at a distance of several hundred
yards from the mountain.
    The apparatus, the use of which has led us to the preceding results,
may be applied without difficulty to determine the changes which
the daily course of the sun produces in the intensity of the heat which
it sends to a given point. This question has been treated by M.

Pouillet ; we have not touched it ; but we have made a tolerably nu
merous   series of experiments to ascertain how the nature of the sun's
heat varies with the time of day — that is, with the thickness of the
layerof atmosphere traversed, and with thequantityofwaterwhich this
layer contains.      \   first series of experiments was made between the
 15th of July  and the 15th of September, on fine days in which from
7h 30m in the morning to midday the atmospheric conditions under
went no great changes. Under these circumstances, at Paris as well
as Lucerne, the sun's heat always appeared more transmissible through
water and through alum in the morning than it was at midday. Thus,
at Lucerne, on Monday, September 13, at 7h 30m a.m. the sun's heat
passed through a glass trough containing a layer of water 0-004
metre in thickness in the proportion of 0"755 ; at noon the transmis
sion through the same trough was not more than 0-71. In August,
at Paris, we obtained still more striking differences.         In October, on
the contrary, in mornings in which the temperature was near zero in
the early part of the day and rose much towards the middle, the
differences in transmissibility were no longer apparent; and this is
readily intelligible — the differences between the thicknesses of air
traversed by the rays in the course of the experiments being less than
in summer, and their influence lessened by a considerable increase
in the quantity of aqueous vapour.
   Our spectroscopic observations have led to results which tend to
confirm the preceding.          At Lucerne, on the 13th and 14th of Sep
tember, the maximum seemed at midday a little more distant from the
red than in the morning.           In October, on the contrary, its position
seemed constant, as did also the transmissibility of the rays through
troughs full of water. — Comptes Rendus, November 29, 1869.
AVOOADRO'S      LAW DEDUCED FROM THE FUNDAMENTAL CONCEP
    TION OF     THE MECHANICAL             THEORY OF OASES.        BY ALEX.
    NAUMANN.
   Avogadro's law, that equal volumes of different gases at the same
temperature and pressure contain the same number of molecules, is
probably regarded by the majority of scientific chemists as the most
certain basis for fixing molecular and atomic weights, which enable
chemical compositions and chemical processes to be expressed in the
simplest and most natural manner.             Hence it may be desirable to
furnish a proof that the same law may be deduced as a necessary
consequence     from a totally different basis and in a totally different
manner.
   In the development of the mechanical theory of gases, Avogadro's
law has been used * as a simple and probable assumption.               But it
may also be deduced as a necessary consequence from the well-founded
assumption that the molecules of gas are very small as compared with
their mean distances from each other, and behave like elastic spheres,
                *

and have a progressive motion*        — if taken in   conjunction with certain
facts confirmed by experiment.
   In accordance with the said assumption, the pressure of the gas is
found to be the sum of all the impacts which the molecules of gas effect
upon the adjacent bodies in virtue of their progressive motion.              The
pressure   on  the unit  of surface  will depend,   therefore,   ( )

of each individual molecule of gas, (2) on the velocity of the mole
cules, (3) on the volume of the gas, (4) on the number of molecules.
   Let us, on the one hand, take the mass of a molecule as m, and its
velocity c ; on the other, the mass M and the velocity C. Then the
force of the individual impacts is directly as the masses and the ve
locities ; it is therefore proportional to the product of the two so-
called magnitudes. of motion — that is,           =           But the number of
impacts effected by a molecule in equal times is proportional                   to
its velocity — that is,   = 4r,     Hence the pressures       as  regards masses

microscopic observation (Kick, Die Naturkrafte in ihrer Wechselbeziehung,

by a tremulous motion, and, further, the observation (O. E. Meyer, Pogg.
Ann. vol. exxv. pp. 177, 401, 564) that the friction of gases is independent
of the density, but increases with the temperature, as is required by a pro
gressive rectilinear molecular motion increasing with the temperature
{he. cit. pp. 584-698, compare also p. 179).

  XLV.    On the present state  of the question as to the Limits of the
       Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods.      By F. J. Pictet*.
               within the last few years all geologists have accepted
  UNTIL   the limits of the Cretaceous and Jurassic formations as
 they were laid down for the deposits of England and the North
 of France. No one ventured to suppose that things may pos
 sibly have gone on otherwise than in the Anglo-French basin.
 We were accustomed to assume that the Kimmeridgian and
 Portlandian stages everywhere formed the upper limit of the
 Jurassic period, and the Neocomian stage (including in this the
 Valangian) the lower boundary of the Cretaceous period, these
 limits being at some points rendered still more distinct by the
 existence of intermediate freshwater deposits (Wealden) .
    New discoveries and investigations have thrown some doubt
 upon this uniformity ; and the general question, originating
 almost at the same time in Germany and in France, has acquired
 an importance and development which seem to me to render it
 worthy of the attention of the Society.      I have therefore thought
that I might render a service to some of our colleagues by sum
 ming up as briefly as possible the numerous discussions which
are now scattered through several periodicals, and which it is
 not always easy to coordinate.

322      M. F.    J. Pictet on the present state    of the question as to
lion the limits of the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods is a me
moir by Oppel*, the purpose of which was to show that, between
        J
those urassic stages which have been regarded as the uppermost,
and the lowest Cretaceous stage, there exist thick strata charac
terized by a very rich fauna.          These deposits had, indeed, been
noticed by several geologists, and especially in Switzerland by
MM. Studer, Brunner, and Fischer-Ooster, and in Germany by
MM. Suess, von Hauer, Peters, &c. ; but Oppel, by a detailed
comparison of the facts, gave them quite a new significance.              He
grouped the whole of this series of deposits under the name of
the Tithonic stage, which he limited below by the Kimmeridgian
stage on which it often rests, and above by the Neocomian stage.
 He was inclined to regard it as the upper term of the Jurassic se
ries.    We have not here to discuss the value of this new name,
which seems to us to represent rather too large a totality t. The
author himself moreover announced his Tithonic stage as constitu
ting a provisional association, destined to be subdivided hereafter.
 Considered generally and rather vaguely, it represents a right
 idea by which science has made a positive advance. Applying
 these data to the special case of the limestones of the Porte-de-
 France, to which we shall refer by-and-by, Oppel was the first who
conceived the idea of reducing the age of these beds, by raising
them in the chronological series of formations. '
    Whilst Oppel sought in this way to raise the superior term of
the Jurassic series, M. Hebert, taking up another phase of the
question, was inclined to lower the inferior term of the Cretaceous
series.    For some years the learned Professor of the Sorbonne
had remarked that, below the bed designated by M. Lory the
Lower Neocomian mark, which passed as the oldest Neocomian
bed, there were some limestones possessing the lithological ap
pearance of the subjacent Jurassic rocks, and nevertheless con
taining Neocomian fossils {Ammonites macilenlus &c.) . In 1 861
our colleague, Professor Studer, accompanied M. Hubert in a
journey the principal result of which was to show the existence
of this new term in the Cretaceous series. At first this discovery
attained but little publicity beyond that which was given to it
by general and personal statements made in the laboratory of the
Sorbonne to all the geologists and palaeontologists who visited
those interesting collections.
    I myself knew of it by conversations with M. Hebert; and
after having often pressed him to give a real publicity to these

certain number of local beds, such as those of Solenhofen &c.

          the  Limits of the Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods.             323
facts,   I obtained for the Bibliotheque Universelle a notice* which
formed     the  primary basis of the discussions in which      I have taken
part, and which have repeatedly occupied the Geological Society
of France.
    The principal object of this note was to establish, in the first
place, the existence of the inferior limestones already mentioned,
which carry the origin of the Cretaceous period to a more ancient
epoch than had been supposed.               Then passing to the investiga
tion of the limestones of the Porte-de- France, the section of
which was well known from the excellent works of M. Lory,
 M. Hebert came to the conclusion, from exclusively palaeontolo-
gical considerations, that these limestones should be ascribed to
the Neocomian period, and not to the Oxfordian stage, as they
 usually had been.
    Our learned friend founds his conclusions upon the investiga
tion of fossils communicated by MM. Lory and Chaper, and
cites, as an important character of these beds, the presence of
 Terebratula diphya, which, according to him, is incontestably
 Neocomian and only forms a single species; for, he says, the
 most careful examination does not enable us to find the smallest
 constant specific character between this aud T. diphyoidesf.
     This novel and bold opinion as to the age of the Terebratula-
 diphya limestones of the Porte-de- France was received with some
 astonishment, and became immediately the subject of discussions.
 I must explain in a few words how I was led to mix myself up
 in them.       I one day received a visit from Brother Euthymus,
 who brought me a series of fossils from Berrias, in which I
 speedily recognized a fauna with Neocomian characters, but
 consisting for the most part of unknown species. Brother Eu
 thymus was kind enough to accompany me into the department
 of the Ardeche; and then, thanks to the assistance of the autho
 rities of Privas, and to investigations made at Berrias itself under
 the auspices of M. de Malbos, I was able to publish a monograph
 on the Limestone with Terebratula diphyoides of Berrias J, and
  thus to add, to the first discovery of M. Hebert, the description
  of a Neocomian fauna of greater antiquity than any of those
  then known.

     t  In his subsequent works, M. Hubert has been less positive ; and if I
  here repeat his first assertion, which has since been much softened, it is
  solely to show the necessity of a monograph upon the Terebratula of the
  c/i/'Aya-group.

  32   I     M. F.   J.  Pictet  on the present state    of t/ie question as to
      It then became necessary to have a better knowledge of the
  Terebratula: of the diphya-growp*, inasmuch as arguments, in
  my opinion erroneous, were drawn from them to justify exagge
  rated associations.        I distinguished several species, the characters
  of which are, in my opinion, perfectly clear ; and               I showed that
  these species, although but little apart as regarded their age, may
  serve to characterize certain distinct beds.
      These two preparatory investigations being made, I also took
  up the study of the limestones of the Porte-de-France, and I
 summed up my opinion nearly as followst, taking as my basis,
 like M. Hebert, the classical memoirs of M. Lory.
      The section of Grenoble and of Aizy is composed of three
 principal stages.
      The base is occupied by a Jurassic fauna, analogous by its                  •
 fossils to that of the beds of Baden in Argovia, or to the fauna
 of Ammonites tenuilobatm.              This fauna, which in Germany has
 often the same geological relations with the Stramberg limestone,
 is regarded by M. Hebert as Oxfordian, and by MM. Beuecke,
 Zittel, &c. as Kimmeridgian J.
      Above this, and from the appearance of Terebratula janitor
  (formerly confounded with T. diphya), there is a limestone which,
 by its fossils, perfectly resembles the Stramberg limestone, with
 which it is incontestably contemporaneous.                 With this limestone
 there is associated at Aizy a coralline breccia which seems to
 contain a mixture of Jurassic and Cretaceous species.
      The top of the section (cement-marls) is formed by beds iden
 tical with the limestone of Berrias.
      Now, where is the limit between the two periods? This is
 what remains to be fixed.           1 supposed a line, A, between the first
 formation and the second, and a line B, of less importance, be
 tween the second and the third.               I showed that the limit was
 perhaps      at the  line  A,  less  probably at the line B, and perhaps,
 again, between the two.              M. Hebert accepts the line A. We
 shall see hereafter the difficulties which surround the solution of              '
 this question.
     It may be added, for the comprehension of the relations of this
 section with our faunas of the Swiss Jura, that the limestone of

" Notice sur les Calcaires de la Porte-de-     France     (ibid. October 1867).
    J   I have adopted this last opinion, but I must add that the determination
of the exact age of the Jurassic bed has been to me but a secondary ques
tion, of which    I leave the discussion to others.   It must be remarked that
the facies of these faunas varies much in different places, and renders ne
cessary a long and complicated investigation, for which I do not possess the
requisite materials.

         the Limits of  the Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods.           325
Berrias probably represents an horizon immediately below our
Valangian.        In the Department of the Bouches du-llhone M.
Coquand has found this Berrias limestone immediately covered
by the bed with Natica leviathan, a fossil characteristic of the
Lower Valangian.
    Thus it will be seen that the great features of the question
were pretty well sketched out in these first works.            It remains
for us to see what has been its subsequent development.
    Every one now seems to be nearly agreed as to the facts which
we have just related.       The succession of the formations is not
contested ; and it is useless to refer here to some divergences of
detail which do not in any way affect the general solution of the
question*.
   Numerous works published of late years show that this succes
sion of faunas has been the same at many points distant from
each other. MM. von Hauer, Suess, Zittel, Benecke, Mojsisovics,
Neumayr, &c. have ascertained facts remarkably in accordance
with those which I have just indicated ; and we may regard it as
a settled point that from the Carpathians to the Mediterranean,
wherever the Tithonian formation is met with, the stages are
usually arranged in conformity with the following section : —
    1. Neocomian stage, properly so called.
    2. Valangian stage, and marls with Belemnites latus.
   3. Berrias limestone.
   4. Tithonian stage.
    5. Bed with large Aptychi.
    6. Jurassic fauna with Ammonites tenuilobatus.
    The principal question, that of the limit of the Jurassic and
Cretaceous periods, may therefore be presented here as the alter
native between the following solutions.
   The line of separation may be the line A of my memoir — that
is to say, the line passing between Nos. 4 and 5.
   It may be drawn a little lower — that is to say, between Nos. 5
and 6.
    This line of separation may also        be the line B of my memoir,
and pass between Nos. 3 and 4.
   *  In particular M. Hebert and myself have not always interpreted the
species in the same way.    For my own part I persist in the greater part of
my determinations, but I must remark that these differences of apprecia
tion cannot at all modify the results indicated.  Moreover it would be easy
for me to show that the signification of my assertions has often been too
much extended.      Thus, when I proved (with MM. Bayle and Chapcr) that
Ammonites StazysciianAA. Liebigi are not A. Grasianus and suhfimbriatus,
I was told in reply that these two species pass into the Neocomian, which
I have never denied; and so forth.

 326     M. F.   J. Pictet  on the present state    of the question as to
    To these possible solutions, which have already been discussed,
 two others may be added, which we shall analyze further on, and
 which tend to acquire a certain amount of probability.
     May it not pass through the middle of No. 4, separating a
 Jurassic from a Cretaceous Tithonian ?
     And, lastly, is not this line an illusion ? and is it not possible
 that there has been no interruption between the two periods ?
    Before going into details,     I must say that it is here especially
 that, under some points of view, I have diverged from M. He-
 bert ; but our divergences have been considerably exaggerated,
 and relate especially to a question of method.             Now the more
 we approach the solution, the more will the facts acquired predo
 minate over this question of method ; and when the truth shall
 be rendered incontestable, it will be of less importance to know
 by what course we have arrived at it.
     M. Hebert now declares* that he has occupied himself only
 with the question of the Porte-de-France, and that the bed with
 Terebratula diphya (Janitor) is incontestably Neocoruiant.              He
 retains some doubts with regard to the Coralline breccia super
 posed upon or associated with the limestone of Aizy, of which             I
have already spoken.
    The opinion which I put forward in my first note, and which
 I have since constantly maintained, is that the question must be
 solved by a general comparison of the strata in dispute over a
large geographical space.         The solution must be capable of ap
plication not only to the south of France, but also to the Car
 pathians, to Italy, to the Tyrol, to Spain, to Algeria, &c. ; we
 may consequently expect that it will be very complex.
    I must remark, indeed, that the Department of the Iscre alone,
 notwithstanding the excellent works of M. Lory, does not fur
nish sufficient documents.         M. Hebert and myself have worked
 upon   the  same   materials, which  are but scanty, and among which
there are numerous species of uncertain origin. We have de
 duced from them, I believe, all that can be deduced ; we may,
perhaps, even be accused of having acted sometimes with a little
temerity.     For absolute certainty, more well-characterized species
found in situ in a very clear section would be necessary.            I con
tinue to be profoundly convinced that the Lithographic limestones
of the Porte-de- France and Aizy must follow the lot of those of
   *  Geological  Magazine, July 1869, vol. vi. p. 301.
   t  M. Hebert   would perhaps have done better had he made use of the
word Cretaceous ; for however possible we may consider it that the Titho
nian stage forms the oldest member of the Cretaceous period, we think we
should refuse the name of Neocomian to a formation so profoundly different
from the stage which bears this name, and which has not 5 per cent, of
species in common with it. But this is a secondary question, and we shall
proceed with the discussion as if M. Hebert had employed the broader word.

            the  Limits of the  Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods.             327
Stramberg, and that their true value can only be elucidated by a
detailed investigation, of which          I must now indicate the diffi
culties.
    We already possess numerous documents upon the limestone
of Stramberg.          From the special point of view which interests
us, supposing all the determinations to be accurate, and assu
ming all the fossils described to be exactly contemporaneous,
what we know may be summed up in the following facts, which
appeared, a few months ago, to be the last words on the ques
tion, and which, in order to preserve a chronological order, I
must analyze here, to discuss and modify them hereafter.
    The Cephalopoda, which have just been completely studied by
 M. Zittel*, number fifty-five species, of which fifty are new.
The five others have their analogues in the Cretaceous period.
 Not one occurs in the Jurassic stages. This proportion, if it
were constant, would solve the question in favour of the line A ;
 but the other documents are far from leading to the same result.
     The Brachiopoda, which have likewise been carefully investi
 gated, first by M. Zeuschnert and then by M. E. SuessJ, one
 of the most competent palaeontologists in this department, give
 a different result.       Of thirty-eight species described, twenty-six
 are new ; none pass into uncontested Cretaceous stages ; eleven
 recur in the Jurassic period; and one (Terebratula janitor, Pict.)
 is particularly valuable because it also occurs at the Porte-de-
 France, and in some other deposits, of which it seems to show the
 analogy with the limestone of Stramberg.
     The Gasteropoda are less known. M. Zeuschner§ and M.
 Peters || have described the Nerinaa of Inwald, a deposit which
 passes as contemporaneous with that of Stramberg.                   They have
 an essentially Jurassic facies.
     This is the case also with the other Gasteropoda and the
  Acephala, at least judging from still unpublished comparisons
  made in the magnificent collection of the Museum at Munich,
  to such an extent that M. Zittel has concluded from these first
  data that the Tithonian stage presents a fauna identical with
  those of Wimmis and of Mont Saleve, which have hitherto been
  ascribed to the Corallian stage.
      Such is the principal difficulty.        If all these facts be correct,
  we must assume that on the confines of the two periods there
  are mixed faunas, and that the Cretaceous species, having suc
  cessively appeared, have gradually modified the Jurassic faunas.

from all chances of error.   It is particularly necessary to ascertain
if thosewhich have been referred to the Stramberg limestone really
belong to     it,
               and whether they have really lived together at the
same time and constituted        single fauna, as

conclusion which we have just indicated.
    Now  itmust be admitted that the most recent investigations
have rendered this contemporaneity to         certain extent doubtful.

It appeared very probable few months ago but now
                                 a                                 ;no             it   is

                    ;
arguments which may be adduced to modify the ideas previously
put forward.     But, as will be seen hereafter, the conclusions
with which we can replace them present themselves under                                      a
curious and unexpected light, and raise questions of quite equal
gravity.
  The first doubts were set on foot                    by
                                         the study of the Swiss
beds associated with the Stramberg limestone — that  to say, the              is
Corallian stage of Wimmis and that of Mont Saleve.        These
deposits, notwithstanding evident relations with the Tithonian
 stage, are nevertheless deficient in several characters which would
 render this analogy incontestable.          Thus neither at Wimmis nor
 at the Saleve has Terebratula janitor been found, any more than
 any of the Cephalopoda of Stramberg.                         If
                                                       we might suppose
 that the German geologists have combined into one two distinct
 beds, of which the more recent               characterized
                                              is                  this Tere   by
 bratula and the Cephalopoda, and the deeper one                 another setby
 of fossils, would       not be possible that we should find with us
                         it
 only  the  inferior  fauna,   designated         by
                                                some geologists the fauna
 of Terebratula moravica, and which would constitute the last
term of the Jurassic period, whilst the true Stramberg would
 form the base of the Cretaceous formations.              M. Hebert gives
us the good news that he has commenced                comparative investi
                                                              a
gation of all these faunas.
    These doubts are in great part confirmed                       by
                                                             recent notea                    by
M. Coquand, "On the Stages of Provence"*.                   The analysis of
this important document would lead us too far.                 Its principal
result  is,  that  in  this  region  the  fauna   of Terebratula   moravica,
entirely destitute of Cephalopoda and probably identical with that
of the Coralline limestones of the Saleve and Wimmis,             covered     is             by
beds containing Kimmeridgian and Portlandian Ammonites, and
consequently        evidently Jurassic.
                    is                        These facts, at least as far
as we can judge of them from              first sketch, seem to indicate
                                          a
that there are two different orders of succession according to the

          the  Limits of the  Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods.        329
 regions.     In one (Provence, Saleve/Wimmis) the stages are nearly
 conformable to what we find in the rest of France, and terminate
 in the littoral Neocomian ; the limits of the Jurassic and Creta
 ceous appear there to be distinct.         In the other, comprised be
 tween the Carpathians and Italy (with a portion of the French
  Alps, of the Department of the Isere, &c.), the Tithonian stage
 rules on the confines of the two great periods.
     It is to tbis latter form of succession that we have to direct
 our attention.       In this affairs have taken place in a very differ
 ent manner from that which characterizes the Anglo-French
  basin.    To be convinced of this, we have only to study the
 recent investigations of M. Zittel* in the central Apennines,
 and those of M. Neumayrt in the Carpathians.               These works
 seem to prove that the Tithonian stage must be divided into two,
 neither of which, indeed, is perfectly identical with the fauna of
  Terebratula moravica, for both of them are rich in Ammonites.
    In the central Apennines the Tithonian stage is strongly de
 veloped and abounds in fossils, but, according to M. Zittel, it
 presents peculiar palaeontological conditions. Of forty-five species,
 consisting in great part of Cephalopoda, there are thirty-one in
 common with the Z)/pAya-limestone of the Tyrol, and twenty-nine
 with the breccia of Rogoznik.         Its analogy with Stramberg is
 less, and supported by only thirteen species.
    From this and from different comparisons, M. Zittel infers
 that the Tithonian stage, as we have just stated, forms two divi
 sions.     The superior of these is the Stramberg limestone, the
fauna of which has more analogy to Cretaceous than to Jurassic
forms.      It corresponds to the coralline beds of the Wolfgang
lake, and also to the lithographic beds of the Porte-de-France
and of Aizy.
    The lower one, which nevertheless evidently forms part of the
same whole, includes the greenish marble of the central Apen
nines, the <ftpAya-limestone of the Tyro), and the Klippenkalk
of Rogoznik.        The fauna has a more Jurassic character than
that of the other division. Out of forty-five species only one is
Cretaceous, and at least four are Jurassic.
    M. Neumayr has studied the formations situated between
Rogoznik in Galicia and the county of Saros in Upper Hungary,
along a long and narrow band.            These formations present an
interesting     and  instructive  series of  faunas, which, like the in
vestigations of M. Zittel just cited, show the extreme difficulty
that there is in finding a limit between the Jurassic and Creta
ceous periods in the vicinity of the Tithonian stage.

330      M. F. J. Pictet   on the present state
                                                of the question   as to
    We shall not refer here to the lower deposits, which have no
thing to do with our subject, namely the beds with Ammonites
opalinus, those with A. Murchisona, and the Crinoidal limestone.
Those which interest us are : —
    1. The lower Tithonian fauna, which may be subdivided into
two : —
    A. The fauna of the Czorsztyn limestone, from which M. Neu-
mayr cites twenty-five species. Of these, twelve also occur in the
blue marble of the Apennines. The general fauna especially
approaches the Jurassic fauna known under the names of the
fauna of Ammonites acanthicus and A. tenuilobatus.             Some spe
cies are the same as those of Stramberg (A. silesiacus, Kochi,
ptychoricus, &c.).     Only one persists into the true Neocomian
 {A. quadrisulcatus) .     The perforated Terebratula are T. Catulloi,
Pict., and T. sima, Zeuschn.
    B. The true Tithonian fauna, containing thirty-eight species
of Cephalopoda, of which sixteen reappear in the breccia of Ro-
goznik, seventeen in the blue marble of the Apennines, and only
eight at Stramberg.        Terebratula Catulloi and T. sima persist.
    2. A white limestone which has been found only at two points
in the south-west, and which corresponds to the true Stramberg
limestone.     Of fourteen determinable Ammonites, twelve also
occur in the latter deposit; of these seven are common to Stram
berg and Rogoznik, and only one is peculiar to the latter stage.
    We must add to these memoirs a very interesting investiga
tion of the fauna of Terebratula janitor made in the environs of
Palermo by M. G. G. Gemellaro*. According to his researches,
the grey limestone of Monte Pellegrino contains, together with
several Ammonites characteristic of Stramberg, an abundant
fauna of Gasteropoda, among which are several of the Nerinace
of Inwald, and also Terebratula janitor associated with T. mora-
vica ! Before taking all the advantage of these facts that we may
hope from them, we must, however, wait for the author's final
conclusions.     It is not impossible, from some statements, that
he also may recognize two distinct stages in this deposit.
    Such are the principal facts with which we are at present ac
quainted, and upon which we can found our judgment.              I may be
permitted to point out that the question has become singularly
modified, and that I was not wrong when I called upon palaeonto
logists not to overstep the proofs furnished by the facts, and to
postpone a definitive solution.        I am still of the same opinion,
although the reasons for waiting have become less forcible, and
we are now much nearer the solution.

         the Limits of   the Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods.              331
   The following, it seems to me, is the mode in which we may
sum up the concordant portions of the documents above cited.
    Leaving on one side, for reasons already indicated, the stages
of Provence, Mont Saleve, and Wimmis*, and applying what
follows only to countries in which the Tithonian stage is well
developed, we find in ascending order: —
    1 . The fauna of Ammonites tenuilobatus ;
    2. The fauna of the Lower Tithonian, represented                especially
by Rogoznik, the blue marble of the Apennines, and                    probably
by the limestone with Terebratula diphya of the Tyrol               ;
    3. The fauna of the Upper Tithonian, or Stramberg               limestone
(Tereb. janitor);
    4. The Lower Neocomian          stage, and particularly the limestone
of Berrias (Tereb. diphyoides).
    Nos. 1 and 2 have dominant Jurassic characters; No. 3 is
rather cretaceous ; No. 4 has most of the normal characters of
the latter epoch.
    Those who seek for the line of separation between the two
great periods place it now between Nos. 2 and 3. The perforated
 Terebratula, then, give the following result : the Terebratula
with a small aperture (7'. diphya, Catultoi, &c.) belong to the
most recent Jurassic deposits ; the Terebratula with a large aper
ture (T. janitor and diphyoides) are Cretaceous.
    But this solution, which is apparently so simple, raises a great
question, almost identical with that which we indicated above.
 The four stages above cited are bound together by great palaeon-
tological analogies.         Several species incontestably         pass from
 No. 1    to No.  2, from   this to   No.  3, and   from   No.   3   to No. 4.
 Nos. 2 and 3 especially, which would be separated by the line of
 demarcation of the periods, have about one-third of their species
in common. This line would therefore be a very weak boundary,
and we should have to admit that in this Tithonian basin the
 separation of the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods was singularly
compromised.
    In the presence of such a result, so much opposed to generally
 received notions, we can only repeat what we have said in previous
works. Let us wait for fresh facts, and suspend all definitive
judgment until we become acquainted with new sections, and
new local faunas can be adduced to confirm or invalidate what
our present results seem to force upon our acceptance.
    We may especially hope soon to have a satisfactory description
   *
      These coralline limestones of Wimmis and Mont Saleve belong, as I
have already said, to the Upper Jurassic, and are in all probability the equi
valents of the Inferior Tithonian stage. A good palieontological investiga
tion is indispensable before we can appreciate their precise relations with
the Tithonian stage of the Voirons, of Chatel-Saint- Denis, &c.

332      M. F.  J. Pictet on the present state      of the question as to
of the fauna of Tereb. diphya of the Tyrol, and of that which
MM. de Verneuil and E. Favre have discovered in Andalusia.
Both these are of great importance, and may furnish some of the
elements that we require for the definitive solution.
    In the meanwhile I will conclude with a few theoretical reflec
tions on the manner in which we should receive and discuss these
unexpected facts.
   Every one who seeks to enrich natural history with new facts
labours more or less under the dominion of certain general and
theoretical data, which cause him to see but one end to be attained
and one course to follow.        Few, indeed, escape this influence,
which, it must   be admitted, is most frequently a necessary excitant.
But it is necessary to guard against the exaggerations of this
principle, so as to avoid the danger of subordinating the results
of direct observation to preconceived ideas. Allow me to call
your attention now to some of these rocks which are to be
shunned.
   For my own part, I am quite agreed with those who believe
that the development and the succession of organisms have always
been and still are under the empire of perfectly regular laws.
The function of science is to endeavour to discover these ; and
the further it advances the more brilliantly does this regularity
manifest itself.    I by no means take part with those who believe
in irregularity and disorder, and whose tendency is to seek for
apparent exceptions, the inanity of which is usually soon shown
by the progress of observation.
   But whilst taking this regularity as our basis, we must recog
nize the fact that the laws are much more complex than had been
supposed.      A few years ago we still believed in strongly marked
lines, in great catastrophes, and in the sudden succession of
faunas which had no material tie between them.                    We were
brought up    in these notions  ;  and   it  has required  all the teaching
of numerous facts to show us that the faunas must have become
modified more or less gradually, and with considerable slowness,
under the influence of varied circumstances, like those which
induce analogous effects in the existing seas.             Now these cir
cumstances are not identical      at all   times  and  in all places, which
renders the probability that things took place exactly in the
same manner in all geological basins infinitely small.             The his
tory  of the succession   of organisms       must   consequently be com
plex and modified by local     facts ;   it  is not probable that we shall
be able to formulate it in a very simple manner applicable to all
cases.
   In presence of the question which now engages us, I think it

         the Limits of the Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods.         333
necessary     to put prominently      forward some special points of
view.
    The first to which  I call attention relates to what is designated
in geology under the name of normal.         The earliest works which
threw a great light upon the classification of strata were prin
cipally produced in England and the north of France. In the
eyes of many naturalists the results obtained in the Anglo-
French basin constitute normal geology, or the normal succes
sion of the stages.      The geology of other countries, where not
strictly identical with this, only forms apparent exceptions which
 must be reduced to a signification in accordance with this nor
 mal state.     To these naturalists the classification of the strata
 in the Anglo-French basin is the Sacred Ark, and the interpre
 tation of facts observed outside of it should have for its object
 to make them fall within the frame of the picture.         In this we
 easily recognize the tendency of a celebrated school, the chief
 representative of which, under this point of view, was the
 learned and lamented D'Archiac.
     But why should the geologies of other countries not be
 equally normal ? and why should they not have an equal right
 to fix the great divisions in the palaeontological history of the
 globe ? We may here refer to an excellent uote by our learned
 colleague M. P. Merian*, who, with his accustomed uner
 ring scientific tact in placing his finger upon errors of me
 thod, has been so often able to give excellent advice to those
 geologists who have consulted him.          In this note M. Merian
 shows that if it had chanced that the first development of
 geology had taken place in other countries, the bases of the
 classification of formations would have been in part different.
 There is no reason whatever why a Table constructed under
 these conditions should be less normal than that of the Anglo-
 French basin.      In the case before us, in particular, we may
 say with certainty that if the first classifiers had commenced
  by the investigation of all that belt of land which is inclu
  ded between Galicia and the Mediterranean, passing through the
  Tyrol and the south-east of France, not one of them would
  have looked for the limits of one of the great periods in the
  neighbourhood of the Tithonian stage. The circumstance that
  the boundaries are very strongly marked in the Anglo-French
  basin does not imply of necessity that they are equally so in
  this other zone.   These two orders of facts are not necessarily
  connected.
     The second point of view upon which it is necessary to say
  a few words is with regard to the more or less complete inde-

334     On tlie Limits    of the Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods.
pendence of the stages.        So long as we were acquainted only with
the principal stages     characterized   by abundant faunas, we could
believe in their complete independence ; and this was certainly an
important general fact ; these successive well-defined faunas will
always remain the necessary guide for the teaching and justification
 of our classification.   But since many intermediate beds have been
studied and traced to great geographical distances, some transi
 tions have been met with.         Fossils supposed to be very charac
teristic, have in some places preceded the fauna with which they
principally lived, or have survived it a little.       We have had to
 learn that affairs have gone on as would have been the case in
 the existing seas in consequence of gradual modification in the
 nature of the bottom, the depth, and the temperature.         We have
 had to discover that, just     as in our seas,  the most marked  faunas
 are separated by intervals in which the species are more or less
 mixed.     Between the formations, as soon as they are known in
 all their details, there are analogous passages. Thus, taking for
 example the Cretaceous series, we know that whilst the principal
 formations were long regarded as characterized by perfectly special
 faunas, modern discoveries, while remarkably increasing the num
 ber of substages, have rendered most of the boundaries less defi
 nite than was supposed.        The Valangian stage has many species
 in common with the Neocomian, and the latter with the Lower
  Urgonian. The Upper Urgonian has a part of the palaeontologi-
 cal characters of the Lower Aptian.             The Upper Aptian has
 sorne of those of the Gault.        The Upper Gault, or Uraconian,
 has come in to diminish the differences which distinguished the
 Gault from the Cenomanian stage, &c.
     I do not wish to exaggerate these facts, the importance of
 which is not sufficient to veil the existence of certain fauuas re
 cognized by every body ; but they teach us that the stages can no
 longer be characterized by one or two isolated fossils, but only by
 the totality of the fauna.
     May not what we have just said with regard to the stages
 into which the great formations are divisible, also apply to these
 formations themselves ? What is the philosophical argument
 that leads us to regard these limits between the great forma
  tions as more strongly marked than others ? Limits are inven
 tions of science and useful as landmarks ; but who has told us
 that there is an insuperable barrier between the last Jurassic and
 the first Cretaceous stage ? Why should this barrier be so clear
 in the Anglo-French basin and not throughout ? We should be
 a good deal embarrassed to furnish a priori a plausible reason for
 this.
     Here again     we  are in accord with      M. Merian's note.    Our

      Prof.     J.   C. Draper   on an Improvement in       Filtration.              335
learned colleague remarks with reason that a multitude of recent
discoveries tend to render these limits obscure.    Recent investi
gations   establish passages between  the  Devonian and the Carbo
niferous.     The Rhaetic stage has filled up a part of the hiatus
between the Trias and the Lias.      The freshwater deposits lately
discovered by M. Matheron strengthen the bond between the
Cretaceous     and Tertiary periods.      The later Tertiaries can
hardly be distinguished from the older Quaternary. Why should
not the Tithonian stage in its turn diminish the value of the se
paration between the most recent Jurassic and the Lower Cre-
    We think, therefore,  that in this important question it is
more than ever desirable not to oppose to the facts which are
being collected nowadays a determination      not to accept them,
founded upon a supposed impossibility.     We must subordinate
the teachings of the schools to those of well-observed facts, and,
without choosing to throw ourselves with break-neck impetuo
sity into the course of a revolution, we must remain impartial
in the investigation of the facts which will perhaps force us to
accept it.   I will only add that prudence commands us to be
strict in their appreciation.

XLVII.      Note  on the Temperature and Heating-powers         of Flames.
                         By W. M. Watts, D.Sc.*
rTMIE April        Number of the Philosophical Magazine contains
  *-     a paper by     Messrs. Silliman and Wurtz on the tempera
tures of flames, in which certain conclusions on some practical
points of importance are stated.
   The following numbers are correctly given as representing the
amounts of heat evolved by the complete combustion of equal
volumes of the following gases : —
                   Hydrogen                         34462
                   Carbonic oxide                   33612
                                     ...

                   defiant gas                  .  166012
   But the conclusion that the heating-power of olefiant gas is
greater than that of an equal volume of hydrogen is condemned
as erroneous, and the authors give as the result of their investi
           " that the powers of the flames of
gations                                               pure hydrogen and
pure olefiant gas, even when used to the Greatest advantage to
heat water below its boiling-point, are almost or quite identical."
   There seems to be throughout the paper a confusion between
the heating-power of a gas and the temperature of its flame in air.
    It is quite true that, because the specific heat of steam, which
is one of the products of combustion of olefiant gas, is greater
than the specific heat of carbonic anhydride (the only product
of combustion of carbonic oxide), the calculated flame-tempera
ture of the latter gas is higher than that of the former ; but, for
the very same reason, if these gaseous products of combustion
expend their heat in raising the temperature of water, the great
est effect will be produced by the olefiant gas, although the tem
perature of its flame is not so high as that of the flame of car
bonic oxide.      If  the gases give up the whole of their heat to the
water, it is obvious that the calorific effects must be precisely in
the ratio of the numbers already quoted ; and even if they escape
at a temperature considerably above 0° C, their relative effects
will be nearly the same.        If   we suppose the products of com
bustion to have a temperature of 200° C. when they escape, the
following quantities of heat will still be available by the combus
tion of equal volumes of carbonic oxide and olefiant gas : —
                                         ....

numbers 33642 and 166012. We conclude, therefore, that the
numbers quoted on p. 292, in which, according to Messrs. Silli-
man and Wurtz, " several most grave errors are involved," do,
in reality, strictly represent the heating-effects of the different
gases when employed to the greatest advantage in heating water
below 100° C.
   The omission of the correction for the latent heat of steam in
Bunscn's original calculation of the temperature of the hydrogen-
flame has been already pointed out by Dibbits*.
   In the calculation of the temperature of the hydrogen-flame
given in this paper (p. 294) there is also an error in assigning to
liquid water the specific heat 0-4805 instead of 1 : the formula
should be
               *~ 34462-9(637-4805) =6743                     C-
                              *3245
   Another of the conclusions arrived at in this paper is erro
neous, viz.  "That, of all known gases, the highest calorific effects t,
under ordinary atmospheric conditions, are obtainable from car
bonic oxide, whose calorific value, above 100°C.,is about 3000°C."
   The flame of cyanogen is hotter than that of carbonic oxide —
the calculated temperature of the flame of cyanogen in air being
3519° C, and in oxygen no less than 10557° C. It must be
remembered, however, that these results of calculation in no way
express the actual flame-temperatures.            The calculated tempera
ture of the oxyhydrogen-flame is 6743° C. ; but the experiments
            J
of Deville and Bunsen § agree in fixing between 2500° C. and
2800° C. The following are the calculated and experimental
flame-temperatures      of certain gases. It will be seen that the
flame of cyanogen is shown by experiment also to have the high

XLVIII.        Note  on the  Atomic Volume of Solid Substances.        By
    James Dewar, F.R.S.E., Chemical Demonstrator in               the Uni
    versity, Lecturer on Chemistry, Veterinary College, Edinburgh*.
            investigation of the volume retained by different elemen
THE     tary substances, when combined in the solid condition, has
attracted the attention of many chemists. We have only to look
at the laborious memoirs of Schroter, Kopp, Play fair and Joule,
Boullay, Filhol, and others, to be convinced of the great amount
of labour expended on the subject.            Nor is it at all remarkable
that so many workers should take to this held of research,
when we remember the simplicity of the laws regulating the
combining volumes of gaseous substances, and the probable
extension of some such similar law to the solid condition of
matter.       Emboldened by analogy, the forementioned workers
endeavoured to find some constant to which volumes of ele
ments and compounds held the relation of some simple multi
ple, and thus extend the apparent simplicity of Prout's law of
combining weights to combining volumes.               The great object in
view was evidently to extend the speculations and laws of l)alton
and Gay-Lussac to the volumes of solid substances, and thus to
arrive at some general explanation of the results.                However
 creditable the desire to reveal simplicity out of the apparent
 chaos, no one, in examining the subject, can help arriving
 at the conclusion that the means employed to extract the seem
 ing harmony from the results were purely arbitrary. It does
 not follow, however, that the results were fruitless, although no
 great generalization was discovered.           The solid state of matter
 is relatively far more complicated than either the liquid or
 gaseous condition.         The uniformity of expansion of gaseous
 matter, and the easy comparison of liquid substances under
 similar conditions, enable us to arrive at some satisfactory con
 clusions regarding the volume in these states : but in examin
 ing solid matter, we have no guarantee that the substances are
  under similar physical conditions ; we cannot, therefore, ex
  pect the same uniformity in the results.          But although, strictly
 speaking,     we  may   entertain   grave doubt   on the real value of the
 results, yet    in  some   cases    we  cannot   help recognizing some
  curious analogies, especially on comparing similar classes of
  compounds.        It is not the object of this note either to criticise
  or discuss the labours and speculations of others, no originality
  being claimed in the subject matter itself, all that is original
  being merely the addition of a few new analogies.
      The first important discovery in the subject of atomic volumes
  was made by Schroter. He observed that the equivalent volume

340               Mr.    J. Dewar     on the  Atomic Volume
free state from the volume of the oxide, gave, approximately, the
same value of 5'2 in the oxides of copper, zinc, cadmium, lead,
mercury, iron, cobalt, and titanium.                    In other words, the
oxygen occupied         the  same    volume   in   each  combination.        Other
classes of oxides gave a volume of twice or half the above
 number.        In order to arrive at the volume of the oxygen,
 Schroter started with the premises that the metal in the com
 bined state occupied the same volume as the uncombined metal.
 Granting, for the present, that oxygen has a definite volume in
 combination in the oxides, it is clear that the volume obtained
 by difference will vary with the volume of the combined metal.
 The same method applied to the oxides of the less dense metals
 would give a negative volume to the oxygen ; and in these cases
 we must admit condensation to have taken place in the metal
 itself.     We may have three cases, therefore, according as the vo
 lume of the combined metal differs or not from that of the un
 combined.        If it remains the same in combination, we obtain the
 real volume ; if it condenses, the volume is a minimum ; if it
 expands, a maximum.                Seeing that the oxygen in the dense
  metals has the volume 5'2, we may regard the greater or
  smaller volume obtained from some oxides as the result of con
  densation or expansion of the metal.                   Supposing the above
  volume (5 2) to exist generally in the oxides, we should have a
  condensation in the less dense metals in combination, approach
  ing very nearly, in the case of potassium, sodium, and alumi
  nium, to one-third, and in calcium, magnesium, and strontium,
  to nearly one-half, of the volume in the free state.                  Thus far,
  then, this number would give a rough explanation in admitting
  condensation in many of the metals.
      I  have thought that it would be interesting to compare this
   volume with the volume of oxygen when it is combined with
  solid substances other than metallic, and to take a series of
  analogous combinations.             For this purpose the chlorine family
   are well fitted in their respective combinations with potassium, and
  these with oxygen.            The following Table contains the best
   known density determinations and volumes of chloride, bro
   mide, and iodide of potassium, compared with the densities of
   chlorate, bromate, and iodate.

The total volume of the oxygen in chlorate of potash, on the
supposition that the chloride of potassium retains its original
volume in combination, is 15 ; whereas it is only 7 in bromate of
potash, if we allow that the bromide of potassium retains its
original volume; and it appears to occupy no volume in iodate of
potash, assuming that iodide of potassium maintains its original
volume.            The apparent disappearance of the volume of the
oxygen,        in   changing iodide of potassium into iodate, is ana
logous        to  the    apparent loss of volume of many salts in their
water of hydration, the salt occupying the volume of the crystal
water taken as ice, as pointed out many years ago by Playfair
 and Joule.             It is clear that, in assuming that the halogen
 compounds           of  potassium retain their primitive volume in their
 oxidized derivatives, we place these compound substances in
 the same position as the metals in the simple oxides.                              Now,
we saw that in many oxides the volume of the oxygen varied,
 and that, in all probability, from metallic condensation taking
 place during the act of combination.                       The metals having the
 lowest density and the greatest atomic volume condense the
 most in combining.                 Generally speaking, if we examine the
 volumes of the halogen salts in the above Table, it is clear that
 the equivalent volumes increase, chloride of potassium being 37,
 bromide 44, and iodide 55*3, and their relative stability dimi
 nishes.         The equivalent volumes of chlorine, bromine, and
  iodine are identical in the liquid state ; and thus the formation
 of the respective potassium compounds is one of the results of
  unequal condensation, the coefficient of contraction in the for
  mation of chloride of potassium being 0-46, bromide 0-29, iodide
  0-23 per unit volume.                  Their formation is attended with the
  evolution of very different amounts of heat.                            The following

      Generally speaking, the             number found for bromide of potas
   sium is nearly the mean of             those attached to chloride and iodide.
   A similar observation has              recently been made by M. Valsen in
   examining the equivalent                capillary constants of these bodies.

342             Mr. J.  Dewar   on the   Atomic Volume
Looking at the atomic thermal number, there is a far greater
likelihood of condensation taking place in the bromide and iodide
of potassium in the combined state than in the case of the
chloride, seeing that it would be relatively far more difficult to
condense.      But neither the chlorate, bromate, nor iodatecan be
produced through the direct addition of oxygen to the respective
halogen salt.     And the chlorate, it is well known, evolves heat
on giving off its oxygen, and thus necessitates an absorption of
heat during combination.        It is just possible that the heat pro
duced during the decomposition is the result of the necessary ex
pansion of volume in the chloride of potassium in combining
 with oxygen, and its return to its normal volume on losing it.
 It makes no change in volume to suppose that, in the one case,
the oxygen is added as a whole to the chloride of potassium, or,
 in the other, that it is between the potassium and chlorine, each
 occupying its individual volume unchanged ; but it would alter
 greatly the heat evolved in so doing.       If oxygen combined with
 chloride of potassium as a whole, without any condensation
 taking place, the natural result would be an evolution of heat.
 But if the addition of the oxygen diminishes the coefficient of
 contraction, as compared with that of the free compound, then
 we have a physical explanation of the evolution of heat on de
 composition.     In this case the actual work performed by the
 condensation of oxygen is retained in a potential form, and
 therefore reappears as heat on its decomposition.          If, now, we
  examine the mode in which the oxygen is attached to the respec
  tive halogen compounds, we can trace, as a necessary consequence,
  the retention of varying amounts of energy.        Chlorate, bromate,
  and iodate of potash are formed by a similar chemical reaction,
  according to the following formula of exchange, given in equiva
  lents, the whole reaction supposed to take place in the presence
 of water : —
             6KO     +     6C1    =      5KC1     +    KCIO6
           6(76238)                    5(97086)
             6KO     +     6 Br   =     5KBr       +   KBrO6
           6(76238)                    5(85666)
             6KO     +     61     =     5KI       +    KI  O6
           6(76238)                    5(72721)
      We have appended the thermal equivalents attending the for
   mation of these bodies in a large volume of water.          It will be
   obvious on comparing the formation of chlorate of potash,
   through the above reaction, that it may be the result of absorp
   tion of heat; whereas it is certain that the formation of iodate
   of potash must be attended with an evolution of heat, or else

                          of Solid Substances.                    313
cold must be the result of their action.    In special experiments,
made with the object of determining the thermal action, neither
absorption nor evolution of heat could be detected.       Thus the
formation of iodate of potash is attended with an evolution of
heat.    This would then accord with the easy transformation of
the chlorates into iodates, or of chloric acid into iodic acid, and
the easy transformation of the iodide of potassium into the iodate,
through the action of permanganate of potash, seeing that we
must have an evolution of heat. The oxygen, therefore, may be
assumed to be in a very different condition relatively to the other
elements ; or else we must suppose that it has not affected the
coefficient of contraction, certainly not to have diminished it.
The author throws out this simply as a possible explanation ;
he is well aware that many other explanations might be given,
all possibly equally satisfactory.       But a physical explanation,
however far it may lie from the truth, seems to convey to us the
clearest ideas of what may possibly take place.
   There is one point connected with the subject of volumes that
requires very careful attention.      All bodies in combining do not
unite with condensation ; that       is,
                                       the volume of the compound
might   exceed  the volumes   of the isolated constituents;  and yet a
large evolution of heat might take place during its formation.      A
well-known example     is that of iodide of silver.    Now M. Fizeau
has shown that iodide of silver contracts regularly with increase
of temperature, and M. Ste. -Claire Deville has given an explana
tion of this anomaly.      Deville believes that bodies combine at
such a   temperature as would be required to transform the volume
of the compound to that of the sum of the volumes of its con
stituents in the free state.     Applying this to iodide of silver,  it
is clear that contraction must take place, and in all similar cases
where we have an increase of volume.          One cannot help associa
ting this increase of volume with    a purely physical change of state,
such as the change of water with expansion into ice.          Now, as
Sir William Thomson has proven that pressure lowers the freez
ing-point of water, and Mousson has actually liquefied ice bv
 enormous pressure,  if  the formation of      chemical compound
                                                                     by is
                                            a
 analogous to  a  physical change of state, we ought to be able
mere pressure to decompose       chemical compound,
                                 a                      the forma
                                                        if
tion of that compound       attended
                            is        with an  increase of volume.
No doubt, in order to get experimental proof of this fact, we
must use   a  relatively weak chemical compound, one attended
with the evolution of no great amount of heat and the well-
                                                    ;
known experiments of Joule on the effect of pressure on amal
gams seems to confirm this anticipation.     Joule has shown that
the amalgams of zinc, lead, and tin are decomposed         by
                                                           pressure

traction of any.    In order to get definite proof of the expansion,
it     of course, necessary to use the specific gravity of mercury
     is,
in the solid state. Now, Joule states, as the mean of his experi
ments, that mercury in the solid form has the specific gravity
15*19, whereas in the above amalgams         would have the density
                                                         it
of only 14*1. The observations of Matthiessen on the specific
gravity of alloys enables us to confirm Joule's results —                        :

The specific gravity of the mercury used in calculating the mean
density was 13573.         Now, seeing that there      little or no con
                                                                    is

                                            a
above specific gravity of mercury, the higher density of mercury
given       Joule as the result of his experiments would necessarily
           by
lead to an expansion in their formation.        To illustrate the effect
of pressure on the composition of an amalgam, let us take Joule's
experiments on the tin-amalgam.         The composition of this amal
gam   was   100   of  mercury  to 51-01  of tin, and the specific gra
vity 10-518. The effect of 5400 lbs. pressure for thirty days
changed the amalgam, so that          had ultimately the composition
                                            it
100 of mercury to 384 of tin. It          natural to believe, therefore,
                                                  is
that the effect of pressure in this case       quite analogous to the
                                                         is

                                            a
ging its state has been subjected to its influence.
    In the early part of this paper we saw that the volume of
oxygen         some oxides, instead of being 5*2, was sometimes
                in
 double this amount, or even more.             has also been remarked
                                                        It
that   ifthe metal in combining were to expand, the volume of the
oxygen would appear as            maximum.
                                     a          This apparently large
volume of the oxygen seems to belong to suboxides, such as sub
 oxides of mercury and copper, and oxide of silver.           If we sup
pose, now, that this large increase of volume         the oxygen    inthe            is
result of an expansion in the metal in combining with the normal
 oxide,    it possible that mere pressure would decompose these
                is
 oxides, at least in part, into metal and the higher oxide.          The
 instability of body of this type, such as suboxide of mercury,
                       a
is  well known, mere trituration effecting the liberation of metal
 with formation of the higher oxide.       In this way, therefore,                        it
 seems to support the argument adduced.

XLIX.     Note  on Inverted Sugar.    By James Dewar, F.R.S.E.,
    Chemical Demonstrator in the University, Lecturer on Chemistry,
    Veterinary College, Edinburgh*.
          some time past an animated discussion has been going
FOR on       in the columns of the Comptes Rendus de I'AcadSmie
des Sciences between MM. Dubranfaut and Maumene regarding
the nature of inverted sugar.      M. Dubranfaut, many years ago,
made many valuable additions to our knowledge concerning the
composition and reactions of various sugars, especially in explain
ing the result of the action of dilute acids on cane-sugar.        He
explained the laevo-rotatory action of inverted sugar, and its ra
pidly varying power with the temperature, as the result of a
molecule of water in reacting with a molecule of cane-sugar, ge
nerating one molecule of glucose and one of laevulose.       Dubran
faut believed that inverted sugar consisted of a mixture of glucose
and laevulose in equal weights ; and although he did not make a
direct analysis of the product, yet he was justly entitled to assume
that it was so constituted, seeing that generally it agreed with a
mean of the properties of inulin sugar and dextrose.
    In order to support the above view, he separated laevo-glucose
from the inverted sugar, through the insolubility of the lime
compound, and compared its properties with pure laevulose.        The
decomposition would, according to Dubranfaut, be as follows : —
            Ci* HM   O" + H4 0 =CS H« 06+ C6 H,406
               + 73-8               +56            -106
                                         (-25)
    So thoroughly had his facts and explanations been accepted
by chemists generally, that, up to a recent date, no one disco
vered any flaw in his researches, and therefore no doubt was
thrown on the validity of thist heory.       Recently Maumene has
 reinvestigated   the composition of inverted sugar by analysis.
 He has attempted to separate the two sugars through the action
 of chloride of sodium.      The dextro-glucose forms a well-defined
 crystalline compound with chloride of sodium, whereas the lae
 vulose does not form any compound.          The results obtained by
 this method differ greatly from theory.       Instead of finding 50
 per  cent. of laevulose, he  found 88  per  cent.   In repeating the
 experiments of Dubranfaut on the separation of laevo-glucose by
 hydrate of lime, he has not met with any better results ; in fact
 his results are quite opposed to those of Dubranfaut.

the views entertained by the different parties to this discussion,
the author has thought some observations on the same subject
might not be unworthy of notice at the present time.
   Linneman, many years ago, applied the process of hydrogena-
tion to the sugars that had been found so successful in treating
the simpler organic substances.    In this way he obtained man-
nite from inverted sugar, the following reaction taking place : —
                   C6       Hls06 + H, = C6Hi4            O6.
Mannite had long been known to be the product of certain kinds
of fermentation, and to occur as a secondary product in the
vinous fermentation ; but it was this elegant synthesis of Linne
man that first clearly showed the connexion.        But although
inverted sugar can be changed into mannite, the next point that
demands a solution            is,
                           supposing the inverted sugar to be
composed of equal quantities of dextrose and lsevulose, are they
both transformed    by
                     hydrogenation into mannite      or    only one?       is
of them, and which        Linneman seems to have directed his
                            ?
attention to the solution of this question.    He states that                       it   is
only the laevulose that       so affected.
                                    is       The reason why he
entertains the above view       not given.
                                         is   In all likelihood he
thought that, just as Berthelot had changed mannite           pecu         by   a
liar fermentation into laevo-glucose, so would the laevo-glucose in
inverted sugar be hydrogenized into mannite.
   In repeating the action of sodium-amalgam on inverted sugar,
I  have not seen any reason why the one sugar any more than the
other should be supposed to generate the mannite.         The follow
ing    is
        a description of the mode       which   by
                                               the sugar was inverted
and hydrogenized   :  — 20 grms. of cane-sugar were dissolved in
 150grms. of water, and inverted through the action of          grms.           2
of sulphuric acid, keeping the solution at the temperature of
70° C, afterwards adding pure carbonate of barium, filtering,
 and then adding 12 grms. of sodium in the form of weak amal           a
gam.     The action took place without any evolution of hydrogen.
 If the amalgam was impure, from the presence of other metals,
it  evolved hydrogen at once, and the solution became brown                              ;
otherwise   it remained perfectly clear.     After one month the so
lution gave no trace of sugar with the alkaline copper solution.
It  was then carefully neutralized with dilute sulphuric acid, eva
porated on the water-bath, the greater part of the sulphate of
 sodium separated      by
                        crystallization, and the residue treated with
boiling 70-per-cent. alcohol, the solution filtered and allowed to
crystallize.    Sometimes the mannite did not crystallize until all
the alcohol had evaporated, leaving       syrup that slowly assumed
                                                     a
the crystalline form.     The product had no rotatory power.        In
no case was the sugar entirely changed into mannite           gummy    ;   a

substance was invariably left, that would not crystallize after ex
posure to the air for months.    Mannitan, or some similar body,
may be one of the products.
   Dextro-glucose made from honey gave mannite when treated
in the same way, having exactly the same melting-point as ordi
nary mannite.    In treating milk-sugar with dilute sulphuric acid,
changing into gallactose and hydrogenizing, dulcite was not iso
lated ; but       I
              have not specially studied the reaction.
L. On       the       Theory    of the Variation of Temperature in Gases
  in     consequence     of     Changes in their Density and Pressure. By
     the Rev.     J.   M. Heath*.
IF   v is the volume of a unit of weight of a gas, p its pressure,
     and t its temperature, then the equation of Mariotte and
Gay-Lussac may be thus written : — pv — k{\ +at), or = A + B/,
and its differential rf(pt') = Brf/.  From these equations we learn
that every change in the temperature of the gas must cause, or
be caused by, a corresponding change in the magnitude^ which
depends upon p and v only.
    Now d(pv) = pdv + vdp, which is therefore equal to Tidt.
But the theory which has been propounded for the last twenty-
five years, and is all but universally received as established
beyond all doubt, is that one of these two terms only, viz. pdv,
is alone connected, whether as cause or as effect, with variation
in the temperature.        It is held that whenever the gas, being
under the pressure p, is expanded or contracted by the quantity
 dv, there is a certain loss or gain in the quantity of heat, and a
corresponding variation, therefore, in the temperature.
    This doctrine is reconcilable with the older one only so long
 as the causes which they respectively assign for the same effect,
viz. a variation of temperature, are the same — that              so long is,
as pdv  =  d[pv)   But d(pv) =pdv + vdp. This identity can there

tion of temperature, which was that which was due solely to the
remainder of the heat after this portion had been separated
from it.
    It appears, therefore, that a conclusion, legitimately deduced
from a certain experiment, has been too hastily generalized, and
is now enunciated as true in all cases, beyond the limitations
which, though not observed, were nevertheless present at, and
controlled the results of the original experiment.          It is true that
 as often as gas is condensed or rarefied under an invariable pres
sure, there will be a change of temperature representing a gain
 or loss of heat proportionate to pdv. But when the pressure is not
 constant, the variation of temperature will be proportional to
 d(pv), and not to pdv.         d(pv) may be nothing; pdv may be
 = —vdp. In that case there is no variation of temperature;
 and in all cases where d(pv) has any value different from nothing
 and different from pdv, there will be a change of temperature
 which does not represent a quantity of heat proportional to pdv .
     In a short paper upon this subject, published in the April
 Number of this Magazine, I attempted to represent the same
 argument (adopting the language and conceptions of the new
 philosophy itself) as I am now urging in the older and more
 generally familiar modes of expression.         I believe that pv is the
 true expression for the maximum internal potential energy, vdp
 is the    elementary potential energy expended, and pdv is the
 elementary work done.         So long as pdv + vdp =0, the internal
 forces, or potential energy, do all the internal work that is
 done, and no other, and d(pv) or Bcfr=0, and there is no change
 of temperature.       When pdv + vdp has a value, positive or nega
 tive, i. e. when pdv is > or < vdp, then, and then only, is the
 temperature affected.

       RGANIC      chemihtry, once the neglected sister of the maturer
          inorganic chemistry, has become so honoured and courted
  since Liebig introduced her as a young science into the chemical
  world, that her relative has gradually been thrown into the shade.
  But now we are beginning to see that inorganic chemistry is not
  deserving of this neglect, but that in her lap she hides a store
  of undiscovered treasure — the promised reward of those who
  cherish her.

   The lively interest excited by the discovery of isomorphism is
now succeeded by an ardent zeal in searching out the origin of
the numberless instances of isomerism in organic compounds.
Hitherto isomeric compounds have scarcely been observed in
inorganic chemistry, much less in mineral chemistry.       This may
be owing partly to the simpler constitution of inorganic com
pounds, in consequence of which isomerism is not possible to
the same extent as in organic chemistry, and partly to the fact
that until now we have altogether neglected to study inorganic
substances with respect to their chemical constitution.
   The truth of the latter assertion becomes at once evident when
 we attempt to frame a reply to any inquiry respecting the consti
tution of the naturally occurring silicates — felspar for example-
 such as what are the proximate constituents of these compounds,
 and what are their several functions.     Let us see the extent of
 our knowledge in this direction.
    Berzelius regarded felspar as built up according to the formula
 Al*Os3Si03 + KOSi08 (old atomic weights), viewing it as a
 double salt of neutral silicate of alumina and silicate of potash,
analogous to dehydrated alum.
   Such a comparison is no longer applicable, since as the atomic
weight of oxygen is now doubled, and silicon is regarded as a
tetratomic element, the molecule of felspar contains three atoms
               Felspar    ....
of silicon, whilst that of alum possesses only two of sulphur.
               Alum (dehydrated).

   Afterwards, when Gerhardt* declared that all investigations
designed   to elucidate chemical constitution could only end in
disappointment, thinking that he had rendered such investiga
tions superfluous by his theory of types (that           is,   by
                                                         the mere
mechanical use of   a  soulless schematism), felspar became water
in which the atoms of hydrogen were substituted            silicon, by
aluminium, and potassium, and its constitution was expressed
 by the formula
                       si<n         sin

 These expressions possess nothing beyond the signification of             a
 sum in addition over the purely empirical formulae Si6 Al4 Ks Oi6,
 or Si3 Al K   O8
                ;   that  isto say, they simply indicate that the sum
 of the affinities of the atoms of silicon, aluminium, and potassium
 present in felspar  is  equivalent to that of 32 or of 16 atoms, as

the case may be, of hydrogen.    Nothing whatever is signified
with respect to the proximate constituents of felspar.
   But how may we consider the elements in felspar to be united
to proximate constituents? and how again may these be supposed
to be combined among themselves?        The cases possible are

in the case of potassium dichromate.
   Thus, when two atoms of the divalent radical of chromic acid,
CrO4, are so combined with an atom of oxygen that its affinities
are divided between them, we obtain the divalent acid radical

signed with this object will furnish such data, and that in the

                  is
reduced to the geodesic angles.          Still the difference      so very      is
small for such triangles as are formed                 by

to conclude that geodesic lines have no necessary place in geo

over which triangulations are being carried, make the considera

               Geodesic   Lines on the    Earth's Surface.          353
gress is to be made in the investigation of the figure of the earth,
certainly no "small quantities" may be set aside without at least
a distinct idea of their magnitude and ultimate effect.         For in
stance, the course of the geodesic line joining two points on a
spheroid of small excentricity is probably not investigated in any
English work, and it is therefore not unnecessary to inquire how
far this line departs from any of the plane curves joining its ex
tremities.
    Although the observed angles of a triangulation are not geo
desic angles, yet in the calculation of the distance and reciprocal
bearings of two points far apart and connected by a long chain
of triaugles we may fall upon the geodesic line in this way : — If
A, Z be the points, then to start the calculation from A we get
by some preliminary calculation the approximate azimuth of Z
at A, or the angle made by the direction of Z with either of the
sides A B, A C of the first triangle.        Let Pi be the point where
this line or direction intersects B C ; then to find Ps, where the
line cuts the next triangle-side C D, we make the angle B P, P4
such that B P, P4+ B P, A= 180°. This fixes P4 ; and P8 is fixed
by a repetition of the same process ; so for P4, P6, . . . Now it is
clear that the points P„ P4, Pg, . . . so computed are those which
would be actually fixed by an observer with a theodolite, proceed
ing in the following manner.          Having set the instrument up at
A and turned      the   telescope in   the direction of the computed
bearing, an assistant places a mark P, on the line B C, adjusting
it until it is bisected by the cross hairs of the telescope fixed at
A. The theodolite is then removed from A, placed over the
mark Pi, and the telescope turned to A ; the horizontal circle, or
merely the telescope itself on its axis, is then turned through
180° and the instrument clamped.            The assistant then places a
mark P2 on the line C D so as to be bisected by the cross hairs
of the telescope, which is then removed to Ps ; and in the same
 manner is P3 fixed.       Now it is clear that the string of points P
 approximates to the geodesic line ; for the plane of any two con
secutive elements P„_, P„, P»Pn+, contains the normal at the
common point P„.
    With the exception of the greater part of Norway, Sweden,
 and Turkey, the whole of Europe may be considered to be co-.
 vered with chains of triangulation binding its countries together.
 From the north-western extremity of the Hebrides to Dunkirk in
 France there is a strong connexion by ihe British triangulation ;
 this line may be continued through France to Berne, and by a
 triangulation, possibly not quite complete, through Switzerland
 and Italy to Corfu and Palermo.           Again, a line may be drawn
 from   Cadiz  to  St. Petersburg   :  if the necessary triangulation is
 not quite complete, it will doubtless be so before many years

European     arc of  parallel between Valentia and Orsk runs along

course.

    It would be difficult to make the subject we are going to con
sider intelligible without going to the root of the matter.   There
fore, at the risk of being tedious, we propose to investigate, in
the briefest possible manner, the leading characteristics of the
geodesic curve.       If we suppose the position of a point on an
ellipsoid of revolution to be determined by its distance f, mea
sured from one of the poles along the curve of a meridian, and
by its longitude co, then, r being the distance of the point from
the axis of revolution, the length of a curve traced on the sur
face is
If this  length is to be a minimum between the given extremities,
we shall most quickly arrive at the distinctive character of the
curve by giving a variation 8co, a function of £ to a>.     Thus
and consequently      for the minimum,
    To fix our ideas, let longitude be measured positively from
west to east, and azimuths from north through east, back to
north. Let a be the azimuth of the element ds of the curve,
then
                             ds cos ol= — d£,
                             dssina = rd(o;
and the latter of these, substituted in the characteristic  of mini
mum, gives
                             r sin a—C.
Now,    if u be what is sometimes called in treatises on the conic
sections the eccentric angle, or the reduced latitude, r=a cos «,
a being the major semiaxes of the spheroid; and if «(a( be the
values of u a at the initial point A,

    It is interesting to consider the case of geodesic lines starting
from a point on a spheroid of small excentricity and diverging
in all directions.     First, to confine our attention to a single line,
it is well known, and may be readily inferred from the auxiliary
spherical triangle, that a geodesic touches alternately two paral
lels equidistant from the poles — the difference of longitude be
tween the successive points of contact being constant and some
thing less than 180°, depending on the angle at which it cuts
the equator.      Now suppose a line starting from (for simplicity)
 a point on the equator with the azimuth a; the osculating plane
 at that point cuts the equator again at the opposite point N. As
 a point P moves along the geodesic towards N, the angle cr of
 the auxiliary spherical triangle increases from 0 ; and when it
 becomes ir, then <r also becomes =7r, and P has reached the
 equator, its longitude being, by (2), tr— ^e2ir sin a. Since in (12)
 H is negative for all values of a from 0 to 7r, the geodesic lies
 wholly on the south side of the osculating plane at the initial
 point ; and its distance south, when a = ir and P is on the equator,
 is ^escos«7r.     "We infer from this that all geodesies proceeding
 from the same point on the equator have an approximately equal
 length \ 7re* (about 36' in the case of the earth) intercepted be
  tween the meridian through N and the equator.               Consequently
  the ultimate intersections of the geodesies will form an envelope
 like the evolute of an ellipse, or the hypocycloid x§ + y$=k%, N
  being the centre of the curve.          (Mr. Cayley informs me that this
  property of geodesies      is referred   to in some remarks in Jacobi's
   Vorlesungen iiber Dynamik, Berlin, 1866, which, however, I
  have not seen.    It is noticed that if geodesic lines, starting from
  a given point, intersect so as to form an envelope, then each line
  is a shortest line only up to its point of contact with the envelope
  and no further.)       If the lines diverge from a point not on the
  equator, the diameter of the envelope will vary as cos4 «.

  the curve of intersection formed by the plane containing the
  normal at Cadiz, we shall compute the meridional distances of
  points P on the geodesic from corresponding points Q on the
  plane curve. We take approximate latitudes and longitudes for
  the terminal points.

    It appears from this that, at the middle point of the geodesic,
 the length of meridian intercepted between it and the plane
curve is upwards of 600 feet. With respect to the azimuths of
the geodesic at its extremities, they differ, as we find by equation
 (13), from the azimuths of the vertical planes by 20"'37 at Cadiz
and 12""71 at St. Petersburg.               How such quantities should be
dealt with in practical geodesy is a question foreign to the object
of this investigation, which is merely to ascertain what sort of
magnitudes we have to deal with in the divergence of the geodesic
from plane curves.

taken from a common map of India, are 25° 0' and 22° 30' re

    Also the differences of the azimuths of the geodesic from those
of the vertical planes are — at Kurrachee 2" 04, and at Calcutta

the line being nearly perpendicular to the meridian.

   Bessel, in one of his papers in the Astronomische Nachrichten,
gives, but without demonstration,     an expression for the differ

In case of the accident of a misprint, it is worth while to verify
it. Q being a point on the (southern) plane curve at a distance
aSu south of P on the geodesic, if we draw an arc of parallel
through P meeting the plane curve in the point R east of P, we
have PR = a8« tan a; the difference of longitude of R and P is
therefore

                                                                                      I
   not seen        noticed.      The comparative light of Algol when
full and when eclipsed enables us to compute the relative size of
Algol and its satellite. The light varies from 25 to                about;           9,
and the disks are therefore as 25 to 16, and the diameters as                                       5
to 4. Knowing the time of eclipsing, we can easily compute the
distance, which on this scale        27. Hence, knowing the periodic
                                           is
time, the mean density          found to be one-fifth that of the sun.
                                  is
This result     probable, as Algol
                is                       unquestionably brighter than
                                                 is
our sun, which would be the case naturally            Algol be less cooled

down or condensed.         The gigantic size of the satellite         thus                is
easily explicable.     Both      and  Algol
                                     it       must    undergo  much   con
densation before they arrive at the condition of our system.
    The constant diminution of the period also naturally results
from the hypothesis.        With such        low density for Algol, and
                                                      a
such    alarge satellite, the  density  of the  latter must be very low.

without impressing on any part any sensible rotation.               It fol
lows naturally, then, from Goodricke's theory, that the period
should be diminished, as the light medium must produce some
effect on so rare and rapid a body.
    Yet the diminution of period is very small.            It amounts to
about one second in twelve years at most.               This gives in one
revolution a diminution of about , - - - } „ „ - - of the whole. Now
                                      on O 0 0 OOOO
for Encke's comet there is a diminution of ~r-—     1 ] ooo
                                                             of the period
                                                                     r
in one revolution.     Of course the circumstances are very different;
but allowance being roughly made for them, the comet appears
to suffer most.      This is probably due partly to the less density
 of the comet, partly to the fact that the light medium is not the
only resister of the comet. Whatever interplanetary media there
may be rotating round the sun, the comet in its perihelion,
moving far faster than they, will be hindered, whilst the con
trary action at aphelion would be far from sufficient to restore
the balance.      Tidal lagging, too, or, without lagging, the con
traction of Algol and its attendant's spheroidal forms as they
cool, would tend to diminish the mean motion, and so prevent
its increase being as great as it otherwise would be.              It thus
appears probable that the diminution of Algol's period may be
accounted for by Goodricke's hypothesis.            This diminution will
continue till, in the process of condensation, tidal lagging comes
into greater play, when it may be slowly reversed.
    The above calculations are rude and approximate.             It would
take more time than the question is worth, even if we had suffi
cient data, to discuss the problem thoroughly.            I shall be glad
if this paper be found to advance a step in our knowledge of the
heavens.
    Note. — In the paper
                             " On the Nebular Hypothesis," October
1869, it may be noticed that the elongation of form, which
theory suggests for the attended planets as their condition on
severance from the central mass, is probably none other than the.
crescent form, like a fragment of a ring partially embracing the
central body, which is by no means without example in the va
rious  nebulae.

     LIV.    On the Spectra     of  some Gases under     High Pressures.
                          By M. A. WtJllner*.

                      on
                        M. Wiillner has already appeared in this
                          the various shapes which the spectrum of a
gas traversed by an electric spark is capable of assuming when
the pressure of the gas or the temperature produced by the
passage of the spark is varied.           In his first research M. Wiillner
had only worked with hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen under
low pressures ; but he has subsequently resumed this investiga
tion with the aid of M. Bettendorff ; and the use of a far more
powerful induction-coil has enabled him to examine how the
spectrum of the electrical discharge is affected when, instead of
a rarefied gas, it traverses a gas under a more or less high
pressure.
                                   Apparatus.
    The apparatus used was arranged so that the pressure inside
the spectrum-tube could be easily varied from an almost perfect
vacuum up to two or three atmospheres.                   For this purpose it
 consisted essentially of a large U-tube with legs of unequal length.
 The longer was at least 2-5 metres long and was open at the
 top ; it contained the mercurial column which measured and ap
 plied the pressure.       In the bend of the U-tube was a glass cock
 by   which   the mercury of the tube could be allowed to flow out.
 The Geissler's tubes used had essentially the same construction
 as those previously used ; they were provided with two adjutages,
 each of which had a glass stopcock.
     The shorter leg of the U-tube extended about 770 millims.
 from the bend ; and to it was fused one end of the Geissler's
 tube.      The lower adjutage was connected, through a Liebig's ap
 paratus containing concentrated sulphuric acid and a tube con
 taining anhydrousphosphoric acid, with the gasometer. The upper
 adjutage was connected with a Geissler's air-pump provided with
 drying-arrangements containing phosphoric acid. The spectrum-
 tube was of the ordinary shape — that is to say, a very short ca
 pillary tube connecting two larger ones. It had two pairs of elec
 trodes, one with a distance of 8 centims. ; the others ended just
  at the extremities of the capillary part of the tube, and were about
  16 millims. from each other.
     In making the experiment, it was first of all necessary to fill
 the apparatus with perfectly pure and dry gas.                 After having
 introduced into the U-tube a quantity of mercury enough

366           M. A. Wullner       on the Spectra   of some
to balance   the atmospheric pressure, some well-dried gas was
passed in; the tube was then exhausted, and this process re
peated until an almost perfect vacuum was obtained ; the tube
was then left for twenty-four hours in communication with the
drying-apparatus of the pump.      The experiment could then be
proceeded with by allowing perfectly pure and dry gas to enter
while the electrical current passed between the two most distant
electrodes.   When the pressure in the apparatus had become
equal  to the atmospheric pressure, it was increased by gradually
pouring mercury into the long leg of the U-tube, which was
provided with a scale to measure the variations in pressure.
                             a.   Hydrogen.
    At low pressures, the use of a large Ruhmkorff's inductorium
with six Grove's elements gave successively three spectra iden
tical with those described in M. Wiillner's first memoir.          First,
when the pressure      is the lowest that  can be attained with a Geiss-
ler's pump, a discontinuous spectrum, or one of the second class,
is obtained, consisting of six groups of very brilliant green lines ;
then, from about 1 to 2 or 3 millims., a spectrum consisting of
 three bright lines, Ha, H/9, II 7 (the spectrum of the second class
 described by Pliicker) ; and lastly, with a further increase of pres
 sure, a continuous (or first-class) spectrum extending from the
orange to the blue, with a certain number of bright lines beyond
 Ha and H/3 (which still remain). From M. Wiillner's new ob
servations, this spectrum remains in its full brightness at 200
 milliins. pressure ; thence it becomes paler, but otherwise retains
the same appearance up to 400 millims. and even beyond. At 671
milliins. the space between Ha and the commencement of the
green is almost completely dark ; the remainder of the continuous
spectrum is still pretty bright; the line II 0 has almost disap
peared, and in its place there is only seen a large band a little
brighter than the surrounding parts of the spectrum.
    As the pressure still increases, the spectrum again becomes
more luminous, the yellow and orange parts gradually reappear,
the line Ha is still very bright, but a little indistinct at the
edges ; beyond this line a continuous spectrum extends from the
orange to the violet, and presents a maximum lustre in the
place previously occupied by H/8.            The spectrum retains the
same aspect up to 1400 millims., but becomes far more luminous;
it is particularly brilliant about H   /Q,which appears to have simply
widened; the same      is    the case in the violet, where     a   broad
bright band seems to have taken the place of the old line          H 7.
    As the pressure increases, the spectrum of hydrogen appears
more and more like the absolutely continuous one of an incan
descent solid body.       At 2240 millims. (that      is  to say, nearly

                         Gases under High Pressures.                       367
three atmospheres) it almost exactly resembles a solar spectrum
restricted to Fraunhofer's lines C and G*.             It merely differs by
the presence of the line Ha, which, however, is much widened,
and by the maxima of luminous intensity which it presents in
the places where were the lines H/S and Hy.
     M. Wiillner concludes, from what has been said, that above a
certain density the temperature of the jet, and with it the lumi
nous intensity of the spectrum, increases continuously ; so that
 we are warranted in assuming that, by subjecting the gas to a
 still higher pressure, or by raising the temperature of the jet, we
should obtain a continuous spectrum without any bright line.
 He endeavoured to effect this by introducing a Leyden jar into
 the induced circuit, so that it was discharged between the two
electrodes nearest to one another. With the Leyden jar, and in
 proportion as the pressure is increased, the spectrum of hy
 drogen is seen to pass through almost the same phases as when
 a powerful Ruhmkorff'a inductorium is used; but the successive
 transformations of the spectrum are more rapidly effected. Thus
 at 300 milliins. with the Leyden jar, the same appearance is pre
 sented as under three atmospheres with the induction-coil alone.
 At 560 millims. the spectrum is almost continuous. Ha is no
 longer a bright line, but a broad red band ; and H /Sis no longer
 recognized, as before, by a maximum of luminous intensity. At
 1000 millims. the spectrum becomes still more equalized; there
 is at most a maximum lustre where formerly the line Ha appeared;
 the temperature of the jet is so raised that the sodium-line appears
 distinctly as a bright line. Lastly, at 1230 millims. the lustre
 of the jet is so great that the sodium-line is reversed, and ap
 pears just like Fraunhofer's line D in the solar spectrum.              Thus
 it is seen that an incandescent gas may produce a reversed
 spectrum, provided its temperature is high enough, and that it is
 not necessary for the principal source of light to be an incan
  descent solid.
     The author pushed the experiment as far as a pressure of
  1320 millims., at which the discharge of the Leyden jar became
  discontinuous.       The appearance of the spectrum at this pressure
 was still the same, as was also its length.         From the commence
 ment of the experiment, at low pressures a spectrum was ob
  tained restricted to the lines Ha and H7 ; and its limits remained
  constant during the whole of the experiment.              It is not likely
  that the spectrum of hydrogen would ever extend further, even
  at the highest pressures ; we have here even a good criterion that
     * With this limitation, however — that the spectrum of
                                                              hydrogen at high
  pressures is a direct spectrum with no dark line, while the solar spectrum is
  reversed.

368             M. A. Wiillner on   the Spectra  of some
the continuous spectrum just described really belongs to hydro
gen, and not to incandescent solid particles carried by the current.
                               b.  Oxygen.
    At low pressures M. Wiillner obtained with          a large Ruhm-
korff's coil and his six Grove's elements results quite agreeing
with those previously obtained.        At 10 millims. he observed a
spectrum    of the second class identical with that which Pliicker had
described ;    but  beyond that,   and  in proportion as he increased
the pressure, this spectrum lost more and more of its lustre. At
200 millims. scarcely more than a small portion of the lines com
posing it were perceived, those contained in the green and the blue.
From this point the luminous intensity again increases, Pliicker's
spectrum-lines gradually reappear, and at the same time there is
 seen behind them a continuous spectrum, which is first seen in
the green and then gradually spreads out, especially on the side
of the more refrangible rays.        At 650 millims. the continuous
 spectrum extends from the ray called Oa by Pliicker to the
 middle of the interval between Fraunhofer's lines G and H. It
 is particularly bright in the green part, where its lustre almost
 causes the bright lines of the spectrum of the second class to
 disappear.     Yet these, contrary to what was observed in the case
 of hydrogen, do not lose the deliniteness of their contour, nor
 become broader, but are less well distinguished on a ground which
 is almost as brilliant as they.    With Ruhmkorff's inductorium
 M. Wiillner could never      with  oxygen exceed a pressure of 800
 millims.    The continuous spectrum remained almost the same,
 with a rather more equal lustre in its different parts ; and the
 bright lines always stood out with perfect precision on this lu
 minous ground.        Here also, though the lustre increased, the
 spectrum never extended beyond the limits within which it was
 contained at low pressures.
    The use of a Lcyden jar gave in this case the same results as
 the simple induced current, but with a far higher degree of inten -
 sity.   At 30 millims., with a Leyden jar we have a very bright
 continuous spectrum quite resembling that which the induced
 current gave at 600 millims.         As the pressure increases, the
 lustre of the continuous spectrum and of the bright lines increase
 at the same rate, especially in the orange and yellow parts.
 There, as in the case of hydrogen, the bright lines lose the pre
 cision of their contour and seem to spread out.       At 280 millims.
 this part of the spectrum forms a continuous field, while every
 where else the bright lines continue, and stand out on a basis a
little less bright than they. The phenomenon remains constant up
to a pressure of 540 millims., which M. Wiillner never exceeded

                      Gases under High Pressures.                   369
 in this experiment.     The limits of the spectrum having remained
 in this case also the same throughout the whole experiment, we
 have a proof that the continuous spectrum on which the bright
lines stand out really belongs to oxygen.
    This gas, then, is distinguished from hydrogen by the fact that
it is in the less refrangible part that the bright lines of its fun
damental spectrum spread out and disappear and only leave a
continuous spectrum, while in the case of hydrogen these lines
first disappear in the more refrangible part.       Moreover it never
gave, like hydrogen, an absolutely continuous spectrum without
any bright line.      Even at still higher pressures than those we
have indicated, and with a larger Leyden jar charged by a Holtz's
machine, the bright lines remain perfectly distinct, at least in the
more refrangible part of the spectrum, starting from the green.
                              c. Nitrogen.
    To investigate the spectrum of nitrogen, the author did not
work as before on air, but on pure nitrogen ; for it was more
than probable that at high pressures oxygen would exert a dis
turbing action upon his experiments which it could not exert in
very rarefied air.
    At low pressures he obtained, as before, a beautiful conti
nuous and fluted spectrum of the first class.      At 25 millims. the
flutings had already disappeared, except in the green and the
blue.     As the pressure increases, the less refrangible part of the
spectrum becomes more and more obscured until a pressure of
260 millims. has been attained ; there then scarcely remains more
of the first-class spectrum of nitrogen than the blue and violet
parts, which are still fluted,and already there is visible in the green
part a bright line belonging to the spectrum of the second class.
There are then gradually seen to appear an increasing number
of these bright lines ; and towards 500 millims. there is, as it
were, a struggle between the two nitrogen-spectra.           It is easy
to see that they are quite distinct, and that the bright lines of
the second have no connexion with the flutings of the first.
When this latter has quite disappeared, a certain number of
bright lines remain which standout upon a continuous and illu
minated ground.        The bright lines first appear in the more re
frangible part, and only last of all in the red.       From 600 mil
lims., and especially towards 760 millims., this spectrum is com
plete and very bright : this pressure could never be exceeded with
the large Ruhmkorff's coil.
    It is easily seen that the continuous spectrum, serving in this
case also as a basis for the bright lines, forms an integral part
of the second-class spectrum of nitrogen, by the fact that it stops
at exactly the same limits as the bright lines.      The author does

not admit that it can be confounded with the first-class spec
trum of this gas, which always retains its (lutings to the moment
in which it quite disappears.
    The Ley den jar gave exactly the same spectrum with more
brightness in the colours.
     From this abstract of M. Wiillner's memoir it will be seen
that the spectrum of one and the same gas rendered incandescent
by the passage of the electric spark varies materially with the
temperature and pressure.          The spectrum of hydrogen offers
four very distinct appearances — that is to say, the spectrum with
six groups of green lines, Pliicker's spectrum with three bright
lines, the continuous spectrum with two of these three lines (Ha
and H/3), and finally the absolutely continuous spectrum pro
duced under high pressures.          Oxygen gives also four different
 spectra ; that is to say:   —  (1) at the lowest limits of pressure, a
 second-class spectrum consisting of five groups of bright lines in
 the green and the blue; (2) at 1 millim. and below, a continuous
spectrum consisting of broad bands, especially in the green and
 the blue; (3) about 10 millims., the second-class spectrum de
 scribed by Plucker; and (4) finally, at high pressures, a conti
nuous spectrum with a large number of bright lines persisting
in the more refrangible part.        Nitrogen gives two spectra — that
 is to. say, a continuous but fluted spectrum at low pressures, and
 at high ones a continuous spectrum without fluting and on
 which are seen to appear a great number of bright lines, first in
 the green and the blue, and then also in the red.        A more pro
 found investigation will show whether these spectra are abso
 lutely distinct.     M. Wulluer is led to believe so, and therefore
 also to assume that the emissive power of incandescent gases for
 rays of different colours undergoes sudden variations as the
 pressure of the gases themselves gradually varies.           This im
 portant point     is  not  adequately   cleared up by   M.  Wiillner's
 numerous observations.
     On the other hand, M.Wiillner has been led by this latter
 research to modify the ideas which he at first shared with MM.
  Plucker and Hittorff, and according to which continuous or first-
  class spectra corresponded to a lower temperature than spectra
  with bright lines.     It would seem, on the contrary, that conti
 nuous spectra correspond to the highest temperatures and pres
  sures, which would be in conformity with Dr. Frankland's ob
  servations on the spectrum of the hydrogen-flame under high
 pressures.     This, however, is a difficult point to verify ; for it
 has been seen above that the lustre and the temperature of the
 electric jet do not vary in a regular manner with the pressure of
 the gas it traverses.      M. Wiillner intends to resume these re
 searches.

       portable mercurial barometer which                  I

hope you will do me the favour of inserting it in the next Num
ber of your Magazine.
    I beg to enelose also the copy of a letter from Dr. Balfour
Stewart, of Kew Observatory, addressed to the makers, together
with the account of the comparison mentioned in that letter.
    The slight discrepancy between the indications of my baro
meter and that of the standard is entirely owing to the careless
ness of the makers, or rather of the man who tested and made
the scale ; for there is no reason whatever, as you will see from
the principle on which it is constructed, why it should not be
made as accurate as a standard one.        The present scale, how
ever, is correct.
    Besides fulfilling the ordinary requirements of a barometer,
it  it is,
         believe, well adapted for taking mountain-measurements,
as  is I light, of small size, and compact form.    Instead of mer
cury other fluids can, of course, be made use of,      thought pre

                          Description of     the Barometer.
   This instrument, as represented in figs. 1 and 2, consists of
three parts : —
   1st, of a glass tube (fig. 2, ABC) of small diameter, bent at
C and ending in the closed bulb D ;
   2ndly, of a tube (E F G) of larger diameter, joined to the first
at E A and open to the atmosphere at G ;
   3rdly, of a cylinder (H K L) joined to the first two at H and
closed at L.
   These three freely communicate with one another at E AH.
The black spaces ending at B F K indicate the parts filled with
mercury, the remainder of the tube ABC and the bulb D con
tain air slightly rarefied, and the remaining space in the cylin
der K L is filled with liquid sulphuric ether.
   From this arrangement it is evident that any variation in the
atmospheric pressure would be communicated to the column of
mercury       FAB through the open tube G F, and the rise or fall
of the point B indicate the exact degree of such variation. This,
therefore, would form a barometer.
   Now with regard to the effects of temperature.        The cylinder
H  K  L  has  been  made  in such  proportion to the  bulb D and the
tube above     it,
                 that the ether and mercury contained         the first
                                                                     in
have the exact expansive power necessary to counteract that of
air in the latter. For instance, suppose the temperature were
to rise, the expansion of air in the tube and bulb BCD would
tend to lower the point         but as the ether and mercury in the
                                 B ;
cylinder also expand at the same time and drive mercury into
the tube  E   F    the weight of this additional column would tend
                    G,
to raise the point       and as these two forces are equal and op
                          B;
posite  in direction, the  point   would remain stationary.
                                       B                         If the
proportion between the two         not exactly equal,
                                       is                   easily re
                                                               it   is
stored, either       by
                    exchanging mercury for ether, or the contrary,
as the case may require, in the cylinder         K     Hor    L,     by
                                                               varying
the quantity of air in the bulb D.
   The two contractions at the lower end of the cylinder are in
tended to prevent the ether escaping when the instrument           laid   is
on its side.

indications can also be made longer by increasing the size of the
bulb and the diameter of the tube E F G ; but in the same pro
portion the cylinder would have to be made larger.
     The chief novelty of this instrument consists in the means
adopted for the correction of temperature ; and this,                I believe,
can advantageously          be  employed     for other purposes.

 THE" On        Fluoride   of Silver.— Part T." By George Gore, F.R.S.
     This communication treats of the formation, preparation, analysis,
 composition, common physical properties, and chemical behaviour of
 fluoride of silver.
     The salt was prepared by treating pure silver carbonate with an
 excess of pure aqueous hydrofluoric acid in a platinum dish, and
 evaporating to dryness, with certain precautions.           The salt thus ob
 tained invariably contains a small amount of free metallic silver,
 and generally also traces of water and of hydrofluoric acid, unless
 special precautions mentioned are observed.             It was analyzed by
 various methods : the best method of determining the amount of
 fluorine in it consisted in evaporating to dryness a mixture of a
 known weight of the salt dissolved in water, with a slight excess of
 pure and perfectly caustic lime in a platinum bottle, and gently ig
 niting the residue at an incipient red heat until it ceased to lose
 weight.       By taking proper care, the results obtained are accurate.
 The reaction in this method of analysis takes place according to the
 following equation, 2AgF+CaO=CaFa+2Ag+0.                        Sixteen parts
 of oxygen expelled thirty-eight equal parts of fluorine present.           One
 of the methods employed for determining the amount of silver con
  sisted in passing dry ammonia over the salt in a platinum boat and
  tube at a low red heat.          The results obtained in the various ana
 lyses   establish    the  fact  that   pure fluoride of silver consists of 19
  parts  of  fluorine  and   108  of silver.
     Argentic fluoride is usually in the form of yellowish brown earthy
  fragments ; but when rendered perfectly anhydrous by fusion, it is
  a black horny mass, with a superficial satin lustre, due to particles of
  free silver.    It is extremely deliquescent and soluble in water ; one
  part of the salt dissolves in "55 part by weight of water at 15°-5 C;
  it evolves heat in dissolving, and forms a strongly alkaline solution.
  It is nearly insoluble in absolute alcohol. The specific gravity of
  the earthy-brown salt is 5'852 at 15c,5 C. ; the specific gravity of
  its aqueous solution, at 15°-5 C, saturated at that temperature, is
  2-61.     By chilling the saturated solution, it exhibited the pheno
  menon of supersaturation, and suddenly solidified, with evolution of

heat, on immersing a platinum plate in it.      The solution is capable
of being crystallized, and yields crystals of a hydrated salt ; the act
of crystallization is attended by the singular phenomenon of the re
mainder of the salt separating in the anhydrous and apparently non
crystalline state, the hydrated salt taking to itself the whole of the
water. The fused salt, after slow and undisturbed cooling, exhibits
crystalline markings upon its surface.
   The dry salt is not decomposed by sunlight ; it melts below a
visible red heat, and forms a highly lustrous, mobile, and jet-black
liquid.    It is not decomposed by a red heat aloue ; but in the state
of semifusion, or of complete fusion, it is rapidly decomposed by the
moisture of the air, with separation of metallic silver ; dry air does not
decompose it.      In the fused state it slightly corrodes vessels of plati
num, and much more freely those of silver.
   The salt in a state of fusion, with platinum electrodes, conducts
electricity very freely, apparently with the facility of a metal, and
without visible evolution of gas or corrosion of the anode ; a silver
anode was rapidly dissolved by             and one of lignum-vitae charcoal
                                             it,
was gradually corroded.          A saturated aqueous solution of the salt
conducted freely with electrolysis, crystals of silver being deposited
upon the cathode, and      a    black crust of peroxide of silver upon the
anode ;   no gas was evolved       : with dilute solutions gas was evolved
from the anode.      By  electrolysis   of anhydrous hydrofluoric acid with
silver electrodes, the anode was rapidly corroded.
   The electrical order of substances in the fused salt was as follows,
the first-named being the most positive — silver, platinum, charcoal
                                                       :
of lignum-vitae, palladium, gold. In dilute aqueous solution of the
                                                   a
salt, the order found was — aluminium, magnesium, silicon, iridium,
                               :
rhodium, and carbon of lignum-vitae, platinum, silver, palladium,
tellurium, gold.
   The chemical behaviour of the salt was also investigated. In
many cases considerable destruction of the platinum vessels occurred,
either in the experiments themselves, or in the processes of cleaning
the vessels from the products of the reactions.
   Hydrogen does not decompose the dry salt, even with the aid of
sunlight, nor does    a  stream of that gas decompose an aqueous solu
tion of the salt but the dry salt
                  ;                        rapidly and perfectly decomposed
                                             is
by   that gas at an incipient red heat, its metal being liberated.
   Nitrogen has no chemical effect upon the sa1t, even at              red heat,
                                                                         a
nor upon its aqueous solution. Dry ammonia gas                      is
                                                                 copiously ab
sorbed by the dry salt.        In one experiment the salt absorbed about
844 times its volume      of the gas.     The salt       fused state
                                                           in   a        is
                                                                          rapidly
and perfectly decomposed           by
                                    dry ammonia gas, and its silver set free.
A saturated solution of the salt            also instantly and violently de
                                             is
composed     by strong aqueous      ammonia.
   Oxygen has no effect either upon the dry salt at 15° C, or at a red
heat, nor upon its aqueous solution.             Steam perfectly and rapidly
decomposes    the  salt at  an  incipient  red  heat, setting free all its silver.
No chemical change took place on passing either of the oxides of ni
trogen over the salt in state of fusion.

     By passing anhydrous hydrofluoric acid vapour over perfectly an
 hydrous and previously fused fluoride of silver, at about 60° Fahr.,
 distinct evidence of the existence of an acid salt was obtained. This
 acid salt is decomposed by a slight elevation of temperature.
     Numerous experiments were made to ascertain the behaviour of
  argentic fluoride in a state of fusion with chlorine ; and great diffi
 culties were encountered in consequence of the extremely corrosive
 action of the substances when brought together in a heated state.
 Vessels of glass, platinum, gold, charcoal, gas-carbon, and purified
 graphite were employed*. By heating the salt in chlorine, contained
 in closed vessels formed partly of glass and partly of platinum, more
 or less corrosion of the glass took place, the chlorine united with the
 platinum and fluoride of silver to form a double salt, and a vacuum
•was produced.       By similarly heating it in vessels composed wholly
 of platinum, the same disappearance of chlorine, the same double
 salt, and a similar vacuum resulted.      Also, by heating it in vessels
 composed partly of gold, an analogous double salt, the same ab
 sorption of chlorine and production of rarefaction were produced.
 And by employing vessels partly composed of purified graphite, a
 new compound of fluorine and carbon was obtained.
     " Approximate    Determinations of the Heating-powers of Arcturus
 and a Lyrae."      By E. J. Stone, F.R.S., First Assistant at the Royal
 Observatory, Greenwich.
     About twelve months ago I began to make observations upon the
 heating-power of the stars.         My first arrangements were simply
            I
 these : — made use of a delicate reflecting astatic galvanometer, and a
 thermo-electric pile of nine elements.     The pile was screwed into the
 tube of a negative eyepiece of the Greenwich Great Equatorial, from
 which the eye-lenses had been removed.
     I soon convinced myself that the heat, condensed by the object-
 glass of twelve and three-quarters inches upon my pile, was appreci
 able in the case of several of the brighter stars ; hut the endless
 changes in the zero-point of the galvanometer-needle, and the mag
 nitude of these changes, compared with those arising from the heating-
 power of the stars, prevented me from making any attempts to esti
 mate the absolute magnitude of the effects produced.        Every change
 in the state of the sky, every formation or dissipation of cloud, com
 pletely drove the needle to the stops.
     At the February Meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society I
 first became aware of what Mr. Huggins had done upon this ques
tion.     His arrangements, however, did not appear to me to meet the
 difficulties which I had encountered. After some trials, I arranged
my apparatus as follows, and with its present form       I am satisfied.
     a and /3 are two pairs of plates of antimony and bismuth. The
areas are about (0*075 )* inch, and their distance is about 0-25 inch.
     The poles are joined over in opposite directions to the terminals of
 the pile and galvanometer.        The whole pile is screwed into a tube

vessels formed of other materials.

pletely shuts the pile up in the telescope-tube. A thick flannel bag
is then wrapped over the eyepiece and terminals.       The bag is pre
vented from actually touching the case of the pile, and is useful in
preventing the irregular action of draughts upon the case of the pile
and terminals.   The wires are led from the terminals of the pile to
the observatory library, where I have placed the reflecting galvano
meter.   This separation of the galvanometer from the telescope is
most inconvenient ; but it was absolutely necessary, on account of the
large moving masses of iron in the observing-room.
   The two faces a and /3 of the pile are so nearly alike, that the re
sultant current generated by any equal heating of them is exceedingly
feeble.

faces a and    and allowed to remain thus until the needle

needle appears to have taken up its position, which usually takes

have always reduced those readings           by
                                             comparing reading with star

although in making the observations        I  have usually joined over the
terminals without knowing the direction for heat, and have left this
undetermined until the completion of the observations.           I mention
this because the differences in the readings for star on a and star on
/3 in the state in which     use my galvanometer are small.

readings of the galvanometer, obtained                       by
                                             cutting off the whole heat
from one-half of the cube, with that obtained      intercepting         by
                                                                   portion             a
of this heat by the glass G. A considerable number of accordant
results gave p=0'725.
   To determine the quantity         have proceeded as follows —

          I
with each face a and       of the pile, along the lines of junction of
                                    /3
the plates. The thermometers were separated from each other, and
the direct radiation of one on the other prevented by the interposition
of piece of blackened card. The two thermometers, with the faces
     a
of the pile in contact, were then exposed to the radiation of the halves
of the face of the cube containing the boiling water. A third delicate
thermometer was read for registration of any change in the tempe
rature of the surrounding air.    This thermometer was protected from
the direct   radiation  from  the cube.   The pile, with thermometers
in contact, was then placed at different distances from the cube and
the thermometer-readings taken.         have usually taken readings at
                                                    I
three distances — one at about 23'5 inches, another at 11          inches,             "9
another at 2-5 inches. From        comparison  aof  these readings with
those taken before the heat from the cube fell upon the thermo
meters,    infer the heating-power of each half of the cube upon the
           I
thermometers, with the faces of the pile in contact.         Calling this
quantity for one inch of distance H', find for my cube in its present

                                                    in
pile, and the galvanic connexions made, we may be certain that the

temperature of the thermometers has been imparted to the faces of
the pile when the needle is steady, provided that the current be
carried from the thermometers without loss in the nature of increased
resistance.   I have therefore compared the deviations produced by
glass G before the faces /3 and a with the thermometers in contact
and without thermometers in contact with two different amounts of
resistance in circuit. Such observations have been considered satis
factory only when the two resistances for thermometers in contact
 and without thermometers were sensibly equal.      This condition can
 be obtained by making the thermometers touch along the lines of
junction of the antimony and bismuth ; but the connexion being one
of mere contact, there is always danger of failure.
   The following observations were made on 1869, Aug. 19 : —
    1 . Without thermometers :
         Resistance = R+0003 B.A. unit.
         Mean difference, G before /3— G before a = 735 div.
  2.   With thermometers in contact :
        Resistance = R,+ 0-003 B.A. unit.
        Mean difference = 698 div.
  3. With thermometers in contact :
      Resistance = R,+ 1-437 B.A. unit.
      Mean difference =324 div.
  4. Without thermometers :
       Resistance =R + 1-437 B.A. unit.
  From (1) and (4) R= 1-251 B.A. unit.
  From (2) and (3) R,= 1-239 B.A. unit.
  The resistances are therefore each sensibly equal to 1-245           B.A. unit.
   From (1) (2) and (3) (4)        we find  ^ = 1 05 6.
   From the mean of such         determinations I find
                                         = 1-087.
                                   ^
   If, therefore, c is the distance of the pile                 from the cube   in
inches, we have
                            C=i5°-°x         1-087.

with moisture, at a temperature of about 52°.        The mean of fourteen
observations of the difference of reading for a Lyrae on a and /3 gave
only 1 1 divisions.   I have no doubt that the small effect here obtained

    This result is again so much smaller than those obtained from Arc-
turus, although the observations of Arcturus were made under more
unfavourable circumstances with respect to altitude, that I cannot but
regard it as a fact that the star Arcturus does give us more heat than
a Lyrae, — a result probably due to the same cause which gives rise to
the difference in colour between these stars, viz. the greater absorption
of the red end of the spectrum in the case of a Lyra than in the case
of Arcturus.
    I may here mention that on June 25, 1869, I made a direct com
parison between Arcturus and a Lyras.         The result gave for the heat
received from Arcturus : that from a Lyrae : : 3 : 2 ; but on account
of the observations of a Lyra having been interrupted by cloud, they
were not sufficiently numerous to eliminate mere errors of reading.
                                             I
    From the whole of these observations think we may conclude : —
that Arcturus gives to us considerably more heat than a Lyras ; that
the amount of heat received is diminished very rapidly as the amount
of moisture in the air increases ; that nearly the whole heat is in
tercepted by the slightest cloud ; that, as first approximations, the
heat from Arcturus at an altitude of 25°, at Greenwich, is about equal
to that from a three-inch cube containing boiling water at a distance
of 400 yards.
    The heat from a Lyrae at an altitude of 60° is about equal to that
 from the same cube at a distance of about 600 yards.        The form given
 to the pile appears likely to be useful in many inquiries respecting dif
 ferences of heating-power.

    " Preliminary Paper on certain Drifting Motions of the Stars."
 By Richard A. Proctor, B.A., F.R.A.S.
    A careful examination of the proper motions of all the fixed stars
 in the catalogues published by Messrs. Main and Stone (Memoirs of
 the Royal Astronomical Society, vols. xxviii. and xxxiii.) has led me
 to a somewhat interesting result.      I find that in parts of the heavens
 the stars exhibit a well-marked tendency to drift in a definite direction.
 In the catalogues of proper motions, owing to the way in which the

382                            Royal Society.
stars     are arranged, this tendency is masked ; but when the proper
  motions are indicated in maps, by affixing to each star a small arrow
  whose length and direction indicate the magnitude and direction of
 the star's proper motion, the star-drift (as the phenomenon may be
 termed) becomes very evident.
      It is worthy of notice that Madler, having been led by certain con
 siderations to examine the neighbourhood of the Pleiades for traces
 of a community of proper motion, founded on the drift he actually
 found in Taurus his well-known theory that Alcyone (the lucida of
 the Pleiades) is the common centre around which the sidereal system
 is moving.       But in reality the community of motion in Taurus is only
 a single instance, and not the most striking that might be pointed
 out, of a characteristic which may be recognized in many regions of
 the heavens.       In Gemini and Cancer there is a much more striking
 drift towards the south-east, the drift in Taurus being towards the
 south-west.       In the constellation Leo there is also a well-marked
 drift, in this case towards Cancer.
     These particular instances of star-drift are not the less remarkable
 that they (the stars) are drifting almost exactly in the direction due to
 the proper motion which has been assigned to the sun, because the
 recent researches of the Astronomer Royal have abundantly proved
 that the apparent proper motions of the stars are not to be recognized
 as principally due to the sun's motion.          Mr. Stone has shown even
that we must assign to the stars a larger proper motion, on the ave
rage, than that which the sun possesses.           Looking, therefore, on the
stars as severally in motion, with velocities exceeding the sun's on
 the average, it cannot but be looked upon as highly significant that
in any large region of the heavens there should be a community of
motion such as I have described. We seem compelled to look upon
the stars which exhibit such community of motion as forming a
distinct system, the members of which are associated indeed with the
galactic system, but are much more intimately related to each other.
     In other parts of the heavens, however, there are instances of a
star-drift opposed to the direction due to the solar motion.              A re
markable instance may be recognized among the seven bright stars
of Ursa Major. Of these, the stars        ft,  y,    2,e, and
                                                           £    are all drifting
in the same direction, and almost exactly at the same rate, towards
the " apex of the solar motion," that       is,  the point from which all the
motions due to the sun's translation in space should be directed.           If
these five stars, indeed, form  a  system (and    I   can see no other reason
able explanation of so singular     a  community of motion), the mind       is
lost in contemplating the immensity of the periods which the revolu
tions of the components of the system must occupy.                 Madler had
already assigned to the revolution of Alcor around Mizar           (f    Ursse)
a  period of more than 7000 years. But          if  these stars, which appear
so clear to the naked eye, have     a   period of such length, what must
be the cyclic periods of stars which cover        a  range of several degrees
upon     the heavens?
    In like manner the stars a,     ft,and y    of Arietis appear to form   a
single    system,   though  the   motion  of o  is not absolutely coincident

                          Geological Society.                         383
either in magnitude or direction with that of ft and y, which are
moving on absolutely parallel lines with equal velocity.
    There are many other interesting cases of the same kind.      I  hope
soon to be able to lay before the Society a pair of maps in which all
the well-recognized proper motions in both hemispheres are exhibited
on the stereographic projection.      In the same maps also the effects
due to the solar motion are exhibited by means of great circles
through the apex of the solar motion, and small circles or parallels
having that apex for a pole.
    It appears to me that the star-drift    I   have described serves to
explain several phenomena which had hitherto been thought very
perplexing.    In the first place, it accounts for the small effect which
the correction due to the solar motion has been found to have in di
minishing the sums of the squares of the stellar proper motions.
 Agnin, it explains the fact that many double stars which have a com
mon proper motion appear to have no motion of revolution around
 each other ; for clearly two members of a drifting-system might
 appear to form a close double, and yet be in reality far apart and
 travelling not around each other, but more closely around the centre
 of gravity of the much larger system they form part of.
     I may add that, while mapping the proper motions of the stars,
I   have been led to notice that the rich cluster around x Persei falls
 almost exactly on the intersection of the Milky Way with the great
 circle which may be termed the equator of the solar motion — that
 is, the great circle having the apex of the sun's motion as a pole.
 This circumstance points to that remarkable cluster, rather than to
 the Pleiades, as the centre of the sidereal system,     if,  indeed, that
 system   have a   centre cognizable  by us.   When   we  remember    that
 for every fixed star in the Pleiades there are hundreds in the great
 cluster in Perseus, the latter will seem the worthier region to be the
 centre of motion.    I   should be disposed, however, to regard the
 cluster in Perseus as the centre of  a   portion of the sidereal system,
 rather than as the common centre of the Galaxy.
     The peculiarities of the apparent proper motions of the stars seem
 to me to lend    a new interest to the researches which Mr. Huggins
is   preparing to make into the stellar proper motions of recess or ap
 proach.

      1. " Notes on the Geology of Cape- York Peninsula, Australia."
    By Alex. Rattray, M.D.
   The author stated that the Eastern mountain-range of Australia
 isproduced through and forms the axis of the peninsula of Cape
 York    ;consists of various granites and porphyries, gneiss, and
             it

 38  i                    Geological Society : —
 felspathic and quartzose rocks. In Cape York itself the roek is a
 porphyry, with numerous crystals of yellowish quartz.       Resting on
 the flanks of this axis are beds of sandstone, regarded as of Carbo
 niferous ago by the Eev. W. B. Clarke, and referred to the Oolite by
 Prof. M'Coy. The surface-rock in the neighbourhood of Cape York
 is an ironstone, varying from a light friable clay to a dense ferru
 ginous conglomerate, sometimes nodular and magnetic ; an average
 specimen contained 39-69 per cent. of iron.       This deposit extends
 at least as far south as the Mitchell River, on the west side of the
 peninsula, and as far as Weymouth Bay on its east side. It is re
 garded as Posttertiary by Mr. Clarke. Between this and the igneous
 rock intervenes a local deposit of coarse quartzose sandstone, which
 forms bold cliffs in Albany Island and on the opposite coast of the
 mainland.    No boulder-deposits or glacial markings were detected
 by the author.
    The author referred to the occasional occurrence of earthquakes
 in Eastern Australia, and to the evidence that at least the north
 east of that continent is being slowly elevated — namely, the occur
 rence of water-worn caves above high- water mark in Albany Island
 and on the opposite coast, the existence of extensive plains covered
 with sand-dunes, especially towards the north of the peninsula, and
the gradual emergence of islands in the line of the great Barrier
 Reef.
    2. " On the Formation of the Chesil Bank, Dorset."       By H. W.
 Bristow, Esq., F.R.S., F.G.8., and Wm. Whitaker, Esq., B.A., F.G.S.
    The authors first described the general character of the bank, and
noticed the previous hypotheses that have been suggested to account
for its formation.    They maintained that it had been formed as an
ordinary shingle-beach banked up against the land, and afterwards
separated by the wearing action of the small rivers flowing to the
sea at this part.    They stated that west of the Chesil Bank there
are cliffs of greater or less elevation, through which small streams
flow down to the shore, when they turn a little eastward between
the beach and the land, and then filter through the shingle without
breaching it. The effect of a similar river-action on the low shore
behind the Chesil Bank would, in tho authors' opinion, be to cut
such a channel as that of tho Fleet, by which this bank is separated
from the shore.
   3. " On a Raised Beach at Portland Bill, Dorset."      By W. Whit
aker, Esq., B.A., F.G.8.
   The author stated that a deposit of shingle occurs upon tho cliffs
of the south-east part of the Isle of Portland, extending from Cave
Hole to the Bill. At the former place it is from 30 to 40 feet above
the sea, and is capped by a considerable thickness of angular " head."
Further south there is less of the " head." The shingle consists of
pebbles of limestone, flint, and chert;      and the deposit contains
shells of Liltorina Uttorea and littoralis, Patella vulgata, and other
species.   Near the beacon these species, with Purpura lapillus,
occur. To the west of the Bill the shingle is partly covered by a

      Prof. Huxley    on a new Labyrinthodont from Bradford.          385
 yellowish-brown loam, containing land and freshwater shells, such
 as Bithinue and Pupa.

 Canton de Vaud." By E. Tawney, Esq., F.G.S., with a Note by T.
 Davidson, Esq., F.R.S., F.G.S.
    The author recorded the occurrence of Terebratula diphya in a
 block of Oxfordian limestone derived from the ridge of the Vanil
 Noir, near Paray Charbon. No Neocomian beds occur within a dis
 tance of several miles. The block had merely fallen, and had not
 been   transported.    The author indicated that this result is in op
 position to the views of M. Hebert, who maintains the identity of
 T. diphya and T. diphyoides, and refers all the beds containing these
 fossils to the Neocomian series.
    Mr. Davidson, in his note, indicated the distinctive characters of
 T. viator, Pict. (=diphya) and T. diphyoides, and confirmed the
 author's opinion as to its Jurassic age.
    5. " On a new Labyrinthodont from Bradford."          By T. H. Hux
ley, LL.D., F.R.S., President, with a Note on its locality and strati-
graphical position, by Louis C. Miall, Esq.
    The Labyrinthodont nature of this fossil was said to be proved by
 the characters of the vertebrae, ribs, and ventral armour. It exhibits
 portions of both jaws, which bear close-set teeth of nearly equal size,
 nearly circular in section, and slightly recurved at the apex, which
 is obtusely pointed.     The surface of the upper jaw shows a pitted
 sculpture.    The ventral armour consists of oval plates, traversed ob
liquely by a convex ridge, dividing them into two unequal parts.
 They are supposed by the author to have overlapped each other so
 as to show little more than the surfaces of the oblique ridges.      The
 author stated that this Amphibian appears to be most nearly related
to his genus Pholidogaster, but that it differs therefrom in the form
of the vertebral centra, and in the nature of the ventral armour. He
 proposed to give it the new generic name of Pholiderpeton.
    Mr. Miall stated that the fossil described by Prof. Huxley was
obtained from the Black Bed or Royd's Coal at Toftshaw, near
 Bradford, and remarked that the Amphibians of the Coal-measures
appear to have been not onty specifically numerous, but individually
abundant.       He also noticed the difficulty of defining exact horizons
 within the Coal-measures.
    6.  " On  the Maxilla of Megalosaurus."     By T. H. Huxley, LL.D.,
F.R.S., President.
    The author stated that the specimen which he was about to de
scribe, belonging to Mr. Abbay, of King's College, was the first ex
 ample of the upper jaw of Megalosaurus that had ever been seen. It
 showed the left side of the jaw, measured nearly 18 inches in length,
 and 4| inches in depth anteriorly ; the posterior part was produced
into a thin and probably free process.         The author described the
general form of the nasal and orbital openings, as indicated by the
 characters of the specimen, and stated that the anterior part of the
jaw exhibits no suture indicating the separation of the prcemaxilla
 from the maxilla.      The teeth were stated to be tow in number, but

     2.  " Observations  on the ' Nuggetty     Reef,' Mount Tarrangower
 Gold-field."     By Dr. G. H. F. Ulrich, F.G.S.
     The author commenced       by indicating  the position and characters
 of tho so-called " Nuggetty Reef," which is situated about 2| miles
 N.N.W. of tho little town of Maldon, about 87 miles N.W. of Mel
 bourne, and consists of two strong quartz veins, separated by a mass
 of bluish-grey metamorphic sandstone.             In certain places the
 " reef" is cut transversely or obliquely by granite bars or veins, of
 which tho author described four, and stated that, although some of
 them are, and all probably have been, connected with the main mass
 of granite, they present rather the appearance of zones of impreg
 nation than of intrusive dykes — there being no line of separation.
 between the quartz rock and the granite, but felspar and black mica
 make their appearance in the quartz, and gradually increase in
 quantity until the granite band is formed. The author noticed the
 following minerals as associated with the gold in tho " Nuggetty
 Reef:" — Iron pyrites, arsenical pyrites, magnetic pyrites, copper
 pyrites, galena, zinc-blende, and a compound of gold and bismuth,
 to which he gave the name of Mahlonite.
      3.  " On the Caratal Gold-field." By Dr. C. Le Neve Foster, F.G.S.
      The author stated that the Caratal Gold-field is situated about
  100 miles south of the Orinoco, at a point about 75 miles above
  its principal mouth. The rock of the district is chiefly gneiss, with
  some mica-schist, hornblende schist, and granite.        The gold occurs
  in four ways : — 1, in lodes, veins, &c. ; 2, in alluvial or " placer "
  diggings ; 3, in red earth or " Tierra de flor ; and, 4, in gravel and
                                                    "
  sand of river-beds.     The mode of occurrence of the gold in these
  different places, aud the various processes employed in collecting it,
  were described by the author, who estimates the quantities of the
  precious metal obtained in the Caratal district as follows : —

                                        "
   Esq., Assoc. Linn. Soc., F.G.S.
      The author prefaced his remarks by pointing out the leading phy
   sical features of Guyana in Venezuela, and by alluding to the Geo
   logy of Venezuela to the north of the river Orinoco, as determined
   by Mr. Wall.
      Mr. Tate has ascertained the existence of an extensively deve
   loped metamorphic series, consisting of felstones, talc schists,
   quartzites, gneiss of great variety, hornblende slate, and amphibole

    Mr.   J. J. Murphy   on the Cause   of the Glacial  Climate.    387
rock, striking about N.E. and S.W., and dipping generally to the
 N.W. at a high angle. The series exhibits little disturbance, but
great lithological variation ; on the whole felspar predominates in
the lower part, whilst hornblende increases in quantity as we ascend
in the section. The fclstono and talc schist, more especially the
former, contain eminently auriferous lodes ; the gneiss contains dis
seminated gold, and that to the north of Upata a rich deposit of red
 luematite and a few intrusions of greenstone.
    This motamorphic series was considered to be contemporaneous
with a similar series constituting the Littoral Cordilleras of North
Venezuela, the praecretaceous age of which is proved by their being
overlain by unaltered Neocomian beds.         Indulging in speculation
as to the age of theso auriferous rocks, the author sought, by ana
logy of their mineral contents and their lithological similarity to
certain auriferous and associated strata in Bolivia, to establish their
Silurian age.
    Skirting the Orinoco and abutting against the     escarpment of the
Itacama Mountains, wore described the "Llanos" sandstones and
conglomerates, derived from the metamorphic series. These beds,
which were referred to the Upper Miocene, aro in their easterly
extension liguitiferous and asphaltic ; and as the basin of the Ori
noco is excavated in them, it was contended that the present river
could have played no part in the accumulation of the materials
from which the asphaltic deposits have been supposed to have
originated.
    5. "  On the Nature and Cause of the Glacial Climate."       By Jos.
John Murphy, Esq., F.G.S.
    The author cited the conclusions arrived at by Mr. Croll as to the
causes of glacial climate, and stated his agreement with them, ex
cept in one instance : he maintained, in opposition to Mr. Croll, that
the glaciated hemisphere must be that in which the summer occurs
in aphelio during the period of greatest eccentricity of the earth's
orbit.    He showed that a cool summer had more to do with the
prevalence of glacial conditions than a cold winter, and referred to
several phenomena furnishing arguments in favour of his opinion.

    The following communications     were read : —

Grey Egerton,    Bart, M.P.,  F.R.S.,  Y.P.G.S.
    The author remarked upon the characters of the genus Gyrodus,
of which he described two new species, namely: — G. Goweri, from
a deposit of Oolitic age on tho east coast of Sutherland, having the
scales covered with a somewhat reticulated raised pattern, inter
spersed with granules ; and G. corcoderma, from the Kimmeridge
Clay of Kimmeridge, having the scales adorned with a multitude of
symmetrical granules which show no tendency to coalesce.            The
author also described a vomer of Sphatrodus gigas, bearing teeth of
the form usual in that genus, and remarked that this specimen esta
blished the validity of the genus Sphasrodus.

    2. " Note   on a very large Saurian Humems from the Kimme-
 ridge Clay of the Dorset coast." By J. W. Hulke, F.R.S., F.G.S.
    This stupendous limb-bone, 31 inches long, was obtained from
 Kimmeridge Bay by J. C. Mansel, Esq.            It had a subcylindrical
 shaft, a transversely elongated proximal, and a cubical distal ex
 tremity.   The distal end is mapped out by a wide shallow posterior
 groove, and a narrower but deeper anterior notch, into a couple of
 condyles, of which the inner or posterior is the larger. The anterior
 border of the shaft towards the proximal end rises, as if to form a
 deltoid crest.    The cortical tissue of the shaft is remarkably dense
 and polished. There is not any medullary cavity ; but the interior
 of the cortex is filled with cancellous tissue.
    The author pointed out that the form of the terminal surfaces
 removed the bone from all the Enaliosaurians, and brought it into
 close relation to the humerus of existing Crocodilians, from which,
however, it differed in its being less curved and by its great size.
    He next referred to its differences from the humerus of the Di
nosaurs Iguanodon and Hylceosaurus, and remarked that it most
nearly resembled the large limb-bone on which Mantell founded
his genus Peloro$aurus.
    3. " Note on some fossil remains of a Gavial-like Saurian from
Kimmeridge Bay, establishing its identity with Cuvier's ' Deuxieme
Gavial d'Honfleur ' and with Quenstedt's Ddkosaurus."           By J."W.
Hulke, Esq., F.R.S., F.G.S.
    The fossils which formed the subject of this communication were
also collected by Mr. Mansel in Kimmeridge Bay. They demonstrated
the existence of a Saurian having long, subincurved, subretrocurved,
laterally compressed, unequally convex teeth, with an anterior and
a posterior finely serrated edge, loosely implanted in distinct and
separate sockets, and vertically replaced by young teeth rising into
the base of the large open pulp-cavity of the fang of the old tooth.
    The lower jaw, of which the greatest part of the right half is
preserved, is about 40 inches long. The symphysis is very long, and
includes the opercular bone.      The upper jaw shows a terminal, undi
vided nostril, not inflated laterally as in the Teleosaww.   The lines of
the jaws seem to merge into the cranium less abruptly than in the
livingGavial, which gives the outline of the head a greater resemblance
to Mecistops.     The vertebra are biconcave, and the outer surface is
hollowed and somewhat overhung by the roundish articular surfaces.
The transverse processes are long and directed outwards, and slightly
backwards and downwards ; their posterior border thick, the anterior
thin.    The ribs have bifurcated spinal ends.      The femur, 14 inches
long, resembles that of the living Crocodilians, only it is less twisted.
    The structure of the jaw, the form and attachment of the teeth,
and the manner of their succession, with the form of the vertebrae
and ribs, proved this Kimmeridge Saurian to be a Crocodilian (and
not a Lacertilian) resembling a bastard Gavial.         The author next
demonstrated its identity with Dakosaurus, Quenstedt, and hence
with Oeosaurus maximus, Plieninger; and he expressed a belief
that it was also generically identical with Cuvier's Honfleur Gavial

    4. " On the Geology of a Portion of Abyssinia." By William T.
Blanford, Esq., F.R.S. dec.
    This paper contained a brief description of the principal geologi
cal observations made by the writer when accompanying the late
Abyssinian expedition.      After referring to the notices by previous
explorers, he gave a list of the different formations met with, viz. :—
1. Kecent Soils on the highlands, including regur or cotton-soil
similar to that found in India, and alluvial deposits on the coast.
2. The volcanic series which skirts both coasts of the southern por
tion of the Eed Sea.     This, which was poorly developed on the west
coast of Annesley Bay, it was proposed to designate the Aden vol
canic series.    3. The great trappean formations of the Abyssinian
highlands, consisting of two groups unconformable to each other — (1)
the Magdala group, consisting of trachytes and dolerites, and (2) the
Ashangi group, entirely composed of dolerites — both of great thick
ness and formed of bedded volcanic rocks, lavas, and ashes.      4. The
Antalo limestone of Oolitic age, containing Ceromya similis, Trigonia
costata, and other characteristic forms.       5. Adegrat sandstone, a
massive formation occupying a considerable area in Northern Tigre,
and perhaps representing the coal-bearing rocks known to exist
 north-west of Lake Dembea, but unfossiliferous.       6. Metamorphics
of varying mineral character, having a general north and south strike,
 due to preexistent cleavage.    Some brief remarks on denudation &c.
 followed.
    5.  " On  the Graphite of the Laurentian   of Canada."   By Prof.  J.
  W. Dawson, LL.D., F.R.S., F.G.S.
     The author described the modes of occurrence of great quantities
 of graphite in the Laurentian    limestones of Canada. He regarded
 the presence and characters of this mineral as indicative of the ex
 istence of plants, side by side with Eozoon, at the period of the de
 position of these limestones.
     6. "On the Correlation, Nature, and Origin of the Drifts of
 North-west Lancashire and part of Cumberland."           By D. Mackin
 tosh, Esq., F.G.S.
     In this paper the author stated the results of observations made
 last December, January, and February, during prolonged visits to
 Blackpool, Ulverstone, and Lancaster.       At Blackpool repeated exa
 minations of the drifts, as exposed on the tidal zone and in the
 cliffs, convinced him that there is a distinct triplex series —a hard,
 very stony lower boulder-clay, a middle sand and gravel, and a less
 stony upper boulder-clay and marl. At Blackpool tho author likewise
  found a newer deposit of warp-clay (or Scotch slutsh) interstratified
  with and overlain by peat and sand.     On the Furness side of More-
  cambe Bay, the same lower boulder-clay, there called
                                                                " pinel,"
  made its appearance.     After many visits to the section near the
  Ulverstone railway-station, he convinced himself that the pinel not
 only contains seams of sand, but overlies a thick bed of finely la
 minated sand.      It wedges out upwards into an exceedingly con

390                        Geological Society   : —
tortcd and false-bedded mass of middle sand and gravel.                    The
pinel   he  found running up   the  hill-sides to  an  altitude   of 800  feet.
Above Soutergate, at a height of between 700 and 800 feet, he found
a distinct line of demarcation between the pinel and an upper boulder-
loam which lower down contained boulders of granite.               The paper
contained a particular description of the completely isolated island-
hill called Dunnerholme with its capping of upper boulder-clay
 and rounded pebbles, many of them still sticking in the funnel-
 shaped cavities of the underlying limestone, which they apparently
helped to grind out. The author described a great thickness of
 upper boulder-clay near Barrow, and denned the north-east boundary
 of the granitic drift, which he believed could not all have come
 from Eskdale in Cumberland.         He likewise described the naturally
 sculptured large    boulder-stones  of Stain ton. On the west side of
 the Duddon, he could clearly trace the pinel and middle sand and
 gravel, and, he believed, an upper rubbly boulder-clay, the lower
 limit of which, however, was not well defined.            He found all the
 drifts, but especially the upper, spreading out along the base of
 Blackcombe in the shape of a regular terrace running up into its.
 combes, and choking up its gorges.          He described the appearances
 presented    and  positions occupied by the drifts at high levels on
 Blackcombe, and endeavoured to trace a distinction between marine
 drifts, glacial moraine matter, and ordinary " screes
                                                            "
                                                              or fallen debris.
 The author gave a particular account of the enormous mounds of
 sand and gravel between Lancaster and Carnforth, described the
 mode of occurrence and striation of the limestone boulders, and
 traced the latter to the action of sea-ice on old sea-coasts around
 Warton Hill, &c. In conclusion, he considered the mode of accu
 mulation and derivation of the drifts of North-west Lancashire, and
 compared them with the lower boulder-clay, middle sand and gravel,
 and upper boulder-clay of the splendid section, 150 feet high, near
  Preston, and with the drifts of other districts.
     7. " On the Connexion of the Geological Structure and Physical
  Features of the South-east of England with tho Consumption
 Death-rate." By W. Whitaker, Esq., B.A., F.G.S.
     The author stated that his investigation of this subject, which
  was carried on in conjunction with Dr. Buchanan, was suggested
  by the fact that improved drainage had been found to exert a
  marked influence upon the average number of deaths by consump
  tion in certain districts.    The chief result arrived at by an exa
  mination of fifty-eight registration districts in Kent and Sussex
  was, that " wetness of the soil is a great cause of consumption ;"
  and this depends not only upon the perviousness or impcrviousness
  of the soils, but upon their position as regards elevation and slope.
     8.  " On the Volcanic Phenomena of Hawaii."            By the Rev.   C. Q.
  Williamson.
     In this paper the author gave a detailed account of tho general
  physical features of the island of Hawaii, noticing especially the
  characters presented by the volcanic mountains of tho island and
  the results of their eruptions.      The eruptions and earthquakes of

 Dr.Nicholson on Intrusive Igneous Rocks of the Lake-district. 391
 1868 were particularly described by the author from his personal
 observations.
     9. “Notes on certain of the Intrusive Igneous Rocks of the Lake
  district.” By Dr. H. A. Nicholson, F.G.S.
    The rocks referred to in this paper were the syenite of the Wale
 of St. John, the syenitic porphyry between Ennerdale and Butter
 mere, and the felstone porphyry of Carrock Fell. The author de
 scribed the characters and position of these rocks with regard to
 the Skiddaw Slates on the one hand, and the green slates and por
 phyries on the other, and indicated that the latter series of rocks
 are unconformably deposited upon the purely sedimentary Skiddaw
 Slates. The Skiddaw Slates were said to be metamorphosed where
                                   Fº
 they come into contact with the intrusive masses, and the latter were
 regarded by the author as most              “the roots of the ancient
 vents from which were derived the alternating ashes and traps
 which together compose almost the whole of the green-slate series.”
    10. “On the Fossil Myriopods of the Coal-formation          of Nova
 Scotia and England.” By Samuel H. Scudder, Esq.               -
    In this paper the author discussed and described the species of
 Chilognathous Myriopods which have been detected in the Coal
 measures. Of these he recognized 6, viz. Xylobius sigillariae (Daws.),
 X. similis, sp. n., X. fractus, sp. n., X. Dawsonii, sp. m., X. Wood
 wardii (=sigillaria, Woodw.), and a species upon which he founded
 a new genus, Archiulus wylobioides. He regarded these forms as
 constituting a peculiar family, for which he proposed the name of
 Archiulidae.
     11. “On the Geology of the Country surrounding the Gulf of
 Cambay.”     By Alexander Rogers, Esq., F.G.S., Bombay Civil Service.
    The author described the surface of the country as consisting
 chiefly of deep alluvial soils, derived from the denudation of the
primary and metamorphic rocks surrounding the district, the former
 making their appearance in groups of isolated peaks, projecting, as
 it were, from a sea of alluvium. The author considered that this
 alluvium could not have been produced by the action of the existing
 rivers, and suggested that the Indus may formerly have flowed into
 the sea by the Gulf of Cambay, the land at the same time being
 much depressed below its present level.      He indicated the evidence
 in favour of this view furnished by various facts in the geology of
 the district, and referred especially to the mode of occurrence of
 laterite.
    12.  “On   a new Acrodont    Saurian from the Lower Chalk.”      By
James Wood      Mason, Esq.,  F.G.S., of Queen's College, Oxford.
    The author described this reptile, for which he proposed the name
 of Acrodontosaurus Gardneri, as differing from Mosasaurus in the
apparently persistent distinctness of the praemaxillae and their small
development in the middle line, in the more anterior position of the
nasal aperture, which is directed upwards and forwards, in the total
obliteration of the maxillo-praemaxillary suture, and in the absence
from the cylindrical teeth of opposite denticulated ridges.         The

ford, Esq.,     F.G.S.
   The author has examined the Eodents from the caves of Somer
setshire contained in the Taunton Museum, and found that many
of them cannot be referred to species hitherto regarded as belonging
to the fauna contemporary with the Mammoth in Britain.            He enu
merated species of Arvicola (including A. glareola, Schreb., and A.
ratticeps, B\a.s. = Lemmus medius, Nilson, and a species which may
be new, and for which he proposed the provisional name of A.
 Qvlielmi), Lemmus (L. norvegicus, Desm.), Lagomys {L. spdeeus,
Owen), Lepus (L. diluvianus, Pict., L. timidus, Linn., L. hibernicus,
Bell, and L. euniculus, Linn.), Spermophilus (S. erythrogonoides,

            ON A NEW       KIND   OF ELECTRICAL DUST-FIGURES.
                         BY PROFESSOR VON BEZOLD.
 TT is a well-known fact that when two glass plates, coated on one
      side only, are placed with the uncoated sides at a moderate dis
tance apart, while the coated sides are connected with the poles of a
 Ruhmkorff's coil, a luminous phenomenon is observed as soon as the
 apparatus is set to work.
    This is a case of discharge produced by influence, and taking place
between two non-conducting surfaces, just as in Gassiot's tubes ;
in which the same phenomena are observed as in Geissler's tubes,
although the enclosed gas is not in direct contact with the polar wires.
    It appeared interesting to investigate whether the consequences of
 such a discharge produced by induction between insulating surfaces
could be made visible by fine powder, in the same manner as Lich-
 tenberg demonstrated the passage of electricity between a metal and
 an insulator, and as Kundt has recently shown between two me
 tallic  electrodes.
    My    idea was completely confirmed, and it was observed that figures
 of great regularity may be obtained in the way in question.        I will
 give   the  principal experiments    here.
    On the edge of a glass plate with a circular coating underneath,
 three small pieces of glass of 1*6 millim. thickness were laid, and
 on these was placed, with its uncoated side downward, a plate quite
 similar to the first. The lower plate was strewn with lycopodium
 powder.
    When, now, the lower plate was connected with the positive, and
 the upper with the negative pole of a large Ruhmkorff's coil which
 was worked by a single element, and the action continued for about
 a minute, on removing the upper plate it was found that about half
 the powder had been projected against it, and that it formed very
 characteristic figures upon each.
    The entire upper plats was covered with small circles which were

                 Intelligence   and Miscellaneous      Articles.                 393
free from powder and stood out very distinctly against the thickly co
vered ground ; in many of them there was in the middle a small heap
of dust.   The diameter of the circles did not much vary generally ;
only  towards  the edge of the coating did they seem somewhat larger.
   The lower plate exhibited no placea free from powder, but only
small solid circles, and upon them little stars.
   About the edge of the coatings (that is, upon the corresponding
places of the uncoated sides) there was a circle almost free from pow
der, which was enclosed in a ring which gradually thinned off towards
the outside. When the action of the apparatus was continued a little
longer, nearly all the powder travelled towards this external ring, and
the parts of the plate over the coatings were almost free from dust.
   If the two poles be interchanged, the figures become reversed ; that
is, the dust-free places are found upon the lower, and the stars upon
the upper plate.
   If the distance of the two plates is made somewhat greater, by
placing on each other several of the above-mentioned pieces of glass,
the diameter of the figures also increases, as is seen from the follow
ing Table, in which d=l'6 millim. : —
                                            Diameter of the circles.

   Here, as the distance increases, the dust-ring moves wider and
wider outwards.
   An exchange of the plates for such as are of thinner glass, or a
change in the diameter of the coatings, has no influence on the
figures ; but it is necessary to alter the duration of action of the ap
paratus to obtain similar figures under circumstances thus altered.
    It may seem surprising that the figures are so similar to Lichten-
berg's ; but it is more surprising that on the plate with whose coat
ing the positive pole is connected, and upon which, therefore, from
electrical laws, negative electricity must accumulate, the stars ap
pear, while the regular circles are exhibited upon the other plate.
    But this apparent contradiction is removed            if,
                                                     instead of the nu
merous breaks which Ruhmkorff's coil yields,       single one
                                                        a        effected   is
by hand, and thus      single discharge passes through the system.
                         a
    This being premised, by correctly regulating the inducing current,
only a  small number of figures are obtained, but these are very beau
tiful and like Lichtenberg's.     For       observed that both plates,
                                           it     is
 even the upper one, which was not covered with dust, had become
 coated with  nuniform layer of the powder, which was only interrupted
 by individual figures.
    On the plate whose coating        connected with the positive pole
                                      is
 these figures are very regular circles free from powder, whose ex
 ternal diameter     pretty well double that of the thickly powdered
                    is

    On the other plate are also circles of the external diameter of the

ring of the figure described above.        In their middle are very delicate
stars, for the most part with four or five rays.
   Hence we have here both the positive and the negative Lichten-
berg's figures, and upon those plates, too, upon which, from the laws
of induction, they ought to be.
   The diameters of these figures are independent of the thickness of
the plates, of the size of the coatings, and even of the intensity of the
inducing battery, provided this does not exceed certain limits, but
vary with the distance of the plates.
   The influence of this element is shown in the following Table,
which contains the mean value of several observations : —
        Distance of the              External diameter    Internal diameter
             plates.                     of the ring.        of the ring.

   An increase in the strength of      the inducing battery is accompanied
by an increase, but not by a change in the shape, of the figures.
 Only when they exceed a certain limit do the figures become indi
stinct through overlapping.
   If the interruption of the current be repeated, and if in the interval
an observation be made, it can be seen how, first, the number of
figures increases, as by each break new ones are formed, and how,
finally, by overlapping they pass into those first described.
   If instead of the glass plates ebonite plates are used, the same
figures appear, though somewhat larger.            Also if the plate coated on
one side be replaced by one coated on both sides, or by a metal
plate, figures are formed on each, the more minute description of
which must be reserved for another opportunity. — Siteungsbericht

                  ACTION OP SODIUM ON ACETIC ETHER.
   An important step in this controversy has been taken by M. La-
denburg, who has recently sent a note to the Chemical Society of
Berlin, in which he confirms Mr. Wanklyu's observation that pure
acetic ether evolves no hydrogen when sodium acts upon it.                     M.
Ladenburg renders acetic ether free from the last traces of alcohol
by bringing it into contact with a little chloride of silicon, which
attacks alcohol, but is without action on acetic ether.

                            BY DANIEL KIRKWOOD*.
                         I. The Meteors of April 20M.
   In the Astronomische Nachrichten, No. 1632, Dr. Weiss called
attention to the fact that the orbit of the first comet of 1861 very
nearly intersects that of the earth in longitude 210°, the point passed
by the latter at the epoch of the April meteoric shower.               A relation

Philosophical Society.      Read March 4, 1870.

between the meteors and the comet, similar to that recently detected
between the November meteors and the comet of 1 866, was thus sug
gested as probable.           Is this hypothesis in harmony with facts ? and if
nut, are our present data sufficient for determining with any reason
able probability the true period of the April meteors ?
    Dates of the April Shower. — Professor Newton selects the follow
ing from Quetelet's Catalogue as belonging to this period* :
             1.     B.C. 687.           4. a.d. 1093, 1094, 1095, and 1096.

             3.    a.d. 582.            6.    „   1803.
    Period of the First Comet of 1861. — The elements of this body
were     computed by Oppolzer, who assigned it a period of 415f'4.
Now, while it is true that the interval from B.C. 687 to a.d. 1803 is
very nearly equal to 6 periods of 415 years, the slightest examina
tion will show that this period does not harmonize with any of the
intermediate         dates.    This fact, then, without further discussion,
seems fatal to the hypothesis that the period of the meteors is nearly
equal to that of the comet.
    What is the probable period of the ring ? — The showers of 1093-96
aud 1 122-23 at once suggest a period of from 26 to 30 years. The
nodal passage of the densest portion of the ring at the former epoch
may be placed anywhere between 1093 and 1096, and that of the
latter in either 1122 or 1123.              The entire interval from B.C. 687
to a.d. 1803 is 2490 years, or 88 periods of 28^295 each ; and the
known dates are all satisfied by the following scheme ; —
b.c. 687          to b.c.   IS           672'0O0 years=24 periods of 18-000r each.
         15       to a.d. 582            597 000    „ =21     „      28 429    „
a.d. 582          to    „ 1093714         511-714  „  =18      „     28 429

  „   1122143 to        „ 1803           680 857   „  =24     „      28-369    „
    These coincidences indicate a period of about 28^             t years, corre
sponding to an ellipse whose major axis is 18*59.                 Hence the dis
tance of the aphelion is very nearly equal to the mean distance of
Uranus.         It will also be observed that the time of revolution, which
seems to have been somewhat lengthened about the Christian era,
was previously one third of the period of Uranus.
                     II.   The Meteors   of December Uth-VMh.
    In   the catalogue of Quetelet          we find the four following extraor
 dinary displays         which   belong undoubtedly to this period.         Obser
 vations made in England, 1862, indicate also a more than ordinary
number of meteors at the December epoch in that year.
     1. a.d. 901.        "The whole hemisphere was filled with those me
 teors called falling stars, the ninth of Dhu'lhajja (288th year of the
 Hegira) from midnight till morning, to the great surprise of the be
 holders in Egypt." — Modern part of the Universal History, 8vo,
vol. ii. p. 281. Lond. 1780.             The date of this phenomenon corre
 sponds     to  the   December     epoch, a.d. 901.

    4. 1830, 1833, and 1836.       The maximum seems to have occurred
 in 1833, when as many       as ten meteors were seen simultaneously.
 " Dans la nuit du 11 au       12 decembre, on vit, a Parme une grande
 quantity d'etoiles filantes de differentes grandeurs, qui se dirigeaient
 presque toutes avec une grande vitesse vers le S.S.E.        A 10 heures
 et ^, entre les seules constellations du Be'lier et du Taureau, on en
 compta environ une dizaine."
    5. (Doubtful) 1861, 1862, and 1863.             Maximum probably in
 1862.     The meteors at this return were far from being compa
 rable in numbers with the ancient displays.            The shower, how
 ever, was distinctly observed.      R. P. Greg, Esq., of Manchester,
 England, says the period for December 10th- 12th was, in 1862,
 " exceedingly well defined " *.
    These dates indicate a period of about 29£ years. Thus :
            901 to 930                1 period of 29-000 years.
            930 to 1571             22 periods of 29-136 years.
           1571 to 1833               9 periods of 29-111 years.
           1833 to 1862               1 period of 29 000 years.
                III.   The Meteors  of  October  \hth-2\st.
   The showers of the following years (see Quetelet's Catalogue)
 belong to this epoch : —
    1. 288. "Apparition en Chine."
   2. 1436 and 1439.       In each year a remarkable apparition was
observed in China.
   3. 1743. (Quoted from Herrick, in Silliman's Journal for April
 1841.)    "A clear night, great shooting of stars between 9 and 10
o'clock, all shot from S.W. to N.E. [Qu. N.E. to S.W. ?] One like
a comet in the meridian very large, and like fire with a long broad
train after it which lasted several minutes ; after that was a train like

   4. 1798. "Brandos marque, a Goettingue, un grand nombre
d'etoiles filantes dans les observations simultanees qu'il fait avec

   These dates indicate a period of about 27| years : —
         288 to 1439            42 periods of 27*405 years each.

   If these periods are correct, it is a remarkable coincidence that the
aphelion distances of the meteoric rings of April 18th to 20th,
October 15th to 21st, November 14th, and December 1 1th to 13th,
as well as those of the comets 18661 and 18671 are all nearly
equal to the mean distance of Uranus.
    ON THE    DIATHERMANCY OF A SERIES OF SUBSTANCES FOR
            OBSCURE HEAT.        BY DR. SCHULTZ-8ELLACK.
   For the heat radiated by lampblack at 100° most substances are
entirely opaque, even in layers less than 1 millim. in thickness. But
a few substances are known which even in thicker layers transmit a
greater proportion of this heat — namely, rock-salt, fluor-spar, sul
phur, sulphate of carbon, iodine in solution, sylvine.      Some of these

substances    are elements, and some are chlorine, fluorine, and sulphur
compounds.        I have found that not only all chlorides, but also bro
mides, iodides, and fluorides of the simple substances, and also a
number of sulphides which could be obtained in a state suitable for
this investigation, have the property of transmitting a considerable
proportion of the heat from lampblack.              These substances have also
something in common as regards their thermocrose.

percentages of the value of the deflections of the reflecting galvano
meter produced by direct radiation.

   Most of the substances were not quite homogeneous ; so that part
of the heat must also have been lost by diffusion and by reflection.
   Chloride of silver and bromide of silver are obtained, by fusion in
an atmosphere of chlorine or bromine respectively, as perfectly trans
parent masses, which by being again fused between thin glass plates
acquire smooth surfaces. The salts adhere to the glass with extra-,
ordinary tenacity ; heated concentrated nitric acid, which does not
perceptibly attack the salts, ascends by capillary attraction between
the glass and the silver-salt and separates them.                Chloride of silver
appears    perfectly   colourless, bromide     of silver  of a  clear amber colour.
   Chloride of potassium, bromide of potassium, and iodide of potas
sium give, when fused, perfectly transparent masses, if the substances
are used in clear crystals as obtained by evaporating their solutions
at ordinary temperatures. A clear bright yellow plate of zincblende
was used which Professor Rose gave me for investigation ; the cryolite
plate used was turbid in consequence of numerous fine cracks and slits.
    Vitreous selenium is obtained in flat plates by fusing and pressing
it between glass plates. Plates of less than 1 millim. thickness
only transmit a narrow band in the extreme red of the solar spec
trum ; plates of more than 2 millims. thickness are scarcely per
ceptibly penetrated by intense sunlight.
    Plates of mixtures of arsenic sulphide with sulphur are also ob
tained in the same manner. These mixtures, when they contain at
most three parts of sulphur to one of sulphide of arsenic, solidify to
amorphous soft masses, which only become hard and brittleafter weeks.

  ON THE     INFLUENCE        OF SOUNDING-VIBRATIONS           ON   THE MAGNE
                   TISM OF IRON.         BY DR. E. WARBURG.
    Matteuccit, and after him Villari I, have examined the change
which the magnetic momentum of an iron bar undergoes when it is
lengthened by a pull. Villari's numerous experiments prove that
the magnetism of an iron wire which is placed in a magnetizing
spiral, and has attained a stable condition which is no longer altered

by agitation, is altered in the opposite direction          by extensions and
contractions of the wire.
     According to the prevalent views of the nature of magnetism, it is
probable that the changes in the length and in the magnetic mo
ment take place nearly simultaneously.           If this is correct, when ex
pansions and contractions succeed each other at very short intervals,
changes in the magnetism must occur in a similar manner.
     An iron bar 1890 millions. in length, which makes the longitudinal
vibrations of the fundamental note, performs about 1300 entire vi
brations in a second. Hence at the nodal points of the bar the
transition from the greatest condensation to the greatest expansion
takes place in the t           of a second.
     The author has found in fact that, provided the iron is sufficiently
 soft, even in this case, in spite of the smallness of the elongations
and notwithstanding the rapidity of the oscillations, very appreciable
variations in the magnetic moment accompany the periodical changes
 in density.
      A change in the magnetism is most easily proved by the induc
 tion-currents which it produces. But if equal and opposite changes
 in the magnetism succeed each other, alternating induction-currents
 are produced which cannot be detected by the ordinary galvano
 meters. Yet W. Weber was able to demonstrate the existence of
 such alternating currents by the electrodynamometer, which is in
  different to the direction of the currents which traverse it. W. Weber
 used the above instrument *, which is of his invention, to demonstrate
  the alternating induction-currents which are produced in an induction-
  spiral by the periodical motions of the free ends of a transversely
  sounding magnetic steel har.          I myself have used the same instru
  ment to demonstrate the induction-currents which are produced in
  an induction-spiral by the periodical changes of the magnetic moment
  on the nodal point of an iron wire surrounded by a magnetizing spiral.
      A piece of commercial iron wire 1 890 millims. in length was firmly
  fastened in the middle, so that, when rubbed with a piece of leather
  coated with powdered resin, it produced the longitudinal funda
  mental note, and thus a nodal point was formed in the middle.
   One half of this wire was almost entirely surrounded by a magnet
   izing spiral ; on the other half, at the node, was a short induction-
   spiral of copper wire, while the rest was free, so that the wire could
   be rubbed.      The short induction-spiral was inserted into a circuit
   containing   a  reflecting dynamometer, and the motions of the mirror
   were observed by means of a scale and a telescope.              The magnet
   izing current    was  furnished  by two  Bunsen's     elements.    When the
   rod was strongly rubbed, a deflection was obtained in the galvano
   meter of from thirty to fifty divisions.       When the induction-spiral
   was pushed on the free end of that part of the wire which was left
   uncovered by the magnetizing spiral, no deflection was obtained in
   the galvanometer.        It must thence be concluded that the induction-
    currents in the first case are not produced by the backward and
    forward gliding of the magnetic particles of iron, which gliding is
   least in the middle (that is, at the node) and is most powerful at the
                      * Electrodyn.  Maassbest. vol. i. § 16.

free ends  of the loops, but is due to alterations of the magnetism,
 owing to the alternate condensations and expansions, which are
greatest at the nodes and are null at the free ends.
    When the dynamometer was replaced by a galvanometer, the
needle of the latter exhibited no deflection, but only irregular move
ments. These arose from the variations of the magnetic iron wire
inseparably connected with the rubbing ; for those actions took place
if the variations of the wire were produced without any note. It is
therefore to be concluded that the action upon the dynamometer is
to be ascribed to alternate opposite induction-currents of equal
 strength, which indicate alternately opposite equal changes in the
magnetism.
    Of other commercial iron wires, of similar dimensions to that of
the wire previously used, two did not at all exhibit the phenomena
described on sounding, while another did so, but extremely feeble.
These wires were now heated in the middle, where a node was
formed when the fundamental note was sounded, and the experi
 ment was repeated.       All three iron wires now exhibited the pheno
menon in question so powerfully as to produce a deflection of 200-
300 divisions of the dynamometer.              The wire used in the first
experiments,    when   heated   at the  node,  gave also, when powerfully
 rubbed, a deflection of 500-600 divisions.           A steel wire, on the
 contrary,  after  strong heating     did  not  exhibit  the phenomena in
question.    Matteucci     states, in  accordance  with  these results, that
the magnetic moment of soft iron wires is more strongly changed
by drawing than is that of hard wires.
    To judge the strength of the effect obtained, it may be stated for
instance, that in one experiment, on opening the magnetizing spiral
(that is, by the almost total disappearance of the entire magnetism
 of the iron), a current was induced in the induction -spiral ^which
only produced a deflection of three divisions in the dynamometer ;
while the action of the currents produced by continuous sounding in
the induction-spiral was so far accumulated in the dynamometer that
the bifilar coil produced a deflection of an area of 460 divisions.
    An increase in the magnetism of the soft-iron wire, whether by
 an increase of the current-producing        elements or by using several
magnetizing spirals, gave no corresponding increase in the magnetic
variations on sounding.         Just in like manner, in Villari's experi
 ments a strengthening of the magnetizing current was not always
succeeded by a stronger change of the magnetic moment in conse
quence of traction ; and even when it was, only in the case of cer
tain wires.
    When instead of two elements only one was used, feebler actions
were obtained ; but even when the magnetizing current was opened
the remanent magnetism of the soft iron wire was sufficient to
produce a deflection of from fifty to sixty divisions in the dynamo
meter when the bar was made to sound.
    Considerably smaller variations of the magnetic moment were
indicated by the dynamometer in a node of the first upper tone of the
bar of 2600 vibrations in a second. — Monatsbericht der Berliner

       GENTLEMEN,
WILL         you allow me to lay before your readers a theory re
          garding nebulae and comets which I believe is in a great
 degree new, and which appears to me to afford a satisfactory ex
 planation of the phenomena observed in those remarkable bodies?
    The theory may be stated as follows:—There exist in space
 large masses of matter in a gaseous, non-luminous, and there
 fore invisible state. This matter is necessarily very rare, because
 there is no solid nucleus to condense it by            attraction. As  its
 long   as   amass        of
                       such matter remains          itself,        by
                                                               continues           it
gaseous, non-luminous, and invisible.            will, however, some

times happen that two masses          gas having
                                               of      chemical affinity
                                                                     a
for each other rush together under the influence            their mutual      of

chemical union may only be able to exist as a gas so long as it
remains at a great heat.       After the compound has formed, it will
cool down, and may ultimately assume the liquid or solid state.
    When liquid or solid matter is formed, it will gradually ag
gregate and gravitate towards the centre of the nebula, and will
form into a nucleus there.        It is probable that chemical action
will not be the only source of light and heat, but that they
will also be produced by the loss of motion of the solid and
liquid parts moving through the gases.
    This theory attempts to explain how nebulae originally came
into existence and assumed the shapes they actually have. And
in this it differs from that of Sir William Herschel, who only
speculated on what would be the subsequent motions and beha
viour of nebulous matter after it had once been formed.
    I  will now proceed to examine what account this theory ren
 ders of the phenomena observed in nebulae.
    And first, I think, if we admit that a great part of the matter
forming a nebula is invisible, we remove the immense difficult)'
 which we otherwise experience in attempting to conceive how
nebulae have assumed or can retain their extraordinary shapes and
yet be subject to the law of gravitation.
    The researches of Iluggins prove that many of the nebulae
 are gaseous self-luminous masses, whilst the spectra of others
 prove the existence of solid or liquid matter.         These last, being
 generally   those which   are  most   easily   resolved, would be those
 which have been longest in existence, and which, therefore, should
contain most liquid and solid matter.
    The curious shapes of the nebulae are well explained on this
 theory.
    Thus the spiral nebulae would       be produced by two masses of
 gas rushing together and forming        an eddy in which they become
 mingled with each other.        If any detached portion of one gas
 got mixed up with the other gas, it would be drawn out by the
 eddy into an elongated spiral form, the surface of which would
 become visible by the light
 produced by the chemical ac-                         ^      \
 tion.     This
 would be the kind       of ne
 bula which would       be   pro
 duced when the two masses
 of gas did not differ greatly
 in size, and rushed together
 in a line not very oblique to
 the line joining their centres
 of gravity.

to the centre of gravity of the larger

be most accelerated, it would become
drawn out into an elongated spiral

mass.    At each revolution it would graze the
surface of the larger mass, and the elliptic orbit
would gradually be changed into a circular one.
It would at length come to revolve about the
larger mass in such a manner as continually to
graze the surface, and an annular nebula would
be the result.                                        Nebula in Lyra.
    Those nebulae, like the large one in Andromeda, in which
streaks of darkness cross the bright parts,
offer the greatest difficulty in their expla
nation.
    We might imagine      that a mass of rare
gas has become entangled between twomasses
of dense gas, and that the masses of dense
gas, being attracted to one another, crush out
the rare gas into a thin sheet, which, looked
at edgewise, presents the appearance of a dark
streak.
    Some of the nebulae of this kind have
nuclei ; and it may be remarked that the po
sition of the nucleus, which will be the centre
of gravity of the nebula, is in the position in
which we should expect to see it if the appa
rently vacuous streaks were in reality filled
with matter.                                      Lsssell, p1. 5. fig. 21 A.
                        Lassell, pi. 5. tig. -Jl.
    Many of the nebulae are very much diffused, and in shape
very irregular ; but even these show certain characteristics which
seem to indicate their mode of formation.          The extreme faint-
ness of their light favours the hypothesis that they are not lu
minous throughout, but that their luminosity occurs only here
and there in comparatively thin shells.
    Again, if these nebulae were luminous throughout, the inten
sity of their light should be greatest where the thickness of mat
ter looked through is greatest, and should fade away at the
boundaries, whereas, if the visible parts occurred in shells, the
boundaries should appear brighter than other parts ; for at the
boundaries the line of sight would be very oblique to the shell,
and a greater thickness of luminous matter would be looked
through.     Now if we examine any of the irregular nebula, we
see some parts of it ending abruptly with a clearly defined out

          Mr. A. S. Davis    on a Theory   of Nebula and Comets.   403
line, whilst in other parts the light gradually fades away into
darkness.   We may suppose that in the one case we are looking
edgewise  at a shell, so that the line of sight is tangential to its
surface, whilst in the other case we are looking at a part where
the luminous shell gradually thins out.      Now in the first case
we find that the light increases towards the border, consistently
with the supposition that the visible parts are in thin shells.
   This peculiarity    is,  apprehend, what Professor Bond and
                            I
Mr. Lassell refer to when they speak of the scroll-like appear
ance of the nebula in Orion.
     In those nebulae which appear to have assumed       amore stable
form, as in the elliptic and circular nebula;, the light diminishes
from the centre to the circumference.
   These nebulae may be in       later stage of formation
                                   a                        they may

the gases may have taken place, and in consequence they may
be more or less luminous throughont.          Their shape, and the
fact that they are generally resolvable in the telescope, point to
the conclusion that they have been        long time in existence.

   Before turning to the subject of comets,         may remark that
                                                    I
the theory that there are large masses of invisible gas traversing
space, affords an explanation of the sudden temporary outbursts
in the intensity of certain stars.     Such an outburst might occur
ifa  star became enveloped with        a mass of gas with which         it
could chemically combine.
   It also explains the phenomena of periodical stars. Mr. Hug-
gins has found that the diminution in the intensity of the light
of these stars    isdue to an increase in the number and size of
the absorption-bands in their spectra.
   It has already been suggested that large opaque bodies may
be revolving in orbits round such stars aDd periodically obscu
ring their light.     We have only to suppose that large masses of
invisible gas  instead  of opaque bodies revolve about them, to ex
plain the phenomenon in accordance with spectroscopic obser
vation.
I    will now examine what account the present theory gives of
comets.
   There are some reasons for supposing that the sun itself        is   a
nebulous star, or that  it  enveloped
                              is               by
                                          matter extending to an
immense distance beyond its visible photosphere.      The pheno
menon of the zodiacal light, the bands of meteoric matter passed
through     the earth in its revolution about the sun, the retar
             by
dation experienced     comets, all point to this conclusion.
                       by
   We cannot suppose that this envelope consists of solid or
liquid matter only, without the presence of gaseous matter; for
at no known temperature can liquid or solid matter exist in             a

406   Mr. A. S. Davis    on a Theory   of Nebula        and Comets.
vacuum without evaporation.      If, then, we suppose for a moment
that solid matter exists without being enveloped by gas, it will
immediately begin to evaporate and form an atmosphere about
itself. This atmosphere will be very rare and very extensive,
as the central mass, being comparatively       very small, will exert
but a feeble attraction on it.
    Or, again, if we suppose that meteoric matter unenveloped by
gas would not acquire an atmosphere by evaporation, it would
do so in another manner ; for it is certain that some of the
 meteoric bands approach very near to the sun in their perihe
 lion. These would attract to themselves a part of the sun's at
 mosphere, which they would carry away with them on their de
 parture ; and portions of this they would, in their turn, part with
 to every meteor which came within a sufficiently small distance
 from them.
    Graham has found that meteoric matter which has fallen to
 the earth gives evidence of having been exposed, when at a high
 temperature, to hydrogen existing under a pressure of several
atmospheres.
   We conclude,    then, that the sun is surrounded by an enve
lope  of gas,  which  is not a true solar atmosphere, but is the ag
gregation   of the atmospheres of numberless meteoric bodies re
volving around it.
   Now M. Hoek has shown that comets are detached portions
of large masses of matter ; and it has been suggested that these
large masses may be nebulae.        Admitting this, a comet, before
its entrance into the solar system, will consist of a solid or liquid
nucleus surrounded by a large mas»of very rare invisible gas.
On its approach to the sun, the nucleus will make its way most
easily into the solar envelope, and the comet will enter with its
tail directed away from the sun.       A chemical combination will
take place between the tail of the comet and some of the gaseous
elements of the solar envelope; and where this combination oc
curs, the gases will become visible from the light evolved, and,
if the compound formed be in a solid or liquid state, from the
light also which it reflects from the sun — or      as probably would
                                                  if,
be the case, the matter be in   a  state of minute subdivision, from
light scattered   by that kind of dispersion which Professor Tyn-
dall has lately shown  is   produced   by finely divided matter.
   On passing through its perihelion, the comet loses            great
                                                                 a
part of its tail, which soon cools down and becomes mingled
with the rest of the solar envelope.
   On leaving the sun, the tail begins to increase, from the ad
dition to it  of matter rendered gaseous     by  the heat of the sun.
Those parts of the gas where chemical action has taken place
being heated, and therefore rendered specifically lighter than

       Mr. A. S. Davis     on a Theory    of Nebula and Comets.         407
 the unheated invisible gases, will have a tendency to escape out
 of the solar envelope in addition to that which they possess
 from their momentum in common with the rest of the comet.
 Hence the comet will depart with its tail directed away from
 the sun.
    The hollow appearance of many comets, and the isolation of
 the nucleus from the vertex of the coma, are in accordance with
 this theory.
    On a comet's approach to the sun, it often happens that a tail
 of immense length is formed in a very few days.              It is usually
 supposed    that the  matter forming the tail has all been projected
 from the head within the time of its first becoming visible, and
 consequently that it has moved with enormous velocity in a di
rection opposed to the sun's attraction.           Hence it has been con
jectured   that the matter  forming   the  tail is not subject to the same
 mechanical laws as those which govern all other known matter.
    On the present hypothesis there is no need to assume this
 enormous velocity.       A comet, in fact, enters the solar envelope
 with a tail of invisible gas. It may be that chemical union can
 not take place between this gas and the sun's envelope until
 the heat of the sun, acting on the head of the tail, has set up
 chemical action or combustion — until, in short, the comet has
 been lit by the sun's heat.       When once combustion has com
menced,    it would   spread  into the  tail with prodigious velocity.
    Tails of comets have been observed to form with enormous
 speed only on their approach towards the sun.             The tails which
form when a comet is receding from the sun are produced with
comparative slowness: this jve should expect; for in this case
there is not already in existence a tail needing simply to be lit
to become visible.
    The more any portion of the gas of a comet becomes removed
from the nucleus, the greater will be the volume it occupies,
 because of the diminution in the pressure due to a diminution
 in the attractive force of the nucleus.        This will account for the
 spreading shape of the tail of a comet.
    We may explain in a similar way the increase in the size of a
comet as it recedes from the sun ; for the pressure of the solar
envelope upon it will become less as its distance from the sun
becomes greater.       M. Valz has attempted an explanation of this
fact in a somewhat similar manner.            He conceives that the in
 crease in the size is due to a diminution in the pressure of the
 aetherial medium, which he supposes to be denser in the neigh
 bourhood of the sun than elsewhere.              Sir J. Herschel objects
 to this explanation, on the ground that we must suppose that the
 aHher does not pervade the matter composing the comet.
    This objection does not apply to the present explanation.

nebula  (Lassell, pi. 2. fig. 9, Royal Astronomical Society's
Memoirs, vol. xxxvi.) shown on page 403.
   The parts represented by the medium shading and the light
shading denote, respectively, the large mass of rarer gas and the
small mass of denser gas.     The dark shading denotes the part
rendered visible by chemical action.
   Immediately below is shown the mode of formation           of an
annular nebula.    The mass of gas indicated by the medium
shading must be smaller than that indicated by the light shading,
and also rarer.  If it were denser, it would ultimately enter into

                    LIX.    Ther mo-chemical Researches.
                        By M. Julius Thomsen*.
               Part I.— Berthollet's      Theory of Affinity.
        his Essay on Chemical Statics, Berthollet laid it down as a
IN   rule of the action of acids on salts, that a base when in presence
of twoacids tends to divide itself between them in proportion to the
bulks of those acids and their respective affinities for that base.
But up to the present time no one has been able to submit this
theoretical    law to    a satisfactory experimental verification.       M.
Thomsen thought to accomplish this by thermo-chemical                    re
searches.      For since different acids disengage different quantities
of heat in combining with the same base, the decomposition of
a salt by an acid must be accompanied by a thermic effectt,
which will be greater the more complete the decomposition, and
which ought to admit of measurement.
   The aim of the present memoir is the special study of the
reactions of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid on sulphate of
soda ; but each of them requires a very great number of experi
mental determinations.           Thus, for the first we must know the
thermic effect produced in the following reactions : —
    1. Neutralization of sulphuric acid by soda.
    2. Neutralization of nitric acid by soda.
    3. Decomposition of sulphate of soda by nitric acid.
   4. Decomposition of nitrate of soda by sulphuric acid.
    5. Supersaturation of sulphate of soda by sulphuric acid.
    6. Supersaturation of nitrate of soda by nitric acid.
    7. Action of sulphuric acid on Ditric acid.
    Reactions     3, 4, 5, and 6 must, moreover, be studied with
varying proportions of the substances concerned in the action.
   The author observes that, iu order to derive' any advantage
from these data, they must be known with great accuracy.                 He
thinks it is necessary that the approximation should be at least
to within    \   per cent.; and he believes that this was attained
in his   determinations.        He adds that he could use no previous
determinations, because they were far from approaching this de
gree of precision.        Thus the heats determined by Messrs. Favre
and Silbermann for the neutralization of nitric, hydrochloric,
hydrobromic, and hydriodic acids are from 10 to 12 per cent.

too high, whilst that which they have obtained for sulphuric acid
is nearly exact.
    The experimental method employed was that of mixtures, the
calorimeter being carefully preserved from all external radiation.
The temperatures were determined by means of thermometers
calibrated and compared with the greatest care, and on which the
      of a degree could be read off with certainty. The weights
of the liquid mixed were usually 450 grammes of each of the so
lutions. In the majority of cases these solutions contained 200
equivalents of water to one of the reacting body ; sometimes,
however, solutions two or three times as dilute had to be em
ployed.
    For solutions thus dilute we can, without fear of an appreci
able error in the results, calculate the thermic effects by merely
taking into consideration the weight of the water.      Moreover, as
the temperature soon acquires a slate of equilibrium (in less
than a minute), whenever the variation in temperature does not
exceed a degree, it can be proved that it remains for several
 minutes without appreciable change, so that there is no occasion
 for any correction in the result obtained.     In the few cases in
 which this variation is more considerable, the thermometer must
 be read every minute from the moment at which the mixture
 was made; then it can be calculated what the maximum tempe
 rature must have been, independently of external influences.
    The value in water of the vessel used as the calorimeter, and
 of the thermometer, had been determined by experiment ; it was
 either 13 grammes or 9'7, according as one or the other of the
 two vessels intended for these experiments was used.
    The exactitude of the method was established by numerous
 experiments, in which water of different temperatures was mixed.
 The maxima of error in forty-two experiments were +7 and
  — 8 thermal units.      In a series of eighty-eight comparative
 experiments, the departure from the mean only once reached 9
 thermal units, and in eighty-four of these series it was less than 5.
 Hence we may assume that the possible maximum of error in each
 determination does not exceed +5 thermal units; and as the
 quantity of matter employed in each of them represents in ge

            Discussion   of  the Results  of these Experiments.
    It follows from the preceding experiments, that when nitric
acid or hydrochloric acid acts on sulphate of soda, they give rise
to an absorption of heat, whilst the reaction of sulphuric acid on
the nitrate or chloride disengages heat.
    It is evident that the thermic effect which accompanies these
reactions may be regarded as the measure of the chemical de
composition ; and experiment confirms this notion. When an
equivalent of sulphuric acid acts on an equivalent of nitrate of
soda, the same product is obtained as when an equivalent of nitric
acid acts on an equivalent of sulphate, or as when an equivalent
of each of the two acids acts on an equivalent of soda simul
taneously.
   Now it follows, from the thermochemical principles previously
explained by the author and admitted by all without dispute,
that the heat disengaged by the reaction of three bodies (A, B,
and A') is the same, whatever may be the order in which they
react :
       (A, B, A') = (A, B) + (AB, A!) = (A', B) + (A' B, A)          ;
from which it follows that
                 (AB, A')  - (A'B, A) =    (A', B) -  (A, B)  ;
which, in the present      case, may be  interpreted thus :     the difference
between    the thermic effects produced by the reaction of sulphuric
acid on nitrate of soda, and by that of nitric acid on the sulphate, is
equal to the difference of the heats disengaged in the neutralisation
of soda by the two acids.
   In fact, experiment gave for these differences: —
                                           Thermal units.
                      15689       -13617 = 2072
                         288- (-1752) =2040.

             M.   J.     Thomsen's Thermo -cliemical Researches.                     415
   The difference of the two results is 32 thermal units, or 2 for
every thousand of the heat of neutralization ; now the exactitude
of experiments cannot attain a closer approximation. In the
case in which hydrochloric acid replaces nitric acid, we have
                                                     Thermal    units.

                                 244- (-1682) =          1926,
the agreement being as satisfactory as possible.
   We shall now show how to calculate the magnitude of the
decomposition for the reaction of an equivalent of nitric acid on
an equivalent of sulphate of soda.
   Let B be the soda, A the sulphuric acid, A' the nitric acid,
and x the proportion of decomposed sulphate of soda ; we shall
have in the liquid after the reaction,
                       (1   —x)   BA + * BA' + xA      + (1    -   x) A'.
   We may regard the total reaction,                           and the thermic      effect
which accompanies                it,
                    as the result of  series of simple reactions,
                                                       a

   The sum of these effects must be equal to the total thermic
effect shown in the reaction      hence   ;

   We may deduce the value of x from this empirically,    utilizing            by
the previously cited experiments which give the thermic effect
resulting from the action of sulphuric acid in various proportions
on sulphate of soda. We thus find that the preceding formula                            is
very exactly satisfied   the value x =

thermal units, a result which agrees within 20 thermal units
with the result of the experiment.
   By some analogous calculations we find that the thermic effect
produced in the inverse reaction of sulphuric acid on nitrate of
soda would be expressed by the formula
 (1     -x)2072 + (1-*) (NaO SO3,^^      = 299 thermal units,

whilst the experiment gave 288 thermal units.                Hence it fol
 lows from these experiments that : —
    (a) When an equal number of equivalents of soda, sulphuric
acid, and nitric acid are placed together in the same solution,
 two-thirds of the soda enter into combination with the nitric
acid and one-third with the sulphuric acid.
    (b) The division of the base between the two acids occurs in
the same manner, whether it has been introduced in the state of
sulphate or in that of nitrate.
         Hence nitric acid has twice the tendency to combine with
        (c)

acid must absorb 1691 thermal                   units; experiment gave 1682.
The inverse reaction of sulphuric acid on chloride of sodium
must disengage heat, 258 thermal units; experiment       gave

     [It might at first sight seem strange that the avidity of acids for bases                       .

    The author has made some analogous experiments with a great
number of acids.       In none of those which he has examined
is the avidity equal to that of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid ;
but it is in some superior, in others inferior to that of sulphuric
acid; in some it is almost nothing.        He announces the forth
coming publication    of these results, and   passes now to the com
parison of his observations with Berthollet's law.
    According to Berthollet, the division of a base between two
acids takes place in proportion to its affinity for those acids and to
their respective masses. Now the masses are proportional to the
chemical equivalents A and A' of the acids, and to the numbers
a and a' of equivalents of each of them which are placed in the
presence of the base.      Therefore if we denote their respective
affinities for that base by x and          xi,
                                        we shall have for the ratio
according   to which the division of the base      effected —
                                                         is     :
                                   _   akx
But that which Berthollet designated the affinity of the acids
was no other than that which was called their capacity of satura
tion — that   to say, the inverse of their chemical equivalents
               is                                               so         ;
that this formula becomes simply
                                       a
and the base ought to divide itself between two acids in propor
tion to the number of equivalents of the latter.
    Hence, in the presence of equal equivalents of sulphuric acid
and nitric acid, soda ought to divide itself equally between them.
Therefore Berthollet's law      not confirmed
                                  is                     by
                                                   experiment.  The
majority  of modern  authors  have   interpreted the law of Berthol
let in a sense less conformable to its strict expression, but more
in  harmony with the ideas which have given rise to the theory of
chemical equivalents,        by
                           attributing to the word affinity    sense   a
analogous to that which its author attributes to the term avidity,
compared   a   bibasic acid with two monobasic acids, so that, the relative
energies of these acids not being very different, the division occurs in such  a
manner as to produce     a neutral nitrate and bisulphate — equivalent quan
                                                 a
tities of sulphuric acid and nitric acid or hydrochloric acid remaining free
in the liquid, as may be seen from the formula —     :
    3NaO, SO'+3HO, NO*=2NaO, NO»+HO, NaO, 2SO»+HO, NO«
                                  + HO, SO'.
  If we   assume that this    the principal cause of the division which the
                             is
base undergoes,     remains to be known whether the influence of the degree
                    it
of energy of the acids has not the effect of slightly modifying this state of
equilibrium.   But in order to be able to verify this supposition,it  would be
necessary to attribute to the experimental data    precision of which they do
                                                     a
not appear susceptible, for reasons which  I shall hereafter explain. — CM,]

and by saying that the division of the base takes place in
proportion to the number of equivalents of the acids and to their

   This formula would well apply to the reaction of an equivalent
of nitric acid on an equivalent of soda, on the supposition that
r^1=\.              But       if   we try

culate the thermic effects corresponding to these various reactions,
we obtain results which in no way accord with those furnished
by experiment*.
   Thus Berthollet's theory does not accord with experiment even
in the form under which it is usually presented.  A formula very
different from that of Berthollet has been proposed by M.
Guldbergt.
  Let A and B     be two bodies which by their reaction produce
the bodies C and D (thus, in the present case, A would be sul
phate of soda, B nitric acid, C nitrate of soda, D sulphuric acid) ;

that n=2.

caused nitric acid to act in various proportions on combinations
equally varied of soda and sulphuric acid, and afterwards the
thermic effects corresponding to the decompositions indicated
by this theory.

we then     recur to the formula of Berthollct, which is thus con
firmed only in the particular case in which acids of which the avi
dities are equal are compared.
   The author terminates this memoir by the following summary.
    1. When two acids act simultaneously        in an aqueous solution
on a base of which the quantity is insufficient to neutralize them,
that base is divided between them in such a manner that they
form two salts, and a part of the two acids remains free.
    2. Hence it follows that when on a salt an acid reacts of which
the heat of neutralization is greater than that of the acid con
tained in the salt, the reaction is accompanied by a disengage
ment of heat ; in the inverse case there                      is,
                                                    on the contrary, an
absorption of heat.
   3. The division of the base between two acids            not effectedis
according     to the  law of Berthollet — that    to say, proportionally
                                                              is
to the number of equivalents of the two acids.
   4. The division does not take place in the ratio of the affinities
of the base for the two acids,        we take as
                                         if           measure of these

affinities their heats of neutralization.
    5. The force with which the acids tend to be neutralized                       is
what  I   call avidity.

mixture being one equivalent, the base divides itself between

              variations in the temperature of a body which occur
  THEduring          its expansion and condensation had long been re
  garded    as  a  problem in physics, to be determined by purely
 experimental and inductive methods.              Until comparatively quite
  recent times it was held that the cold produced in rapidly ex
 panded air, and the permanent cold in the permanently rarefied
 air of the upper regions of the atmosphere, were alike caused by
 the rarefaction itself, and that the capacity of a body for heat
 increased with its rarity.        This doctrine is now abandoned ; and
 it is now held that the energy or quantity of action of a force
 which causes a condensation is the cause and the measure of the
 evolution of heat in the body which is observed to follow.
     From the moment when this doctrine was regarded as esta
 blished by a sufficiently probable induction to entitle it to be
 made the basis of future inquiry, the science, thenceforth to be
 called the Science of Thermodynamics, had passed from the cate
 gory of inductive sciences and had virtually become a branch of
 dynamics, the business of which is the deduction of the conse
 quences of previously admitted first principles in their applica
 tion to particular cases.        The exhibition of heat was now a con
 sequence of     the  action  of force ; and it was apprehended that its
 production would be found to follow the same laws as connect
 the vis viva of a system of particles with the quantity of action
 which generates it. Now the quantity of vis viva which a given
energy will generate is perfectly well known.               It only remained,
 therefore, to ascertain whether        the  empirical law connecting the
quantity of heat evolved in a given condensation with the con-

      [It is probable that, if the author has considered himself able thus to
generalize conclusions from observations which only comprise so small a
number of cases, it is because these conclusions seemed to him justified by the
very great number of other experiments which he has made and intends to
publish shortly. Without that they would not be sufficiently proved. As we
have already remarked in a preceding note, the ratio according to which soda
divides itself between sulphuric acid on the one side, and nitric and hydro
chloric acids on the other, might be explained simply by the tendency of the
first acid to form a bisulphate, without its being necessary to introduce a
difference of energy or avidity.   In order, however, to be able to form a judg
ment on this theory, we must wait for the rest of the memoirs announced
by M. Thomson.— C. M-l

densing energy was identical with the deductive dynamical law,
and the whole question would be definitively settled.
    In two articles previously communicated to this Magazine,         I
have shown that the assumption that the heat developed in a
compression is proportional to the whole force externally applied
to the surface of the gas, multiplied by the compression, is erro
neous, because the externally applied force necessarily includes
a part, called in D'Alembert's Principle
                                              " the lost force," which
has been already included in the value of the internal forces of
the gas, and that it is the remainder only of the applied forces,
                          "
commonly called the effective forces," which can produce any
such effect as heat or vis viva affecting the temperature or total
energy of the gas.       I shall now complete what I have to say
upon this subject, by showing that the same assumption (the
proportionality of the heat to the whole impressed force) is
equally at variance with the laws of dynamics, which show that
the vis viva produced is proportional only to the action of the
effective forces.
    Let M be the mass of the gas, and let it be contained in a
cylinder the area of whose section is unity, in which a piston
 moves vertically, loaded with a weight P pounds.         Let v be the
 depth  of  gas between the piston    and the bottom of the cylinder,
 and Q the upward pressure upon the lower surface of the piston,
 resulting from the expansive force of the gas.
     The forces P and Q may be considered to be distributively ap
 plied to every separate particle in the gas. The force, therefore,
 which acts upon one such particle          will be     P actiDg verti

 expansion which may take place in the vertical direction ; but
 v, the depth of the gas, =2r, the sum of all the distances of
 adjacent particles situated in one line ; .*. dv = 1.dr.    Now dv is
 the quantity by which the piston descends or ascends during
 condensation or expansion of the gas; it is equal, therefore, to
 the sum of all the extensions or contractions of the constant dis
 tance r between all the particles upon the same vertical line.

 system of forces is iS?nt)4=JSP</Jp — JSQ^, where Pand Qare

this equation to the foregoing case, we get
  i S»it;*=j"2^ Vdr- j2 ^ Q,dr= ftdv- jQrft;=J(P-Q)^.
   It appears, therefore, that, if the identity of the heat evolved
by condensation   with the vis viva generated by the condensing
energy is to be maintained, we must take (P — Q)dv, the effective
part of the applied forces, and not Vdv, as the measure of the
heat produced.    This is in strict conformity with what       have      I
contended for from other considerations.

of them on the retina. An object, to become visible, must then
be placed further than the principal focus of the eye ; if an object
be placed between that focus and the eye, it becomes directly in

emitted by the surface M N, those alone that are situated on the
circle C D can enter into the eye, crossing at the aperture E.
If, now, an object be placed on the cone E C D, this object, act
ing as screen, will intercept some rays of the circle C D, and the
eye will perceive in black the image of this object H on the
circle. The same must take place when the object is in G, pro
vided it be reversed ; then, as all the rays cross at E, the object
G will intercept the     same rays as H (supposed E G — E H), with
that difference, that at G the object, being directly invisible, can
 only act as a screen, while at H it could at the same time act
as a screen for the surface M N and be visible, if it is in the con
ditions of distance above mentioned.            This will explain, then,

    Here the writer explains the erect appearance of the inverted
 pin G by identifying it with the erect appearance of the erect pin
 H, as seen by crossing rays — quite forgetting that, if objects or
 dinarily appear in their true position, a special arrangement
 which   inverts them before they reach the eye will make them
 appear reversed, that H therefore ought to appear reversed;
 and that " why it does not " demands explanation as much as
 " why G does."          He has, by employing two cones of rays,
 brought the pin on to the lens in an inverted position, and yet
 expects that we should see it erect, in defiance of hourly expe
 rience, that just as objects stand upon the lens so they are seen.

      radiant point impinging on retina fig. 5, inasmuch as fig. 6 dif
      fers only from fig. 5 in point of deficiency ; i. e. retina fig. 5 has
      all the light of retina fig. 6, and a great deal more.       Now the
      experiment is here interesting because, by a special arrangement,
      it makes this faint impact of light appreciable ; and this it does
      by excluding the more vigorous impact of light ; i. e. it negatives
      delineation by cones and admits of it by single rays only ; and it
      shows once more, supposing perception to be appreciated nervous
      differentiation, how such differentiation may exist unappreciated.
                          I
          For it may, as shall now show, be proved that both impres
      sions, the stronger and the fainter, do indeed coexist upon the
      retina, and that the exclusive appreciation of the former is owing
      solely to its greater intensity.   For by introducing the means of
      delineation by cones of faint light, both images (the one erect,
      the other inverted) may be made visible at once.         At E, fig. 6,
  l have a hole (§ inch diameter) in the card and cover it with trans-
  l parent paper. The faint light from this enlarged source will
      depict all points of the pin by cones of rays, which cross a little
      behind the crystalline, and consequently give a tracing of the
      pin head upward on the retina, head downward to perception.
      Now let a small hole be pierced in the transparent paper to do
     the office of radiant E, i. e. to delineate by single rays ; and a
     little nice adjustment, somewhat increasing the distance of G
     from the eye, will bring this single-ray tracing of the pin head
     downward on the retina, and head upward to perception.               So
     that we have on the retina at the same time two impressions in
     contrary positions, and consequently perceive two pins in con
     trary positions, each retinal impression being respectively reversed

to the mind.          To procure this result we first fix the eye upon
the radiant point E till we see the pin head upward, as in the
illusion ; then steadily increasing the distance, as stated, we
presently get sight of the actual pin as it                     is,
                                                           head downward, with
now   a    little light circle in its head, and                little upright pin

within that circle. Remove the transparent paper, and the bright
cones obliterate the smaller image; or cut off the cones                                     by
opaque paper, still retaining the radiant point, and the larger
 image vanishes.             It   only
                                  is          reducing the intensity of the

cone-depicted image that we make the other image appreciable.
     The deductions from these induced facts are, first, concerning
 erect vision with an inverted image.
     However conclusive the reasoning against there being any
direct deliverance to the retina, or other neurine, as to the position
 of the object, however consistent the theory that experience                     the   is
 sole interpreter of sensory excitement, and that there never                                 is
 " an inverted retinal image," inasmuch as there                       no image till

 various analogies, direct experimental evidence has been wanting.
 It here supplied. For we have here one object before us and
    is
 two opposite perceptions of its position at the same moment,                                 a

 ject as to its position.          If there were (as still contended                     by   a

  effect  on   the retina    in  behoof of the object's position, we should
  here see both images in one and the true position.                      But we do
  not.    And what       is   itwe do? We fall back upon hitherto expe

  neither is, nor       ispresented as in focus, its outline being every

         theories of " projection
                                  " or out-seing are begging the question
         when the question is of vision, in this case it is obvious that as
         the plane M N was removed further off, the image thus projected
         would increase in size ; and if the projection represented the ap
         pearance as proposed, the pin would appear larger : but it proves
         otherwise.
            It may be noticed that this analysis demonstrates the peculiar
         effect of what I call single-ray delineation on the retina, which
         will not only happen when the radiant point is behind the object,
         showing it as a shadow, but also when an object, itself reflecting
     I
         rays, is seen through a pinhole.    The effect in both cases is faint
     /   vision, and an uninverted image on the retina, which would result

electrical phenomena in the light of some dynamical theory.           It
was for this reason that I considered the matter worthy of expe
rimental investigation, the fruits of which were given in the paper
referred to.       One point, however, still required a little clearing
up ; and it is this which I now propose to deal with.            I mean
the mode of action of the condenser, which was employed, as in
the inductorium, for the purpose of rendering the break more
sudden, and which I had found necessary for the success of the
experiment as then arranged.            At this necessity I was not sur
prised ; for, according to the indications of theory, the effect was
only to be expected when the fall of the primary current is sud
den compared to that of the secondary.             Now the duration of
 free transient currents in a circuit varies, cateris paribus, as the
self-induction ; so that when the number of turns in the secon
dary is too much reduced, there is danger of the condition not
being fulfilled.       If it be objected that as much would be gained
by improved conductivity as lost by diminished self-induction,
I    answer this is not the fact, the resistance varying as the num
ber of turns simply, while the self-induction varies as the square
of the same number.            Besides, I had reasons for keeping the
resistance in all cases invariable.
      Wishing, however, to obtain the effect without the aid of a
condenser,       I prepared a quadruple coil by bending into the form
of a compact ring a bundle consisting of four No. 16 copper
 wires, each 70 feet long.         Into one of these the current from a
 Daniell cell was permitted to flow, subject to interruption at a
 mercury-cup. The secondary circuit consisted of the other three
 wires arranged consecutively, and of the magnetizing spiral, which
 contained the needle destined to measure the effect of the mo
 mentary current. The three wires could be joined so that the cur
 rent circulated the same way round them all (a), or so that in one
 of them the direction was the opposite to that in the two others (b).
 It will be seen that the resistance was always the same, the only
 change being in the coefficient of mutual induction (M), and of
 self-induction of induced circuit (N). In the former paper it
 was shown that the initial induced current, being proportional to
 M
        is three times as great in (b) as in (a) (a sufficient sudden
  jjj-,
 ness of break being assumed), while the total currents are in the
 reciprocal proportion.        In carrying out the experiments, I sub
 mitted the needle (a new one in each measurement) to the action
 of six break-induced currents, always removing it from the spiral
 when the battery contact was made.             In this way a more con
 stant result is obtained than from one discharge only, which is
 liable to vary from slight differences in the character of the break.
 The needle was then swung by a silk fibre and the number of

            is
If the secondary current containing galvanometer be broken so
                                                           a
quickly after the primary that the induced current has not time
during the interval sensibly to diminish, the deflection of the
needle may be considered to measure the initial value of the in
duced current.      To carry out this experiment properly would
require rather elaborate apparatus, on account of the necessity
of constant interval of time between the breaks.
  a                                                       The contri
vance that   I used was of home manufacture and very rough, and
acted  by  the almost simultaneous withdrawal of wires from two
mercury-cups. The secondary circuit in case           consisted of the     a
two wires of     large coil, A, joined consecutively, and of
                 a                                                short                    a
wire galvanometer.      Iron wires were inserted in A in order to
increase the duration of the induced curreut.          In      only one                b
wire of A   was used, the resistance being made up          the substi            by
tution of another wire, whose self-induction might relatively be
neglected.    The total currents in the two cases would be as                                  2

two cases where the initial currents were equal. With this object
the primary current (originating in          Grove cell) was passed
                                                               a
through   two  wires,  Q„   Q,, of the quadruple coil combined for
self-induction.     The induced circuit included Q3, Q, and the
magnetizing spiral. The arrangements in other respects being
as before,

       13, 14, 15, 16, mean 14£ vibrations per minute*.
    was now removed from the primary circuit (the resistance
being made up to former value) and Q, from the induced circuit.
The numbers now were —
                      11, 10, 12, 12:                      meau 11£.
Q, being next replaced, but not Q,,, there resulted, —
                  35, 35, 33: mean 34.
 *  The experiments were not made exactly in the order here adopted for
convenience, but were broken up.

In   the first two arrangements      the initial currents would be
equal, while in the third they would be doubled.
   On the whole, I think these experiments confirm the view that
the acquired magnetism depends principally on the initial cur
rent.    The exact laws regulating the connexion between the
current and the magnetism produced by it are doubtless compli
cated, and not of much interest.      The facts here detailed should,
however, be borne in      mind   by any one who wishes to pursue
this subject, and they do something towards explaining the dis
cordant results of previous experimenters.
   And now as to the effect of a condenser.       Considering that,

is the same thing, the duration of the spark,      did not anticipate

that  a condenser (whose plates were connected with the breaking-
points) would have any influence.       But to my surprise      found        I

the magnetic effects were all increased.       The explanation                       is,

  with the first part of the electrical motion, the manner in which
 the currents wear down under the action of resistance being of
 subordinate importance.               Now it appears that, if the motion be
 decidedly     of  the    oscillatory type, the first few oscillations will
 take place almost uninfluenced by resistance ; and on this suppo

 This is its maximum value, and is double of that which would be
 generated by a simple stoppage of the primary current, however
 sudden.                    I
             In this way am inclined to explain the increase of
 effect produced by the condenser.        It is true that, having reached
 its maximum value, the secondary current rapidly declines and
 then changes sign ; but from what is known of the behaviour of
 permanent magnets when submitted afresh to the action of mag
 netizing force, it does not seem likely that much disturbance
 would arise from this cause.
    A more plausible objection may be founded on the exceeding
 rapidity of the oscillations, for some time must be necessary for
 the magnetization      of steel. -.Indeed in our case the period of
 oscillation is unusually short, on account of the smallness of
       M4
 L—    j^-.
             When the two circuits are composed mainly of wires
 coiled side by side,   L, M, N     are approximately     equal, and there-
 fore  L    jj- very small compared with either of them.           The cur
 rent is then transferred, with almost indefinite rapidity, from one
 wire to the other and back again.
    I made some experiments to examine this point, which will
 also serve as examples of the general increase of magnetic effect
 produced by a condenser.          The primary current from a Grove's
 cell was passed through the two wires of coil A joined consecu
 tively, and then through one wire of a similar coil B. According
 as the wires of A are joined, L = 5 or 1.           The induced circuit
 included the other wire of B and the magnetizing spiral, so that
 N = 1 and M = 1 approximately.           In the first case, therefore,
 while in the second it is very much smaller.           The experiments,
 conducted in other respects as before, gave the following re
sults : —
    L=5, without      condenser       .  16,    13, 13,     14; mean 14.
    L= 5,   with condenser       .   .  24£, 28, 31,        28;    „   28.

    L=l,    with condenser      .    .  17,    18,19, 21;         „     19.
    It will be seen that, while without the condenser it made little
difference whether     L=l    or L = 5, the increase produced by the
condenser is much greater in the latter case.            This is so far in
agreement    with  the explanation just given ;    but  I  confess I should
have been better satisfied had the influence of the condenser been
less marked when L=l.           In order that the reader may better

judge of the correctness of the view here taken, I subjoin an esti
mate of the period of oscillation in the actual arrangement of the
 experiment.
    The time of a complete oscillation of a current in simple con
 nexion with a condenser =2ir v^LS*, where L and S are mea
 sured in absolute measure.           If r be the time-constant of the
 circuit, L = Rt, R being the resistance in absolute measure. Now
 the capacity called a Farad is 10~i3 absolute measure, and the
 B.A. unit is   107 on the same system.
    If therefore we take as practical units the        B.A. unit of   resist
 ance, and the Farad as unit of capacity,
 t and  t  are here measured in seconds.         The condenser employed
 (made by Elliott Brothers) had a capacity of half a Farad, so
 that S = \.    For one wire of coil A or B,
                                   t = 004t.
 For one of these wires in simple connexion            with the condenser
 the time of oscillation would be
               mVl *lxmo                    = about •°0014/'
 Comparing this with the value of t, we see that the first ten or
 so oscillations would be comparatively         unaffected by resistance.
 By what    has  been  proved,   the  time, when   L = 5 (in different unit
 of course), must be just double of this, or -00028".
    The action of the condenser in the inductorium is very imper
 fectly explained in the text-books, and is no doubt in many cases
 rather complicated.       From the reasoning of this paper, it appears
 that it is by no means a complete account of the matter to say
 that the advantage derived from the use of the condenser depends
 only on the increased suddenness with which the primary cur
 rent is stopped.       In a complete investigation (which          I do not
 mean to enter     on  here) a distinction would probably have to be
 made, according as the secondary circuit when open allows the
 passage of a spark or not, or, as a third case, is completely closed.
  I would, however, remark that a good deal of misapprehension
 arises in this and similar cases from forgetting that a condenser
 is powerless to make away with electrical energy.             Such energy
 may be disposed of in the form of a spark, or it may be converted

tion in this way cannot take place instantaneously, requiring as
 it does a time comparable with the time-constants of the circuits
 concerned.       So far, indeed, is a condenser from itself absorbing
 electrical energy, that in many cases it actually prolongs the du
 ration of motion ; for an oscillatory current, in consequence of
its smaller mean square, sustains itself twice as long against the
damping action of resistance as a comparatively steady current of
the same maximum           value.

LXII1.       Supplement to a Mathematical Theory of Oceanic Tides.
    By    the Rev. Professor Challis, M.A., F.R.S., F.R.A.S.*
         two preceding      communications,      contained  in the Num
 IN bers of the        Philosophical Magazine       for January and April
of the present year, I have attempted to solve the problem of
lunar tides on the suppositions that the earth is wholly covered
by water of uniform depth, and that the moon has no declination.
My object in attacking the problem under this form was to dis
cover the correct mode of employing for the solution the general
equations of hydrodynamics, the effects of friction and of imper
fect fluidity being left out of account.             Notwithstanding the
simplicity     of  the  conditions,   the  difficulty of ascertaining the
proper process of reasoning is so great that it is not surprising
success should be attainable only by slow degrees and after re
peated failures.        Having good reason to be dissatisfied with my
first attempt in the Number for January, I proposed two other
solutions in that for April- The first of these fulfilled the given
conditions of the problem, and at the same time satisfied the
general hydrodynamical equations ; but as it led to the result
that there would be an infinite tide if the depth of the supposed
uniform ocean were 8^ miles, I thought that it must on that
account be rejected.         In the other solution this result was evaded
by the introduction of certain special considerations, which, how
ever, conducted to values of the resolved velocities which did not
satisfy the equation

itself.   Now, however,       I
                             admit that it is absolutely necessary
that   the equation (a) should be satisfied by the solution of
every problem which relates to motion of an incompressible fluid
for which udx + vdy + wis is an exact differential.               I
                                                           therefore
fall back upon the first of the two solutions in the April Number,
which appears, for reasons I am about to adduce, to have been
too hastily rejected.
    The infinite wave might be accounted for in the same manner
as the continually increasing velocity of a pendulum, or an elastic
spring, which is subject to external action having the same pe
riod as its own.     Any disturbance of the waters of the supposed
ocean would generate waves which of themselves would be pro
pagated with a velocity depending          on the uniform depth ;
but the period of the tide-wave, or the rate of its propagation,
 is determined by the mean relative periodic motion of the moon
 about the earth.     If, however, the depth of the ocean should be
 such that the rate of propagation depending upon it is equal to
 the rate of the moon's relative rotation, the waters might receive
 continual accessions of velocity, just as in the case of the pen
 dulum or spring above mentioned.         It may be presumed that
 the infinite velocity given by the solution in question for a cer
 tain value of the ocean's depth is generated under theseconditions.
    This view is confirmed by actually calculating for the case of
 an equatorial canal the depth H, which corresponds to a rate of
 propagation equal to that of the moon's rotation about the earth
on the supposition that the rate = v^H.            I
                                                find by this calcu
lation that H is equal to 12'6 miles.    This agrees closely with
the depth (12 miles) of an equatorial canal in which, according
to Mr. Airy's mathematical investigations,     an unlimited tidal
elevation would be produced. (See Phil. Mag. for April, p. 267.)
    Since we found that in an unbounded ocean the infinite wave
is generated if the depth be 8-5 miles, the rate of propagation of
the lunar tide along the equator would appear to be greater in
such an ocean than in an equatorial canal in the ratio of V 12"6
to ^85; that        of 122 to 1-00 nearly.
                    is,                       This increment may
be due to the undulations which, according to the solution now
under consideration, take place in directions transverse to the
equator, in the same manner as, in the theory    have proposed of

LXIV.  On the Connexion between the Electrical Insulating-power
  and Chemical Composition of various kinds of Glass.  By F. L.
  Ekman, Junior Professor at the Royal Technological Institute
  in Stockholm*.
                  been known that the electrical insulating-power
IT varieslong
       has
           greatly    in different kinds of glass ; but the causes of
these differences have been but little investigated.     The question,
however, is of considerable practical importance, and I there
fore, at the suggestion of Professor E. Edlund, undertook to
inquire whether the difference in the insulating-power of va
rious kinds of glass might not be ascribed to differences in
their chemical composition.         In this examination         I
                                                              employed
five specimens of glass, supplied to me by M. Oeller, electrical-
instrument maker, two of which have been found by him unfit,
but the remaining three good for electrical purposes.
    Most chemists, I imagine, in order to answer such a question,
 would, like myself, in the first place direct their attention to
 those chemical relations in the glass which can produce differ
 ences in the qualities of the surface. A species of glass which           is,
 within reasonable limits, rich in silica, potash, or lime ought to
 prove  a better insulator than      lime glass containing much soda,
                                        a
 simply because   it    harder, and therefore preserves
                       is                                      perfectly
                                                                 a
 smooth surface better than the latter.       But the insulating-power
 of glass may depend in         still higher degree on its power to
                                    a
 resist the effect of chemical agents          for humidity and car

 bonic acid in the atmosphere are at all times present to corrode
 it. The new substances that are thus formed on the surface of
  the glass may be themselves inferior to glass as insulators, and
  moreover may contribute to the production of conducting stra

438      M. F. L. Ekman       on the    Electrical Insulating -power and
beyond doubt that the same change takes place, though far more
slowly, on a smooth surface of glass. It is known also that there
are kinds of glass which in moist air speedily become covered with
a visible coating that dims both the brilliancy and transparency
of the glass. That such kinds of glass, which must be consi
dered absolutely faulty in their composition, must be unfit not
only for optical but for electrical purposes is self-evident; but it
appeared to me probable that similar changes in the surface of
glass even of unexceptionable composition might take place in the
air, sufficiently minute, indeed, to escape observation, but suffi
ciently serious to affect the electrical insulating-power, and that
the differences between various            specimens of glass as insulators
 may accordingly depend           chiefly on their different chemical
 durability.
    The expression for the chemical durability of glass is to be
found in its equivalent formula. The composition of ordinary
 glass varies on each side of the mean formula (MO + 2Si03),
 where MO signifies alkali and lime. The kinds of glass in which
the amount of silica exceeds that expressed by the formula possess
usually a greater degree of chemical durability, and vice versd ;
 but that durability depends also in a great measure on the mu
tual relation between the alkali and lime, so that, at least to a
certain limit, it is increased the more lime is substituted for alkali.
    On subjecting the above-mentioned kinds of glass to analysis,

     Incalculating the equivalent formulae,   have deducted from             I
the alkalies as much as is   necessary to form a neutral salt with
the sulphuric acid found. The remaining alkali I have reckoned
in equivalents of that alkali which was present to the greatest
amount in the glass; and in like manner I have reckoned mag
nesia and oxide of lead as lime.    The small quantities of arsemic
acid, oxide of iron, oxide of manganese, and alumina           have                                      I

action of air free from carbonic acid, but saturated with moisture
at the ordinary temperature, and determined the increase of
weight after a certain time.              The vessel in which the specimens
were exposed to the action of moisture was of silvered metal with
the surface polished.           The same quantity (1 gramme) of each
specimen was weighed out ; for in this as in all other respects
the greatest possible uniformity was observed in these experi
ments.      The following Table shows how many milligrammes of
water each specimen absorbed in the time stated : —

     With No. 3 the observation              failed ; I can say, however, with
 certainty   that   it absorbed     less   water    than either No. 4 or 5.
     We see, then, that the kinds of glass which were unfit for
 electrical apparatus were much more hygroscopic than the others,
 and that the glass which contained much lime was least hygro
 scopic, whereas that which was relatively deficient in lime and
 silica was most so.           When, after being dried in air (as free as
 possible from carbonic acid) at 160° C, the specimens thus tested
 were reweighed, it was found that Nos. 1 and 2 had almost ex
 actly resumed their original weight,                    No. 4, on the contrary,
 weighed    0*0014,     and    No.   5  0  0022    grm.     more than before; and
 both these specimens appeared             in  a striking degree agglomerated,
 evidently in consequence of the powder being glued together by
 the hydrosilicated alkali formed.
     I  now placed the specimens over water in a closed vessel con
 taining, instead of air, carbonic acid gas. After a certain time
 they were placed over lime and chloride of calcium till constancy
 of weight had been attained, after which they were dried at 160°
 Cels. and again weighed.                 The affinity of the specimens for
 carbonic acid in the presence of humidity is shown in the fol
 lowing Table     : —

display sensibility to the action of carbonic acid in the same

442     M. F. L. Ekman       on the  Electrical Insulating -power and
glasses employed.        After the glasses had been well cleaned, two
narrow strips of tinfoil coating were fixed parallel to each other
on one side of each glass.          The one strip which was intended
to be charged with free electricity was fastened as far as possible
from the edges of the glass, the other was placed in communica
tion with the earth.       These tinfoil slips were all of the same size,
 namely     43  millims.  long and 8 millims. broad, with the corners
rounded off ; the distance between them was 48 millims.               This
coating having been fixed, the glasses were warmed and covered
with shellac varnish, leaving, however, the tinfoil slips and the
glass surface between them bare.
    The glasses being thus prepared and the lower coating of each
connected with the earth, the upper coating was charged from a
Leyden jar, to which the same quantity of positive electricity
was always communicated by means of a Lane's electrometer.
The insulating quality of the glass was now measured by the
length of time during which the electricity remained in the
upper coating.       As the last traces of electricity disappear very
slowly   from   well-insulating  kinds of glass,    I  considered it suffi
cient to observe how long the charge in the upper coating con
tinued sufficiently strong fully to deflect the gold-leaf in a
Bohnenberger's electroscope on the transfer of the first charge
from the coating to the electroscope.           This test, though it can
not make pretensions to extreme accuracy, is yet abundantly suf
ficient to establish the order of precedence in which the different
kinds of glass must be classed as insulators. The relative mois
ture of the air varied during the experiments from 47 to 5.2 per
cent., at a temperature of from 15° to 18° C, and may therefore
for these experiments be regarded as sufficiently constant.
    The times of insulation thus determined for the different
                               ...
glasses were found on an average to be —
              Glass No. 1.               At   least 6 hours.

    The differences were, as we see, strikingly great, and tend on
the whole in the direction which one, on chemical grounds, would
be led    to expect.    But here there is a remarkable exception.
Specimen No. 2 had proved less hygroscopic and less susceptible
to the action of carbonic acid than No. 1, and yet is far surpassed
by the latter in insulating-power.
    It now appeared to me worth while to try whether any of the
badly insulating kinds of glass could be improved by the re
moval of the old surface of the glass.           I tried this experiment

         Chemical Composition of various kinds          of Glass.   443
with No. 5. Partly by friction with alcohol mixed with a little
hydrofluoric acid, partly by means of crocus-powder, I endea
voured to remove the old surface, and as soon as possible after
wards again tested the insulating-power of the glass.      This
indeed showed some improvement, but so little that the glass
must still be considered utterly unserviceable for the purpose
of electrical insulation.
   I was accordingly driven to ask myself the question, whether
the rapid disappearance of electricity from certain kinds of glass
might not, in a far greater degree than is usually supposed, de
pend on a passage of it through the substance of the glass itself.
This led to the following experiments.
   The specimens were subjected to the same test of their non
conducting-power that has been above described, with the differ
ence that now also the surface between the tinfoil coatings, pre
viously left bare, was covered with shellac varnish.  The relative
moisture of the air exhibited no material change.               I
                                                         obtained
the following times of insulation : —
         Specimen   No.   1.   .   .   At   least 12 hours.
             „      No.   2.   .   .        „      1£ hour.
             ,,     No.   3.   .   .   About       18 minutes.
             „      No.   4.                ,,     60 seconds.
                    No.   5.   .   .        „      40      „
  It  appears, then, that the insulating-power of the glasses had,
indeed, been increased by covering their surfaces entirely with
shellac ; but that increase appeared to bear a certain proportion to
the insulating-power displayed by the glasses while the surface
between the tin-foil coatings was still left bare.     The increase is
therefore very inconsiderable for the inferior kinds of glass ; and,
indeed, the different sorts appear to differ in insulating-power as
widely as before.
    These experiments appear to me to justify the conclusion that
in the specimens of glass tested the electricity took its way princi
pally through the substance of the glass itself, and that the nature
of the surface was of relatively subordinate importance.
    To verify more fully the correctness of this conclusion,          I
 made the following experiments with specimens 2 and 5, whfch
were plates of nearly the same thickness and circumference.        In
the middle of the plate a circle of tinfoil, 7 centims. in diameter,
 was fastened, and a similar one on the opposite side of the plate,
after which the whole remaining surface of the glass was var
 nished.   The distance then between the tinfoil coatings was
 the thickness of the plate (3£ millims.), reckoned through the
 substance of the glass, but at least 12 centims. along its surface.
 I now insulated the plate 5, put one           e. the upper) coating
                                                 (t.

in communication      with the inner coating of a Leyden jar
charged  as in the preceding experiments, and touched the lower
coating  with  a conductor  which communicated with the outer
coating of the Leyden jar.      I could then receive sparks from
the coating of the plate at intervals of less than a second, until
the Leyden jar was nearly discharged.      When the communica
tion between the plate and the jar was kept up constantly, the
latter had entirely discharged itself in twenty minutes.  The re
sult with the plate No. 2, under exactly the same circumstances,
was widely different.    When the electricity that first arose in
the lower coating by induction had been got rid of, I had to
wait several minutes before a scarcely perceptible spark could be
obtained, and with continuous communication         between the two
coated surfaces of the plate and those of the Leyden jar, the
latter, after an interval of an hour, was still found to be strongly
charged.
    It has been remarked that glass, when newly blown, has a
conducting outer crust, and only loses its conducting-property
by wear and tear after being used for some time.        In order to
assure myself that the strong conducting-property of the plate
No. 5 did not arise from some such cause, I repeated the above-
mentioned experiment, only with the difference that the outer
coating of the jar communicated with a narrow rim of tinfoil
round the edge of the whole plate.     It is clear that if the con-
ducting-power of the plate depended on its surface and took
place along that and under the varnish, the discharge of the
Leyden flask ought now to take place about twice as rapidly
as before;    if,on the contrary,    it depended principally on
the conducting-power of the glass itself, the discharge ought
to take place far more slowly than in the former experiment.
The latter was found to be the case    ;  for the Leyden jar was
still strongly charged after an interval of three quarters of an
hour.
   If we now go back to the analyses in order to obtain from
them some indication of what caused the difference of conduct
ing-power in the substance itself of the different glasses,       it   is
evident that the phenomenon cannot be satisfactorily explained
eitlicr by the amount of silica or of lime contained, whether we
take account of their percentage or of their equivalent propor
tions.   But there  is an ingredient the quantity of which in the
glass continually  increases in thejneasure in which its electrical
insulating-power decreases that ingredient
                            :                    soda and

sider thatI   may combine the results of this research in the fol
lowing statements — :
   (1) The non-conducting property of the glass does indeed in
some measure depend upon the more or less non-conducting

          Prof. 6. Magnus        on  Surface Radiation of Heat.         445
character of its surface, and indirectly on its chemical durability;
but
    (2) It depends also on the more or less non-conducting cha
racter of its internal mass, and in that respect is inversely pro
portional to the amount of soda in the glass.
    (3) In the case of kinds of glass whose surfaces are not of a
peculiarly unfavourable nature, the latter circumstance has a far
greater influence than the former on the serviceableness of the
glass as an electrical insulator.
    It is certainly an unexpected result, that of two oxides so si
milar to each other in their properties as soda and potash, the
one should, in combination with silica and lime, produce an
electrically conducting glass, the other an almost non-conduct
ing *.     But as long as we have no certain knowledge in what
proportions the silica in the glass combines with the lime and
alkali respectively, and of the conducting-power of the combina
tions thus arising, it appears to me that, from the analyses and
experiments here described, we cannot avoid coming to the con
clusion just enounced.          I  do not, however, mean to deny that
the more complete saturation of the bases with silica may con
tribute to the production of the non-conducting character of the
substance.
    It would be very interesting, in the first place, to have speci
mens prepared of pure potash-lime-glass and soda-lime-glass               of
different, but corresponding,         equivalent formulae, and then to
subject them to an accurate test of their insulating-power and
their other physical properties.          As, however, my occupations
will probably not allow me time to continue this research, I do
not wish to reserve to myself the completion of the work.

LXV.      On the Change in the Radiation of Heat by Roughness            of
            the Surface.     By the late Prof. G. MAGNust-
                  who was the first to observe that a body with a
LESLIEJ, rough surface     radiates more heat than one with a smooth
one, also expressed the opinion that this was conditional on the
density of the surface.         Yet he urges against this view the cir
cumstance that the        limit   between hard and soft bodies cannot
be fixed.
    Melloni§ subsequently also maintained that the altered radia-

  446        Prof. 6. Magnus    on the Change in the Radiation
  tion depended merely on a change in the density of the superficial
 layer.     In support of this view he adduces the fact that in cer
  tain substances, such as glass, marble, and agate, he observed no
  change in the radiation whether the surface were rough or polished,
  and only in the case of metals was there an increase when they
 were roughened.        As this was observed not only in the case of
 easily oxidizable metals, but in those of gold and platinum, so
 that the notion that the change might have been due to a layer of
 oxide was excluded, Melloni ascribes the phenomenon to metals
  being compressible, but agate, ivory, or marble not. Experiment
 teaches, he says, that metal plates which are made by hammering
 or rolling have a greater density on the surface than in the in
 terior. Looking at a list of the radiating- powers of bodies, it is
 at once seen that in general this property is inversely as their
 respective densities.    Hence, if it be assumed that the same law
 also holds for different densities of one and the same substance,
 the greater radiation is explained ; for, by scratching, the surface
 becomes less dense, or the interior softer places are laid bare.
     In support of this view Melloni adduces the following experi
 ment.       He had four plates of very pure silver made — two
 strongly hammered, and two cast and allowed to cool very slowlyin
 their moulds of sand.      These he used as the sides of a quadran
 gular box with a metal bottom ; and in order not to alter the
 density and hardness of the plates, he soldered them with easily
 fusible solder.    Before being joined, they were polished with pu
 mice-stone and charcoal without using hammer or burnisher. One
 of the cast and one of the hammered plates were then strongly
 rubbed in one direction with coarse emery-paper.      The sides which
 had retained their lustre reflected sharp images, the rubbed sides
 dull and streaked ones. The silver vessel thus prepared was filled
 with hot water.     The deflections which the four sides produced
 were   : —
                                                          o

             The  cast and scratched side .   .   .  .   11 "3
     Scratching the hammered plate had thus produced an increase
of the radiation, while in the cast plate it had produced a dimi
nution. This unexpected fact appeared to him to prove the cor
rectness of his principle.
    We are as much, and perhaps more justified in saying that the
surface becomes denser by scratching, than in saying, with Mel
loni, that it becomes less dense ; for during the scratching a
pressure is exerted upon the surface ; and if even it be assumed
that the individual scratches are not pressed in but are scooped

                   of Heat by Roughness of   the Surface.             447
out,  in this scooping a pressure is exerted upon the adjacent
parts, which, even though exerted laterally, must necessitate a
condensation.
    Melloni* also made the following experiment.           From a sheet
of plate    glass 11 millims. in thickness he had four pieces
cut ; they were heated to redness, and two were allowed to cool
slowly, while the others were cooled rapidly.         One of each of
the two kinds was scratched, and then the four sides of a box
were made of the plates, which was filled with hot water.             The
two slowly cooled ones exhibited the same radiation.               Of the
quickly cooled ones, the scratched one gave a deflection of 29°*7,
and the other of 28°. Thence Melloni concludes that the rough
ness of the surface only exerts an influence if the interior of the
mass has a smaller density than the radiating layers on the
surface.
    Knoblauch    t  subsequently made experiments to confirm in
another manner Melloni's view.          He used cast and rolled lead
plates.    One of the first, the cast ones, which when smooth pro
duced a deflection of 49°, exhibited after being scratched only a
deflection of 48°-25.      Hence the radiation had decreased — it is
true, only by 0O-75 ; but by a subsequent scratching in a trans
verse direction it decreased by another degree, for the deflection
only amounted to 47°-25.
    Of the rolled plates, one, which when smooth had produced a
 deflection of 50°'5, after scratching also indicated a decrease in
the radiation, for the deflection amounted only to 48°,5.            After
being again scratched in a transverse direction there was again an
increase in the radiation of 1°,5 ; for the deflection amounted to
49°-75. M. Knoblauch supposes that the increase in the radia
tion by the second scratching might be due to the lead being
compressed in the positions of the marks, but loosened at the
points at which the upturned edges of the furrows intersected.
    Knoblauch then took a cube of rolled copper plate, and first
 compared the radiation of a smooth side with one scratched in
 two directions.       The first produced a deflection of 29°, the
 other of 47°* 75.     Afterwards, both having been covered galva-
 noplastically  with   copper, the first gave 490,25, the grooved one
 51°5.
    This experiment is indeed very interesting ; but in my opinion
 it does not, as Knoblauch maintains J, confirm Melloni' s prin
ciple " that scratching the surface only influences the radiating-
 power of bodies so far as it modifies their density and hard
 ness, and it increases or diminishes the radiating-power accord
 ingly as it loosens or condenses the parts affected;" for M.

448         Prof. G. Magnu9      on the Change   in the  Radiation
 Knoblauch himself mentions that, by scratching, the parts under
the strokes proper are condensed, but the upturned edges are
loosened.      Melloni maintains, on the contrary, that scratching
 does not loosen the part, but only lays bare the lesS dense interior.
    Under these circumstances it seemed desirable to examine the
 phenomenon a little more minutely ; and with this view the author
experimented with platinum plates instead of copper and other
easily oxidizable metals, so that other alterations also on the sur
face, such as are produced on silver by small quantities of sul
 phuretted hydrogen, were not to be feared.
    A platinum plate which had been made as hard as possible by
rolling, after having been strongly heated, radiated as much heat
 as before. Here the hardness cannot have affected the radiation.
    Another platinum plate had been passed under very great pres
sure between two rollers, one of which was finely grooved; so
that after this treatment one of the sides exhibited small eleva
tions, while the other remained smooth.               The first radiated
slightly more than the other; but after the plate had been
strongly heated, even this difference was no longer perceptible.
Hence it follows that, when the surface is otherwise the same,
inequalities, and even regularly alternating elevations and de
pressions, may exist without any increase in the radiation.
    When, on the contrary, a plane platinum plate, which had
been heated by a glassblower's lamp and was quite soft, was
roughened by means of fine emery-paper,               the radiation was
doubled.
    In order   to be able to make the comparison, the radiating plate
was heated by a small brass apparatus which was kept at 100° C.
by means of steam.          It consisted of a horizontal cylinder of 50
millims. internal diameter and of the same length ; the plate
under investigation formed one of the ends.             In order readily
to exchange     this  plate for another, the cylinder  was  provided with
a broad welt, against which the plate was pressed by means of
a brass ring and three screws.            In order to make the whole
apparatus quite     tight, rings of stout paper were used      as washers,
and rendered it      perfectly steamtight.
    To be certain    that in the treatment of the plate no foreign sub
stance had been     left upon it (traces, for instance, of the glue of the
emery-paper, although it was used quite dry), the plates before
being fastened in the apparatus were heated for a time in con
centrated nitric acid, then washed with distilled water until all
traces of acid were removed, and then dried without being touched
by   a cloth or any other object.
    It is difficult to conceive that by the slight treatment with
emery-paper the density of the surface was so far increased that
the radiation was doubled.

                of Heat  by Roughness   of the Surface.           449
   When a platinum plate was covered with a thin layer of spongy
platinum, by spreading a thin layer of ammoniochloride of plati
num upon it and then strongly heating, without treatment with
nitric acid, it indicated seven times as much radiation as before
being treated with spongy platinum. Spongy platinum is looser
than the plate upon which it adheres ; but each individual par
ticle is undoubtedly as hard as a particle of the heated plate.
Hence the action of the spongy platinum is due to its presenting
more points and corners.      This is more probable from the fact
that the radiation of a plate covered with spongy platinum dimi
nishes when it is frequently and continuously heated.            It is
possible that at each fresh heating some of the sponge is de
tached ; but in any case the extreme points and corners arc
rounded off.     Harder they cannot become.
   The author is of opinion that the increase in the radiation with
a roughened surface depends essentially on the refraction which
the heat experiences on its emergence from the surface of the
radiating body.      He explains this influence for various forms of
the surface, and arrives thereby at the following conclusion.
The greater the refractive index of heat between the radiating
substance and air, the smaller is the radiation from the plane
surface, and then the quantity of heat reflected inwards increases.
The metals have doubtless a very high refractive index.        Hence
they reflect the rays from without, and allow but few to penetrate ;
and hence they reflect internally those coming from the interior,
and allow but few to emerge. Great inequalities of the radiating
surface do not occasion any important alteration in the radia
tion. Such a one only occurs when the radii of curvature are
very small, and change greatly, and when the radiating surface
has but little diathermancy.      In general, the roughness of the
surface may effect both an increase and a diminution in the ra
diation ; but if the inequalities are very fine and very deep,
there is almost always an increase in the case of substances
which are but slightly diathermanous,         as the metals.   When
there is a very fine powder of the same substance on the radiating
surface, the radiation is considerably increased, not merely from
substances which, like the metals, are but little diathermanous,
but also from very diathermanous ones, such as rock-salt.

  -*-      " On   some remarkable Spectra of Compounds of Zirconia and
 the Oxides of Uranium."            By H. C. Sorby, F.R.S.
      When a scientific man has been led into an error and afterwards
 discovers his mistake, I think it a matter of duty that he should
 take an early opportunity to correct it.            I therefore now write the
 following notice of certain remarkable peculiarities in the spectra of
 some compounds of the oxides of uranium with zirconia which led
 both myself and others* to conclude that they were due to a new
elementary substance.
     Though the spectra of the different salts of those bases which show
 well-marked absorption-bands often differ in detail, yet they usually
 resemble each other so much that there is no difficulty in recognizing
 each particular element.          This is so constantly the case in the various
 compounds        of erbium,    didymium, and cobalt, and in the ordinary
 salts of uranium, that for a long time the more I studied this ques
 tion, the more did it appear to be a general rule, and there seemed
 to be no reason to suspect that a few special compounds of uranium
 would give spectra with absorption-bands as unlike as possible those
 of all others. Such, however, turns out to be the fact when its
 oxides are combined with zirconia.
     As an excellent illustration of important differences in mere detail,
but general correspondence, I would refer to the spectra of didymium
in different states of combination t, and would especially refer to the
most distinct of the numerous nbsorption-bands, which occurs in the
yellow.       The various compounds agree in showing this band in the
same general position ; but by careful management, and by the use
of sufficient dispersive power, it may be resolved into a very variable
number of narrow bands or black lines.              For example, in the case of
the crystallized sulphate containing comparatively little lanthanum
it can be resolved into seven narrow lines, two of those near the
centre being the darkest ; whereas when much lanthanum is present,
one line on the side next the green is so much darker than the rest
that the others are comparatively absent.                On fusing the mixed
oxides with borax, the same spectrum is seen as with oxide of di
dymium alone, and I can resolve the above-named band into only two
narrower bands ; whereas when the saturated bead is made to deposit
crystals by being kept some time at a very dull red heat, this band can
easily be resolved into eight equal and very distinct black lines.
Although these and similar differences in detail are of much interest,

yet in no case are they so considerable as to prevent our recognizing
at once that the spectra are all due to didymium.            It is also impor
tant to notice that the amount requisite to give a most splendid
spectrum when the bead is crystalline, will scarcely show any trace of
bands when it is in a vitreous coudition, dissolved in the borax. This
is analogous to what occurs in the case of solid and powdered crys
tals of sulphate of didymium ; for the absorption-bands in the spec
trum of the light transmitted by a thin layer of the fine powder,
strongly illuminated from the other side, are as distinct as in that
transmitted by a many times greater thickness of solid and transpa
rent crystal. We may very conveniently take advantage of this fact in
studying the spectra of such substances when the amount of material
at command is otherwise too small. This seems to be because the
transmitted light does not simply pass through the crystals, but is in
great measure reflected from them backwards and forwards, and
thus, as it were, passes through a greater thickness.             It is also to
a considerable   extent similar to that reflected from the powder when
illuminated from above, as may be clearly proved by what occurs in
the case of uranic salts.     These when in a state of moderately fine
powder transmit light, giving a spectrum showing not only the ab
sorption-bands in the blue, which alone are met with in that trans
mitted by a clear crystal, but also the bands in the green, which
depend on fluorescence,       characteristic of that reflected from the
powder*.     These two kinds of bands can be easily distinguished by
means of a plate of deep-blue cobalt glass, which has an entirely
different action accordingly as it is placed below or above the object
when the bands are due to fluorescence, but has no such effect when
they are due to ordinary absorption.           It would perhaps be well to
mention here    that I  have  in  this  manner   proved that the abnormal
bands seen in the spectra of the compounds of zirconia with the
oxides of uranium, described in this paper, are due to genuine ab
sorption, and not to fluorescence.
    The remarkable spectrum of some jargons has been already de
 scribed by me in the 'Chemical News 't, and in the Proceedings of
the Royal SocietyJ. One of its most striking peculiarities                    is,
                                                                            that

 prism  into two  spectra  having   the  light polarized  in opposite planes,
 though some of the absorption-bands are of equal intensity in both
 images, yet others are comparatively absent, some in one and some
 in the other whereas in the case of other dichroic crystals which
               ;
 give spectra with absorption-bands, they are usually all more dis
 tinct in one image than when the light        not polarized, and all fainter,
                                                    is
 or even comparatively absent, in the other. No sooner had observed     I

452      Royal Society      : — Mr. H.     C. Sorby   on some Spectra
accord with the results of the various analyses published by other
chemists, none of whom mention the existence of any trace of that
substance.     Moreover the general character of the spectrum was
entirely unlike that of all the known compounds of uranic oxide.
The various artificial salts all agree in giving a variable but small
number of moderately broad absorption-bands in the blue end (Nos.
1, 2, and 3) ; and the same is also seen in the case of several natural
minerals ; whereas the jargon gave a most unusually large number of
narrow black lines (fourteen quite distinct, besides others more faint,
and a single broader band which I cannot separate into lines), extend
ing from the red end, so that nearly all occur in that part of the
spectrum which is entirely free from bands in all previously known
compounds of uranic oxide. This same general fact was also seen in
the spectrum (No. 6) of the opaque blowpipe-beads gently flamed, as
described in my former paper.           These differences will be better un
derstood by means of the following drawing, which shows three of
the most striking spectra of uranic salts, that of uranate of soda, and
the two which are rendered so abnormal by the presence of zirconia.

     of Compounds of Zirconia and        the Oxides       of Uranium.     453
    I will not now enter into a description of the various chemical
and physical facts which seemed to warrant the conclusion that zir
cons sometimes contain a new earth ; but taking these into considera
tion, there seemed to be every reason to believe that spectra which thus
differed so much from those of any previously known substance were
characteristic of this new earth. Judging from the facts then known,
it was more probable that spectra of such a new type were due to a
new element, than that they were due merely to a combination of
two such elements as zirconium and uranium.          Some of these che
mical and physical facts can now be explained by the presence of
uranium ; but besides this and several of the more common earths
and oxides, I have detected in some zircons erbium, didymium,
yttria, and another substance which exists in such small quantity that
I  have not yet been able to ascertain whether or not it is the suspected
new earth.     These accidental constituents do not, indeed, occur in
sufficient quantity to be of importance, except as modifying the phy-
sical and optical properties, the didymium giving its usual charac
teristic absorption-bands (zircons from Sveneroe, Norway), and the
manganese the same spectrum as that of garnets (zircons from an
unknown locality in Siberia*).      This method, however, fails to give
evidence of a new earth ; for, since the publication of my former paper,
I have proved that the very abnormal spectra which seemed suffi
cient to establish its existence are really due to compounds of zir
conia with the oxides of uranium, which have such a powerful action
on light that an almost inappreciable amount is sufficient to pro
duce the spectra to great perfection — in fact, so small an amount
that the total quantity which misled me was only a few thousandths
of a grain ; and its presence might easily have remained unsuspected,
if I had not made a number of experiments which at first did not
seem to have much connexion with the subject.
    In studying the spectra of crystalline blowpipe-beads, it seemed
desirable to examine those made with carbonate of soda, with or
without a little borax. This when melted dissolves certain oxides ;
and though it crystallizes on cooling, so as to be only partially
translucent, yet with strong direct sunlight well-marked spectra may
be seen.     For example, in the oxidizing flame uranic oxide is easily
dissolved by carbonate of soda alone ; and when quickly cooled, an
orange-coloured bead is obtained, probably containing uranate of
 soda in a vitreous condition, which gives a single well-marked ab
sorption-band in the green (see spectrum No. 4) ; with so small a
quantity of the oxide, that in a bead      inch in diameter shows the
                                           -jr
spectrum to the best advantage, and even               grain can be easily

454       Royal Society   : — Mr.   H. C. Sorby      on some Spectra
passed into a crystalline state ; for the spectrum then shows four
absorption-bands, and is more like the ordinary type ; but this
change does not occur if a little borax has been added.           The addition
of  more and more borax causes the absorption-band to become more
and more faint, and to advance towards the blue end, until we obtain
a spectrum with very faint bands but of the usual character.
                                                          I
   In examining the various products into which separated jargons
in order to study the supposed new earth in a state of purity,                I
obtained a small quantity of a dark-coloured substance, apparently
zirconia containing some oxide which communicated a green tint to a
glassy borax blowpipe-bead, but yet not sufficiently distinct to show
that it was due to uranous oxide. I therefore thought that the car-
bonate-of-soda method might throw light on the question ; and
though the presence of zirconia prevented solution by pure carbonate
of soda, the addition of a little borax enabled me to prove that uranic
oxide is really present in some jargons.        Such, then, being the case,
it seemed desirable to ascertain whether the oxides of uranium would
give rise to any special spectra when present along with zirconia in
crystalline blowpipe-beads.      To my astonishment I found that the
spectra were precisely the same as those obtained in the case of what
I  had thought to be an approximately pure new earth*.                   When,
however, I had ascertained the quantity of oxide requisite to give
this result, I was no longer surprised that I had not suspected its
presence.     In the case of transparent blowpipe-beads of borax with
microcosmic salt, it is requisite to have as much as about ^ grain of
uranous oxide to show faintly the characteristic absorption-bands,
whereas, when present along with zirconia in the crystalline beads,
urinnr gr&in gives an equally well-marked spectrum ; and Ytho grain
shows it far better than a larger quantity, which makes the beads too
opaque.      These very minute quantities were obtained by the re
peated division of a small known weight, either before or after fusion
with borax. This spectrum also differs very considerably from the
spectra of the usual salts or blowpipe-beads of uranous oxide.              On
comparing them side by side, the only common peculiarity is the fact
of there being numerous absorption-bands distributed over a large
part of the spectrum ; but they do not correspond either in number or
position.    On the contrary, they differ almost as much as possible,
and the darker bands in the spectrum of this zirconia compound
occur where the transmitted light is the brightest in other cases.
   The oxide of uranium is so easily reduced at a high temperature
to the state of protoxide in a borax- bead, with excess of boric acid,
and is so readily peroxidized at a dull-red heat when crystallized
along with borate of zirconia, that there seemed good reason to refer
the change in the spectra to temperature rather than to the state of
oxidization, until after it was found that they were due to uranium.
By gently flaming the crystalline bead, the spectrum is entirely altered,
and becomes like No. 6, which seems to be characteristic of a com
pound of borate of zirconia with uranic oxide.            This gives a spec-
      * Figs. 1 and 2 of my former paper, at p. 07 of the present  volume.

      of Compounds of Zirconia and      the Oxides  of Uranium.     455
trum with five well-marked absorption-bands, all of which occur at
the red end, where no trace of bands exists in the case of ordinary
salts, as will be seen on comparing it with Nos. 1, 2, and 3.    I have
 tried many experiments in order to ascertain whether any other
element besides zirconia will cause uranium to give similar abnormal
spectra ; but none show any thing of the kind, at all events in similar
conditions.     A few have special characters, as described below, but
the majority exert little or no influence ; and even when the blow
pipe-beads are crystalline, they show only the usual spectra of the
oxides of uranium.      Moreover no such great change in the character
of the spectra of any other elements which give absorption-bands is
to be seen when they are combined with zirconia ; and, as far as my
present experience goes, it seems as if such very abnormal spectra
were met with only in the case of these remarkable compounds of
zirconia with the oxides of uranium.
    Such, then, being the facts, it appears to me that we are now in
a position to explain why certain zircons give three different spectra,
as described in my former paper.        Some jargons (usually those of
a green tint) contain a little uranium so combined that the charac
teristic spectrum is only faintly visible, whereas, after ignition, the
intensity of the absorption-bands is permanently increased to a vari
able extent, occasionally only a little, but in some cases as much as
twenty-five times. This more powerful action on light is accompanied
by an increase in hardness ana in specific gravity (sometimes as much
as from 4-20 to 4'GO), as described in my former paper ; and I have
since found that these changes are approximately proportional to the
amount of uranic oxide in the various specimens, as shown by com
paring the spectra of the blowpipe-beads.       This change may partly
depend on the oxidization of the uranous oxide, since some speci
mens slightly increase in weight when ignited ; but I think it cannot
be mainly due to that ; for sometimes there is uo such increase, and
uranous oxide combined with zirconia gives rise, not to a spectrum
without bands, but to one with several of very marked character, as
described below.     On the whole, since this abnormal type of spec
trum is so characteristic of combination with zirconia, it appears to
me more probable that the effect of a high temperature is to cause
the uranic oxide to combine more specially with the zirconia, as
though the greater part existed naturally as a silicate, but after igni
tion as a zirconiate.    We may also apply the same explanation in
the case of zircons more or less strongly coloured by other oxides,
which become almost colourless when heated ; and thus this unex
plained peculiarity of zircons may depend on the fact of zirconia being
able to play the part of both a base and an acid which, as compared
 with silica, has an affinity for bases varying according to the tempe
rature.
    The brown-red zircon from Ceylon, named at page 514 of my
former paper, kindly presented to me by Mr. E. L. Mitford, of
 Rusthall, gives a spectrum precisely like that of the borax blowpipe-
 beads crystallized after treatment in the deoxidizing flame, and there
fore no doubt contains uranous oxide.      This spectrum being given by

456       Royal Society    .-— Mr. H.     C. Sorby    on some Spectra
 only one part of the crystal, probably depended upon the presence of
 some substance which either reduced the uranic oxide or prevented
 the oxidization of the uranous.
     These facts thus clearly show that the various spectra which seemed
 to indicate the presence of a new element existing in three different
 physical conditions, are in reality only characteristic of the two oxides
 of uranium combined with zirconia, or not in combination.           Perhaps
 some may think that my having been thus led astray shows that little
 or no reliance can be placed on the method of investigation employed;
 but I contend that the mistake was due to its being such an unex
 pectedly delicate test for uranium; and, as explained above, the error
 was ultimately corrected by a further development               of the same
 method.     As far as the interests of science are concerned, there is
 no need to regret the general result.        We have lost what appeared
 to be good evidence of a new earth, but have gained an almost en
 tirely new system of blowpipe testing, which enables us to detect
 such a minute quantity of some substances as could not be recog
nized by the ordinary means.         I shall not now attempt to give any
 thing like a full account of this subject, since it would be much better
to let it form part of a paper on various improvements in blowpipe
chemistry, but will merely mention a few facts which have a special
 bearing on the question before us.
    In the first place,   I   would say that zirconia and the oxides of
 uranium are most useful reagents in detecting the presence of certain
 substances with which they unite to form compounds having very
special characters. The most striking of these are : — the compounds
already described, which are distinguished by the spectra, and not
by any well-marked colour ; the compound of eerie oxide with uranic
oxide, which is of a splendid deep blue colour, but shows no absorp
tion-bands ; and that of yttria with uranic oxide, which is charac
terized by a deep orange-colour and extreme fusibility.          Thorina and
oxide of lanthanum form with uranous oxide compounds which
give spectra with absorption-bands in special positions, but of the
usual type, and not of such a marked character as to be useful in
detecting minute quantities of those substances in mixtures.
    In order to see the spectra of the zirconium-uranium compounds,
it is requisite that both elements should be combined in a crystalline
condition.     When both constituents are melted in borax and are
held in solution, or if when crystals are deposited any other sub
stance replaces either the zirconia or the oxides of uranium, the
characteristic spectra cannot be seen.        The most simple application
of this test for uranium is in the case of various zircons. As much of
the powdered mineral as will dissolve should be melted with borax in
a circular loop of platinum wire about        |   inch in diameter, so as to
give   a bead  of  moderate    thickness.   A  little boric acid should then
be added, which not only tends to keep the uranium in the state of
protoxide, but also facilitates the crystallization of the borate of zir
conia, which is far less soluble when there is excess of boric acid.
The bead should then be kept at a bright red heat, just within the
deoxidizing flame, until so much borax has been volatilized that small

      of Compounds of Zirconia and         the Oxides        of Uranium.       457
needle-shaped crystals begin to be deposited, when it must be allowed
to cool rapidly.    It should then be transparent, with scattered crystals,
and the uranium all in the state of protoxide.            On gently reheating
it,  the bead ought to suddenly turn white and almost opaque               ; and
care must be taken not to heat        it  any more than        just requisite to
                                                              is
cause the borate to crystallize out, or else the uranium will rapidly
pass into the state of peroxide.         Such beads must be examined by
strong direct light from the sun, or from           alamp of very great bril
liancy, condensed on them        by  means of an almost hemispherical lens
 of about inch focal length and in addition to the means described
          }t                     ;
in my former paper,      I   have since found   it  very convenient to place
them over   a  hole in black card, so as to entirely prevent the passage
                      a
of any light which has not penetrated through them, even when so
arranged in the focus of the microscope that the spectrum of their
thin edges may be examined,          ifthe centre be too thick and opaque.
If thus properly prepared, the presence of more or less uranium will
be shown       bythe greater or less intensity of the absorption-bands of
the spectrum described and shown in fig.                of my former paper.

This test   is   so delicate that there    is  no difficulty in seeing the
darker band in the green in the case of zircons which contain no
more than -fo per cent. of uranic oxide         ;  and   I find that very few
 localities yield this mineral so free from          that
                                                    it        cannot be easily
                                                             it
detected.     Those from Miask, Siberia, are the only specimens in
which I    have not been able to recognize it.      The jargons from Ceylon
contain an amount varying up to about           1 per cent., although in no
published analysis      that I   have   seen is  there   any allusion to the
presence of even     a   trace.   It has also been overlooked in several
other cases    ; andit   now becomes important, because            gives rise to
                                                                   it
various well-defined spectra, which are so characteristic of the differ
ent minerals, that they can be very conveniently identified, even when
cut and mounted as jewels, by means of the number and position of
the absorption-bands, as intend to explain in
                          I                              paper on the spectra
                                                         a
of minerals.
    On flaming the bead at moderate red heat, the protoxide passes
                              a
into the peroxide, and the spectrum No.             6,
                                                   given above, may be seen,
if sufficient oxide be present but considerably more
                                 ;                                required than
                                                                   is
in the case of the protoxide.     I   may here say that the examination
of better preparations has enabled me to detect another distinct band
in the extreme red, not shown in fig.      2  of my former paper, and also
an additional faint band in the blue, not shown in fig.             1.
    In applying this test to detect minute quantities of uranium in
other minerals,          requisite to bear in mind that zirconia may play
                    it
                    is
the part of both an acid and base, and that various oxides and acids
                                 a
so combine with the zirconia or with the oxides of uranium as to
prevent the formation of the compounds which give rise to the
characteristic spectra. The zirconia appears to combine with some
rather than with the uranous oxide, and with others rather than
with the uranic, so that,     if   one spectrum cannot be obtained, the
other may and there are few,
           ;                         ifany, cases when neither can be seen,
especially if  care be taken to use excess of zirconia. If, however, the

458      Royal Society: — Mr.      II.  C. Sorby   on some Spectra
amount    of uranium be very small, and so much of other oxides be
present   as to make the bead very dark, or too opaque from de
posited  crystals, before it is sufficiently concentrated for the com
pounds   with the oxides of uranium to crystallize out, it may be im-
minerals, a bead of borax, boric acid, and pure zirconia should be
prepared, then a small quantity of the mineral added, and, after
fusion and sufficient concentration, the bead made to crystallize in
the manner already described.          If needle-shaped   crystals be not
deposited in the bead when very hot, and if it do not suddenly turn
opaque when reheated, the result may not be satisfactory.           In this
manner it is easy to detect uranium in ^-J-0 grain of such minerals
as Fergusonite, tyrite, and yttrotantalite, even when they contain no
more than 1 or 2 per cent.       If in such cases the spectrum of the
uranous compound cannot be obtained, the bead should always be
flamed and reexamined, to see if that of the uranic compound is
 thereby developed.
   In a similar manner we may make use of a little oxide of uranium
to detect zirconia ; but the test is far less delicate than the converse,
because it is almost impossible to obtain the compound in a crystal
line state, unless there be an excess of zirconia.        Not more than
TTiW grain   of uranic oxide  should   be employed,   or the bead may be
too opaque.     There is no difficulty in thus detecting zirconia in zir
cons, or in katapleiite ; but the presence of so much of other bases in
minerals like eudialyte prevents our obtaining a satisfactory result.
There certainly could not be a more characteristic test to confirm the
results of other methods, or to identify such a small quantity of ap
proximately pure zirconia as could not easily be distinguished in any
other way.
   The only other compound of uraDic oxide of very abnormal cha
racter which I have so far discovered is that with cericic oxide. So
much of both oxides should be fused with borax in the oxidizing flame
as will yield a bead which is perfectly clear, and of pale yellow colour
when rapidly cooled, but crystallizes when gently reheated.          If the
constituents be present in a certain proportion, it then turns from pale
yellow to a deep blue, as though coloured by oxide of cobalt.      In most
cases the bead is rendered nearly opaque by the number of crystals ;
but sometimes, though it turns deep blue, it remains transparent,
owing to the compound being set free in a state similar to that of
the red oxide of copper in a borax blowpipe-bead, with carbonate of
soda and oxide of tin, treated in the reducing flame.       The spectrum
of these blue beads shows no absorption-bands, but merely a general
absorption at the red end ; and it is curious to find that the combina
tion of two yellow substances gives rise to a deep blue, in much the
same manner as when the yellow ferrocyanide of potassium is added
to a yellow ferric salt.    The production of this blue colour on the
addition of a little uranic oxide  might be employed with advantage to
identify moderately   small quantities of cerium, even when mixed with
a number of other substances ; but uufortunately the presence of
much oxide of lanthanum, which is so commonly associated with it,

       of Compounds of Zirconia and       the Oxides    of Uranium.      459
interferes, as though the eerie oxide had a stronger affinity for the
oxide of lanthanum than for uranic oxide.
     The most characteristic peculiarity of the compound of yttria and
 uranic oxide is that it will not crystallize out from a borax blowpipe-
 bead, and that the affinity of the uranic oxide for yttria is stronger
than for zirconia. Perhaps erbia may prove to act in the same way ;
 but I have not been able to examine that earth quite free from yttria.
 On adding yttria to a bead with zirconia and a little uranic oxide, and
 gently flaming it in the oxidizing flame, the uranic oxide combines
 with the yttria and rises to the surface as an orange-coloured scum,
 which has a great tendency to collect on the platinum wire ; and if
 sufficient yttria be added, the crystallized borate of zirconia is left in
 the interior almost colourless, and so free from uranic oxide that no
 absorption-bands can be seen in the spectrum.            We may take ad
 vantage of this circumstance to detect yttria in small quantities of
 compound minerals like Gadolinite and Fergusonite ; and I may here
 say that by combining such means with the observation of the spectra
 of the transparent or crystalline beads, and of the form of the crystals
 when slowly deposited, with or without the addition of suitable re
 agents*, we may often detect twice as many constituents in minerals as
 could be detected by the ordinary methods of blowpipe chemistry —
 au advantage which, I am sure, will be appreciated by those engaged
 in the study of rocks, when it is often so important to obtain satis
 factory results with small quantities of material.        I have also found
 these methods of great practical use in examining small residues in
 the qualitative analysis of minerals, and have thus unexpectedly dis
  covered small quantities of comparatively rare elements.
     I have tried the effect of many other substances along with zirconia
 and the oxides of uranium, and find that most of them have no sensible
 influence, unless they are present in considerable relative quantity.
 The most striking effect is that of oxide of tin, which causes the two
 absorption-bands in the yellow and yellow end of the green in the
 spectrum of the uranous oxide compound to be nearly equally dark,
 whereas without the oxide of tin that in the yellow is comparatively
  faint.    This is another illustration of the manner in which certain
  substances, having no special action on light, influence by their pre
  sence the properties of another. The oxides of uranium are unusually
  sensitive to such actions, and thus not only lend themselves to us as
  blowpipe-reagents, but also seem more than any others to afford the
  means of explaining the relation between the physical conditions of
  compounds and their action on light.
      The only compound of zirconia with any other oxide to which I
  need now draw attention is that with chromic oxide as deposited
  from a borax blowpipe-bead.         After treatment in the deoxidizing
  flame, when the cooled very pale green bead is gently reheated, this
  compound crystallizes out so as to give a fine red-pink colour by
  transmitted light, even when so little chromium is present that the
  glassy bead is scarcely at all green.    If too strongly heated, the pink
  tint is lost.   This compound is of interest in connexion with the
          * Sec my paper, Monthly Microscopical Journal, vol. i. p. 349.

To others, like the emerald, it imparts a green colour ; and, on the
whole, it acts on ligbtjn such a variable manner, according to the
presence of other substances, that the spectra may be made use of as
a means of identifying particular minerals, though they do not pre
sent any thing like such striking anomalies as those met with in the
compounds of zirconia with the oxides of uranium.
    " On the Mathematical Theory of Stream-lines, especially those
with four Foci and upwards." By William John Macquorn Rankine,
C.E.,   LL.D., F.R.SS. Lond. and Edinb., &c.
   A   Stream-line is the line that is traced by a particle in a current
of fluid.   In a steady current each individual stream-line preserves
its figure and position unchanged, and marks the track of a filament
or continuous series of particles that follow each other.       The mo
tions in different parts of a steady current may be represented to the
eye and to the mind by means of a group of stream-lines.
    Stream-lines are important in connexion with naval architecture ;
for the curves which the particles of water describe relatively to a
ship, in moving past her, are stream-lines ; and if the figure of a
ship is such that the particles of water glide smoothly over her skin,
that figure is a stream-tine surface, being a surface which contains
an indefinite number of stream-lines.
    The author in a previous paper proposed to call such stream-lines
Nedids ; that is, ship-shape lines.
    The author refers to previous investigations relating to stream
lines, and especially to those of Mr. Stokes, in the Cambridge
Transactions for 1842 and 1850, on the " Motion of a Liquid past a
 Solid," and of Dr. Hoppe, on the " Stream-lines generated by a
 Sphere," in the Quarterly Journal of Mathematics for 1856, and to
 his own previous papers on " Plane Water-lines in Two Dimensions,"
in the Philosophical Transactions for 1 864, and on " Stream-lines,"
 in the Philosophical Magazine for that year.     He states that all the
 neoid or ship-shape stream-lines whose properties have hitherto been
investigated in detail are either unifocal or bifocal ; that is to say,
 they may be conceived to be generated by the combination of a uni
 form progressive motion with another motion consisting in a diver
 gence of the particles from a certain point or focus, followed by a
 convergence either towards the same point or towards a second point.
 Those which are continuous closed curves when unifocal are circular,
 and when bifocal are blunt-ended ovals, in which the length may
 exceed the breadth in any given proportions.      To obtain a unifocal
 or bifocal neoid resembling a longitudinal line of a ship with sharp
 ends, it is necessary to take a part only of a stream-line ; and then
 there is discontinuity of form and of motion at each of the two ends
 of that line.
    The author states that the occasion of the investigation described
 in the present paper was the communication to him by Mr. William
 Froude of some results of experiments of his on the resistance of
 model boats, of lengths ranging from three to twelve feet.      A sum

Dr. Rankine     on the   Mathematical Theory of Stream-lines.             461
mary of those results is printed at the end of a Report to the British
Association on the " State of Existing Knowledge of the Qualities of
Ships." In each case two models were compared together of equal
displacement and equal length : the water-line of one was a wave-line
with fine sharp ends ; that of the other had blunt rounded ends,
each joined to the midship body by a slightly hollow neck — a form
suggested, Mr. Froude states, by the appearance of water-birds when
swimming.      At low velocities, the resistance of the sharp-ended boat
was the smaller ; at a certain velocity, bearing a definite relation to
the length of the model, the resistances became equal ; and at higher
velocities the round-ended model had a rapidly increasing advantage
over the sharp-ended model.
    Hence it appeared to the author to be desirable to investigate the
mathematical properties of stream-lines resembling the water-lines of
Mr. Froude's bird-like models ; and he has found that endless
varieties of such forms, all closed curves free from discontinuity of
form and of motion, may be obtained by using four foci instead of two.
They may be called, from this property, quadrifocal stream-lines, or,
from the idea that suggested such shapes to Mr. Froude, cycndids ;
 that is, swan-like lines*.
    Those lines are not to be confounded with the lines of           yacht
                                                                      a
having at   a  distance the appearance of       swan, which was designed
                                                   a
and built some years ago       by  Mr. Peacock, for the figure of that
 vesselis  simply oval.
    The paper contains four chapters.         The first three are mainly
cinematical and geometrical, and relate to the forms of stream-line
 surfaces in two and in three dimensions, especially those with more
 than one pair of foci and surfaces of revolution, to the methods of
 constructing graphically and without calculation, by means of pro
 cesses first applied to lines of magnetic force by Mr. Clerk Maxwell,
 the traces of such surfaces, which methods are exemplified by dia
 grams drawn to scale, and to the motions of the particles of liquid
 past those surfaces.   The fourth chapter dynamical
                                                   is       ; treats of —

reduction.   These results relate to the disturbances of level which
accompany the disturbances of motion when the liquid has a free
upper surface, to the waves which originate in those disturbances of
level, and the action of those waves in dispersing energy and so
causing resistance to the motion of the vessel, to friction, or skin-
resistance, and the
                    " wake " or following current which that kind of
resistance causes the disturbing solid body to drag behind     and to it,
the action of propelling instruments in overcoming different kinds of
resistance.
   The resistance caused by viscosity     isnot treated of, because its
laws have been completely investigated by Mr. Stokes, and because
for bodies of the size of ships, and moving at their ordinary velo
cities, that kind of resistance is inconsiderable compared with skin-
resistance and wave-resistance.     The resistance caused             by

   1. " Australian Mesozoic Geology and Palaeontology." By Charles
Moore, Esq., F.G.S.
   The author referred to the observations of Professor M'Coy and
the Rev. W. B. Clark on the occurrence of fossils of Mesozoic age

Mr. C. Moore on        a Plant- and Insect -bed on the Rocky River. 463
in Australia, and then proceeded to notice the species which he had
Obtained from that region.          Fossils of Mesozoic type occur in
Western      Australia,   in the  centre   of the continent on Stuart's
route, and in Queensland; but the specimens have hitherto been
found in apparently drifted blocks, and nothing is known of the
bedded rocks from which they are derived.          The author stated that
the Australian Mesozoic fossils agree, not only in genera, but also
in many cases in species, with British forms ; and he gave a list of
species from Western Australia, identical with British species from
the Middle and Upper Lias, the Inferior Oolite, and the Cornbrash.
Of the fossils from Queensland also, many are said to be identical
with, or very nearly allied to, British species ; but the author regards
the general type of the Queensland remains as referring them to
the Upper Oolite.        A gigantic species of Crioceras is regarded by
the author as possibly indicative of the occurrence of Neocomian
deposits in Australia.       The fossil evidence upon which Professor
M'Coy inferred the occurrence of the Muschelhalk in Australia
was said by the author to be nugatory, his supposed Myophoria
proving to be a Trigonia nearly allied to T. gibbosa of the Portland
 Oolite, and his doubtful Orihoceras a small Serpnla.        The author
had found no indications of the existence of Triassic or Liassic
 deposits in Queensland.
     The blocks from Western Australia referred by the author to the
Middle Lias contain Myacites liassianus (Quenst.), and are quite as
 highly ferruginous as the English Marlstone. The species identified
by the author with British Oolitic species would indicate a range from
 the Inferior Oolite to the Cornbrash ; the author suggests that the
 species may have had a longer range in time in Australia than in
 England, or that the subordinate divisions of tho Oolite were not
 clearly marked in the Australian Mesozoic deposits.       He is inclined
to refer the fossils to the period of the Inferior Oolite.
    The author inferred, from the occurrence of these Mesozoic fos
 sils in drifted blocks at the two extremities of Australia, separated
 by 38° of longitude, that an enormous denudation of rocks of
the secondary series has taken place over a considerable part of
 Australia.
     2. " On   a Plant- and Insect-bed    on the Rocky River, New South
 Wales."      By  Charles  Moore, Esq.,  F.G.S.
     The organic remains noticed by the author were found by him in
 a small block of chocolate-colourod, micaceous, laminated marl, ob
 tained from a bed about ten feet thick, at a depth of 100-110 feet,
 in the auriferous drifts of Sydney flats, on the banks of the Rocky
 River. The author found the leaves of two forms of Dicotyledonous
 plants, fragments of a flat narrow leaf which he refers to the Coni
 fer®, a seed-vessel, and the impressions of several seeds.           The
 insect-remains consist principally of the elytra of Beetles, among
 which Buprestida; appear to predominate.          The vegetable-remains
  seem to indicate that the doposit is of Tertiary age.

        To the Editors  of the Philosophical Magazine     and Journal.
        Gentlemen,
      'HE following remarks    on the inexpediency of provisionally adopt-
  -*-
       ing in Science hypotheses avowedly erroneous were suggested by
a recent lecture of a learned Professor whose authority in scientific
 matters is justly entitled to great weight.         While freely admitting
the probably erroneous nature of the hypothesis, he suggested the
                                "
adoption of the " two-fluid        theory of electricity, on the score of its
 convenience in the explanation of electrical phenomena — rejecting,
however, with some little inconsistency, the qualitative terms " vi
treous
          " and " resinou?," and
                                     adopting the merely quantitative ad
juncts
          " positive " and " negative," which are essentially associated
with the equally erroneous " one-fluid
                                             "
                                                 theory.
     Even the convenience of this hypothesis is not very obvious ; for
although the idea of an electric "fluid" flowing over a conductor is
not at first sight inappropriate, still, that a fluid should travel at the
rate of 250,000 miles in a second (the velocity of electric transmis
sion in a copper wire as approximately determined by Sir C. Wheat-
stone) does great violence to our conceptions of fluid-motion.
     Might not the nature of electricity be as intelligibly, and with
much greater verisimilitude, explained to a partially scientific audi
ence thus : —
     If any two substances, or two portions of the same substance, he
energetically rubbed against each other, a molecular agitation or
disturbance of the particles is set up, which is recognized as heat.
But if certain substances be rubbed against each other, a molecular
agitation, differing in kind from the former in some manner at pre
sent unknown, is produced in the two substances, conferring upon
them certain physical properties, known as electricity, which, being
in some respects of a mutually opposite character, have, for the sake
of distinction, been termed positive and negative. Thus, if a glass
tube and a pad of silk, a stick of sealing-wax and a pad of flannel,
be respectively rubbed against each other, then the glass and the
flannel, the sealing-wax and the silk, respectively manifest similar
properties ; the former are said to be positively, the latter nega
tively electrified ; and so forth, theory being further dispensed with
in the exposition of electrical phenomena.
     Nor is this hypothesis at all improbable, as there are some grounds
for believing that the friction that developes electricity does not de-
velope heat, although this has not yet been fully demonstrated.
Moreover, the substitution of heat for electricity and of electricity
for heat at the point of junction of two dissimilar metals was some
time since shown by the writer ; and the evolution of light and heat
at a point of great resistance interposed in a voltaic circuit, as in
the electric lamp, are strong arguments in favour of the dynamic, in
contradistinction to the material, theory of electricity.

     The mind is proverbially tenacious of first impressions ; and the
 chief idea that an imperfectly scientific audience would have carried
 away from the lecture in question, is that electricity is a form or
 kind of matter, and not a mode of motion, or phase of dynamic
 euergy.                         I am. Gentlemen,

   RESULTS OF A RESEARCH ON THE ABSORPTION-SPECTRUM                      OP
                IODINE-VAPOUR.        BY ROBERT THALEN *.
    From my investigations on the absorption of iodine-vapour I have
arrived at the following results t : —
     1. The dark bands on the absorption-spectrum of iodine do not
extend the entire length of the visible spectrum, but only to the half
between the red and green parts.
     2. When the absorption has reached its maximum (that is, when
the absorbed part of the spectrum forms almost a single continuous
band) the violet part still remains without the smallest change ; hence
originates the violet colour characteristic of iodine-vapour.
     3. The successive bands do not form a single series, but several
mixed with each other — a fact which may be very distinctly recog
nized in the periodical changes which the intensity of the bands pre
sents.
     4. The bands belonging to a given series are not equidistant ; but
their mutual distances increase progressively with the wave-lengths,
though they are not proportional to them.
     5. Each band may be resolved into several very fine lines which
form among themselves more or less regular groups.

    In absolute determinations of nitrogen and other gases, accurate
observations of temperature and pressure are, in the ordinary methods
of analysis, necessary, and when made require subsequent calcula

By the following simple method these observations may be altogether

by the side of the companion-tube and in the same trough or cistern.
Both tubes being supported by cords passing over pulleys, it is easy
to bring the level of the mercury in the two tubes to an exact coin
cidence. The pressure on the gas is then the same iu each tube.
The temperature is also the same, as the tubes hang side by side in
the room set apart for gas-analyses, and are equally affected by any
thermometric change. It is then only necessary to read off" the vo
lumes of the gas in the two tubes to have all the data necessary for
calculating the weight of the gas to be measured.              This calculation
may     be  effected   in   two  ways,   each of which  will  be found of use.
Thus proportion (4) reads in words : — as the observed volume of the
air in the companion-tube is to the observed volume of the gas in
the measuring-tube, so is the reduced volume of the air in the first
(previously determined as above) to the reduced volume of the gas to
be measured.          This method, of course, applies to the reduction of
any gaseous mixture whatever to the normal pressure and tempera
ture.      In absolute nitrogen determinations, however, proportion (5)
gives the weight of the nitrogen measured at once, since the term
tc,V0 is found by multiplying the weight of 1 cubic centim. of nitro
gen at 0° and 760 millims. by the reduced volume of air in the com
panion-tube, and is a constant which can be used as long as the com
panion-tube lasts.          In practice, a companion-tube filled with mercury
will last with a little care for a very long time. Even when filled
with water I have found that excellent results may be obtained, and
that the tube will last for some weeks. Williamson and Russell, in
their processes for gas-analysis, have employed a companion-tube
for bringing a gas to be measured to a constant pressure ; but the
application made above is, I believe, wholly new. — Si1liman's Ameri

    I. In    the   136th     volume of these Annaien I have described a
method for determining, by means of a vibration-chronoscope, the
time which elapses between the commencement of a flash of lightning and a
motion of the hand made in consequence of perceiving it.            In the case
of one young man, whom I will denote by M, I had found this in
terval to be 0'145 of a second.
    I have recently repeated these experiments in the case of two of
my pupils, and have found that this interval amounted in one case
 to 0-183 and in another to 0'165 of a second.
    II. During the late frost I incited one of my pupils to make ex
periments to determine the coefficient of the friction of iron upon ice.
The young miin remained standing on his skates (which were not
grooved) holding in his hand a spring balance.           To this a stout cord
was fixed by which a second skater drew him along the ice.                   At
the commencement             the balance indicated a pull of from 10 to 12
pounds ; during the course it varied between 2 and 4 pounds. As
the subject of the experiment weighed 125 pounds, the coefficient of
friction in question amounted at the commencement to 8-9 per cent,
of the burden, but during the motion only to l-6-3*2 percent. — Pog-
