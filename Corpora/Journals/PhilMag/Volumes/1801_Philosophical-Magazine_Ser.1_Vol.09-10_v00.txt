  I.    History of Astronomy        for  the Year   i8co.      By Jerome
                               De Lalande*.
   JL HE    century now closed has            been   very    remarkable in
  regard    to astronomy     :  telescopes,    indeed,   and the      laws of
  Kepler and      of attraction, will    place the 17th century at the
  head   of  all the rest.   Nothing     had been before done, and the
  first century, when astronomers         began to labour, ought to be
  that of discoveries.        But the 18th century has furnished us
  with at least twelve      epochs so important that it will bear to
  be compared with the preceding.               A new capital planet and
 eight    satellites discovered,     the   periodical return of comets
 known       and demonstrated,       and 68 new comets observed and
 determined ; the aberration and nutation of the stars ; the
 transit of Venus, and the true distance of the fun and of all
 the planets; the figure of the earth and its irregularities;
 calculations in regard to the inequalities produced bv attrac
 tion, and, above all, in regard to Jupiter and Saturn, which
 have furnistied correct tables of all the planets and their sa
 tellites; tables of the moon, the most important of all, car
 ried to the precision of a quarter of a minute ; and, in the
 last place, 50,000 stars accurately observed          :  all these far sur
 pass the    hopes    which could have been conceived             a century
 ago   of the progress    of astronomy     since that period.       To these
 we must add the improvement             of astronomical instruments :
 sectors, meridian telescopes, whole circles,            reflecting circles,

telescopes     by Short and      Herschel, compensation balances,
 marine     time-keepers,      all assumed in the last century a new
 face.
     The conclusion of        the last    century was remarkable in
many respects-        Some days before the end of the year 1799,
C. Mechain discovered a comet in Ophiuchus; it was ob
served also by Messier.          Mechain and Burckhardt took           the
earliest opportunity      of calculating the elements of it.
     What    was so tedious and difficult fifty years ago, is at pre
sent the work      of  a few  hours.     This comet   was seen only for
a few days,      and    appeared to the naked eye       as a star  of  the
fifth or sixth magnitude.         It is the 91st, the orbits of which
have been calculated.          Its orbit has been calculated also in
Germany by M. Gibers and M. De Wahl.
     The prize proposed by the Institute for determining the
orbitof the cornet of 1770, has produced an excellent me
moir    by Burckhardt,     in which the question has been resolved;
but, to represent the observations, he has been obliged, like
Mr. Lexel, to recur to an orbit of five years. However ex
traordinary that result may appear, the attraction of Jupiter
seems capable      of explaining that derangement; but this ar
ticle would require long discussions;
    The grand labour respecting the stars, which we began on
the 5th of August 1789, has been continued with courage,
and successfully terminated by Le Francais Lalande.                    He
has determined the places          of 50,000 stars, from the pole to
two or three degrees below the tropic of Capricorn ; and he
has already begun, with Burckhardt, to review the zodiacal
constellations,     in the hopes of finding some new planets.
Madame Le Francais, who has already reduced 10,000 stars,
has begun      the   reduction of the whole number with exem
plary ardour.      These 50,000 stars, terminated with the 18th
century, will,     in  my opinion, form a remarkable epoch in
the increase of our astronomical knowledge during that period.
     M. Bode, of Berlin,        has published the fourth number          of
li is large and beautiful Celestial Atlas : he announces that
the fifth and last will appear in the course of four months,

              History  of  Astronomy  for the Year 1800.
                                                                   5
fists of twenty    large charts.     They may be had at the Col
lege de France, at Paris.
    The conclusion of the century has been distinguishes
also in a very remarkable manner by the theory of the moon.
On the 13th of June Laplace announced a new result of the
 theory, which is a nutation of the lunar orbit, resulting from
the oblate figure     of the earth.   According to this inequality,
 we may suppose that the lunar orbit, instead      of moving with
 a constant inclination to the ecliptic, moves in    a plane pasting
 through the equinoxes between the equator and the ecliptic,
inclined to the latter at an angle of six or seven seconds.      He
has found also an inequality of the moon, depending on the
 Jongitude of the node, which is six seconds.         Disputes were
 long maintained respecting this inequality, which the English
totally neglected,     and which did not seem to be indicated by
 theory.
    The mption of the moon during the course of 1 002 years wai
attended with a difficulty which has been now removed. The
observations of the Arabs in the tenth century were of great
importance, in this respect.        We were acquainted only with
three,   when    I discovered    among the manuscripts of my old
master, Joseph Delisle, an Arabic copy of a part of the work
of Ibn Iunis, which contained a great many ; but the ori
ginal was at Leydenj and we long solicited theBatavian go
vernment to entrust us with it. At length, on the 26th of
May    1799,    the ambassador brought to the Institute this va*
luable manuscript, written in a small character, and forming
400 pages in quarto. Cauffin is employed in giving a com
plete translation of it ; and we hope, that not only the trans
lation, but also the Arabic original, as far as it relates to the
observations,     will be printed at Paris. Caussin has already
translated   that which     I  procured him.    He was assisted by
Bouvard in regard to the astronomical part and the calcula
tions. The results of the observations of the moon have been
already printed.
    The Institute had proposed as the subject of a prize, the
comparison of a great number of observations of the moon,
with the tables to six the epochs of the longitude of the moon,
                                                                  of

of  the apogeum,     and  of  the node.    The two   papers   of Burg
 and Bouvard, which shared the prise of the Institute, contain
new determinations of the moon's motion, founded on so
great a number of observations,        that there is reason to think
that the tables thence      resulting will never err more than      15
orao   seconds;    that is to fay, one-half or one-third less than
those which Mason published in England.              Dr. Maskelyne
made    him undertake them by determining the co-efficients
of  24 equations of the tables of Mayer by a comparison with
those of Bradley.       But the new researches are founded on a
much greater number of observations.
   The equations, which De Laplace found by theory, have
added to them a greater degree of perfection, and nothing
remains but the latitude, for which a new prize ought to be
proposed.
   Burg   has calculated    3233 of Maflcelyne's observations,      in
order to   determine    the  epoch  of  the   moon.    He has   again
determined also the 24 equations of the moon as Mason has
done, but with more correctness.        Madame Lavit has had the
courage   to calculate    more than 500 places of the moon for
the researches   of Bouvard on the fame subject.
   Burckhardt, one of our ablest sand most zealous astrono
mers, has calculated tables of the moon, according to the
new results of Burg, for the use of the astronomers who have
set out on a distant expedition. They will perhaps find them
selves in situations when it will be of importance for them to
have   the longitudes calculated more exactly         than they are
either in the English Nautical Almanack or the French Con-
noijsance des Temps, which, besides, may be exhausted before
their return.
   The French Board of Longitude            has proposed   a  prize of
6ooo francs      (250/.)   for more    perfect tables of the moon,
which   we shall soon obtain.     This part, therefore, of ,so much
importance to astronomy and navigation, which has occupied
astronomers for more than ioo years, is at length terminated
in  the completest    and most satisfactory   manner.
   De Parceval,     an   able geometer,     has terminated a grand
analytical theory of     the moon,    in which he has given exact
                                  1                          formulae

formulx     for a greater number of equations than are in the
tables   above mentioned.    He proposes publishing a history
of   the integral calculus.
  De Laplace is employed also on the theory of the moon ;
and we have reason lo expect from him new and valuable
things.    He has given a memoir on the satellites of Saturn
and those of Herschel's planet. He has shown that the last
satellite of Saturn has a constant inclination, and he deter
mines the motion of its nodes.          New considerations in       regard
to those of Herfchel, induce him to think that this planet
may maintain in the fame plane its first five satellites ; but
that the cafe,    in all probability,    is not the fame in regard to
the. sixth.
     Vidal continues   to fend us rare observations         on   Mercury,
"which he has made at Mircpoix.    Ke is our valuable Her-
mophilus,  who  fees Mercury every day, and who fees him
even at the distance of some minutes from the fun.    This
astonishing observer has already         sent me more than 500 ob
servations of Mercury.    He          has done more in this respect
than all the other astronomers          in the world.       At Mirepoix,
perhaps, it is not known that such a man exists in that
small town, but we shall proclaim it to the universe and to
posterity.
  The minister    appointed him director of the national ob
servatory at Thoulouse on the 21st of April last, and a better
choice could not have been made.
   Michel Le Francais-Lalande,    my nephew, finding that
Mars was the only planet the tables of which were still
liable to errors of one or two minutes, has re-calculated all
the observations of that planet. Eurtkhardt has re-calcu
lated the perturbations which I formerly gave in the memoirs
of   the Academy  of Sciences, and which Schubert aud Oriani
afterwards calculated ; and Le Fran^ais has presented to the
Institute new tables of Mars in temhs of a second, and which
give us reason to apprehend no more than a sew seconds of
error.   They arc now printing in the &nnai£ance <ks TiVips
for the year 12 ; and the opposition of the 8ih of November
last has confirmed the correctness of these tables. An exact
vbscnaiiuu of     the 13th, gave an error         of only   ij   seconds   in,
                                                                 longitude

   longitude and 6 in latitude ; and the observation made by
  Bouvard with the new instruments of the observatory,                        gave
  the same number of seconds; which confirms,                       in asatisac-
  tory manner, the goodness of our instruments and the exact
  ness of our observers.
      Triesnecker       has  undertaken        a  similar labour at Vienna,
  and Oriani at Milan.            The     differences       are insensible,     but
  none of the three knew any thing of what was doing by his
  fellow-labourers.
      Wurm      has    also calculated       the perturbations of Mars by
 the method       of  Klugel,   inserted    in   the memoirs of the Society
 of Gtktingen.          Oriani, Burckhardt, Schubert, and Wurm,
 do not always agree, but the differences arc trifling.
      Bouvard is employed in calculating the perturbations of
 all the planets, as they affect each other, by the formula; of
 De Laplace. This will be a very complete work, the result
 of which will      appear in the second volume              of  the Mecanique
 Celeste.
     The transit of Mercury             over the sun has afforded me an
 opportunity of verifying the            place     of   the   aphelion by the
 method which          I  gave in the memoirs             of  the Academy for
 1786,     and   which is the most conclusive.                By my      result  it
 appears that there is no reason for making any change in the
tables of Mercury, which             I published in the Connoijsance dis
 Temps.       The     fame   agreement         in regard to Venus may be
 seen in the     Connoiffance des      Temps for the year II, p. 456.
     For    Jupiter we have found the              correction to be made in
the     tables + 34" in the         opposition and + 30" in the qua
drature.
     For Saturn       the   correction      in the      opposition is     —   10",
nearly     as the  preceding year.
    For HerschePs planet          I  have found       —    9" ; and Von Zach,
by employing five observations, had the fame result.
     We     have reason      therefore     to be satisfied       with   the cor-
Tcctnessofour        tables for all the planets.
     In  regard to the tables       of the tun,      I  have still found     8  or
10* too much in our longitudes               :  whether this arises from a
retardation in the motion of the earth for                 15  or 20 years past,
or from some error respecting            the mean motion in the con
                                                                       struction

ever this may be,       I deduct 10" from the fun's place in cal
culations where great precision is required.
    Delambre does not admit this correction : he fays, that in the
300 observations of Greenwich, which he calculated in order
to construct    his tables,    he compared     the fun   with  the liar*
which    pasted  in the day-time, one before and the other after
the fun   ; and   he adds, that unless this precaution is taken,
we cannot assert that 10" are to be deducted from his tables.
    An account of the        grand   labour by Delambre respecting
a degree of the meridian between Dunkirk and Rodez, has
been printed.       The southern part, executed          by Mechain,
will next appear.
    Vidal continues to fend us observations of         the stars below
the tropic.     Bernier, who laboured with me for nine months
before his embarkation,        reduced them up to the year 1800;
and they    will  soon be printed.
    Delambre      has undertaken to observe with a whole circle
the declinations      of  the stars   of the 1st, ad, and 3d magni
 tude; which will add a         new   degree of perfection to the ca
talogue of the principal stars publistied annually in the Con-
noifsance des Temps.
    The description of the astrolabe planisphere, found by
 Gail in Synesius, has induced Delambre to give a long me
 moir on the history of astrolabes, their construction, their
properties, and the method of finding new results even in the
 most hackneyed part of astronomy.
    Burckhardt has found         a formula which represents the de
 clinations of the magnetic needle observed at Paris since the
 year 1580.      It appears from this formula that the period of
 the declination of the magnetic needle is at Paris 860 years;
 that the greatest declination west is 30" 4, and will take place
 in  the year 1878    :  the greatest eastern declination is only    zy.
    The printing of the Hijloire celeste Fran^aife, which is a
 collection of all our observations,         is still continued.     My
  Bibliographic Aflronomique is also continued, but the print
 ing-office of the republic is not sufficient for all the under
  takings which have already been begun in it.            Chaptal, the

      The printing of     of sines to thousandth parts of the
                               tables
circle has been finished. The late Borda caused them to be
calculated under his own inspection.       The printing was
pretty far advanced,            but several things still remained to be
done.           Delambre      put the last hand lo them, and verified
the calculation  in several parts : he corrected the proofs and
wrote the explanation.
   The decimal tables have been calculated to a much greater
extent at the Bureau du Cadastre by the care of Prony; but
the difficulty       of printing         them    will   perhaps greatly retard the
advantage         we expect from them.                  Ifwe can get all the astro
nomical          tables   reduced        to decimal degrees,            that    is to fay,

drant, astronomical               calculations will          be much simplified ; but
a long time may elapse before astronomers will agree in re
gard  to this reformation, though useful.
      I
     have published an edition of the Mondes de Fontenelle,

is still generally read, stood in need of notes for correcting its

 , In the Ephemerides of Vienna for j8oo and 1801, Trief-

since 1747,        in order to deduce from them                        the longitudes         of
the cities      of Europe and America, and also                        the errors       in   the
tables.        Never were            so
                                      many eclipses calculated and that           ;

                                                        a
service to government.
   Goudin,   who has bestowed great labour on the analytical
calculationof eclipses, and who has published several memoirs
on that subject,              has   by   his analysis completely determined                  the
circumstances of the eclipse of 1847, the most considerable of
the present new century.    Duvaucel, to whom we are in
debted for the delineation                   of eclipses for thirty         years past, has
delineatedalso this eclipse for every country on the globe.:                                  by
his diagram      appears that

   Duvaucel has delineated also the eclipse of the                                nth of Fe
bruary 1804, which will be curious, because                           it   will   be total and
annular        in       countries according to the altitude of the
                    different

   Asia, from nine in the morning till one o'clock ; it will be
   total, with a short duration in the shadow, to the southern
   part  of Europe  :  there is reason to think      that some voyage's
   will  be undertaken on      this occasion, since it will be an un
   common opportunity for determining the differences of the
   diameters of the fun and moon, the irradiation and inflection.
   These diagrams of eclipses have hitherto appeared in the
   Ephemerides of Paris and in those of Bologna ; but those in
   the Ephemerides of Paris terminated with 1800, and in those
   of Bologna, which     go as far as  j8io,   there is only one diagram
   for 1804; four are wanting, viz. of 1802, 1803, 1806, and
   1807. Duvaucel purposes to construct them, and particularly
   the last two.

   assigned to   him by Bonaparte, he has published the eighth
   volume of the Memoirs of the Italian Society, in which he
   has given some memoirs on astronomy.
      Bode, in the Ephemerides of Berlin for 1802, has published
   a great many memoirs, observations, and calculations, by him
   self and by Wurm, Mechain, Olbers, Cafella, Koch, Koehler,
   Triesnecker,    Burg,    Schrœter,     Klugel,    Scyffert, Hennert,
   Schubert,    Derfflinger,    Hahn, Kautsch, Fritsch,        and Schau-
   bach.
      In the    Connoijsance des Temps for the year        1 1, which  has
  just appeared, there are a multitude of observations and cal
   culations by Laplace, Delambre, Vidal, Messier, Lachapelle,
   Sorlin, Mougin, Quenot, Burckhardt, Thulis, Poitevin, Ber-
   nier, and myself,    and a catalogue of 2300 new stars by Le
   Francais-Lalande      and Vidal.
      This volume consists of more than 500 pages, agreeably to
   the decision of the Board of Longitude, which I requested
   several years ago,    and yet   I have still  in my hands materials     .
    which   I was not able to employ.
      I  shall embrace   this opportunity to inform those who have
   the Connoijsance des Temps for the year 9, without the addi
   tions, that they have been published separately under the title
   us Melangis d'JJlronomie, and that with the first part they

form the 500 pages as above announced. It was apprehended
that the use of the old calendar and the old measures found in
this work would thwart the projects of government, and this
sacrifice was made for the fake of peace. But the amateurs of
this collection of the Connoiff'ance des Temps will be deceived
if they     have the volume             of
                            the year 9 without the Melanges.
     In      Melanges, page 382, I announced the publication
          these
of   Malespina's Voyage round the World ; but it has not
taken place,         and       is still in prison.
                            that    officer         I am, how
ever, of opinion, that in the' maps about to be published in
Spain, advantage will be taken of his observations.
  The Memoirs of the French National Institute, vol. ii.forthe
year 5, were published on the                 iath of November        1799.    They
contain calculations of two comets and several eclipses already
observed; the theory of the secular equation of the moon by
Laplace,          the discovery     of which      we announced,        and    which
may be found also in the Mecanique Celejle,                       that grand       and
important work, of which we have already spoken, and of
which three long extracts were published by Briot in the
Magazine Encyclopedique.  Burckhardt has given a German
translation of        it,
                   that his former country may enjoy the va
luable discoveries of Laplace.

 extract from       this paper.      In  the Transactions     of 1800,
Dr. Herfchel gives a long paper on the            influence of the dif
ferent solar rays and those of terrestrial bodies to communicate
light and heat : he has found that the yellow rays illuminate
most, and that the red communicate the greatest degree of
 heat. Astronomers will make use of this information when
they observe the sun.        This   paper contains a series  of curious
experiments on light.
    Mr. Playfair, in the fifth volume of        the Edinburgh Trans
actions, has given formulae for the figure of the earth.
    A valuable work for geometry, which treats of the calculus
of derivations    published   by Arbogaft, one of our greatest geo
metricians, deserves     a  place in our history of astronomy. This
work, in    page 355, contains an application of the calculus of
derivations to series which proceed according to the finesor
cosines   of the multiples of     the fame angle   :  his methods give
more facility and perfection to the manner of treating them.
    I have received the Ephemerides of Milan for the year
1800, which        contain the perturbations of Mars, calculated
by Oriani,     and his tables    of Mars, which will form part of
the Ephemerides fort 801. I have received also the Epheme
rides from Rome by Oddi, who occupies the observatory
Gaetani, and the Nautical Almanack for 1804, which Sir
Joseph Banks transmitted         to us with his usual zeal.
    Gudin has published a poem of 6oo lines, containing a
history of astronomy and an account of the present state of
that science.       The author has added very copious and in
structive  notes.     This poem is already employed as an agree
able fund of instruction for youth under the care of a well
known preceptor.         But, after so many interesting works, the
historian is obliged to announce one more voluminous, called
Principes natureh, ou Notions generates et particulieres de

     During        the    first years       of    the   revolution the national ob
servatory was neglected : as soon as                       I   was appointed          director
of   it I solicited       for new instruments;                 and   Mechain, when          he
returned        from his voyages, employed                   himself in causing the
necessary reparations                to be made.           By the month of July the
new instruments were erected,                       but it was not till the 22d             of
August that Mechain was able to begin his observations of
the moon. Bouvard supplies his place with that zeal by
which he is so much distinguished; and we shall have at
Paris     a series       of   of the moon that may equal
                              observations
those made at the observatory of Greenwich.
   The large mural quadrant of 7 j- sect, which Bonaparte
procured for us, as I mentioned in my History of Astronomy
for the year 7, has been erected.
     Lenoir        has added         to     the   centre       an    ingenious machine,
which       eases the         central axis from the weight                  of   the telescope
and        according as the elevation of the telescope is
          varies
changed.   A mural of five feet, made in England by Siflon
in 1743, and which I had at Berlin in J 751, has been erected
on the northern fide.   An excellent transit instrument by
Lenoir       has been placed in the meridian, and sights have been
fixed up north and south at great distances, that the telescope
may be always exactly in the meridian : there is reason to
hope that we shall have a column in the plain, with a light
to be kindled in the evening, which will serve during the
night.                                >

   The copper, properly alloyed, is first taken to a rolling
mill, and reduced between iron rollers to a proper thickness
for the button. The sheets of copper are then brought to the
button manufactory, and cut into circular pieces of the size of
the intended button by means of a fly-press. In this state
they are called blanks, and resemble halfpence and farthings
worn smooth by long circulation.
     The       shanks,         which         are made with wonderful facility and
expedition by means of a very curious machine, are then se
cured to the bottom of each button by a small iron crank,
and            quantity os solder and resin applied to each.

gross, and introduced into a very hot stove, where they remain
till the workman is satisfied that the solder has melted, and
that the shanks are united to the button;                                         after which the
edges are smoothed in a lathe.

buttons come from the burnisher they are fit for gilding.
This      is   a   very curious operation, and truly chemical..
  The         first process towards gilding                     is   what they call quicking,
which         is   effected as         follows — Any given quantity of buttons,

acid     5    and thus the buttons and mercury are stirred together

 acid to the copper, adheres to the whole surface
 The buttons are then taken out and put into what is called a
 basket, though in fact an earthen vessel full of small holes,
 the handle of which the operator holds in his hand, and jerks
it with    considerable          force    down towards        a   wooden trough
 (a receptacle for the quicksilver) till, by repeated jerks, all the
loose particles of mercury are disengaged, leaving a complete
continuity over the surface,                  and giving them the appearance
of silver buttons.
     Now   the gold,       a grain       of which will        spread over many
superficial feet of copper, is thus prepared :     Any given
quantity of mercury is poured into an iron ladle, the inside of
which having been previoufly guarded, — that      rubbed over      is,
with dry whiting to prevent the gold from adhering to the
iron, — into this mercury    thrown the portion of pure gold
                                         is
intended to cover  given quantity of buttons. The gold and
                          a
mercury are heated together in the iron ladle till the work
man (whose practice soon enables him to judge) perceives
that there   is
             a     perfect union between               them; when he empties
his ladle into    a   containing cold water.
                      vessel
   The amalgam being cold,       put into  piece of fhammoy

leather, and squeezed till no more mercury will pass through.
What passes the fhammoy contains not the smallest portion of
gold  ; what remains will be about the consistency of butter,
so   completely united that every particle of mercury stiall con
tain an equal portion of gold. The amalgam should he then
put into an earthen vessel, and   small quantity of nitric acid
                                               a
added thereto, allowing sufficient time for the acid to unite,
with the mercury.      But the buttons and amalgam are com
monly  introduced  first, and  quantity of diluted nitric acid
                                         a
added thereto,    that, for want of complete union between
                   so                              a

                                              superabundancy a
of acid, there may not be sufficient to carry all the amalgam
to the surface of the buttons.
   When the acid has had sufficient time to embrace (as work
men call   it)   the mercury, the buttons should                  be introduced,
and be stirred    till    the amalgam, carried           by   the affinity   of the

18                     A   brief Account of      the
acid to the copper, and the tendency which the gold has to
extend itself to the mercury with which the buttons have been
previously quicked, completely attaches to the whole surface.
    •It is the next process in which we principally wish to re
commend a deviation from the old practice, by which most
of   the mercury   will  be recovered,       and the gilder's health, in
a great measure, preserved from the dreadful              effects of vola
tilised mercury.
    The   old practice is as follows       :   The buttons being com
pletely covered with mercury and gold, the operator proceeds
to that business which is called drying-off, which is performed
thus : The buttons, to the quantity of a few dozens, are put
into an iron pan somewhat like a large frying-pan, placed
over a sire, and gently shook, while the operator watches
carefully till he observes the mercury begin to flow; — upon
the first symptom of which, he takes the pan from the fire,
and throws the buttons into a large cap, called a gilding cap,
like a man's hat with a very small brim, but much larger
in   the crown,    made    of   coarse wool and goats hair.        In this
cap, with a circular brush, the buttons are stirred, to spread
the gold and mercury while in a degree of temperature-nearly
sufficient to volatilise   the mercurv.         The buttons arc again
thrown into the pan, placed over the sire, and shaken, while
the mercury gently volatilises.          The buttons are again thrown
into the cap, and stirred with the brush.                 This process is
 continually repeated,     till  all the  mercury    is volatilised, leav
 ing the gold on the buttons, which appear sgain of a yellow
 colour.
     Thus a principal part of the mercury ascends the chimneys,
 is deposited on the tops of the houses and about the adjacent
 neighbourhood, and great quantities are inhaled and absorbed
 by the operator, keeping him nearly in a state of salivation
 till disease obliges him to desist.
      Considerable quantities of mercurv thus volatilised are found
  united and collected in small pools in the spouts and gutters
 on the     tops of the buildings.         Thus many* tons of mercurv
  have been dissipated about the town and neighbourhood of
  Birmingham,      to the great       injury of the inhabitants.       The

 poor sweep who has ascended the chimneys has been salivated,
 and the manufacturer has sustained considerable loss.
     To preserve a principal part of the mercury thus dissipated,
and to prevent, in a great measure, the terrible effects of it
on the constitution of the operator, is the object of these re
marks, as far as it regards manufacturers.
    By means of an apparatus similar to the plan delineated in
Plate    I.  fig. 3. which     has   been    partially and successfully
adopted by       Mr.  Mark Sanders, an eminent button-maker of
Birmingham,         the principal part     of  the mercury may be re
covered,     and the health    of the operator     greatly«preserved.
    A    hearth of the usual height is to be erected, in the
middle of which a capacity for the fire is to be made; but
instead    of permitting   the smoke to ascend into the top       A,  made
of sheet or    cast iron, through which the mercury is volatilised,
a flue for that purpose should be conducted backwards to the
chimney B. An iron plate, thick enough to contain heat
sufficient to volatilise the mercury, is to cover the fire-place at
the top of the hearth C. There must be an ash-hole, D,
under the sire-place.        The square space E, seen in the fire
place, is the flue, which serves to carry the smoke back under
the hearth into the chimney B.                The door of the fire-place
and ash-pit may either be in front, as represented in the plate,
or at the end of the hearth at F, which will perhaps less in
commode the work-people.              It would    be  of  great advantage
if  the space between       A and   the   iron plate C was covered up
with    a glass  window     coming     down so low as only to leave
sufficient    room for moving the pan backwards and forwards
with facility. If the fides were also glass instead of brick
work it would be still better,            as the  work-people would be
able to have      a full view of their work without being exposed
to the fumes of the mercury, which, when volatilised by heat
communicated to the pan by the heated iron plate over the
 sire- place,   would ascend into the top A, appropriated for its
reception, and descend' into the tub G, covered at top and
filled prttty high with water.              By this means the hearth
would, in fact, become a distilling apparatus for condensing
 and recovering the volatilised mercury.               In the tub G the
principal part would be recovered; for, of what may still pass

on,    part would be condensed in ascending the tube H, and
          a
fall back, while the remainder would be effectually caught in
the tub or cask               I,   open at the top and partly filled with water.
The latter tub should be on the outside of the building, and
the descending branch of the tube H should go down into it
at least 18 inches, but not into the water.  The chimney or
the ash-pit should be furnished with a damper to regulate the
heat of the fire.
     The water may                  be occasionally drawn out                    of   the tubs by a
siphon, and the mercury clogged with heterogeneous matter
may be triturated in a piece of flannel till it passes through,
or placed in a pan of sheet iron, like a dripping-pan, in a suf
ficient degree of heat, giving it a tolerable inclination, so that
the mercury, as it gets warm, may run down and unite in
the lower part of the pan. But the mercury will be most
effectually recovered by exposing the residuum left in the
flannel bag to distillation in a retort made of iron or of
earthenware.
  When the mercury is volatilised from the buttons, or, as
the workmen denominate                           it,
                          when the buttons are dryed off,
they are finally burnished, and are then finished                                        and fit for
carding.
  The          reader unacquainted with this branch                                 of manufacture
will be         surprised          to learn how         far     a     small quantity      of gold,
incorporated with mercury, will spread over  smooth surface                     a

                             144 buttons, each of one inch
diameter, are sufficient to excuse the manufacturer from the
penalty inflicted                  by   an act     of parliament; yet many, upon
an assay are found to be deficient                      of this small quantity, and
the maker fined and the buttons forfeited accordingly. Many
hundred grosses have been tolerably gilt with half that quan
tity;   extremely far can gold be spread, when incorporated
              so
with mercury, over the surface of                           a   smooth          piece os copper*.

III. A      Treatise on the Cultivation                 of the Vine, and       the
         Method of making Wines.               By      C. Chaptal *.
  X HERE          are few natural productions employed by man
as aliment,     which    he has not altered or modified by prepara
tions which remove them from their primitive state.                        Corn,
flesh, and fruits,      are    all  subjected        to   a  commencement         of
fermentation before they are used as nourishment ; and pe
culiar qualities are given even to objects of luxury, caprice,
or whim, such as tobacco and perfumes.
    But it is in   the fabrication      of liquors in particular       that man
has displayed       the greatest      sagacity     :   all are the work    of his
own creation, water and milk excepted.                        Nature never fur
nishes spirituous liquors : it suffers the grapes to rot on the
stems, while art converts           the   juice into        an agreeable,   tonic,
and nourishing liquor called ivine.
    It is difficult to ascertain the precise period when mankind
began to make wine.             This valuable discovery seems to be
lost   in the darkness of antiquity, and the origin of wine has
its fables, like all other things which have become objects of
general utility.
    We    are told by Athenæus that Orestes, the son                  of Deuca
lion, came to reign at Ethna, where he planted vines. Histo
rians agree in considering Noah as the first who made wine
in Illyria, Saturn in Crete, Bacchus in India, Osiris in
Egypt,     and   king Geryon in Spain.                    A poet, who assigns
every thing to a divine source, is inclined to believe that after
the deluge God granted wine to man to console him in his
misery, and he        expresses    himself thus respecting its origin           :
              Omnia   vastatis  ergo cum ctrneret arvis
             Dcsolata Deus,      nobis felicia vini
              Dona dedir, trifles hominum quo munere fovit
              Reliquias  ; mundi    solatus vite ruinam.       Vanerii Prttd. Rust.
Even the etymology of the word wine has given rife to dif
ferent opinions among authors ; but from that long series of
fables with which the poets, who are always bad historians,
have obscured the origin of wine, we may collect some va-
               * From Cows W Agriculture        tie   Rozier, Vol. X.
                                                                            luable

 22                  On the  Cultivation   of the Vine,
luable truths, and among these we may venture to class the
following    :
    The   earliest   authors not only attest that they were ac
quainted with the art of making wine, but that they had
some very correct ideas in regard to its different qualities and
virtues, and the various ways of preparing it. The heathen
deities, we are told, delighted in nectar and ambrosia.
    Dioscorides speaks of the Cæcubum dulce, the Surrentinum
aujlerum, &c; and Pliny describes two kinds of Alban wine,
the one mild, and the other sharp and tart.               The celebrated
Falernian      wine,   according to Athenæus,          was  also of two
kinds.     The antients were even acquainted           with brisk wines,
 as appears by the following       passage   of Virgil  :
                                   -Me   impiger hausit
                                       -
                   Spumancem pateram
    When       we  read what historians have left us respecting the
origin of   the wines possessed by the antient Romans, it seems
doubtful     whether their successors have added any thing to
their knowledge on that subject.              They procured their best
wines from Campania, called at present Terra di Lavori, in
tho* kingdom of Naples.           The Falernian and Masiic wine
were the produce of vineyards planted on the hills around
Mondragon,        at the foot   of which runs the Garigliano, for
merly called the Iris. The wines of Amicla and Fondi were
made in the neighbourhood of Gaeta, the grapes of Suefla
grew near the sea, &c. But notwithstanding the great variety
of wine produced by the soil of Italy, luxury soon induced
the Romans to seek for that of Asia, and their tables were
loaded with the valuable wines of Chio, Lesbos, Ephesus,
Cos, and Clazomene.
    The earliest historians who have furnished             us with    any
positive facts respecting      the making      of wines,    leave us no
reason to doubt that       the   Greeks had made considerable        pro
gress in the       art of preparing and preserving them. They
distinguished      them itto two kinds, protopon and deuterion,
according as they were produced from the juice which flowed
from the grapes before they were trod upon, or from the juice
expressed by treading them. The Romans afterwards denoted
                                                                    these

                   and the Method        of making Wines.               23
these two kinds        of wine by the terms vinum pr'marium            and
vinum secundum.
     When      we    read with      attention what Aristotle and Galea
have handed down to us on the preparation and virtues of
the most celebrated wines of their time, we can hardly help
believing that the antients possessed the art of thickening and
drying certain kinds of wine in order to preserve them for a
long time.          Aristotle tells us expressly that the wines of
 Arcadia became so dry in the leather bags in which they
 were kept, that it was necessary to scrape them off and dilute
 them with water before             they could be fit for drinking : Ita
 exjiccatur in utribus ut derasum bibatur.                 Pliny speaks of
 wines kept for a hundred years which had become as thick
 as   honey, and which could not be drunk till diluted with
 warm water and strained through a cloth.                  This was called
saccatio vinorum.              According to Martial, Cæcuban wine
  ought   to  be  filtered    in  that manner :
                  Turbida sollicito transmittere Cicuba  sacco.
  Galen speaks of some wines of Asia, which, when put into
  large bottles suspended near the fire, acquired by evaporation
  the solidity   of   salt.     This operation was called fumarium.
      It was certainly wine of this nature that the antients            pre
  served in the upper part of their houses, and in a southern            ex
  posure   : these places were distinguished by the appellations           of
  borreum vinarium,           apotbeca  vinaria.
      But all   these facts can relate only to mild, thick, and little
   fermented     wines, or to juices not altered and concentrated.
   They were extracts rather than liquors, and perhaps they
   were only resinous substances similar to that which we form
   at present by the inspissation        and concentration of the   juice of
    the grape.
       The antients      were acquainted     also with light wines, which
   were drunk immediately:            quale in Italia quod Gauranum vo-
   cant et Albanum,          et  qua in Sabinis et in Tufcis nascuntur.
   They   considered        recent wines as hot in the first degree, and
    the oldest were considered         as the hottest.
       Each kind of wine had             a known and determinate period
    before which       it could not be employed for drinking.          Dios-
             8                                                        coridea

 24                            On the Cultivation               of the Vine,
 corides fixes this period at the seventh year, as a mean term.
 According to Galen and Athenæus, Falernian wine was never
drunk, in general, until it had attained the age of ten years,
and never after the age of twenty. The Alban wines required
the age of twenty years, the Surrentine twenty-five, &c.
Macrobius                 relates that Cicero,            being at supper with Dami-
fippus, was treated with Falernian wine  of forty years, which
Cicero praised by observing  that it bore its age well : bene,
inquit, tetalem Jcrt.  Pliny speaks of wine served up at the
table of Caligula which was more than 160 years old. Horace
celebrates            wine of       a   hundred leaves, &c.

variable truth,                that beyond the 50th degree of latitude the
juice of            the grape cannot experience   that fermentation which
converts     into an agreeable beverage.

     The cafe with the vine in regard to climate                               is   the fame as
with          other vegetable      productions.                      We find towards the
north           a   vigorous vegetation, plants well nourished, and suc
culent;             while the south exhibits productions charged with
aroma, resin, and volatile oil                   ;       here    every   thing    is   converted
into spirit, there every thing                           employed to produce           Jlrength.
These characters,                                in is
                    striking   vegetation, occur in the phæ-

to be the attribute                of   the inhabitant          of   the north.
     TravellersEngland have observed that some of the insipid
                          in
Vegetables of Greenland acquire taste and smell in the gar
dens near London.    Reynier found that the melilot, which
has       a    penetrating smell in warm climates, retained
                strong;
hone    Holland. Every body knows that the highly subtile
           in
poison of certain plants and animals     successively blunted      is

further towards the north.

    Sugar itself seems not to expand in a complete manner
but in warm countries.          The sugar-canes cultivated in our
gardens    furnish    scarcely   any     saccharine     principle ;   and
grapes are four, harsh,      or insipid, beyond the 50th degree of
latitude.
    The aroma, or perfume of the       grapes, as well as the saccharine
principle,   are the production       then  of a bright   and a constant
sun.    The   sour or harsh    juice produced in grapes during the
first period  of their formation cannot be properly matured, in
the north, and thi3 primitive character of greenness still exists
when the first frosts come to freeze the organs of maturation
    Thus, in the north, the grapes rich in principles of putre
faction contain scarcely any element of spirituous fermenta-"
tion, and the     expressed  juice of the fruit, having experienced
the phenomena         of fermentation, produces a four liquor, in
which there exists only that proportion of alcohol necessary
for interrupting the movements of putrid fermentation.
    The vine, therefore, as well as the other productions of
nature, has climates peculiar to itself: it is between the 40th
and 50th degrees of latitude that this vegetable production
can be cultivated with        any degree of advantage.          It is also
between these points that the most celebrated vineyards are
found, and the countries richest in vines; such as Spain,
Portugal, France, Italy, Austria, Styria, Carinthia, Hungary,
Transylvania, and a part of Greece.
    But of all countries none perhaps presents so happy a situa
tion for the vine    as France ; none exhibits so large an extent
of vineyards, nor     exposures more varied      5  and no country has
such an astonishing variety       of temperature.       From the bank9
of  the Rhine to the     bottom of the Pyrenees       the vine is almost
every where cultivated, and in this vast extent the most agree
able and most spirituous wines of Europe are to be found.
    But though climate      stamps a general and indelible charac
ter on its productions, there are certain circumstances             which
modify and      limit   its action  ;  and it is only by carefully at
tending to what each of them produces that we can be able
to discover the effect of climate alone.             It is thus that we
often find the different qualities of wine united under the fame

46                   On the Cultivation     of the Vine,
climate, because the soil, exposure, and cultivation, modify
and mask the immediate action of that grand agent.
    On    the other hand,       there are some vine plants which do
not leave us the choice of cultivating them indiscriminately
in any latitude at pleasure.          Soil, climate, exposure, cultiva
tion,    all ought to be appropriated to their inflexible nature;
and    the    least violation of this natural character essentially
alters    the product.      Thus,    the vines   of Greece   transported
to  Italy no longer      produced    the same wine ; and those    of Fa-
lerfrum, cultivated at the bottom of Vesuvius, have changed
their nature. It is confirmed by daily experience that the
plants of Burgundy transported to the south no longer pro
duce wines so agreeable and delicate.
    It is therefore    proved that the characters by which certain
vines are distingui Hied cannot be reproduced in different sites;
for this purpose the constant influence of the same causes is
necessary, and, as it is impossible to unite them all, the con
sequence must be changes          and modifications.
    We may       therefore conclude that warm climates, by favour
ing   the formation of the saccharine principle, must produce
wines highly spirituous, as sugar is necessary to their forma
tion.      But the fermentation must be conducted in such a
manner       as to decompose     all the sugar of the grapes, otherwise
the result will be wines exceedingly luscious and sweet, as has
been observed       in  some   of   the southern   countries, and in all
cafes where tlje saccharine juice of the grapes is too much
concentrated to experience a complete decomposition.
    The cold climates can give birth only to weak and exceed
ingly    aqueous     wines, which have sometimes an agreeable
flavour    ;  the grapes, in which scarcely any saccharine prin
ciple    exists,   cannot contribute towards the production of
 alcohol, which forms the whole strength of wines. But, on
 the other hand, as the heat arising from the fermentation of
 these grapes is very moderate,         the aromatic principle is pre
 served in its full force, and contributes to render these liquors
 exceedingly agreeable, though weak.

 in   fat moist soil, well dunged, that                         it ought     to be cultivated.
 But we are taught by experience                           that the goodness           of wine is
 never proportioned to the force                         of   the vine.      We     may there
 fore fay that nature,                    desirous to assign to each quality              of   soil
a    peculiar production, has reserved dry light soil for the vine,
and has entrusted the cultivation of corn to fat and well nur
tured lands           :
                               Hie   segetes,   il lie veniunt felicius uvae.
      It   is   in   consequence    of this admirable distribution that agri
culture covers              with its varied productions the surface of our
globe ; and nothing is necessary but to avoid deranging the
natural order, and to apply to each place the proper cultiva
tion to obtain almost every where abundant and varied crops:
                       Nee vero terra ferre omnes omnia possunt :
                       Nascuntur steriles sexosis montibus orni ;
                          Littora myrthetis lÆtifsima:          denique apertos
                       Bacchus amat cutles.
  Strong argillaceous earth is not at all proper for the culti.
vation of the vine ; for not only are the roots prevented from
extending themselves in ramifications, as is the cafe in fat
and compact foil ; but the facility with which these strata are
penetrated by water, and the obstinacy with which they retain
it,       maintain         a   permanent         state   of humidity,           which rots the
root,       and gives to all the individuals of the vine symptoms                               of
weakness, which soon end in their destruction.
   There are some kinds of strong earth which do not possess
those hurtful qualities that belong to the argillaceous soil above
mentioned.     Here the vine grows and vegetates        freedom                   in           j
but this strength                    of         hurts the good
                                          vegetation     still essentially
quality of the grapes, which can with difficulty acquire ma
turity, and gives the wine neither spirit nor flavour. These
kinds of soil, however, arc sometimes                               set apart     for the vine,
because its abundance makes up for its quality,                                   and because
it   is    often more advantageous                    for the farmer to cultivate the
vine than to sow corn.                          Resides,  these weak but abundant
wines furnish               a    beverage         suited to labourers of every class,
and        are attended with advantage                     in   regard    to distillation,     as
the vines require                little culture.

28                     On     the    Cultivation of          the   Vine,
   It is well known to all farmers that moist soil is not proper
for the cultivation of the vine. If the soil, continually moist
ened, is of a fat nature, the plant languishes  in      rots, and                it,
dies   :   on the other hand,                 if   the foil be open, light, and calca
reous, the vegetation may be strong and vigorous, but the
wine arising from    cannot fail to be aqueous, weak, and de
                               it
stitute     of flavour.
   Calcareous soil in general      proper for the vine
                                                     is  being                         :
arid, dry, and light,   affords   proper support to the plant
                                    it               a                                          ;
the water with which        becomes occasionally impregnated
                                         it
circulates, and freely penetrates through the whole stratum                                      ;
the numerous ramifications                         of    the roots    imbibe      it   at every
pore   ;      all these points of view calcareous soil
            and      in                                   very                             is
favourable to the vine.   In general, wines produced in calca
reous soil are spiritous, and the cultivation       much the               is   so
easier, as the soil   light and not strongly connected
                               is                             be                           ;
sides,     to be observed that these dry soils appear exclusively
           it   is
destined for the vine   the want of water, mould, and manure,

oppose the idea             of     every other cultivation.
     But    there are some kinds                   of   soil still more favourable to the
vine, those which are at the same time light and pebbly: the
root easily forces itself through soil, which,    mixture of

      Volcanic earth also produces delicious wines.                              I     have had
occasion       to observe in different parts of the south of France
 <.hat     the most vigorous vines and the most capital wines were
produced             among the             remains of volcanoes.    These virgin
earths,         prepared for        a    long time    the   in
                                                          bosom  of  the earth                   by
subterranean              sires,    exhibit an intimate mixture of all the
earthy principles;                 their semi-vitrified texture, decomposed                      by
she-
     combined action of the air and water, furnishes all the
flcmcnts of good vegetation, and the fire with which these
garttys     have been impregnated, seems to pass                           in   succession into

all the plants intrusted to them. The wines of Tokay and
the best wines of Italy are the production of volcanic foil ;
the last bishop of Agde dug up, and planted with vines the
old volcano of the mountain, at the bottom of which that
antient town is situated, and these plantations form at pre-,
sent oneof the richest vineyards in that canton.
  There are points on the variegated surface of our globe
where the granite no longer presents that hardness and un-
alterability           which       in   general        form       the character of that
primitive          rock   ;   in   these places         it    is pulverulent,          and pre
sents to the eye nothing but dry sand                          of greater or         less coarse
ness : it is among                 these remains that the vine is cultivated
in    several parts       of France
                             and, when a favourable exposure
                                             ;
concurs to assist the increase, the wine is of a superior qua
lity. The famous Hermitage wine is produced amidst simi
lar ruins.  From these principles it may be readily judged,
that a foil like that of France must be favourable to the
formation          of    good      wine      ; as   it exhibits that lightness of sod
which permits             the roots to extend themselves,              and allows the
water to filter through                   it,
                           and the air to penetrate       that                         it  :
flinty  crust which  moderates and  checks the  ardour of  the
fun   ;that valuable mixture of earthy elements, the compo
sition of which seems                   so
                                             advantageous         to every     kind of          vege
tation.
      Thus,       the farmer, more anxious to obtain wine                             of   a    good
quality than an abundant vintage, will establish his vineyard
in light pebbly foil and he will not make choice of
                                   ;                           fat                              a

 IV. Description of an             improved Family Oven invented by
  Mr. S. Holmes, of                Cajlle- court in the Strand, London*.
 "    r-r*
       A HE         ovens    in  general use are made with flues, which
destroy      a great     quantity of fire in its passage through them,
and much trouble is required                 to keep them heated.          The   fire
which       should      be  employed in roasting meat, is in                 a great
measure dissipated          in the flue of the common ovens,                if  used
art  the time     of   roasting, or the common oven does not acquire
sufficient heat to answer the purpose, unless much coal is
consumed.
     "   My invention          consists of a cast-iron oven, with a solid
piece     of iron    projecting from its fide into the fire, in which
this piece constantly remains, and, becoming red hot, com
municates sufficient heat for baking to the whole oven, and
even asiists the fire         in roasting.
     "   My     oven keeps continually at a baking-heat,                    without
expenr.e       or trouble, as the common fire is sufficient for the
purpose.        The first oven, which I made for experiment,
was      fixed   in my own          house,     for use, eighteen months ago,
and may be viewed at any time the Society think proper.
Others are also in use at Mr. Blackmore's, in Brompton ;
Mr. Esdale's,         the Banker,       in Clapham        ; Mr. Robinson's, at

Wife's,      at Carlwood ; all         of which       have even exceeded my
expectations."

the above is an extract, is accompanied with several certifi
cates from different gentlemen,                   all  agreeing     in stating that
these ovens answer every purpose for which they are intended.

committee, appointed by the Society for the Encourage

dimensions, to be fixed to the fides of a fire-grate in the
model- room of the Society, one of which ovens only differed
from the other by the piece of cast iron projecting from its
fide into the sire : both ovens were heated by the fame fire,
and fixed in mortar and brick-work in a similar manner.
     " Two    loaves,   of equal size and quality, being prepared from
 the fame dough, one was put into each oven ; and after remain
ing therein      three quarters      of   an hour, they were taken out at
 the fame time, and examined.                 The loaf from Mr. Holmes's
 oven     was   in  every respect        well baked, but the other was
 dough-baked and imperfect.                 An oven upon Mr. Holmes's
 construction has been since fitted up in the Register's kit
 chen, which appears to answer every purpose that could be
 expected from its size, which is 13^ inches wide at the door,

 two plans, with a table of reference to each.
     At Worfley the Duke of Bridgewater's navigation begins }
 it goes west to Leigh, and east to Manchester, where it locks
 up into the Rochdale canal.             In its way to Manchester, it
 turns out, in       a western    direction,   near Longford Bridge, to
 meet    the    Grand      Trunk Canal'      above   Preston Brook; and
 from thence        it  goes north-west to Runcorn, where it locks
 down into the Mersey, in the tide-way to Liverpool.
     To this navigation above-ground, which, in all its direc
 tions, is extended through a length of forty* miles, upon one
 level, without tunnel or lock, except the locks at the extre
 mities.      At Worfley, an under-ground navigation is joined,
 which     goes to "the different mines        of  coal  under Walkden-
 Moor;       from     which mines,        by  these   navigations above-
 ground and under-ground,              Manchester and various other
 places are supplied with that valuable article.
     The canals of this under-ground navigation lie upon two
 levels, or stories.
     The lower is upon the fame level with the open navigation,
 which it joins at Worfley ; and consists, in the different
 lines which it pursues to the different scams of coal, of near
 twelve miles of tunnelling.
     The higher is thirty-five yards and a half perpendicular
height above the level of the lower, and varies from thirty-
 eight to sixty-one perpendicular yards below the surface of
 the earth, and consists of near six miles of tunnelling.
     The tunnelling of each level is ten sect four inches wide,
and eight feet six inches deep ; and the depth of water, three
feet seven inches.
     Before a communication           was   made by an inclined plane,
    •
      Forty miles upon one lcvel.~\     Adding to these forty miles, nearly
twelve   miles of the Duke of Bridgewater's         Under-ground Navigable
Canal, which lie upon his lower main level, and including eighteen miUs
us the Grand Trunk Canal betwixt the lowest lock between Middlewich.
and Preston-brook,     there are seventy miles of navigable canal, without a
lock, upon    one level,  eighty-two feet above low-water mark; whereby a
communication     is obtained between  London, Liverpool, Bristol, and Hull.
At this lowest lock the Grand Trunk Navigation locks down, to be upon
a level with the Duke of Bridgewater's.
                                                                        th«

                      executed at     Wall den- Moor.                33
the   coals   were    discharged     by hand from the boats on the
higher level, and were let down the pits in tubs by an engine
and a break-wheel into those upon the lower.                 To convey
the boats themselves from the canals of the higher level into
that of the lower, was the intent of making this under-ground
inclined    plane.     By    the help  of this machinery,    the whole
business is now done at once, without discharging or damag
ing the coal, and at one fourth of the expense : for the
boats   of   the higher       level are bodily   let down the inclined
plane, and are floated from the foot of it through nearly three
miles, in a straight line, of the lower level canal, into the
open navigation at Worsley           : and, whereas they were before
obliged to be drawn up to the surface of the earth at great
inconvenience and expense, to be repaired at a work-shop on
Walkden-Moor, they now come of themselves, in their
course of business, to be repaired at the great dock-yard at
Worsley.
    The   place     where the inclined plane is constructed, is
adapted    in  a  singular way for the purpose.       There is a bed of
white rock, or grit, eight yards twelve inches deep, which
dips one in four, lying exactly in the direction most con
venient for the communication between the two levels;
which     bed    of rock   is hollowed    into a   tunnel, driven upon
the rife of the metals, by blasting with gun-powder,, and
working it down with wedges and hammers.                   In this tun
nel, formed through a rock reaching from the lower to the
higher level, the inclined plane is fixed ; and, by its being
in the heart of a rock, the whole workmanship can be
pinned, secured, and compacted together at the top, bottom,
and sides, most effectually: — an advantage which no in
clined plane above-ground can have, and which renders
this a singular production, no where perhaps to be imitated.
    The run of the inclined plane is one hundred and fifty-one
yards, besides eighteen yards, the length of the locks, at the
north' or upper end : and the fall is one in four, correspond
ing with    the dip   of  the rock.
    Of  these one     hundred and fifty-one yards, about ninety-
 four yards are formed into a double waggon-way, in order to
 let two boats, namely, the empty and the loaded boat, pals

                                       E                              up

 34                 Of the   Under-ground inclined Plane
  up and down; and arc divided by a brick wall, supporting
  the roof, in which are openings for a person to escape out of
  the way of the boats ; which double waggon-way joins in
 one, about fifty-seven yards frem the lower level.
     The whole width of the double waggon-way is nineteen
 sect ; and      of  the single1 waggon- way, after the      junction,   ten
 feet.
     These waggon-ways are supplied with iron rails, or gul
 lies, laid on sleepers, down the whole run ; and the height of
 the roof, above the iron rails, is eight feet.
     At  the top     of  the inclined plane there is a double lock, or
 rather two locks, fide by fide, formed in the heart of the
 fame rock, which deliver the loaded boats from the higher
 level down the inclined plane, and receive the empty boats
 from the lower. The length of that part of the tunnel in
 which      these    are formed, is eighteen yards; the width or
 diameter, twenty sect six inches ; and the height of the roof,
 at the north end and above the locks, at dd, Plate I. fig. 4.
 twenty-one feet, to admit the break-wheel.
    The bottom, or south end of the inclined plane, is six feet
 nine inches under the surface of the water, where the loaded
 boat floats       off the      carriage  upon the     canal  of the lower
level.
    The     depth    of the locks, under water,       at the north end,   is
four feet     six  inches;     at the south end it is eight feet.
    The wall between the locks is nine inches above the sur
face of the level water; its breadth is three feet.
    The diameter of the horizontal main-shaft, upon which
the rope works to let the loaded boats down, and to draw the
empty boats up, is four feet eleven inches, and its circumfe
rence is fifteen          feet five    inches.    The main-rope     is two
inches and a         half in diameter,       and seven inches and a half
in circumference.             It is lapped round with a small cord of
about an       inch   in   circumference,     for the length of about one
hundred and five yards, to prevent its wearing, which it doei
chiefly when it drags upon the bottom, when at work, at the
place    v,  here    the    waggon- ways unite; and, for the fame
purpose,      rollers of eight inches diameter are fixed at intervals
down     tl'c run of the inclined          plane.    Moreover,   a  hollow
                                                                      cast-

                      executed at IVaikden-Moor,                          35
 cast-iron roller   of   eight inches and a        half diameter is    fixed
across   the   west lock, parallel to the upper west lock-gate,
 and near    the north end of the lock, but half a yard higher
than the gate, in order to bear up the rope, and to prevent
it from swagging.
    A hold-fast rope is fastened to the main-rope, to stay each
boat upon its waggon, as they go up or down.                  It is marked
k i, in fig. 4, Plate I. and its uses are more particularly de
tailed in the table of reference, at k k, to that plate.
    Upon this horizontal main-shaft is a break-wheel above
mentioned, which          regulates   the motion of the loaded boat
going down the inclined plane.
    The number of iron teeth, or cogs, in the spur-wheel,
which is fastened to the side of the break-wheel, is three
hundred and      seventy-two ; and the little nut- wheel, No. 3,
fig. 5. which sets it in motion, contains eleven teeth, or cogs.
The nut-wheel is supported by two uprights from the pillar
to the roof, and works between them.                    Two winches or
handles, No. 44, fig. 5, on its axis, put the main-shaft, del,
fig. 4.   or No. 1, fig. 4. in motion.              The power of both
united enables a man, who uses a force equal to forty pounds
weight, to set forward two tons upon the waggon-road : and
this force,    multiplied at the winches or handles, may be
used to set   forward the loaded boat out of one lock, and to
bring the empty boat into the other. The boats being thus
put in motion, the little nut-wheel is disengaged from the
main-shaft,     by a slide drawing        the little nut sideways, so as
to disengage the teeth, or cogs, from the cogs of the spur-
wheel. The weight of four tons going down brings up about
tone.
    The spur-wheel, however, which             is fastened to the break-*
wheel, No. 2, fig. 5. is seldom used,          as it is occasionally only
put   in motion   to  regulate   the   stretch  of the ropes when new<
and to draw the light boat into the lock, when at any time
it  may happen      to be over- weighted with materials, such as
mortar, props, slabs, &c. for the use of the higher level
collieries, and will not move of itself, upon a balance, out of
the lower level.
   The length of        the carriage, or cradle,        is thirty feet ; its
                                 E  1?                               width

36              Of the    Under -ground inclined Plane
width is seven feet four inches.              It  moves    upon four solid
cast iron rollers, which run upon cast-iron plates ; on one
side of each of which there are iron crests, which stand two
inches higher than the plates, and prevent the carriage from
running off the road.
    The weight of neat coal, contained in the loaded boat, is
 about twelve tons : the boat weighs about four tons ; and
 the   carriage,   or cradle,    in which      the boat is placed,        when
 convened down the inclined plane, is about five tons                 : — in all
 about twenty-one tons.
     At this inclined plane, thirty            loaded    boats   aTe    now let
 down, with      ease,  in about eight hours; that is to fay, four
 boats are let down       in a little more than an hour. The boats
 used   in these collieries    arc   of different   sizes and dimensions;
 some    will carry seven,      some eight and a half, some twelve
 tons.
!   The weight of neat coal, independently of the weight of                  the
 carriage    and boats, which is let down the inclined plane,                 in
 twelve-ton boats, in eight hours, will consequently be three
 hundred and sixty tons. The weight of the carriage, suppose
 five tons, let down      in the fame time,      will  be one hundred and
 fifty tons ; and the weight of the boat, suppose four tons, thirty
 times down, in eight hours, will be one hundred and twenty
 tons : — in all six hundred and thirty tons down in eight
  hours.
     The weight of         the carriage     thirty times up, and thirty
  boats up, in eight hours,        will  be
  Carriage, st 5 tons, 30 times up = 150 tons
  Boat,        at 4 tons, 30 times up =120 tons
                                     In all      270   tons    up    in    eight
                                         hours.
  So that there will be 630 tons down

  The various                feeders which           are loosened bv opening the
coals in the higher level collieries, as well as three sufficient
reservoirs,       which
                   may occasionally be resorted to, and used
in a drv season, keep the higher level always to its height,
and afford a constant supply of water to sill the locks, for the
purpose  of working the inclined plane.
   This inclined plane was begun in September,                               1795   j it   was
finished, and in use, in October, 1797.
   Of this, as of most of his other great works, the Duke of
Bridgewater was himself the planner and contriver : — to pro
ject greatly,          and to execute completely, are the perfection                        of
genius.
   The singularity of                   the    place        in which it is    constructed       ;
the original boldness of the design ; the ingenuity and me
chanism displayed in planning and executing it; the dispatch
with which it has been finished                         ;    the simplicity, beauty, and
harmony of             its    parts,        tending to one united             whole; and,
above all, the perfection to which   it is proved to have been
brought,  now  that it is practically in use; render it equally
astonishing with any other of the stupendous works which
have been To ably planned,                          and so successfully       executed,     by

  an auxiliary line NQ is drawn parallel to, and at an arbitrary
  distance from, the ordinate MP, to which it (NQ) may con
  tinually approach, till the two lines coincide; the line NO,
 or NQ — MP will then be an infinitely small quantity (see
  art. 19). Now as NO is the difference of the two values,
  MP        and    NQ,       successively attributed to the ordinate, it has
  been agreed            to distinguish it in discourse by the diminutive
  Word,      the differential, s& the variable line                 MP,     and to repre
  sent it     in calculation by the same variable line, with the cha
  racter d prefixed *. Thus, putting y for the ordinate MP,
 dy will signify the Differential of MP.
      But to suppose, as we have done, that A7Q continually ap
  proaches         MP, is al&> to suppose that AQ continually ap
  proaches to AP ; for the first of these suppositions necessarily
  implies the second. Putting, therefore, x for the abscisse AP,
  the little line PQ or MO will be the disscrential of x, and
  we shall have MO — dx in the same time that NO-dy.
       If we farther suppose NQ — _/, and AQ = Xs, we shall have
jr1   =y    .+  dy, and x' = x + dx ; so that the differentials dy and dx,
  are nothing else than the increments of their correspondent
  variables y and .v, or the quantities by which they are in
   creased when they become                    y' and xf    f.

  value RS, such               that   PQ      and    QS    may differ infinitely little

   the infinitesimal       or differential  theory,    which is properly his subject, into

   doctrine,    may be of great use,       if  his readers take care not to confound the
   differentials    (or increments) of quantities considered as formed by an ap

    NQ,        by the first hypothesis, is already supposed to approach
continually to MP) that RS will also continually approach to
the same line MP; so that, like NQ, it will ultimately co
incide with that same line; otherwise it is evident that the
ratio of QS to                        PQ, which, by the supposition, ought                             to ap
proach continually to unity, would recede from it.     It is
moreover evident, from the law of continuity, that the fame
    will       be the cafe          of RZ to NO. Agreeably,
                                            with       the ratio
    therefore, to the general notion of differential quantities,
    above delivered, QS ought to be the differential of AQ, RZ
    that of A'Q, QS — PQ, or NZ — MO, that of PQ, and
    lastly, RZ — NO, that of NO ; and all for the fame reason
    that NO, or NQ-MP, is the differential of MP. Accord
    ing to the received manner, then, of expressing differentials
    in calculation, we must have QS = d.v, RZ = dy, QS — PQ
     = d {MO), RZ — NO = d (NO).
                                                                                         -
                                         But we have already
    found MO = dx, aud NO = dy; therefore QS         PQ-ddx,
    and       RZ        —   NO-ddy, that                 is, the quantities ddx and ddy (also
    written dzx and             dy) will                  be the differentials of the differen
    tials of x and^, called also, for brevity, second differences, or
                                                ddx                         is,
    differentials of the second order ; that          the differential              is
    of the second order, or                            the    second difference         of x, and ddy
    that of y.
         Now,               since      QS        and     PQ    are supposed to differ infinitely
    little from each other, their difference ddx    infinitely small               is
    in comparison with each of them (by article 28). Therefore
    differentials of the second order are infinitely small in com
    parison             with first differentials, or those of the first order*.

    3= o, or     dx constant.   Thus, one of the differentials may be supposed
    constant.       But, from AP A^and AS being in arithmetical progression,                                     it

differentials of the third order; from the differentiation of these
last will result those of the fourth order, and so on.        Thus
dddy, or d3y will be the third difference of y and ddddy, or
d*y, the differential of the fourth order, fee.   Now, after
what has been said on the generation of differentials of the
first and second orders, there will be no difficulty in compre
hending the production of the superior orders.        shall there            I
fore only observe, that it consists in attributing, for each new
order,    new auxiliary value to each of the variable quantities,
            a
and such, that not only each of these new values may differ
infinitely little from thai which precedes    but that the fame       it,
thing may take place between their differentials, the differen
tials of their differentials, and forth.            so

will   be increased,              by   supposing     the increment          of *   to be dx.
     To integrate,            differential, on the contrary,
                             or to sum,       a              to                         is
return from that differential to the quantity which produced
it
 ;     and this last quantity                is called the Integral or Sum of the
proposed differential              *.       For example, x     the integral or sum
                                                                  is
of dx,       and to integrate, or to sum,                 dx     is  nothing more than
to assign that quantity, .i, which                       is   its sum or integral.
  We have seen that, in calculation,                                  the differential of    a
quantity         is
             expressed                  by

signifies the sum of dx                 ;   so   that we have evidently x —sdx,

       54. Let it first be proposed, then, to assign the differential
of     the sum, .v + y + z &c. of several variable quantities.
  By the hypothesis, x becomes x + dx, y becomes y +                                               dy.
&c. Therefore the sum proposed becomes x + dx +y +                                                 dy
+ z + dz &c. Consequently, it is increased by dx + dy                                              ¦+-
dz,         &c;      and         these increments               are precisely       what we have
called differentials #.

  But, with respect to this equation, I observe, that dx and
dy, being infinitely small, in comparison with .r and y, the
                                                                                                                      last
But, for           which the author gives, xy (in his notation
                 a reason
didx) may  be rejected, and so the fluxion of xy is \y  yx.                                               -f-
   Example 2.  Thus also, the fluxion of
                 xyz     xzy             is
                                yzx ¦+¦xyx.                +
    Example 3. In like manner, the fluxion of
            vxyz     v\yi + vxzy  is   vy7.i 4- xzyv.               +
      2dly, To find the fluxions of powers, as x% xi, &c.
    Example i. In the first example above, we had xy         for                                         +      y.i
 the fluxion of xy.   Let x — y, then xy = .v:, and xy + yx
 = xx + xx or 2xx, will be the fluxion of x1.
    Example 2. In the second example above, let * =         = z                                             y
then 4-jz will become xl, and •*)&      xzy    jz.r will become         +             +
xxx + xxx      xxx, or 3-v *, which will be the fluxion of .r3.
                      +
   Example 5. In like manner,        in the      example above,  if,                  3d
v ~ x =     = z, the fluxion of x* will be 4v3i'.
                 y
   Thus the fluxion of a-1 being 2.v.r, that of .v3 being3v2i,
thatof*4 being 4f3jf, &c. we conclude that the fluxion of
any power of x whatever, fay x       will be mx    x.   Here        ,

therefore, dxdy be neglected in the preceding equation, ft
will then become d.xy = xdy +ydx, which is what I call an
imperfect equation.  But, since imperfect equations (by ar
ticles 31 and 34) may be employed like rigorous ones, with
out inducing any error into the result, it is evident that I may
use this last equation instead                           of   the     first ; and, as             it   is more

both towards          A   and towards       B, it     is evident that the tangent

                               ought to be parallel to the
                               point
line AB. Then by putting (as in article 62) Q for the angle
formed by the tangent and the ordinate, we shall have, at the
point      M,   Cot. Q     =   o, or      Lini.   (-/-)         = o.        I   find, there
fore, the differential of the equation of the curve, and                                  I   get
the imperfect equation,
                ydy       = adx — xdx, or              —— —                     ;

But    we ought to have Col. Q                 = o     ; therefore                   ¦= o, or,
lastly, a = x, which was to be found.
   64. The process, therefore, for discovering the greatest or
dinate of any curve whatever, is to find the differential of its
equation, and thence the value of Urn- \~j~) which                                    must     be
made       equal      to nothing.         This    rule is commonly                  enunciated
by saying simply, Find the differential of_y, and make dy
= o. But what this enunciation gains in brevity, it loses in
accuracy.

i?, creater than the angle LNQ, formed         any other tangent  by

ment.
    Let     AMP (fig. 6.) be that segment: if we suppose the
abscisse     AP to be increased by the infinitely small quan
tity   PQ,       the segment                will   increase,           in the same time, by the
quantity MNPQ; that                             is,   PQ being            supposed          the   differen
tial of *, MNPQ will be                         the differential            of   the segment whose
surface    required.
                is   Conversely, therefore, that segment                                                        is
the integral of MNPQ    that    AMP = /(MNPQ). But,

the latter; and hence we have the imperfect equation MNPQ
= MOPQ.         Substituting, therefore, the second of these
quantities for the first,                       in      the accurate             equation,        AMP =
J [MNPQ),                    we shall have the imperfect equation,

 VI.     On the Utility of Birds in destroying hiseSs and other
                  Productions hurtful to Mankind.
  VV HEN            the destruction and waste     of  the fruits of the
earth, occasioned        by birds  and   insects, is duly considered/
we cease to wonder at the anxiety          of agriculturists and others
in seeking out means for the destruction sometimes of the one
and sometimes        of  the other, according as particular.circurrt-
siances have made the havoc         of either more or less observable
on their fields.       Indeed, on   a hasty view of the subject the
only matter that strikes the        mind with surprise is, that un
wearied and unceasing means have not been generally fol
 lowed to extirpate many of those pests which aii mankind
seem      equally to have an interest in destroying ; for, every
thing     that  diminishes the profits of the farmer adds to the
price of the necessaries of life — and, consequently, adds to
the quantum of labour performed by every individual.
    But, in waging         war   against   the  feathered   tribe there
ought      to be some discrimination,     aud the fact on a close ex
amination of the subject will turn out to be, that we ought to
 form an alliance with some of them, as far as protection to
wards them can favour that end, with the view of the auxi
liary aid they may afford us in extirpating the hostile bands
                                                                      of

very germs         of
               vegetable life.
   We are led to these reflections by perusing Professor Bar
ton's Fragments of the Natural History of Pennsylvania, lately
published at Philadelphia.     The utility of the following re
marks on infests, as the food of birds, is our inducement for
laying them before our readers ; and the more so as several
of the birds are natives of our own country, and a careful
observation of the habits, &c. of other British birds would

of them      ought to be protected even by law.
              as                                 We need
hardly observe, that many which partly live on seeds ought
nevertheless to be included among the friends of mankind,
on account of the greater benefit they vield by also destroying
many insects, grubs, and other noxious vermin.
  " It may in the first place be observed," says Dr. Barton,
"    that insects appear to be the first food           of almost   all the birds
of our country. The more I  have inquired, the more 1 have been
convinced, that almost all birds live, in some measure, upon in
sects. Even those species which consume considerable quantities
of   feeds, berries, and fruit,           also consume      large quantities           of
insects   :   and there are reasons to believe, that others, whose
principal      food     is   the nectar    of plants,    also live partly upon
these insects.          Thus Mr. Brandis found           the vestiges    of   insects
in the stomach of the trochilus, or humming-bird, one of
the last birds one would have suspected of feeding on animal
food.
     "   The   greater number       of our smaller birds, of        the order           of
fafferes, seem to demand our attention and protection.
Some of them feed pretty entirely upon insects, and others
upon a mixed food — that             is,
                           insects and the vegetable feeds,
     Many of them contribute much to our pleasure

 capable of obtaining their food in the fame way.                      This

 continues with us until late in September, when it retires

true, these birds are sometimes injurious to us, by eating
some    of our  finest fruits, particularly      our cherries, and there
fore pains are taken to expel them from our gardens.                     But
they devour vast numbers of insects, particularly some of
those species which prove so destructive to the trunk of the
trees, such as the coleopterous insects,           which, perhaps,    do as
much mischief        as the    caterpillars.
   "   IV. As     a devourer      of pernicious infects, one of the most
•useful birds with which I am acquainted is the house-wren,
or certhia familiaris ? This little bird seems peculiarly fond
of the society of man, and it must be confessed that it is
often protected by his interested care.               From observing the
usefulness of this bird in destroying infects, it has long been
a custom, in many parts of our country, to six a small box
at the end    of a long pole, in gardens, about houses, See. as a
place for it to build      in. In these boxes they build and hatch
their young.       When the young arc hatched, the parent birds
feed them with a variety of different insects, particularly such
as are injurious       in gardens. One of my friends was at the
trouble to observe the number of times a pair of these birds
came from their box, and returned with insects for their
young.      He sound that they did this from forty to sixty times
in an    hour; and, in        one particular     hour,   the birds carried
food to their young seventy-one times.               In this  business they
                                                                       wer$

 Taking the medium, therefore, of fifty times in an hour,
 it appeared that a single pair of these birds took from the
 cabbage,     sallad,  beans,   peas,  and    other vegetables     in  the
garden, at least fix hundred insects in the course of one day.
 This calculation proceeds upon the supposition, that the two
birds took each only a single insect each time. But it is
 highly probable they often took several at a time,
    "  The species of certhia of which I am speaking generally
 hatches twice during the course of the summer. They are
 very numerous about Philadelphia, and in other parts of the
 United States.
    "  The fact just related is well         calculated to show        the
importance of attending to the              preservation   of   some     of
our native birds.          The esculent      vegetables   of   a    whole
garden may,        perhaps, be preserved from the depredations           of
different species of insects by ten or fifteen pair of these small
 birds : and, independently of this essential service, they are
 an extremely agreeable companion to man ; for their note is
 pleasing.     A   gentleman, in the neighbourhood of Philadel
 phia, thinks he has already reaped much advantage from, the
services of these wrens.        About his fruit trees he has placed
a  number of boxes for their nests.          In  these boxes they very
readily breed, and feed themselves and their young with the
insects which are so destructive to the various kinds of fruit
trees, and other vegetables.
    " V.    The   services  of the ibis, in devouring the reptiles       of
Egypt, are well known.          They procured to this bird a vene
ration and regard which form an interesting fact in its history,
and in the history of human superstitions.              The storks are,
perhaps, not less useful.        Pliny tells us, that these birds were
so much regarded for destroying serpents, that, in Thessaly,
in his age, it was a capital crime to kill them, and that the
punishment was the fame as that for murder. Virgil hints
at the usefulness     of the stork when he describes it as       '
                                                                    longis

birds of this tribe, the          frogs, and toads, and other reptiles,
would increase to         so great a degree as to prove a real       nuisance-
North- America           abounds with birds of this order; and we
even have some species           of ibis very nearly allied to the ibis ot
Egypt— such        as   the tantalus loculator,       or wood-pelican, the-
tantalut ruber, or scarlet ibis, the tantalus fufeus, or brown
ibis,   and the tantalus alhus,           or white     ibis.    Mr. Bartram
informs       us, that the first:    of these birds feeds       ' en

seen near the banks of great rivers, in vast marshes or mea
dows, especially such as are caused by inundations, and alfo-
in the    vast   deserted rice plantations.'         This bird, both with:
regard     to his     general     aspect,   and   his manners and habits,
may be considered as the ibis of America.                     Tn the midst of
 all their superstitipns,        I do not find, however, that the na
tive Americans          have    ever paid    any particular      regard to this
 bird.     I cannot    learn that any of these speeies of tantalus have
ever been seen        in Pennsylvania.
     " VI.     Some of the birds of the vultur-kind are extremery
useful    to man, by destroying           immense quantities of carrion,
 which serve to vitiate the air, and, perhaps, in some instances,
 to give rife to malignant epidemics.                 The vullur aura, or
 turkey-buzzard of our country, is one of the most useful of
 these birds.        In Virginia it is protected by a law of that
 State.     The Abbe Clavigero speaks of the usefulness of the

has not always allowed us to acknowledge this truth. 'Thus
we give to the Hessians the honour of introducing among ua
that most pernicious infect, the Hessian-fly, which, for seve

so long a time, overlooked, will probably be mentioned in.

      "       Many of       the    pernicious insects     of the United States
seem          to be increasing instead         of diminishing.   Some of these
insects, which originally confined their ravages to the native
or wild vegetables, have since begun their depredations upon
the foreign vegetables, which are often more agreeable to-
their palates.             Thus        the bruebus pifi,       or pea-fly, is       a   native,,
 and seems originally                  to have fed, in a great measure unno

 pea      :                         of this last among us, it is

 the ravages of this insect.   The Hessian-fly could not origi

 gramina of this kind, for these vegetables are not natives of
 America..  It is now more formidable to us than would be an-

 different kinds of insects are much less confined to vegetables
 of the fame species, or to species of the fame genus, than has
 been commonly          imagined.      It is certain, that the fame spe
 cies   of  insects,  in America,     often  feeds indiscriminately, and
 in succession, upon plants of very opposite genera, and even
 of very different natural orders.
     "  Hitherto     too little progress has been made among us           in
 the discovery of remedies for the            great mischiefs occasioned
 by insects.      The fubjec^Jias not         been examined with suffi
 cient    attention.      It has   given place to discussions and in
 quiries of very inferior utility ; and, I fear, it will not claim
 all that industrious attention which it so well merits, until the
 evil shall    have   spread still further.     Il  is doubtless  difficult,
but it is by no means impossible, to prevent the ravages of
 noxious insects.          In this important business something has
 already been done in our coimtrv.                We have discovered a
methol of diminishing            the   depredations of the little bug,
 called   cucumber-fly, which proves so destructive to the cu-
 curbitaceous vines, particularly those of the cucumber and
musk-melon.          By manuring our wheat lands, and thereby
increasing the strength and vigour of the wheat, we have
lessened the evil of the Hessian-fly.             By suspending, to our
young apple,       and   other trees, pieces  of   tow impregnated with
a mixture as brimstone and train-oil, we have learned how
to frighten away the periodical locusts (cicada septemdeeim
of Linnæus), which often do so much injury to our orchards.
The American Philosophical Society, by calling the atten
tion of the public to the decay of our peach-trees, has
brought us to a better acquaintance with the causes of this
decay, and with the means of preventing it. Insects are, no
doubt, one of these causes.            We have made some progress
in preventing the mischief of the bruclus piji, or pea-fly,
which proves so destructive to one of the finest esculent vege
tables.      But all that has yet been done is very little, com
pared to that which remains to be done.                The subject is as
new    as  it is important."

IN      general,      to strip off the bark                 of   trees,       is to   kill them ;

chill, of New-York, there is a time of the year when,
apple-trees (pyrus malus) may be peeled from their roots tQ
their boughs, on all sides, without sustaining any damage
from the operation. An experiment was made in 1799 upon
an apple-tree, the whole body of which was decorticated, and
whose branches nevertheless                   retained all their leaves and                   fruit.
In two months           after an entire new coat                   of bark was formed,
which     invested      the tree on every fide.                       The tree was as
healthy and vigorous as ever.    The season for doing this is
when the days are at the longest, that    towards the end of      is,

with the view of applying the remedy generally ? We need
hardly add, that in every cafe of the kind the bark should be
carried out of the orchard and burnt, to prevent the insects
from travelling back to the trees ; and that a bandage im
pregnated with some fœtid substance should be tied round the
Jower part of each tree to prevent the insects that may have
fallen during the process from again ascending.                       A. T.

             the 17th of March 1788 our traveller took his de
 parture from Kahoratho, and, directing his course north-east,
 in a sew days after crossed a small mountain, from the top of
 which he had a view of a beautiful plain beneath, with the
 town of Haoussa lying in the back-ground, and in the front
 of the landscape the great river Niger. Here he found him
 self all at once transported           into  a  totally different country,
 which      presented,   as far as the eye could reach, huts, houses,
 delightful thickets,        enlivened by goats, horses, and camels
 feeding, and people busy at their             occupations both on foot
  and on horseback.          This district, our traveller asserts, is one
  of  the finest,  if not   the finest, in all  Africa. From the moun
  tain it was a good hour's walk to the Niger,where he intended
  to cross ; but fix of the Moors in the ojitatbs         f wanted to detain
  him, and to fend his companions back.

accordingly they refused to comply, and the dispute was per
tinaciously carried on on both sides, till at length we began
to capitulate.   Our guides were dispatched over the river to
the little town         of Boosu, while     I     remained in custody of the
others.       Here at this river        a   guard     is   constantly    stationed to

returned in company with three armed Moors on horseback.
These were to serve             as   our escort   ;   and accordingly at break
of day      attended     us over the river, for which              the fare   of   each
person was six zimpos.        We            soon came          to Boosu,      a    small
lively town      of about two hundred             houses and       a   hundred huts,

were carried to the akomoni, or judge, who first entertained
us with victuals, and then inquired,   means of an inter  by
preter,concerning the purport of my journey.      Having an

be conducted to the          king in the capital. Though we had
flill  three   German miles to go, yet the way did not seem
tedious to me, as we were always meeting peeple, and my
attention was struck by a diversity of objects.
    " It was already dark when we came to Haoufla; which,
standing on      a  mountain,      may be    seen    at a great distance.
The king being gone to rest, we were obliged to remain with
the guard at the gate ; but we were treated with good pro
visions, and particularly some delicate goat's flesh broiled.
About eight o'clock the next morning I was admitted into
the court of the palace, and conveyed to the king.                 lie or
dered a number of questions to be put to me, and he was
particularly interested in the account of niv journey, of which
he was eager to know all the particulars.               In order to con'-
vince him that      I  was no spy,     and to gratify    his curiosity,    I
drew my journal from under my waistcoat, and related from
it such parts as I chose, and especially those which I thought
lie would be the most entertained         in hearing;     the interpreter
writing down several of these accounts on a               piece  of wood,
which he handed to the king.             When he had       read them, be
ordered    meat and drink to be set before me immediately, then
 directed me to be taken to the house of his servants, and to
be provided with         a cloak.    All this was accordingly done;
 and I was obliged to lay aside my sheep- skin pelice and waist
 coat.    The cloak, according        to the   custom    of  the country,
"was made very      long,    and consisted os reddish- coloured linen.
 The number of       the royal servants, including myself", amounted
 to   sixty-eight persons.       Our functions were to attend the
 king   twice  a day   to  the temple, and once to the place where
 he issued his decrees; also, whenever he went to visit any
 thing out of the town, alternately to bear him on a litter.
 Eight persons were commonly employed in the last office, so
 that the turn came in rotation only once in several weeks.
 When I had.       been    here a fortnight,    it pleased the king to
 make an excursion        to Boosu, and to visit many things there          •
 and, it being my turn, I was ordered to prepare for the jour
 ney.     On receiving this notice I      was extremely distressed, on
 considering how        I  should  go through with the service,         as it
 was generally performed in a sort of harness.                  At   first  I
                                                                 njfinaged

managed         tolerably well ; but, as it was never the practice to
make       a   halt, I was so overcome with fatigue that I fell clown.
The Moors, my   comrades, attempted to raise me up; but, being
utterly unable to concur with their eflbri;s by helping myself,
they took their trammels from the litter, and were going to
beat me.    On this, I set up a violent scream, in order to
attract the king's attention, who, immediately giving orders
to halt, inquired what was the matter, and commanded one
of   the    Moors who             attended         him on    horseback         to dismount, to

This drew upon me the hatred of some of the attendants, of
which, however, they let nothing appear, from reverence to
the  king, particularly as they perceived that he behaved
kindly to me.   After a stay of fix days, the king returned to
the capital, previous to his departure giving orders that I
should not act as a bearer, but ride.                            I    did    as   he had com
manded, and, at our arrival, restored the horse to his owner
with many thanks. No employments being assigned me,
I took to some of my own accord : in particular, I sometimes
visited a man who carved out various devices on wood, and he
was highly            pleased that             I   frequented         him,     in the hopes of
learning several things of me. While with him, \ made a
square frame and a cupboard, not indeed so well as a European
joiner; but then I                 had not the necessary tools, being obliged
to make use os a sharp knife instead                             of    a   chisel, and          a stone
was the only substituteI had' for a sine plane. After having
visited      man's house for about ten days, the king one
               this
day sent for me, and forbade me to go for the future into the
town : the fact was, that attempts had been made to bring
me into suspicion with                     him, by         persuading        him that       I   enterT
tained         some       ill   designs.    I     vindicated myself               by saying, that
      had      done       no harm              that   had only gone                at times to         a

pleased him           ;    and he told             me, that, since         I   was     a   workman
in wood,         I        should     work for him.                On my promising him
that   Iwould do so, he immediately ordered wood to be
fetched, and likewise gave me permission to go every day,
for two hours, and look about the town.   The first thing                                           I
 made for the king was                     a   chest   of eight drawers,               and next        a

small        cabinet,      which          I   painted red               and   yellow.         Both
pieces met with his entire approbation,  looking at them very
often, moving them first to one place, then to another; now
putting one thing in Mittm, and then something else.   I then
made him three pair     jof knife- handles, and as many for
forks,       of goat-bones, adding to them silver rings, on which I
carved        several letters of his name, viz. M. H.Y. polishing
them all      finely as I possibly could.
                 as                        At this he testified.
a hearty satisfaction, and promised to reward me as he should
see occasion.   One holiday I took the opportunity of asking
leave to go out of town to look about me.    He did not refuse
my request, but gave me a passport, which was a piece of
wood, whereon was carved the royal arms, namely, a half
tiger; telling me that I might be absent till fun-set, but that
then     I   must attend him to the temple.                       Accordingly      I passed    out
through the north gate to the village Vahasua, situated at about
an hour|s walk from the town.      On my approach to     three                          it,
men came out of                it,
                       riding directly up  to  me. Taking me
for  adeserter, they told me, that     did not go back imme

diately to town, they would carry     me  thither bound.  Per
ceiving me make some hesitation, they leaped from their,
horses, and struck me with their sabres. On this produced                         I

the town to the king. The king expressed his surprise at this,
proceeding,           as he had             given me                       and inquired what

they had taken             it        from     me      tp prevent me from executing
my designs.   At the fame                          time one of the men made up                   a
story of untruths, pretending that     was going to attack    I

                                              :
and, turning to me, he asked, whether the accuser spoke
truth.   justified myself
             I                                by
                          appealing to the licence granted,
me      by   his pass;     representing             to him, that, as          I   was not tho
roughly versed           in    the language            of    the       country,   these people,
might have misunderstood                      me,      and erroneoufly thought that
1    abused them.          The king           was very patient and gentle during
the whole conversation, which                         I   interpreted as promising me

some comfort.           At    last he commanded me to be carried to
prison, but ordered the principal accuser to remain, that he
might see, on the following day, how I should be punished.
Being now utterly inconsolable, and convinced that the end
of my life was drawing near, I had not slept a wink, when,
in the morning, four soldiers came to me, bidding me follow
them. As I went, I perceived people who pitied my condi
tion; but others, standing here and there, who seemed to
enjoy my distress.             On the public place where I was to ba
punished, thirty soldiers on foot, and twenty on horseback,
were drawn up in a circle, in the middle whereof a buffalo's
skin was stretched, and near it stood six young men, two of
the strongest having platted thongs in their hands. I was all
over in a tremor, on the point of fainting every moment,
concluding that I was' either to undergo a violent death, or
 certainly to be cruelly scourged.                The king,    with his offi
cers, now arriving, called for the principal                   accuser,     who
sprung-      into   the    circle    apparently with great satisfaction.
The king now              asked     me, whither I had purposed to go ?
—I      answered     :
                        ' To Vahasua.' — ' Where didst thou meet
the stranger?'          said he then to the accuser; who replied:
 (   On the bye-road behind Vahasua *.'                      On which         the
king immediately ordered the man to                       be  stripped,    then
 thrown on the buffalo's skin, and to have sixty strokes on the
belly.       All   present      were  astonished    to see the    punishment
they expected was to be given to me inflicted on the accuser ;
but they presently saw how the matter stood, on hearing the
                            '
king declare, that Nobody should belye a stranger, or do
 him an injury, or endeavour to draw on him a punishment
 which      he had not deserved.'           The delinquent, after receiving
 this chastisement, was directly sent beyond the borders of the
 country, while I was put in his post, and received his horse.
 The king then         related     to me how     it  happened,    that he had
 resolved     to make a strict examination             into the real    state  of
 the    case  between      me and     the man now banished.           Having
 perceived, he said, that it was the very person who, on the
Journey to Boosu, was obliged to dismount from his horse,
     * That is the
                        way to Feene,      to which place numbers had secretly
 p);ide  their escape from this territory.
                                                                             and

at that time that he looked displeased
                                     and angry at me, he
had therefore come to this conclusion, that the accusation
was only founded in malice and revenge ; adding, that his
suspicions    were      fully confirmed        by the confession   of the two
companions of         the accuser,      on their being brought to a strict
examination.
     " Inow ventured to petition the king to let me depart ;
but this he refused, by saying, ' It is thy duty to do as                    I
command thee.' —The matially (under officer) of the Moors
now took me with him, delivering to me my horse, with a
bridle of rope, and half a goat's skin for a saddle, at which
I was  much surprised ; because I foresaw that I should not be
able to do much with these implements, but should probably
run the fame risks as I had done before ; accordingly I re
solved to renew my request to the king, that he would allow
me to prosecute my journey, or at least appoint me to some
other post. The next morning I was ordered to appear before
him ; when he directly asked me whether I could ride, &c.
to which I answered : No. e Then thou must learn,' said
he, ' as I design thee for a higher station, if thou wilt remain
with me.'         For   the present      I   did not presume to solicit him
again for my dismission,             as he   of himselfhad once more spoke
of my remaining                I resolutely insisted on being
                             here.     Had
dismissed,    I     shouldrun the

present to his brother-in-law Soomahaty*, where I should
infallibly      my days in misery.
             pass                   I therefore resigned my
self to fortune, hoping to make my escape at some sit oppor
tunity, and in a sliort time learnt to ride, that     to sit        is,     so
firm on my horse             as   to be able to charge and fire my gun.
My    office was solely to be about the              king when     he chose to
be carried abroad,   or when he rode out on his great camel,
which was led by four men the rest of my time employed

concerning the neighbouring             nations.     At two    several times
caravans     from the western Barbary passed through on their
wav to Vangara.           With either of these I would gladly have
stole away, but I found it impossible to effect my design.                  la
one of my rambles f got acquainted with the richest mer
chant in the town, named Koobi.                     This man carried on a.
considerable     trade, constantly keeping two caravan-teams              of a
hundred and sixteen beasts of burden, and               a   number of staves
on the road.      One of    his slaves, an ingenious and active young
man, diverted me at times by relating a variety of circum
stances concerning his travels ; and, among other things,                     I
got out of him an accurate account of the march-route into
the greater Barbary. — Now came on the rainy season, when
 the  king   never rode out, going          only to the temple and pro
 mulgating his decrees in the court of the palace. I had there
 fore more time to prepare secretly for my flight, by exercising
 myself in pronouncing the hard words in the language of the
 country,     learning of the afore-mentioned slave the most or
 dinary expressions in the language of the neighbouring na
 tions, and the like.         One day, the king, showing me a mus-
 quet with a broken slioulderpiece, asked me whether the
  workman       in wood that        I  was acquainted with was capa
  ble of making another.          I   said I would show him the stock ;
  and, taking it with me,          I  myself made a new stock, which
  pleased the     king    so  well, that he presented me with fifty
  zimpos.
     "  At  the end    of the rainy        season  I purposed to get off by
  stealth ; but my design was frustrated            by the breaking out of
  a war between my king and the king of Vangara.                           We.
  hastened to the field as fast as possible, and the army was al
  ready   mustered     by the 24th of July ; and though, as the.
  rainy season was not entirely over, the soldiers were obliged
  to march, for half the day, up to the middle in water, yet
   they were still alert     and courageous.         The king of Vangara
   perhaps thought     it  impossible    for our  army    to pusli on through
   the valleys overflowed with water, in order to come at his
   frontiers  ;  but he was mistaken. — Our king, likewise, made
   use of a stratagem to prevent the king of Vangara from know
   ing when hi* army was to begin their march.                     On  the 22d

 of July, about noon, an officer              came    to the capital from the
 enemy, attended by four Moors, bringing with him the de
 claration of war. It was written on a narrow (lip of white
 leather, rolled on two long sticks. On delivering                   it,   he said
 that the king his master would come here and fetch                   it    back.
 Our king put oil  very friendly countenance, gave the officer
                        a
the best entertainment his palace afforded, but issued" private
 orders for his own   army to be kept in readiness to march                     ;
saying to the officer, that when the valleys and plains were
free from water, he would take back the sticks himself; that
 is,   would begin the war.
   "     On   the 25th, before fun-rife,             the infantry   was in full
march,        and at noon was followed               by
                                          half of the cavalrv.
The enemy's officer purposed to sel out on his return that fame
day; but the king entreated him to remain, promising to ac*
company him on the following day, to prevent his being
attacked. On the 24th, at noon, the king set out with his
officers and the one belonging to the enemy, taking me also
among his body-guard.     On the first day we arrived at Taa-
hasa,    small
         a     town  of two  hundred hut3, whera we were
joined       by   five hundred       Moors.    Passing the Niger on the
25th, we were         in   extreme    danger   of our lives, insomuch that
we could not prevent the             loss of twenty men who perished in
the floods, as the river was too much swollen, and yet the
cavalry who could not be carried over, were forced to swim
across with their horses.  We now reached Maatoh,      vil                 a
lage   of forty huts, in        the valley through        which the Niger
flows.
  " On       the 26th and 37th, we marched over           a   chain of moun
tains towards the    east, advancing on the 28th at noon to the
Krahoto, or Gold-mountains.        Here, making halt, we sent
the hostile officer to his king, commissioning him to tell him,
that king Maonaoussay was come into his country with his
forces to visit him. The officer had twenty men to escort
him as far as Kahsuto,   small town in Vangara.
                                 a               As soon
as he was gone, accounts were    brought that the infantry
were  already on the enemy's ground, where they waited for
further orders. An European army, that excepted which
Bonaparte led over the prodigious mountains of Switzerland,

would never have ventured                 to   do what I here         saw performed
by undisciplined troops.                 We     had before     us the       two enor
mous ridges of mountains which we had already crossed in
one of their turnings ; but which in this place were fur steeper
and more inaccessible than in the former, insomuch that
I thought it absolutely impossible for us to surmount them :
but    I    witnessed       what     I   had     considered     to     be    impracti
cable.
    " At     break    of    day the      king    issued the necessary orders to
his officers; whereupon, in half an hour the cavalry that
were with us drew up, (lung their mufquets, and raised a
horrid shout that re-echoed from the mountains.           They
cried out : Ojbtbsugo, koato aqvlaty ! that          Death and       is,
                                                                       '
*
  the place of torment (with us Hell) sliall not deter us  and                    !'
the whole troop sprung up the mountain;       that, though            so
pieces of the rock flew off, not one of them met with any
accident.       The royal camp             was now broke up, and                  it   was
our turn to clamber up the steep declivity.   alighted from     I
my horse, and with extreme difficulty attained the summit.
The king continued sitting on his camel, smoking pipe of                      a
 tobacco completely undismayed.     new obstacle now made
                                                   A
its appearance  for below ran an arm of the Niger, which
                     ;
we must inevitably cross.                The king remained             on the camel,
led    by
       the swimming staves, and got safe over.         followed             I
on horseback,     and likewise happily succeeded; but        felt                 I
great pain in my feet, as the ropes here used for stirrups had
chased the skin      screlv, that the blood ran down.
                           so                            In like
manner we were now to climb the second mountain             and                   ;
during this perilous businessthe evening  came on. On reaching
the bottom       of   the other side       of   the mountain we halted,                and
pitched our camp on the enemy's ground.                         At     the distance       of
about three leagues before us we discerned                     a     sire   with smoke
rising, which proceeded from the infantry that bad marched
on, and were already busily employed                      in
                                              plundering, burn
ing,  and destroying. At the sight of this, joy spread through
out our camp;    which now burst forth in sliouting and sink
ing. The next morning powder and small pebbles, instead
of balls, were distributed to all the people of the camp   as                         ;

 we might      be in    a   condition    to resist     in. case of an attack;
 which, however,        was     not likely to be expected.           At noon
 threescore and two prisoners were brought in, and afterwards
 conveyed    further.     These people were         indeed     deplorable ob
jects, and excited great pity and compassion, for they were
 miserably maimed and disfigured ; some being (hot, others
 backed with sabres, and others wounded bv spears : betides,
 these wretches were entirely naked and destitute, as every
 thing had been taken from them, and even their huts burnt.
Here neither camp-hospital, nor medicine-chest, nor other
 similar means of relief were to be had              ;   no styptics to apply
 to the wounded;        but, when       the   prisoners,       by crying and
 howling, expressed       lite   extreme    violence of their pains, re
 course was    immediately       had to the cautery, by burning their
 wounds ;, and even this was done by especial grace of the
 king.    Our march proceeded very slow ; for this day we came
 only to  within somewhat more than two leagues of the little
 town Kahiuto, where we again encamped. We heard a tiring
 the whole night through ; officers likewise were frequently
 coming with report? to the king, though I learnt nothing ot
 them.     At day-break a hunched of our army were brought
 in wounded,     and thirtv prisoners      taken from the enemy.          We
 now heard that the main body ot our army was before Kah
 luto, which was obstinately defended bv the enemy. Our
 slaves were therefore       sent off to reinforce it        ;  however, thev
 were not wanted,         as   they had     scarcely     been gone an hour
 when we saw the flames ascend from Kahsuto, and presently
 after received intelligence that the enemy had retreated, having
 previously set the town on sire.              We now put forward, as
 the main armv was gone on ; having a bad road the whole
 day long, through         thickets and      over     sandy flats,   but fre
 quently meeting        with     burnt villages. We encamped on
 the river Eniog, on the other (bore of which the main armv
 was drawn up.        This river runs hither from the north, and
 flows through the whole territory of Y'angara southwards.
 We   were here in    a dis greeable situation ; for, the plains near
 the river being still in several places under water, we were
 forced to go round them, wading through mud and dirt ;
 therefore  could by no means kindle           a fire,     and much less at
                                                                       tempt

tempt to take rest.           On the right hand, indeed, we had a
high    hill  ; but we could not turn ost" to that, as we were en
deavouring to come into nearer co-operation with the main
army.        Such of us      as   had horses kept their feats the whole
night long, in order, at least, to get tome rest. At break of
day we proceeded over the river, and marched for the capi
tal.     When the hostile armv was within fight, it was ordered
that the baggage, under a guard of forty slaves and fifty soldiers,
should remain behind with me; when the king took upon
 him the command of the armv, and pushed onward. In a few
hours the fight began with great cries and bellowing on both
 fides, so that even we ourselves were frightened.            Our army,
 which      had    not rested    for some days,   was several times re
 pulsed,     yet constantlv pressed forwards        Till towards even
 ing the event of the battle was undecided, now one army and
 now the other giving way : however, at last, when the dark
 ness   came      on, our army maintained its ground, while the
 enemy retreated into the town.            We took two hundred pri
  soners, and a number of tri Ming articles as spoil.          With this
  action the main brunt of the war was over, as in the whole
  hostile territory throughout there was no other such plain
  where the two armies could draw up in front of each other,
  but thickets, forests, narrow valleys, and mountains, in alter
  nate vicislitude.       I remarked that both armies were totally
  unacquainted with tactics, and that with them every thine
  depended on the courage and temerity of the men.               Though
  the battle lasted several hours, yet during          all that time our
   people    fired scarcely     twenty times, and the enemy probably
  not oftener. In order to load their pieces the armv eveiy
   time fell back, and then advanced again : there was likewise
   a deficiency of powder.            We rested for two whole days;
   when, no messenger of peace coming from the enemy, we
   proceeded forwards. Now, however, we experienced a failure
   of provisions; what we had brought with us being all con
   sumed,      and  there   was    nothing to be found in the enemy's
   country.       The king then       made proclamation, that it would
   not be advisable to go back to fetch provisions ; but that,
   whoever was desirous to eat, must push on with him to con
   quer the capital.        What the king did, that the armv. was

obliged to do ; and therefore we proceeded onwards.   We
marched that whole day, and even half the night, without
rinding any nourishment either for men or horses. At day
break we were still above a league from the town, which we
could already distinguish.    Whichever way we turned our
eyes, we  saw men   in great numbers, both of our own and of
the hostile army.   Our troops were meditating an attack,
when they were anticipated by the enemy; who, pouring down
the mountain which runs before the town, suddenly rushed
upon us, and the sight began with the utmost fury.  Having
to contend on all sides, we shouldcertainly have been lost,
had not the Moors heroically pressed forwards and made
themselves masters of the town. Being within      they im       it,
mediately dispatched    deputy to the king with tidings of
                               a
their success.  We therefore instantly received orders to pack
up and follow the king into the town.      These we joyfully
obeyed, in hopes of getting plentiful supply os food for both
                                       a
men and cattle;       but we sound         ourselves   deceived,      as there
was not the least thing left for both what the fugitive in
                                       :
habitants had not been able to carry oss, and what such as
staid behind had still possessed,          was   all consumed      by   those   of

likewise set sire to the town on the north side. The king's
first orders Were      to extinguish        the flames;    after which          he
consulted    with his officers         how we were now to proceed.
I   had my quarters   in what was lately the habitation of an
officer;    where, though    found convenient lodging, yet
                               I                                                I
could find no supply for my stomach.   To those who had got
nothing in the general pillage,  small portion of meal was
                                           a
indeed distributed; but this was no piore than sufficient to
appease the appetite     for  few hours. The next day was
                                   a                        day           a

ployed in making the proper regulations.    was ordered to

pity is here entirely banished : yet at other times I have seen
him display instances of pity and compassion.       But I soon
altered my opinion, for that very evening he issued orders to
the army to quit the town the following morning; without,
however, setting fire to    as was the usual practice, or car

 IX.     An Account of     the  Life and Writings of h.KVOi sier.
                       By Jerome Lalande.
  l\ nthony Laurence                Lavoisier          was  born at Paris
 on the a6th of August 1743, and enjoyed the advantage of a
 good education, on which his father, a man of property, be
 stowed great care.       In  the year 1764, the French government
 having proposed      as the subject   of a prize of 2000 livres the
 best method of lighting the streets, the prize was divided
 among three artists who had made experiments on the sub
ject  ;  but Lavoisier,    who had examined it           as a philosopher
 and man of    letters, was rewarded       in a  different manner. The
 paper   which   he  wrote  in answer   to  this  question was published
 at the expence of the Academy of Sciences, and the King
 caused a gold medal to be presented to him by the president
 in  a public   fitting of the academy held on the 9th of April
 1766.     This paper, which contained a great many excellent
 mathematical      and philosophical observations, announced the
 author's entrance in the career of science in which he after
 wards continued to distinguish himself.
    On the 18th of May 1768, he was chosen a member of the
 academy,    in the room of Baron        ;   and about the same period
 he published several treatises       in different periodical publica
                                                                    tions,

tions, such       as Observations on the proposal          for erecting a
steam engine to supply the city of Paris with water, on thun
der, on the northern lights, on the transition os water into
ice, &c.       The Memoirs       of  the Academy      for the year      177.0
contain Observations by him on the nature of water, and on
the experiments said to prove the possibility of its conversion
into earth.       Lavoisier, however, showed        that the earth ob
tained by the distillation of water was a part of the vessel
which had been attacked during the operation : for, having
continued the distillation without interruption 101 days, the
total weight of the vessel and of the water contained in it re
mained unchanged, but the pelican had loll as much                         in
 weight as the water had increased.
     In   the   year   1774 Lavoisier proved that the increased
 weight of     metals during their oxidation, arose from their im
 bibing the air contained in the vessels in which the operation
 was performed ; by which means a question that had long-
 formed a subject of dispute among philosophers and chemists,
 and had occasioned       many costly experiments, was finally de
 termined.       This formed a foundation for his new chemical
 theory, which he first opposed to the phlogistic sysiem before
 adopted by chemists.
     In the fame year he published his small physico-chemical
 works.       Priestley, in the year 1772, had made known his
 experiments on carbonic acid gas ; but Lavoisier traced back
 its   origin  to Paracelsus,   born in 1493, and to his pupil Van
  Helmont,       born   1111588;     and   showed    that   even    Pahssey,
 Kay, Boyle, Hales, Vcnel           and   Macbride     had   been    in part
 acquainted with this gas.           He  showed also that     Dr. Black     os
 Edinburgh       had called the    attention   ot philosophers        to this
                                                                     *
 important part of chemistry so early as the year 1756 ; and
  therefore he ascribed to him the honour of this new disco
  very, which in the course       of twenty    years had given occasion
  to so many others      of the utmost     importance to mankind.
      Lavoisier proved by his experiments, that an elastic fluid,
  or kind of gas, was united in a fixed form with calcareous
  earth ; he proved the presence of it in alkalies, and showed

                                                                          that

that it was produced during the reduction of metallic calce*
and of the phosphoric acid.          He not onlv applied to che
mistry the different methods of experimental philosophy, and
its various kinds of apparatus, but even introduced into it the
spirit of accuracy and calculation, which had never before
been    employed     in  that way.        With this union of two
branches of natural knowledge, Lavoisier's principal work
forms the commencement of a bright period in the history of
their improvement.
   Priestley having found that, during the union of nitrous acid
with an earth, oxygen gas was generally produced, thence
concluded that atmospheric air was a mixture of nitrous acid
and earth. Lavoisier,on the contrary, showed in the year 1776,
that oxygen, gas was a component part of nitrous acid. This
oblervation confirmed the truth of a great number of experi
ments, and gave rife to      a variety  of other   discoveries.
   In  the year 1778 he was able         to prove that the purest air,
that necessary for respiration,      or the dcphlogisticated air of
Priestley, was the cause       of aciditv,    and existed in al) acids.
To this    part of the atmosphere,     contained in all acids, which
converts     the metals  into .metallic calces, and creates oxygen
gas in union with caloric, he gave the name of ovygen.
   In Germany, where chemistry has been much cultivated,
this theory was soon adopted, and first made known by Gir-
tanner at Gottingen, and Hennbstadt at Berlin, the latter of
whom translated Lavoisier's Elementary Treatise of Chemistry
into German.        Soon after it was adopted also by Klaproth,
Mayer, Lichtenberg, and Gottling. Westrumb, Crell, and
Gren, however, still endeavoured to defend the old phlogistic
system   ;  but the majority was against them. Berthollet re
mained for some time undecided ; but his own experiments
soon induced him       to embrace     this theory, which conducted
him to important discoveries.
   In the month of June 1783, Lavoisier constructed             an appa
ratus   for burning hydrogen gas with oxygen gas in close
vessels;   and the result was a fluid, or rather pure water, the
weight of which corresponded exactly with that of the two
gases employed..      Having    learned    that  the fame experiment
had be«n made by Cavendisti and             Monge,    he invented an
                           8                                        Cher

other apparatus for decomposing water, with which, by means
of iron tubes, he separated the hydrogen from the oxygen.
Lavoisier proved also that atmospheric air consists of two
kinds    of gas, one of which is fit, and the other unfit, for respi
ration; that the first is oxygen, which possesses the property
of uniting with bodies, and thereby becoming fixed ; that
this substance combines with            metals during their oxidation,
and with combustible bodies when in a state of combustion ;
and that in the first cafe a metallic         calx is produced, and in
 the last an acid,    which   is  of  a  different nature according to
the     kind of the inflammable body.            On this depends the
 whole theory of combustion, of the production of acids, and
 the division of natural bodies into inflammable                 and  non.-
 inflammable.       On this depends also the knowledge of that
 kind of gas called formerly fixed air, but now carbonic acid
 gns, because it is produced         during the combustion of char
  coal, and is compounded of carbon and oxygen.
      Lavoisier, therefore, was the first who discovered that the
  different kinds of gas are. the result of the solution of any sub
  stance by caloFic ; this conducted him to the conclusion lh3t
  the caloric and the matter of light, disengaged during the
  combustion of inflammable            substances,   docs not arise from
  them, but from the air which surrounds them, and in which
  the combustion       takes  place      In this    series of experiments
  may be classed that made by Lavoisier on detonation, which
  is nothing else than a sudden inflammation,              the products of
   which are disengaged in the gaseous form.
       In the year 1776, Lavoisier by means of Turgot was ap
   pointed fuperintendant of the powder manufactory, in order
   to improve that     art ; and    this he did   so  effectually, that the
   powder manufactured under his inspection was capable of
   driving a musket-ball to the distance of 120 fathoms, whereas
   that made before was capable of driving it only to the di
   stance   of  90 fathoms.       In   the war     of  1765,   the   English
   bullets reached     our  vessels   from   a  distance    at which    ours
   could not reach them ; but in the war of 1778 the cafe was",
    reversed.    In the year 1788 he was in great danger of losing
   his life in consequence os an explosion which took place
   during some experiments then made             at  Essone.   ,

 sis  of nitrons acid,      an acid easy to be decomposed,       but difficult
 to be extricated       ;  and which,   however, is   of great importance,
 as   it is   a component part of saltpetre,         and   at the same time
 of gunpowder.
     In the year 1789, Lavoisier         endeavoured    to bring the whole
 series   of his experiments into        systematic   order, and thence to
 compose an elementary work oh chemistry.                   Two editions of
 this work were fold off in the author's lifetime, and he had
 begun to prepare a new and improved one, in which new
light would have been thrown on the whole science of
chemistry,          He intended also to give a collection of all his
 Essays in six volumes, but          of these three only were published.
     It would     be difficult to determine what influence Lavoisier's
discoveries       have had, or may in future have,           on the practice
 of -the arts; but, if we consider the entire revolution effected in
 that of dyeing bv the new chemistry, we shall tind reason to
entertain the        best    hopes respecting    the rest.    Almost all the
phænomena in this art may now be traced hack to burning
and combustion, as has been sufficiently proved by Ber-
thollet in his important work on dyeing.               This art, therefore,
Xvhich formerly depended            on mere practice,      is  now founded
upon     a very simple       and well-grounded      theory.
     The    art  of mining, of assaying and fusing metals, of pre
paring       steel, of bleaching linen and wax ; in a word, almost
ull the chemical arts, under the direction of the new theory"
have been rapidly improved and brought near to perfection.
     By applying      these discoveries    to the phenomena       of breath
ing;, Lavoisier has shown that this vital function is a real com-,
bultion of carbon and hydrogen, bv which carbonic 'acid and
water are produced. The effect of this combustion is animal
heat, the degree of which he was so fortunate as to ascertain
by calculation.            His experiments on this subject conducted
him to means for determining the remarkable relation which
exists between accelerated respiration, the circulation of the
blood, and perspiration, and between the different powers,
and the application made of them by nature, lie had la
boured      also for  a   long time on    a  particular work on the sub
ject of digestion.

    The    last,   and perhaps the most important of Lavoisier's
 labours      related to animal perspiration, on which subject he
 read a paper before the Academy              of Sciences on     the 4th   of
 May     1
           79 1.     A part of this paper may be         found in the Me
 moirs of the Academy for the year 1790.
    Lavoisier first lays it down as an established principle, that
 the animal body is maintained by respiration, perspiration,
 and digestion.         He then examines in a chemical view each
 of these effects, the nature of the perspiration of the skin and
 of the lungs, distinguislies the effects from each other, and,
 as  it were, interrogates       nature respecting the three causes by
 which they are produced. He invented an apparatus by
 which every thing that relates to evaporation externally, and
 to breathing        internally, could be observed.         In conjunction
 with Seguiri, he made on this subject some exceedingly dif
 ficult and laborious experiments, by which he found that a
man by perspiration loses daily 2 pounds J3 ounces ; that m
the course of 24 hours he consumes 33 ounces of oxygen gasj
 that in the fame period 8 cubic feet of carbonic acid gas, one
 third of which consists of carbon, and two thirds of oxygen,
 are disengaged        from the lungs ; that the quantity of water
 produced      in  the  lungs amounts to 1 pound 7 ounces, of which
3 ounces         are hydrogen, and 20 oxvgen, and that only 6
ounces of water are formed by the perspiration of the lungs.
For these experiments he had provided balances which did
not err half      a dram    in 125 pounds.
    By these accurate and difficult experiments Lavoisier had
obtained great insight into the causes of several diseases, as
well    as  in  regard    to the means     of assisting the powers    of na
ture    in curing them,         and   on that account had resolved to
overturn       the    immense     colossus   of medical prejudices and
errors which had beeii before established.                None of his un
dertakings       was   of more   importance    than   this, and it is much
to be lamented that he did not live to carry it into execution.
    Between the years 1778 and 1785, he improved. and cul
tivated     at his own expense         240 acres of land in la Vendee,
in order     that   he  might promote agriculture by setting a good
example before the farmers; and his mode of culture was at
tended with         so

of crop than was obtained by the usual method. In                the
course of nine years his produce was doubled ; but as            the
capital he laid out did not produce him five per cent., he was
thence induced to form a plan for lowering the interest of
capitals, and extending leases to the period of 27 years.
   The committee of the constituent assembly of 1 791, ap
pointed for the purpose os settling the taxes, having requested
Lavoisier to assist them by his knowledge in accomplishing
the object which they had in view, his ideas were of great
assistance to   them in the formation of    a   plan by which the
whole system of income and expenditure was greatly simpli
fied.    In order that he might give the committee the neces
sary information     on this subject, he communicated to them
an extract from a very large work       on the different produc
tion? of the country, and their consumption, for which he
had   been   long employed in collecting materials.        This ex
tract was printed bv the National Assembly, under the title
of Ricbrffa tcrritoriales de la France, and is undoubtedly the
best work on the subject.
   In the year 1791 he was appointed      a   commissioner of the
national treasury ; and, without abandoning the study of the
sciences, he introduced into this department such order and
regularity,   that the proportion between the income and the
expenditure in all the branches of government could be seen
at one view every evening.
   In   the great   and important undertaking     of establishing in
France     a new   system of weights  and measures,     with which
the academy had been occupied for some          time, none of the
members was more active or more useful than Lavoisier.
   In order that he might diffuse new light on the important
but not sufficiently illustrated doctrine of the expansion of
metals by heat, he constructed an apparatus by which metal
rods immersed in water and exposed to different degrees of
heat, put in motion a telescope,      which    showed on a distant
object the smallest degree of expansion.
   In the year 1793, it being necessary to have       a  basis mea
sured with the greatest     accuracy, in order to determine the
length of an arc of the meridian,       he erected in his garden,
rods of platina aud copper, which       he employed as metallic

thermometers,        and on which each degree of variation in the
temperature      could  be accurately observed.      On this occasion
he ascertained the proportions of their expansion, and these rods
 were afterwards employed        in measuring a base between Lieu-
saint and Melun ; from which were afterwards deduced the
 length of the meridian between Dunkirk and Barcelona, the
 circumference of the earth, and the standard for the new
French measures.
     It might    have been expected that a philosopher possessed    of
 talents so rare and uncommon, would have inspired with
 respect for his character the most savage and worthless of
 mankind.        But at that period the helm of the French go
 vernment was in the hands of a fut of monsters to whom no
 thing was sacred,       and  whose  unbounded ambition sacrificed
 every thing to the hope       of flattering   the deluded  populace.
 They conceived that nothing could contribute more to the
 accomplishment of this view, than to offer up as victims at
 the shrine of popular licentiousness all the farmers-general ;
  and in consequence       of this cruel measure, twenty-eight of
 them, among whom was Lavoisier, were put to death, for
  crimes real or pretended, on the 8th of May 1794, by the
  bloody revolutionary tribunal.
      In the year 1771, Lavoisier married Mary Anne Pierette
  Paulze, the daughter of one of the farmers-general, a lady
  of agreeable manners, and possessed of considerable talents.
  She engraved the copper-plates for his last work.
      Lavoisier was of large stature; complacency and penetra
  tion were displayed in his countenance; his behaviour was
  mild, civil,    and polite;  and his activity knew no bounds.

       On     the third and tenth of February a curious paper by
    I. J.   Schroder    on the accidental changes of the fixed ne-

    him, that the irresoluble nebulæ, or those of which the
    distinct stars cannot be seen by the highest powers of the
   telescopes     applied to them, are subject to the same increase
   and     diminution of brightness that some of the fixed stars
   have been observed to have          : he supposes that nebulæ       of this
   description are not at the amazing            distance    conjectured by
   some      astronomers   ;   but,   that they are collections of the

  of   its   author (John Hawkins, Esq.) we may hope that the
  state    of the mines in Cornwall, and the geology of that
  highly interesting county, will be laid before the curious.
  This     lode is one of those which, in the language of the
  miners of that county, are termed cross lodes, i. e. running
 north and south, it intersects a lode of copper running east and
 west.       The silver is very rich ; but, however productive it
 may turn out, it cannot be worked much longer, as the mine
 will soon be nearly 200 fathom deep, and there are no me

 from     a greater  depth.

  C. Cadet having mixed the materials to be employed in

with well-formed crystals of oxalic acid.
  C. Badollicr, apothecary at Chirtres, has announced a
new method of preparing acetic acid.      It consists in distill
ing, in a retort placed in a sand bath with a receiver adapted
to   it,   a    mixture os equal parts of sulphate of copper and ace
tate os lead.
     To examine                  the    products, C. Badollier                  made        use     of     a
pneumatic apparatus    during the operation he obtained only
                                       :
asmall quantity of elastic fluid, which he found to have arisen
from the dilated air contained in the                              vessels.      This air, wlien
subjected to the proper re-agents, exhibited no traces                                   of car
bonic          acid.        As
                       presumed that his acetic acid might
                                   he
contain sulphuric acid, he tried      means of    solution of

      The American Medical Repository, Vol.             IV.   contains the
  following remarks: — If the fixed vegetable alkali is an ele
  mentary material, it might be expected to show itself after
   the decomposition      of plants by putrefaction      as well as by in
  cineration.      Yet the American forests, where immense quan
  tities of timber are rotting down, afford no evidence of this.
   On the contrary, the trunks of the largest trees, as they un
   dergo gradual decay upon the ground, give no sign of pot-ash.
   Frequently in the progress of decomposition, the annual cir
   cles are so detached     from each other    as to be easily peeled   off,
   and    the   cohesion   of the wood so much lessened, that the
   blade   of  a knife  or  of a sword can be thrust in toward the
   medullary part of their whole length. Now there is no saline
   efflorescence   on this rotten timber in dry weather, nor is there
   any alkaline taste, nor any pot-afli        to be obtained by mace-

 rasing it in water, nor are vegetable blues or purples in the
 least rendered green by dipping in such water.              Indeed, the
 manufacturers of the article, which is one of the great sub
jects of export from New York, know that in clearing the
 wilderness, the trees, in order to afford pot-ash, must be
 burned ; if they are suffered to rot, no alkali can be procured.
 On    the contrary the rotten wood contains an acid.           Did   pot
 ash   pre-exist in the wood, why should it not be evolved by
 putrefaction ? These considerations, and the analogy of am
 moniac, lead to a persuasion, that this alkali and soda are
 compounds.         Whether, as some have asserted, carbon and
 azote are the ingredients, or whether there are other consti
 tuent parts, are points not as yet settled.
                     DISEASES      OF   THE EYES.
    Dr. Mitchill of New- York           states (Med. Rep. Vol.       IV)
 a cafe  of a girl whose constitution had been considerably            in
jured by siphylis, being affected,        in addition    to that disease,
with    an ugly and scabby      eruption     over   her face and neck,
and with an enlargement and inflammation               of the lachrymal
sac   of the right eye.        Determining to defer the particular
treatment of the fistula lacbrymalis until the general and
more urgent      disease of her constitution       should have abated,
he   prescribed,    besides other things,       a weak solution  of car
bonate of soda in water as a lotion for her face.              This had
the usual effect of disposing the eruptions to dry away and
disappear in a few days ; but what he did not at all expect,
the  fistula lacbrymalis    disappeared    too,  under the continuance
of  the alkaline wash, and returned ho more.
   Dr. Guthrie of Petersburgh mentions (Duncans1 Annals
of Med. for 1799) the remarkable efficacy of the effluvia of
spirits of turpentine in the cure of an old and obstinate cafe

Parkinson's     Chemical Pocket-booh,   or Memoranda        Cbemica.
     Second  Edition.   Symonds, Murray and Highley, &c.
    We announced the publication of        the first edition  of this
valuable little work in our sixth volume, p. 364. We then
observed, that Mr. Parkinson's work could not fail to be use
ful in no mean degree, though we feared that in a few cases
he had admitted facts of uncertain authority, and theories
not sufficiently supported.     In the present edition, which we
are happy to find so Toon called for by the public, the author
has separated as much as possible the varying opinions         which
he wished    to enumerate,  from the other part of the work, and
has introduced such new chemical facts as have been esta
blished since its first publication.
                         MINERALOGY.
   The Chemical      Society of Philadelphia, besides a variety
of other minerals from different parts of the United States,
have lately received a specimen of the golden or auriferous
pyrites from Virginia, from ten pennyweights of which three
grains of gold, twenty-four carats fine, have been extracted.
    A quantity of manganese has been sent to the Society
from the county of Albemarle, where it is found in abun
dance. This mineral now retails in Philadelphia at the rate
of  elevenpence    per pound;
   A   variety of the sulphate of barytes, called lapis hepati-
cus, accurately described by Cronstedt as the lieberstein, or
liverstone, of the Germans and Swedes, has also been for
warded    to the Society from the fame       place. This mineral
almost always accompanies the best metallic ores, and is con
sidered by mineralogists as a happy presage of finding them.
According to the celebrated Becher, it is a certain indication,

    The French in Egypt     have not been idle    in their researches

                              . M   3                             this

graphical errors, the necessary consequence of mere admea
surement,      by astronomical observations ; and laid the foun

complete knowledge          of  the   monuments       of  antiquity   which
now remain (mostly in Upper Egypt) has been obtained }
and plans     of  the feite  of many     celebrated    antient cities have
been taken.         Drawings    have hern made        of the sculptures on
the antient monuments,          as  well  as  of  the monuments them
selves,    In  the sepulchral    excavations     of Thebes many mum
mies in high preservation          have been found ; and,- which is
of much      greater importance, along with them several rolls             of
papyrus, which enrich the possessors with some of the most
antient manuscripts in the world.              On the base of a peristile
at Esne a sculpture of the zodiac has been discovered, in which
the solliiee is indicated in        Virgo   ; and    another in the great
temple of Dendara, which represents                 the fun in Leo : his
approach to Cancer has also been observed.                  These show at
the same time the antiquity of the temples, and the know
ledge which the fc'gvptians possessed of the preeeslion of the
equinoxes.
    Two     vases    containing    about two thousand         Roman     gold
coins have lately been discovered near Eeauvais in France.
They consist chieflv of the emperors from Galba to Geta in
 clusive,  many of them of beautiful workmansliip and in high
 preservation.       They were eagerly seized upon by the persons
 in   the  neighbourhood, and it is believed that the fear of
 losing them      keeps some    of   the most valuable       of them con
 cealed ; especially     those  of  the empresses.       This will, how
ever, probablv for a long time be a source of valuable speci
 mens for cabinets; for sooner or later they will come to
 light.

    We     are happy to find that a successful            attempt   to tame
 this animal has been         made     by  Mr. Chancellor Livingston,
 President    of   the  New-York Society for promoting Agricul

 much     to hope, that at no very distant period the old world
 may    thus   receive from the new a useful domestic animal in

     No attempts,"               fays Mr. Livingston          (Part   III.   of the
Transactions of the              New-York Society),          "   have been made
to render these noblel animals useful.                      Content with sacri
ficing them to our hunger, we have never thought of drawl
ing, from their activity and strength, the aids which they
might afford us by their labour. The elk is larger than the
rein-deer, and, when taken young, as domestic as the ox, as
I    find from having three that run with my cattle, and appear
as much attached      to them as to their own species.   I have
lately attempted to break two of them to the harness, and am
much encouraged by my first essay.      They have been but
twice bitted, and appear to me to be quite as docile as colts
would be at their age.     They apply their whole strength to
the draught, and go on a steady pace.                      Their mouths      appear
to       bte       and some care is necessary to prevent their
               very tender,
being injured by the bit.  Mine are about two years old, and
are not less than thirteen hands high : their thighs are as
muscular           as those    of   the horse.     In their native woods             the
males grow to about fifteen hands, as far as I can collect
from the information of hunters.  It is probable, however,
that in a        of domesticity they would grow much larger,
                    state
as all graminivorous animals are pinched for food in our cli
mate during the winter.     Their gaits are a walk and a trot :
they never bound like the stag.    If upon trial it is found that
the elk can  be  rendered  useful in  the harness, it would in
many views be an acquisition : as its trot is very rapid, it is
probable that, in light carriages, they would out-travel the
horse.  The rein-deer affords abundance of rich milk. It is
 not to be doubted that the animal, which                         is only a larger
 species         of rein-deer, might      be brought to furnish our dairies.
    It   appears to me to be less delicate              in its food than     a horse.
    Mine  have been kept fat on hay alone, though they were very
    negligently attended.  They are long lived, and more pro
    ductive than any domestic beast of burden, generally pro
    ducing two fawns at a birth.   By castration they may be
    prevented  from getting horns,   as           if,

 ally expended upon the horns, would, in that cafe, add to

            THE WILD GOOSE DOMESTICATED;
    Attempts have frequently been made on Long-Ifland to
 render the wild goose, which winters in the bays adjoining
 the Atlantic ocean, a tame and domesticated               bird.   Indi
 viduals of this species have accordingly been catched alive by
 the gunners after having been wing-»broken by a (hot, and
 carried home free from any other injury.              When thus dis
 abled from flying)     they become gentle,      and   will mate wi:h
 common geese. They even breed together ; but the offspring
is a mule, incapable of further propagation.               Mr. Daniel
 Coles, of Oyster-bay, has gone a step beyond others in this
business.     He has a wild-goose and gander in a domesticated
(late, whom he keeps from flying away by taking off the ex*
treme bone3 of the wings at the joint.            The goose has 'laid
eggs and hatched a brood of goslings.            For fear of losing the
young    ones,  their  wings  have  been   treated   in the fame man
ner; and    the whole family now composes          (September, 1800)
a beautiful flock     of wild geese   in a domesticated    state.  They
are as gentle   as  common     geese,   and live upon the food       ob
tained about a house and on a farm quite as well.             Mr. Coles
even    found that the goslings, on the day of being hatched,
ate  Indian  meal as readily as chickens. They are more active
and handsome than the tame-goose,           and their long necks are
arched    more like those of swans.       If this   experiment should
be continued for several generations, it is highly probable the
temper and habits of the breed may be changed, so that the
descendants    of  these wild-geese may lose their inclination         to
fly from country to country, and attach themselves, like tur
keys, ducks, and other birds whose progenitors were once
wild, to the society and protection of man. Should Mr. C.
meet   with no disasters, it is not improbable that the wild-
goose will be eventually added to our stock of poultry.
                   NEGRO TURNING WHITE.
   The change of colour which Harry Moss has within               a few
years undergone, from black to white,          has been publiflied so
                                                                   oftea

often that few curious persons are ignorant of it. In the
town of North-Hempstead,               something of the same kind is
now to be seen. A young negro, named Maurice, aged 25
 years, began, about seven years ago, to lose his native colour.
 A white spot appeared on the right fide of his belly, which is
 now about      as large     as the palms      of two   hands!      Another
 white spot has appeared on his breast, and several more on
his arms and other parts ; and the fable cloud is plainly dis
appearing on his shoulder.            The skin of  these fair spots is not
surpassed    by the European          complexion.     His   general    health
is and has been good ; and he has suffered no scalding ulcer-
ation, scabbiness, or other local disease. The change is not
the dead white of the Albinos, but is a good wholesome car
nation hue. Such an alteration of colour as this, militates
powerfully against the opinion adopted by some modern phi-
lpsophers, that the negroes are a different species of the human
race from the whites, and tends strongly to corroborate the
probability of the derivation of all the varieties of mankind
from a single pair.        Facts of this kind are of great value to
the zoologist.       How additionally singular would it be, if in
stances of the spontaneous disappearance of this fable mark
of distinction    between      staves  and   their masters were       to  be
come frequent      1   They would then         be no less     important     to
the moralist and political economist.
                                  LOCUSTS.
    The following     observations      on locusts,    made, in the year
1715, by the Rev. Andrew Sandel *, then rector of the
Swedish church in Philadelphia, are left on the records of
the said church, in the Swedisti language: — " In the month
of May    a  peculiar kind of grasshoppers or flies, called by the
English locufts, issued from the earth.             They came up every
where, even on the hard roads. They were enabled to pierce
the earth by means of a (hell that covered the whole body,
pven the mouth and feet.             Having issued from the earth, they
crept out of their (hells, flew about, placed themselves every
where on the trees, and made a peculiar noise.                      As they

were in great     numbers over        the whole country,       their noise
was so loud that the people could hardly hear the bells in the
woods.      They ripped the bark of the trees, and put worms
therein.     Many expected that the trees would be dried by
this ; but we found, next year, that it did not happen. Swine
and fowls fed on these insects.             The Indians did also eat
them,    especially   on  the   first  arrival, after    a previous slight
roasting  :  from this it is probable that they are of the fame
kind with      those eaten by      John the Baptist.       They   were   of
short continuance, dying in June;"
    Remarks. The worms mentioned were, no doubt, those
white worm-like eggs which the present locusts deposit in
the bark. All the other circumstances correspond with those
that now take place.
    That the locusts were not destructive, appears by the ac
count given by the fame author, on the extraordinary fer
tility of that year, in wheat, rye, Indian corn, oats and
apples.
    That  year was also remarkably healthy among the Swedes,
as appears    from   the small     number of deaths on the funeral
records, which included       a   district at least fifteen miles north,
west, and south from Philadelphia.

    A  surgeon    lately arrived at Rotterdam from Surinam
states, that in that colony they have now large thriving
plantations of the bread-fruit tree, which are exceedingly
productive ; that the bread made from it is as good as that
from wheat j and that for this purpose the fruit is sliced,
dried in the fun, and then pounded, and this flour with
water made into paste, which rises as well as wheat flour.
Hopes are entertained that this valuable tree may be intro
duced into Europe.

XI. Life of Abraham Gothei.f Kastner,                                 Prqsejsor
                     of    Mathematics at Gottingen.
A.      G. KASTNER,               professor     of mathematics   at    Gottin
gen, was born      at Leipfic on the 27th of September 1719.
His   father, Abraham Kastner, maintained himself and family
by giving lectures on different subjects relating to jurispru
dence; and his mother's brother, Dr. G. R. Pommer, by
lecturing on the practical parts of the fame science. Both of
them, however, had more taste for literary pursuits than for
that from which they derived their support.     The latter un
derstood the French,English, Italian, and Spanish, and by
these means young Kastner had an opportunity of learning
these languages. Pommer possessed also a considerable col
lection of books in these languages, and, as Kastner had
early acquired a taste for reading, he made use of    as                 it,
well as of*his father's library, as far as his talents would
admit.  As      impossible to read much, even in historical
                it   is
events,      whether real or feigned, without meeting with allu
sions to the mathematical sciences;      Robinson Crusoe having
fallen into our young mathematician's hands, he learned
with  great avidity the nautical terms which occur in that
popular romance, and of which an explanation                      is   given in
the German tranflation.
  In the  year 1731, he attended the philosophical lectures of
the celebrated Winkler, and next year studied mathematics
under     G. F. Richter.          At this period        he purchased    at auc
tions    many books as he could, and he received many as
        as
presents from his uncle.   In regard to his knowledge of ge
neral mathematics, he derived great benefit from the works
of Wolfe; and he acquired     good notion of astronomy from

6S              Life of Abraham Gotbelf K'dflner,
    In the  year 1735    he studied  under Hausen, and he used
to thank this preceptor     for having recommended to him the
Greek method of geometry, which is             so certain, and which
Kastner afterwards     pursued with so much credit to himself.
    At this   period   there  was   very   little encouragement at
Leipsic for practical astronomy.         Hausen sometimes showed
the moon to his pupils through a telescope, and young
Kastner once observed in his company an eclipse of that
planet ; but they had no time-piece, and their only telescope
was borrowed from Walzen, a native of Wirtemberg, who
resided at Leipsic as a private tutor,     and who was afterwards
geographer royal at Dresden, where he died. Another time
Hausen carried Kastner along with him to the tower of
Saint Nicholas's     church to observe    a transit  of Mercury   over
the sun, and for determining the time they had a plummet
suspended by a thread ; but, the weather being cloudy, they
could make no observation. In the year 1742 a comet ap
peared,    and   Hausen    determined its orbit in the simplest
manner, by the intersection of two arches through two pair
of stars. A projection of this comet's orbit may be seen in
Gottsched's preface to Heyne's Versucb einer Betrachtung liber
dieCometen; Berlin, 1742. Young Kastner being desirous of
observing, along with some friends, this comet through a
 elefcope, applied to his tutor, who gave him an old wooden
tube, and a convex glass to be used as an eye-glass, by hold
ing it to the end of the tube with the hand.           What observa
tions the company could make with this instrument it would
be difficult to fay in prose; but Kastner himself has given an
account of them in an ode published in the first part of his
Miscellanies.
    From what has been said it may readily be conceived what
progress Kastner was able to make in practical astronomy.
Being left entirely to his own assiduity, he procured Doppel-
mayr's chart of the stars and Bayer's Uranometria ; and often
repaired to the market-place of Leipsic, and other convenient
 stations,  to observe   the heavenly bodies.        In the year 1742
 he   formed   an  acquaintance    with   I.  C.  Baumann,    who by
 his own industry had studied mathematics in the writings of
Wolfe,     and who wished     to sec himself what he had learned
                                                                 from.

from these and other books         ; but he had no money to pur
chase instruments and telescopes.        He therefore did what has
been since practised     by Herschel   :  he constructed   some him
self,  according to the directions given by Hertel and Leut-
mann.       Baumann's sister, whom Kastner afterwards mar
ried, recommended         herself to his notice by her attachment
to these pursuits.
    Having obtained from Baumann a             telescope  the object-
glass of which had a focus of fix feet,        and which magnified
23 times, he employed it for observing the comet of 1744,
much better than the one he had borrowed in 1742.                 He
had no time-keeper,        but he purchased at a sale a brass qua
drant of half      a Rhinland foot radius, with fixed sights, and
divided into quarters of a degree.
    In the course of time he caused more and larger telescopes
to be constructed, which he employed as far as could be pos
sibly done where he had no means to determine accurately
the time.      With a 26 feet telescope of this kind, he saw in
 the sun,   as he assures   us himself, white luminous spots, such
 as   Mr. Schroter of Lilienthal observed afterwards with the
 best telescopes.     With the fame telescope Baumanu observed
a dark red      ring round Mercury during his transit over the
fun on the 6th of May 1753.           On the 9th of October 1751,
 Kastner observed an occultation of Jupiter; and on the 11th
 of February, next year, one of Venus by the moon : of both
these phænomena, and the circumstances attending them, he
publislied an account in the eighth volume of the Hamburgh
Magazine. It may there be seen that at this period he em
ployed himself in observing the heavens         as much as his situa
 tion would admit.
    In   the year 1737      he had   begun to learn algebra with
 Heinfius.     Next year, Heinsius,      having finished his course,
 made     a tour to Petersburgh, and on his return in 1745
 Kastner requested leave to be present at the observatory while
 he made his observations ; but he could not get his wishes
 gratified.    In this point Heinfius was exceedingly reserved,
 and it was only with great difficulty that baron Kregel could
obtain a similar favour.         In other respects Kastner kept up
 a very friendly intercourse with Heinsius.

 loo             Life os Abraham Gotbelf Kaftner,
     In the year 1755, when the celebrated Lieberkuhn, to
 whom optics and physiology are so much indebted, was called
 in as a physician to visit an old duchess who resided at Lcipsic,
 he paid a visit to Kaftner, and presented him with two object-
 glasses, one  of  27 feet 6 inches focus, and the other     of 1 1 feet,
 which Kiistner kept by him as long as he lived.
    After   the year 1746, Kaftner        enjoyed  a salary of 100   rix-
 dollars as extraordinary professor : what was further necessary
 for maintaining himself and family, he procured by his lec
 tures and by labouring for the booksellers.             By translating
 the Swedish Transactions,         contributing towards the Ham
 burgh Magazine, publishing an edition of Smith's Optics,
 and translating Lulolf's Knowledge of the Terrestrial Globe,
 he had a further opportunity of improving himself in astro
 nomical knowledge ; but he was not able to employ so much
 time in the pursuit of this science as he wished ; and he wanted
instruments,     as well as a proper place, for making astronomical
observations.
    Kaftner had hopes of obtaining the first philosophical chair
that should become vacant at Leipsic ; but, as he could not
wait till Heinfius or Winklcr sliould make room for him, he
left that city, and in the year 1 756, after Segner's departure
from Gottingen, was invited thither to be professor of ma
thematics and natural philosophy.
    At that period Gottingen         afforded   many excellent oppor
tunities for improvement in the mathematical, astronomical,
and physical sciences.        Tobias Mayer had been invited thi
ther after Penther's death       ;  and   Lowitz, Wehner, Miiller,
Meister, Eberhard,       and   Hollmann, taught every branch of
the mathematical and physical sciences.             Mayer, in particu
lar, showed great friendship to Kaftner; but he gave him no
opportunity of participating in his labours at the observatory.
    In his occupations Kiistner      was assisted by Baumann, who
had followed him to       Gottingen      as optician to the university,
and who was of great service to the observatory by construct
ing for it instruments and achromatic telescopes ; but the
unsettled   state of affairs during    the seven years war, by   which
Gottingen     was    much affected,       was uot favourable to astro
nomical observations.
                                                                A   geo-

   A geographer and astronomer being wanted to accompany
the travellers sent at the expense of the Danish government
to the East, in consequence of a proposition made by Mi-
chaelis, Mayer recommended one of his scholars ; but as he
refused the offer, Kastner recommended Niebuhr, one of his
pupils, who was destined to be an engineer. Niebuhr agreed
to the proposal, but was under the necessity of obtaining in
struction in two branches of knowledge which he did not
before    consider     as necessary to his views    :   he was obliged to
learn    Arabic with Michaelis, and to make astronomical ob
servations    under Mayer.    How well he employed his know
ledge    in these respects may be seen by the account of his tra
vels ; and it may with justice be said, that the successful result
of the expedition      was in a great measure owing to Kastner.
   Kastner having received a rescript from Hanover, in which
it was stated that, the observatory not being employed for
the benefit of the university, as was wished, if he would agree
to take      a share   in it   he should be allowed the free use       of it
along with Mayer; he returned for answer, that "as Mayer's
great service to astronomy was well known, he could not fee
how the observatory could be employed to better advantage
than under his direction." When Kastner had sent off this
answer,      he transmitted    a    copy of   it,
                                           along with the rescript,            <
to Mayer,        who was highly satisfied with his conduct on the
occasion.        Mayer at the fame time said, that      any other
                                                               if
person     had    been suffered to participate with       him in    the care
of the observatory,                     his office altoge
                          he should have resigned
ther; adding, that " would be an unfortunate thing for a
                               it
man to become old in Gottingen." Mayer, indeed, did not
live to become old, for he died three days after he had com
pleted his 39th year.    Kastner was then secretary of the
Royal Society of Gottingen, and on the 13th of March 176a
he read before that body an eulogy on Mayer, which he after
wards published.
    After Mayer's death, the care of making observations was
 committed to Lowitz, who at the fame time received an in
 crease of his salary; and Kastner was appointed to assist him.
 Lowitz, however, would not accept of Kastner in that capa
 city, and the latter did not choose to importune him. In
                                                                         the

year 1763        Lowitz        made        known       his resolution      of leaving
Gottingen,       and     resigned          the   observatory         to Kastner, with,
every thing it contained.                  Though       Kiistner had before           no
thing to do with the observatory,  he gladly assumed this new
occupation ; but it was an express condition on entering upon
it,that he should require no increase of his salary;   sacrifice              a
which      he readily     made,          especially   as he had before         found no
difficulty,     when     in   a   less   favourable situation at Leipsic, to
incur      considerable        expense      in order to gratify his taste for
astronomy. The confidence reposed in him on this occasion
he employed to the benefit of astronomy and the honour of
Gottingen,        by
                 causing the manuscripts left   Mayer, and             by
his drawings of the moon, to be purchased for the use of the
university.  These he preserved at the university till they
were deliveredinto the hands of Lichtenberg for publication                             ;
and those not published were after his death deposited in the
public library.
  Kastner had     neither occasion, time, nor inclination, to
acquire the fame dexterity as Mayer       he obtained the use:
of the observatory when he was five years older than Mayer
at the time of his death, and only as an addition to his other
numerous    occupations.  He did not therefore pretend to
great readiness in the management of the instruments, which
requires long and uninterrupted experience; but      may be                   it
seen by his works that he understood every thing in regard
to making observations,                  and that his former practice was               of
great use to him.
     The    first who,     under Kastner's direction, took advantage
of   the permission       given to         use   the observatory,           were   Kiigel,
Lichtenberg, and Ljungberg.    The last was much inclined
to devote himself entirely to astronomy         Kitstner's re    :    by
commendation he was appointed professor of the mathema
tics at Kiel, and  now     counsellor of state to his Danish
                          is             a
majesty     at Copenhagen.
     On    the 19th    of June 1769, when               the transit     of Venus over
the fun took place, Kastner, in company with Lichtenberg
and Ljungberg, observed as much of that phænomenon as
could be      seen at   Gottingen         ;   that    is,   the ingress    of the planet
into the setting sun.
                                                                                       In

                 Profejsor of Mathematics at Gottingen.           103
      In  the year 1771,    Lichtenberg,   in consequence  os  a pro
  posal made by Kastner, was appointed          to make observations
  for determining the geographical situation of different places
  in the electorate of Hanover.         He, however, wanted a qua
  drant ; and as Kampe, who had undertaken to construct one,
  proceeded     slowly in his labour, Kastner applied to Demain-
  bray, director of the king's private observatory at Richmond,
  who sent him, at ihe king's desire, a quadrant by Sisson,
  which Lichtenberg employed, and which he afterwards gave
 ¦to   the observatory.
      The   observatory   had now obtained an excellent instrument
  for corresponding altitudes of the fun ; but as observations,
'
  on account of the nature of the building, could be taken
  m the morning only on the south-east side, and in the after
  noon on the south-west, it was necessary to remove the qua
   drant each time, and afterwards to adjust it. This labour
   was    undertaken by H. Opperman; I. T. Mayer, son of the
   astronomer,     a counsellor of state to his British majesty, and
   now profeflbr at Gottingen in the room of Lichtenberg; and
   Miiller,    captain of the Elbe frigate at Stade: but, on a re
   presentation made by Kastner, a building was constructed in
   the year 178a, under the direction of Opperman, on the
   south side of the observatory, where Sisson's quadrant is now
   erected,    and when used     it needs only to be turned.   A  like
   building has been constructed on the north side, for corre
   sponding altitudes of the northern stars.
       Kastner procured from Baumann several achromatic tele
   scopes and a heliometer; and the observatory, by the munifi
   cence    of their present majesties, the late duke of York, and
   the care of the Hanoverian government, was enriched with
   various telescopes, among which was one of Herfchel's re
   flectors, and a clock by Shelton with a compensation          pen
   dulum.       A paper of Kastner's respecting the variations in
   the going of this clock during the winter of 1778, may be
   found in Langsdorff 's Mechanical and Hydrodynamical Re
   searches, published in 1788.
    • In the
                 year 1789, Charles Felix Seyffer was appointed
   professor    of astronomy    at Gottingen  j  and as the practical
                                                                  part

part of this, science was committed to his care, he was placed
under Kastner for instruction.         Since that period all the ob
servations   at the observatory    have been made by Seyffer.
    Notwithstanding      Kastner's   service to astronomy and geo
graphy, the service he rendered to the mathematical sciences
in   general   was  much greater; and his name will be men
tioned by posterity among the most eminent professors.               He
exerted himself with the most celebrated geometers of Ger
many, Segner and Karsten, to restore to geometry its antient
rights, and to introduce more precision and accuracy of de
monstration into the whole of mathematical analysis.                The
doctrine    of binomials; that of          the higher equations; the
laws of the equilibrium      of two forces on the lever, and their
composition, are some of the most important points in the
doctrine of mathematical analysis and mathematics, which
Kastner illustrated and explained in such a manner as to excel
 all his predecessors.      Germany is in particular indebted to
him for his classical works on every part of the pure and prac
tical mathematics.        They unite that solidity peculiar to the
 old Grecian geometry with great brevity and clearness, and
 a fund of erudition, by which Kastner has greatly contributed
 to promote the study and knowledge of the mathematics.
 Kastner's talents, however, were not confined to mathematics :
 his poetical and humorous works, as well as his epigrams,
 are a proof of the extent of his genius ; especially as these
 talents  seldom    fall to the    lot of    a mathematician.      How
 Kastner acquired a taste for these pursuits, we are told by
 himself in one of his letters.         In the early part of his life he
 resided at Leipsic, among     friends   who were neither mathema
 ticians nor acquainted with the sciences : he then, as he tells
 us himself, contracted " the bad habit of laughing at others;"
 but he used always to fay, Hanc veniam damns petimufqut
 vuijfim. Kastner died at Gottingen on the aoth of June
  1800, at the age of eighty-one.
     Besides works on the pure and practical         mathematics,     we
  are indebted to Kastner for a          history of the mathematics
  from the revival    of literature   to  the end of the 18th century.

 v_>.    CAROCIIE         finished in the month        of May a telescope
of  22 feet,    constructed     without a small mirror,        in the same
manner      as those of Lemaire and Herschel ; and he is now
employed in making for another a speculum of platina. 7*-
inches in diameter.
    C. Tremel       has begun      a new stand       for the telescope of
22 feet, much firmer and more convenient than those before
 employed.
    A  terrace   has been       begun towards the south on            a level
 with the lower hall       of  the observatory,      for placing the tele
 scope upon when carried out            : nothing is wanting to com
 plete  it but  the  last course   of the   materials.
    Brother Noel, a Benedictine, finished, in 1772, a telescope
 the speculum of which had a focus of 24 feet 4 inches, and
 which     was   22i inches in diameter*.               He  pretended     that
 this telescope      magnified 430 times; but Sir George Shnck-
 burgh estimated its magnifying power only at 200. Noel
 valued this instrument at 80,000 francs, but Louis XV. had.
 expended     upon it more than 500,000.
    The small speculum was convex, in imitation of Cafle-
 grain's,   and had five feet real focus        ; which made the length
 of the telescope less. The eye-glasses of 8 and 24 inches
 focus could magnify 528 times ; but it was not sufficiently
 good to bear that degree of power.
    He mistrusted astronomers, and would not suffer me to view
 Jupiter through       his telescope:     " If you   find it  a good    one,"
 said he,    " you will    add nothing      to my credit,       for I  am al-

    Brother Noel was a tallow-chandler of Amiens, who had
become bankrupt ; but, having an opportunity of making
himself known          to the duke de Chaulnes,        at his feat  in Pi-
cardy, he imposed on him by his loquacity, and the duke
introduced him at court to exhibit a microscope which in
 all probability he had never made.             He got a lodging at the
Abbaye     ; he associated    himself with Navarre, who was        a good
optician;     and he proposed to the king to undertake a telescope,
only 12 feet in length, which should have           a magnifying power
double to the great telescope of Herschel.            He was afterwards
allowed to reside in the          hotel   de Passy,   near the castle of
La Muette, where           he laboured     till his death, which took
place in 178s.
    Rochon,      who succeeded him, sent for Caroche,           who had
already given proofs of his ability, and who, having re
polished the mirror, rendered this telescope as good as that
of Herschel : this Mechain and myself proved in 1788.
    The   observatory     will now be   as  well furnished with instru
ments    as   any in Europe.
    C. Janvier,      a celebrated  watch-maker,        has  presented    to
the Institute     a  beautiful clock, in which       he has represented,
by new and ingenious means,            things difficult to be expressed
in machinery,        such as the nodes    of the moon, the precession
of the equinoxes, and the two parts of the equation of time,
He presented also, not long ago, another new machine, which
contains new inventions for eclipses, the tides, the satellites,
the annual parallaxes, the true motion of the heavenly bodies>
and where these complex movements do no injury to the
moving force of the regulating wheels.
    The king of England has given 3000 guineas to Mr. Schrœ-
ter, of Lilienthal, for his instruments, which in future will be
considered as the property of the university of Gottingen.
    The duke of Gotha has procured for his excellent observa
tory a three-feet circle made by Troughton, who in that line
vies with Ramfden : this circle cost 10,000 francs.               He has
bespoke     a  large sector for making observations in the zenith,
and a   telescope of 16 feet from Mr, Schrceter.            He has car
                                                                      ried

ried  his zeal and munificence          so  far  as to cause to be    con
structed, for Mr. Wurm, a telescope           of  7 feet, that he maybe-
enabled to gratify his taste and to exercise his talents for astro
nomy.     The   duke   of Gotha    has obtained also from         Paris an
equatorial instrument by Ramsdcn, the circles of which are an
inch in diameter, and which is accurate to 3c/''. It is that
which I caused to be made for Bergeret, and which was
afterwards purchased by Patu de Mello, who had a singular
though barren taste for possessing sine instruments and good
books. Besides others, he had the observations of Hevelius, of
which only ninety copies were left, the rest of the edition having
been burnt by the villainy       of an infamous wretch in            1679.
This volume      has been purchased        by C. Labbey,       professor   of
mathematics in the central school           of the Pantheon, with all
the other works     of Hevelius, which he is worthy to possess.
    Patu de   Mello had two equatorial*, excellent achromatic
telescopes,  and beautiful clocks ; but he would               never suffer
any one to     use  them, nor even to       see  them.     In this  respect
he was very different from the president            Du Saron, who took
a pleasure in lending his most valuable instruments; and
from Bergeret, who lent us his large mural quadrant for the
Military School, where it       still remains.
    Troughton has already made fifty circles in imitation                  of
ours, with some changes and useful improvements.                    He   di<4
not think that his being an Englishman ought to prevent
 him from taking advantage of an invention which principally
 belongs to France.
    The king of Prussia has granted 20,000 francs to the ob
 servatory of Berlin, where M. Bode was in want of many
 important articles. A meridian telescope of 3 [¦ feet, by Dol-
 lond,  has been procured ; and a new hall has been prepared
 above that where     I erected   the mural        in 1751.     A  descrip
 tion and   figure   of this   observatory      may be    seen   in Bode's
 Ephemerides for 1804.
    Adjutant-commandant         Abancourt is employed, by order
 of the commander in chief, in constructing a map of Bavaria
 on the fame scale as the large map of France ; and he has
 sent us the foundation* of his labour. This map will connect

 Messrs. Bohnenberger and Amman.
     M. Delecoq is constructing one of Westphalia: that of
  the Netherlands, on the fame scale, has been finished : thus
  the example of the French has become fruitful, and even
 the English arc preparing to follow it.
     The Academy of Stockhoim has sent M. Svanberg to
 Tornea to examine the stations where the French academi
 cians carried on their operations in 1733, for measuring a
 degree   of  the meridian.       As this    degree    seems to be too
 large, some errors are supposed to have taken place ; and a
 design is in agitation for re-measuring it.            As sensible irre-r
 gularities have been found in the degrees of the meridian
 between    Dunkirk   and Barcelona,       it would not be surprising
 that there should be some at the 66th degree of latitude.
    The king of Denmark has established a board of longitude,
 pf which professor Bugge is director, with two assistants.
 This establishment was chieflv owing to M. Lowenhorn.
 Ephernerides for 1S03 are going to be calculated, which
 will contain the distance of the moon from the planets.
 M. Wurbierg      gives lectures   there on astronomy        ;  and pupils
 are now instructing,     in order to be sent to Iceland to form a
 map of that country.
, M. Von Zach, who every year, in autumn, makes a gco»
 graphical and astronomical tour through Germany, has de
 termined the position of Brunswick             to be 53° 15'     43"   and
 32 '37" east of Paris.
     At Zeil, in the duchy of Lunebourg, M. Von Ende, coun
 sellor of the supreme court of appeal at Hanover, who pos
 sesses a well furnistied     observatory,    has determined its posi
 tion to be 520 37' 47" and 30' 5".
    M. Olbers, at Bremen, has determined that city to be
 33° 4' 37" and 25' ^8".        He is more and more confirmed
 in opinion that the      place   of  the 7noon mav be determined
 within 5 or 6" by a       sextant   of 9  inches   as  well   as with the
 hell instruments.    Bremen, which is        a large free   hanfe-town,
 has enabled    M. Olbers, in     consequence      of his zeal,    to form
 pn association   of opulent     people   and    merchants, who have
                                                                established.

    At Lilienthal, M. Von Zach was astonished                  at the im
mense number        of inltruments in      the possession   of M. Schrœ-
ter.     One of his telescopes is 27 feet in length ; but he has
another of 13 feet, which is perhaps the best in the world ;
it produces effects that have astonished one of our ablest ob
servers.     M. Schrœter's gardener, who is a man of great
ingenuity,     casts specula,    and    polishes     them with wonderful
dexterity.      His telescopes of 7 feet will bear        to be compared
with    those  of Herschel.      He has established       a very extraor
dinary manufactory, where astronomers may be supplied with
a speculum of 4 feet focus, and a small plain speculum, at the
 price of 120 francs; and a speculum of 15 feet focus for
 700 francs.         This is not the tenth part of what was
 usually demanded for such articles at London and at Paris.
 M. Schrœter has made observations of Mercury, the rota
 tion of which        he believes    to be 2411.5'.        On this subject
 he intends publisliing hermographic               fragments.    In regard
 to astronomy, he has a privileged             fight;   he can distinguish
 Mercury in       the open day by the naked eye ; he has several
 times   seen   in his telescope small stars stiooting along like a
 delicate streak of very faint light, which lasted 2 or 3 "; this
 proves    that the hydrogen and oxygen of the atmosphere ex
 tend to the distance of several leagues : meteors or globes of
 fire, which excite astonishment when at the distance of a few
 hundred fathoms, become shooting stars when at the distance
 of a league, and telescopic stars at three or four leagues.
     Prince Adolphus, the tenth child of his Britannic majesty,
 aged 27, who is very studious and well informed, contributes
 towards the peculiar protection granted by his father to astro
 nomy in the electorate of Hanover; he paid a visit at the
  fame time as      M. Von Zach       to the observatory     of Lilienthal.
  M. Harding        has been    appointed assistant to       M. Schrœter,
  with   a salary from the king.
     M. Von      Zach every where found zeal for astronomy, and
  he every where contributed to increase it: details on this
  subject may be seen in the excellent journal whicty he pub

 Jifhes every month.        In this journal portraits of those abl*
 astronomers Delambre, Mechain, Burg, and Duc-Lachapelle,
 have been given,      together with an account of their labours.
 Those of Mechain are very considerable.
     M.  Bogdanich undertook also a similar tour, and on his
 jetum brought back a great many determinations.
     Our knowledge of the geography of distant countries has
been considerably enlarged by the voyages of Vancouver and
 Marchand round the world : that of the latter has been pub
 lished by Fleurieu in four volumes quarto. To these we may
 add Symes's embassy to Ava, Park's travels in Africa; those
of Brown, who was as far as Darfoor in the interior of Ne-
gritia ; those of Horncnian, to whom general Bonaparte pro
cured the means of penetrating thither, and who has already
sent home his journal ; and those of Damberger, who spent
 several years in Africa, which have been published atLeipsic
with a curious map of Africa by M. Goldbach : they are
now translating into French.          When I published my Memoir
on Africa in 1791, nothing was known of that immense
country.       By collecting    a few   facts  I  endeavoured  to excite
emulation      and   curiosity;   and  my wishes      are already  in a
great measure accomplished.
    Vail Ian t proposes to return to     Africa, where he has already
distinguished himself; and a        company of merchants at Mar
seilles have announced an establishment             on the eastern coast
of that country.
    Seventeen     charts of the coasts of South America          and   of
the gulph of Mexico have been publislied at the            Repository of
the Spanish Marine established in 1791. Nautical tables have
been published by Mendoza,          and memoirs respecting naviga
tion by Lopez Royo and Galiano.               Joseph de Spinosa, cap
tain in the royal navy and director of the repository, has done
every thing to render       himself useful;      and there is reason   to
hope for great things from his intelligence and zeal.
    We have received also an account of the voyage undertaken
to   the  straits  of Magellan in 1785 and 1786 by Don An
tonio de Cordoba, Don Dionifio Alcala Galiano, and Don
Alexander Belmonte, with a great many charts and observa
tions.

    M.   Rossel is employed in England in arranging the journal
of   his  voyage with d'Entrecarteaux, which he purposes to
publish.      M. Lagrandiere, another officer belonging to the
fame expedition, has also a journal ; and it is probable that
the British government, to whom it was communicated, made
use of it for the chart of New Holland lately published.
    C. Meignien, now at Madrid, has had the courage to
translate into French four Spanish works relating to naviga
tion, and has sent the manuscripts to the Repository of the
Marine     at  Pam.
    I  shall say nothing of the great number of new charts and
maps which have appeared in England and Germany : they
have been announced in the General Journal of Foreign Li
terature, edited by M. Loos, and published by Treuttel and
Wurtz at Paris. This journal is an immense repository of
books, which without ils aid would be unknown to us.
    The General Journal of French Literature, published by
the same booksellers, is also of importance on account of the
great care they take to omit nothing.       The first year contains
 1680 articles.
    We ought      to mention also the Literary Notices,    or spirit
of the foreign journals, printed for Kcenig at Paris and at
Strasburg, which contain interesting information in regard
to astronomy.
    We     have received   from Humboldt observations      made  in
 South America, to which he has been conducted          by the love
of   science.   His knowledge in astronomy, natural philosophy
and natural history, his zeal and his fortune, all equally con
tribute to render his travels interesting.
    The Memoirs respecting the Marine, by A. Thevenard,
vice-admiral, published in the month of November by Laur
 rens, in four volumes octavo, contain various articles on
geography, and one in particular on Cape Circumcision,
 which gave occasion to a discussion between me and the illus
 trious author, which was published in the. Cmnoijsance des

      The Englisli        have announced that a vessel, called the                  Lady
Nelson,        is about to      set   out on a voyage round the world for
the improvement of science.
   Nouet has sent us a table of the positions of 35 cities in
Egypt, as far as Syena, which he finds to be in 34° 8', though
,it   was long believed         to lie under, the tropic.
      We learn from           a   memoir transmitted               by   C. Corabceus,
engineer in Egypt, that the Egyptians, on two zodiacs found
at Henne in 25°, and at Dindara in 260 north latitude, had
indicated the solstice, first placed in the constellation of Virgo,
then in Leo, and approaching Cancer.
      C. Grobert, chief of the brigade of artillery, has published
a     description of the pyramids of Ghize and of the city of
Cairo:      it   contains an astronomical note                by   Burckhardt, who,
having        drawing, made
               seen   a             Denon, of the zodiac of
                                               by
Dindara, finds that the solstice had advanced 6o° further than
the place where            which supposes an antiquity of
                           it   now     is
                                         ;
4000 years.  By studying the surrounding figures, this posi
tion may be obtained with more accuracy.
      C. Fournier         has presented to the Institute                of Egypt   a    me
moir containing further details.
   The zodiac of Henne or Efma         much older   the
                                                    is                    ;        solstice
there     isthe constellation of Virgo, which supposes
               in                                                                  an an
tiquity of 7000 years. But the position of the solstice                            is   there
 indicated in         a    more vague manner, and              it   is   not impossible
 that there may be an uncertainty of some hundred years.
 This, however, still appears to give some degree of probability
 to the hypothesis           of Dupuis, mentioned in               the fourth volume
 of my Astronomy, who                   ascribes our zodiac to the climate                    of
 Egypt when the summer solstice was in the constellation of
 Capricorn 14 or 15,000 years before our æra; and who finds
 that the Indian zodiac, which Bailly caused to be engraved,
 goes back also 7000 years.
       The zodiac of Henne               was sound       by   general Dessaix,          Fou
  rier, and Costas, after the departure of Denon.    But Cora
  bceus fays in his letter that the zodiac indicates the sol i#e                         ft

General Menou announces a new journey, 150 leagues fur
ther.      We     are assured that there are other Egyptian antiqui
ties ; and the men            of   letters who go thither    will perhaps dis
cover a zodiac        of greater         antiquity than that of Henne.
     C. Corabœuf, when            that the large pyramid of
                                       he    says
Memphis declines 20 minutes to the north-west, adds, that
Picard found 18' deviation in the meridian of Tycho. As an
astronomer        I
              ought to add, that Picard was mistaken by
taking one tower of Elsineur for another, as M. Augustin
has shown in the twelfth volume of the old Memoirs of the
Academy of Sciences at Copenhagen.
  The voyage undertaken by the corvettes                        le Geographe    and
le Naturalijle, captains Baudin and Hamelin, stiows the at
tention of government to the sciences.  The plan was in agi
tation for several years.  Captain  Baudin, having brought
from America, four years ago, a large collection of plants
           when he made a voyage in la Belle Angelique
and insects,
with Le Dm, the Parisian naturalists were exceedingly de
sirous    that    he sliould undertake another, on a larger scale,
round the world, or, at least, to countries little known, which
might be more important and more productive.
     In   the    month of February he came to Paris to solicit in
savour    of this  enterprise : the astronomers united with the na
turalists to point out the advantages of                 it,   and they even pre
tended to the most important part   of the expedition. Geo
graphy has so many departments which demand our atten
tion, that we could not help seizing this opportunity of sup
plying some deficiencies in     and the French people, who
                                            it

are determined lo have                 a    navy, wisli to obtain certain data
in every    sea, and to be able to assist          navigators in every coun
try; This        is   a   great    and      an immense     labour;    a   few plants
and insects        more      is   the least important       part ofthe voyage.
Some persons were of opinion that                     it   ought to be deferred
till the conclusion of peace but the
                                   a             ;         first consul, who sees
no difficulties when grand objects are in view, was desirous
they should set out as soon as possible. At ten in the morn
ing, October the 19th, our navigators left Ha vre-de- Grace,
directing their course northwards, and at ten    the evening       in
     Vol. IX.                                P                                  had

delay of     an    hour,   occasioned    by a visit from the English*
There is every reason to think that they got clear of the
channel in two days. M. Belsin, who accompanied them till
two in the morning, was highly pleased with their unanimity >
their eagerness, and joy.            Captain Hamelin is loved and
esteemed by every body; in a word, the whole of the people
on board le Naturalijh seemed to form only one family.
   The Board of Longitude, in concert with the commis
sioners   of  the Institute,   chose   for this expedition two astro
nomers, Frederic dc Bissy, born at London May 10, 1768,
who had laboured in my observatory at the military school
from 1795 to 1798 ; and P. Francis Bemicr, born atRochellc
November        10, 1779, who, after being instructed at Mon-
tauban under Duc-Lachapellc, laboured for eight months-
with great success in my observatory at the College de France,.
and who has exercised himself in nautical astronomy with
great   assiduity.     He will     soon be accustomed    to observe    on
board ship     :  his zeal and intelligence give me the greatest
hopes respecting      him;    and   I have already seen  with   pleasure
an eulogy on him in the Journal de Paris.
   This young astronomer has not forgot the eare I took of
him : I learn so by reading in one of the journals, that,
during an entertainment given by the officers to the men of
science, when the Republic and the Navy had been drunk,
Bernier said, with a tender effusion of gratitude,           " To   those
who have guided us in the career of science."                This   toast,
worthy of his sensibility, was received            with satisfaction   by
all the guests.
    I  had    proposed   another astronomer,       C. Louis Ciccolini,
born at Macerata on the aad of November 1767, a knight
of Malta, who        had laboured with me two years, and several
of    whose    calculations    I  published in the Connolffance des
 Temps ;   but he was not      a Frenchman, and this reason seemed
decisive,   particularly at a time when the French were desirous
©f   mowing their zeal.         I in vain attempted to destroy this
prejudice.       In a word, I have seen with pleasure that all the
three   wrere  exceedingly desirous to undertake the voyage, not
withstanding the dangers of every kind with which it must
                                                                       be

be attended.       General Bougainville had the courage to send
on board     one of his sons, Hyacinth, born on the 26th of
December 1781, who is beginning, in an honourable man
ner, to tread     in  the steps   of his illustrious father.   We    ex
pected    that  Maingon       and  Quenot,     well known   as astrono
mers, would have had             a share  in  the expedition ; but the
former was prevented by indisposition, and the latter would
not depart without him.
    The naturalists      fay,  that the flax  of New Zealand will     be
sufficient to indemnify the state for the expense of this expe
dition ; and the astronomers will find themselves sufficiently
rewarded     by- some positions     to the south   of New Holland and
on the coasts of Africa. But a voyage of two or three years
cannot fail to furnish science with a number of new facts.
    A  most singular meteorological phænomenon is the hurri
cane   of  the 9th   of November, which ravaged the whole coun
 try from Brittany to Holland, and from Burgundy to Eng
 land ; it destroyed a great number of vessels in the Channel,
 but our navigators had got out of it long before that time.
    The loss I sustained in C. Bernier has been repaired by
 Michael Chabrol, born at Riom on the 18th of November
 1777. In the month of May he came to Paris to reinforce
 astronomy, which had need of his assistance.                He has al
 ready calculated a great many eclipses, positions of stars, and
 the longitudes, latitudes, and angles of position, of 600 of the
 principal stars, which form the fundamental catalogue in
 serted in the Connoijsance ties Temps, and which Le Francois-
  Lalande has further improved by observing the right ascension
  and declination of those which before were not fully known.
     Considering the scarcity of astronomers, we ought to ap
  plaud Lancelin, professor at Brest, who propagates nautical
  astronomy with wonderful zeal : he has formed pupils, who
  will be of the utmost utility to us when our marine stiall
  have acquired that activity which the French government
  intends, and is preparing, to give it.
     C. Henri      haS left Peteriburgh to return to France.         The

     On the 14th of July the fire-works at Dijon, on account
 of the   festival,  having been placed on the top of the observa-
 tory, occasioned a conflagration, which damaged the instru
 ments, and particularly the speculum of a Herschel's tele
 scope  ;  but professor Jacotot has      still  a  sufficiency to make
 useful observations.
    Montucla, who        died on the 19th of December 1799, after
 having published the History of the Mathematics up to 1700,
 in two volumes, had          prepared  a continuation of that work,
 comprehending the 18th century.               Three hundred page3 of
 the third volume were even printed; but the remainder of
 the copy was not finished, and especially that part which re
lates to mechanics and astronomy.             Defortia has taken upon
him    the optical part,     and  I have engaged      to revise the astro
 nomical, and to complete and publish the whole.                 I thought
this care due to one of my oldest friends, whom               I forced, as
I  may fay, to give this new edition.
    C. Montjoye has published an eulogy on the first president
Du Saron, who was an able astronomer. He has added some
interesting details, furnished by Messier and myself, and with
which I was unacquainted when I gave his eulogy in the
History of Astronomy for 1794, a year of crimes and mis
fortunes.
    On the 20th of June i8cp, we lost at Gottingen Abraham
Kastner, who was born at Leipsic on the 27th of Septem
ber 17 19. He was director of the observatory after the death
of Mayer      and Lichtenberg.        He  was as celebiated       as a ma
thematician      as a man of letters, and published several memoirs
on astronomy, both in German and Latin, in the Transac
tions of the Society of Gottingen.              Some details respecting
him may be found in Von Zach's Journal for July *. His
life has been printed at Leipsic in an university oration spoken
in the fiftieth year of his reception.

    On the 22d of April we lost at Thoulouse Jerome Hadan-
court, born in that city in 1748, who laboured for several
years with Darquier, as may be seen at the head of his ob
servations.     Four years ago he had been entrusted with the
observatory of Thoulouse, which Garipuy caused to be built
in 1775 ; but he could not make use of it for more than three
years.     The gout and other maladies conducted him to the
grave.     His eulogy may         be found     in the Magazine Ency-

    Hanna died     at Pekin    : he is the last, I believe, of the Chi
nese astronomers.        The     general of St. Lazarus, desirous to
fill up this department of the missionary establishment, placed
him under my          care to    study   astronomy    :   he was met near
Pekin by the English,        as  may be   seen   in the account    of Lord
Macartney's      embafly to China.
    Arnold, the      celebrated     watch-maker,        died   at London;

    The abbot of Cremsmunster, Erembertus, died in his abbey
on the 39th of March. The service he did to astronomy we
have mentioned in another place.              It was to him that Fixl-
muller dedicated in 1776 his work entitled Decennium AJlro-
nomicum.        Professor   Wolfgang Leuthner, his successor, shows
the fame       desire to support       astronomy in that abbey which
Fixlmuller     rendered     celebrated.

establish another at his country-seat near Moscow.                     He   pos
sessed knowledge and zeal, still very rare in Russia.                     1
    Such have been the losses sustained by astronomy ; but it
may be       seen   in this account that        we   have the pleasure         of
reckoning among our fellow-labourers some men of great
merit, and of having just reason to hope for further success. In
a word, astronomy, as we may fay, is now complete, since, if
we except comets, all the celestial bodies have been fubjedled
to calculation     j  and   it appears   at present    that we have little
more to desire.          But,   as Seneca fays,     there    will always      be
 something to do       :  Et   post mille  facula   nan deerit occqfio       ali-

 XIII.     Translation     of a Memoir on a new             Species    of Siren.
                         By  M. De Beauvois *.
 AMPHIBIOUS                  animals    properly so called, so dreadful
 and hideous to the vulgar, but so different to the eyes of the
 naturalist, to whom all the productions of nature arc equally
 interesting, offer us an infinite scope for discovery.                   Natu
  ralists, therefore, not stopped by the thoughtless repugnance of
  the vulgar to animals infinitely less dangerous than they sup
  pose, and considerably more useful than ignorance (which is
  continually asking, to what purpose are all these things?) can
  imagine j naturalists,       I  fay, have left us data respecting         these

beings, which, with time, must lead us to a more correct
knowledge of, and a more intimate acquaintance with, them.
The animal to be treated of in this memoir is a proof of what
I  advance.
    In examining Mr. Peale's collection, I had occasion to
remark amongst the amphibiæ one which I have not seen
described by any author.        It appeared to me entirely new,
and the more interesting as tending to determine our idea3
of  the inguana,     which has by some been classed amongst the
amphibiæ, by        others  with fish ; but which we find to be au
intermediate class connecting these two.
    After having examined, described, and drawn this new
 animal, Mr. Peak and I have thought proper to speak of it
to this Society before the publication of his catalogue, which
 will soon take place.
    Linnæus, the celebrated Linnæus, whom jealousy is some
 times pleased to criticise generally without cause ; Linnæus,
 whose    errors, always exaggerated by his detractors, are (let
 my admiration for the merits of this great man excuse the
 expression) for the greater part marked with a ray of genius j
 Linnæus, I fay, had formed a separate order of the inguana (A)
 discovered    in South Carolina       by Dr. Garden, since whose
 death other naturalists, amongst whom was Compser, (B) have
 made some new observations respecting it.             It was regarded
 by him, Bonnaterre, (B) and Gmelin, the last editor of the
 works of Linnæus, as a fish.           The latter naturalist conse
 quently suppressed the order of meantes ; and the Siren la-
 cerlina is now found placed amongst the muræna under the
  same of    Murana Siren.       Although this animal has much
  analogy to a fisti, being furnished with gills,     Gmelin has ob
  served that, in the formation of them, the inguana and mu
  ræna are distinguishable by the numbers of rays. He there
  fore supposes it should       be placed amongst the branchi-
  osiegæ, whatever relation it might otherwise have with the
  muræna.
     Such is the last opinion       respecting   the inguana, (C) of
  which    we  will  give a description  in  order  that we may com
  pare it with that of the new animal which is principally the
  -object of this memoir.

    Head flat at top, rounded at the nose, eyes small, nostrils
 small and placed near the end       of the. snout, which is some

    Tail flat, furnished on      the  top  with  a simple  membrane,
which .commences nearly at the neck, and extends itself
under the tail as far as the anus : fig. 3. H.
    Mr. Peale has preserved the latter animal alive in water
for nearly thirty-fix hours, at the end of which time it died.
He observed that as long as it lived it continued swimming,
making use of its feet and principally of its tail ; that the
lobes which terminate the gills were continually floating
and in motion ; either by a power of motion belonging to
them, or perhaps rather the effect of the motion which the
animal caused with its feet and tail, and which was commu
nicated to all parts of the body. He does not recollect whe
ther the opercula opened and closed as in fish ; but, judging
from the conformation of those parts, I am led to believe
 they do not.
     As long   as  the inguana only was known,          incertitude  re
 specting its nature might have placed it rather with fish, to
 which, it is true, it bears an affinity by an essential cha
 racter, gills, than with the amphibiæ, to which it seems to
 belong by all the other parts of its body. But now a new
 individual of the fame kind, furnished with four feet like
 lizards, seems to indicate that it cannot belong to fish.
     On this discovery three very important questions arise.            I
 do not flatter myself I shall be able to resolve them, but will
 endeavour    to discuss them, and give my opinion.
     Are these animals fish ? Do they belong to the amphibiæ ?
 Or do they form in the order of nature a new intermediate
  class ?
     If   we form    our   opinion of the animals we have been
 describing merely     from    their gills, there is not a doubt but
 that we must consider them as fish.             Messrs. Vicq D'Azir
 and    D'Aubenton       ascribe   the following   characters to fish    j
 That they are furnished with gills which give admittance to
  the air; that they have not lungs, viscera which are wanting
  in all oviparous animals, except birds and the amphibiæ.
  But if we judge from the entire conformation of all their
 parts, can we call those animals fish whose bodies, head, tails,
  and feet, are similar to those of lizards ? Can we fay with
  Gmelin, that the      feet  of  the inguana are but digitated pec.

 list              On the Cultivation    of the Vine,
 toral fins  ?  And, in describing the new animal upon         the same
 principles, shall we call its hind feet digitated abdominal fins?
 On the other side, shall we rank animals, whose gills are ex
 actly similar lo those of fish, with lizards?           No. I think
 that both these opinions would be equally improper; and it
 appears to me more natural to believe that these animals thus
 organised,     appertaining in a certain degree to each, should
 form an intermediate and well-marked class between lizards
 and fish.     And until more observations be made, and other
 discoveries of new individuals shall enable us to form this
 class, I think it would be best to revive the order of meantes
 established by Linnæus, and improperly suppressed by other
 naturalists.
     It remains to consider        whether these animals are      of the
 fame, or whether they form between themselves a distinct
 genus.     It is certain that in comparing them sensible differ
 ences may be observed ; but these differences appear only spe
 cific, and mould yield to the common character of having
 three exterior fringed lobes attached to three serrated interior
 rays, and feet.       I will call the first, then, with Linnæus,
 Siren lacertina, and the other Siren operculata.
 XIV. A        Treatise    on the Cultivation    of the Vine,   and th«
         Method      of making Wines.      By   C. Chaptal.
                          [Continued from Page 29.]
 EXPOSURE. —The                fame  climate,   the fame   cultivation,
 and the fame soil, often furnish wines of very different quali
ties.   We may daily fee some mountain, the summit of which
is entirely covered with vines, present in its different aspects
astonishing varieties in the wines they produce. Were we to
judge of places by comparing the nature of their productions,
we should be often induced to believe that every climate and
every kind     of soil has concurred to furnifli productions     which,
in fact,   are    only   the  natural fruit of the fame lands differ
ently exposed.
    This   difference     in the products,     arising from exposure
alone, may be observed in all the effects that depend on ve-

getation. Wood out down in a part of a forest looking to
wards the north, is far less combustible than that which
grows towards the south : odoriferous and savoury plants lose
their perfume and savour when reared in fat soil exposed to
the north.      Pliny had observed that the wood on the south
side  of the Appenines was of a better quality than that which
grew   in  any other exposure : and every body knows what the
effects of exposure are in regard to pulse and fruits.
    These phænomena, which are perceptible in regard to all
vegetable productions, are particularly so in regard to grapes.
A   vine turned towards the south produces fruit very different
from those which look towards the north.                    The  surface  of
the soil planted with vines, by being more or less inclined,
though with the fame exposure, presents also modifications
without end.        The summit,      the middle, and the bottom         of a
 hill  give productions      very different.         The   summit,    being
 uncovered, continually receives the impressions                   of every
 change and of every movement that takes place in the at
 mosphere ; the winds harass the vine in every direction ; a
 more constant and more direct impression is made on it by
 fogs ; the temperature       is more variable and cold.           All these
 circumstances united,      cause   the    grapes   there to  be less abun
 dant  ;  they come with more difficulty, and in a less complete
 manner, to maturity ; and the wine arising from them is of
 an inferior quality to that furnished by the fides of the hill,
 ••/hich by their position are slieltered        from the greater partof
 the fatal effects of these causes.         The bottom of the hill, on
 the other hand, presents very great inconveniences : the con
 stant coolness of the soil, no doubt, gives the vines great
 vigour; but the grapes are never so saccharine, nor have
  such an agreeable     flavour   as   those    which    grow towards the
  middle region : the air there being constantly charged with
  moisture, and the soil always impregnated with water, enlarge
  the grapes, and force the vegetation, to the detriment of the
  quality.
     The   most favourable exposure         for the vine is between the
  cast and the south.

       A    northern exposure has at all times been considered as
   the most fatal : the cold damp winds do not favour the ripen
   ing of the grapes ; they always remain harsh, sour, and desti
   tute   of   saccharine      principle  j  and the wine must participate in
   these bad qualities.
       A south exposure is also not very favourable : the earth,
   dried by the heat in the day-time, presents, towards evening,
   to the oblique rays of the fun (become almost parallel to the
   horizon)       but an arid soil destitute         of all moisture     ; the fun,
  which by its position               penetrates     then under the vine and
  darts its rays upon the grapes, which have no longer any
  shelter, dries and heats them, ripens them prematurely, and
  checks the vegetation before the period of fullness and ma
  turity has arrived.
       Nothing is more proper to enable us to judge of the effects
  of exposure than to observe what takes place in a vineyard,
  the ground of which is unequal, and interspersed here and
  there with a few trees : there all exposures seem to be united
  in   one spot; all the effects thence depending present                    them
  selves to the observer.             The   stems     of vine   sheltered   by the
  trees throw         out long slender twigs, which              bear little fruit,
  and lead to slow and imperfect maturity.                      The highest por
  tion of the vine is           in   general the barest ; vegetation there is
  less vigorous ; but the grapes are of a better quality than in
  low situations.            The    best grapes     are always found       in those
  places most exposed to the south               *.
      * The     general principles, in regard to the influence of exposure, admit
  of many exceptions : the famous vineyards of Epernai and Versenai, in the
  mountain of Rheims, are fully exposed to the north, in a latitude so northern
  for vines, that it is in those places where tht region of the vine suddenly
  terminates under that meridian.
      The    vineyards of Nuits and Beaune,       as well as the best of Bcaugenei
  and Blois, lie towards the east ; those        of Loire and Cher lie indiscrimi
  nately towards the north and south ;        the excellent hills of Seaumur fase
  the north; and the best        vines of Angers    arc  produced from vines which

                *nJ the   Method  of making Wines.                 125
    4. Seasons. — It   is well known that the nature       of the vine
varies according to the character     of the   season ; and its effects
 may be naturally deduced from the principles we have esta
 blished in speaking of the influence of climate, soil, and ex
 posure ; since we have     shown how to ascertain what effects
 moisture, cold, and heat, may have on the formation and
 quality of the grapes.     A cold and rainy season, indeed, in
 a country naturally hot and dry,      will produce on      the grapes
 the fame   effect as a northern climate     :  this state of the tem
 perature,  by bringing together these climates, assimilates and
 identifies all the productions of them.
    The vine is fond of warmth, and the grapes never come
 to perfection but in dry soil exposed to the rays of an ardent
 fun.    When a rainy year keeps the soil in a state of conti
 nual humidity, and maintains a moist, cold temperature in
 the atmosphere, the grapes will acquire neither flavour nor
 saccharine principles; and the wine they produce will be ne
 cessarily abundant,     weak, and insipid. These kinds of wine
 can be preserved with difficulty ; the small quantity of al
 cohol which they contain cannot secure them from decom
 position, and the large proportion of extractive matter in
 them determines movements which continually tend to
 change their nature. These wines turn oily, and sometimes
four; but    the small quantity of alcohol they contain prevents
 them from forming good vinegar : they all contain a great
 deal of malic acid, as we shall prove hereafter, and it is
  this acid which    gives  them their peculiar taste; an acidity
  which is not acetous,     and which forms a more prevailing
  character in wines in proportion as they are less spi'ritous.
     The influence of the seasons on the vine is so well known
  in all countries where vineyards are planted, that, long before
  the vintage, the nature of the wine may be predicted.               In
  general, when the season is cold, the wine is harsh, and has
  a bad taste ; when rainy, it is abundant, weak, and not at all
  spiritous: it is therefore destined for distillation, at least in
  the south of France, because it would be disagreeable to
  drink, and difficult to be preserved.
     The rains which come on when the vintage               approaches
  are always the most dangerous     : the grapes tb.en have neither
                                                                   time

126                 On the Cultivation as the Vine,
time nor sufficient        strength    to mature the juice    j and they
become silled with a very liquid fluid, which holds in solution
too small a quantity os sugar for the produce of the decom
position to be either strong or spiritoua.
   The rains which fall when the grapes are increasing in
size, are exceedingly favourable : they assist the organisation
of the vegetable, furnisli it with its principal nutrition, and,
if continued    heat facilitate the maturation,       the quality of the
grapes must be perfect.
    Winds are always prejudicial to the vine           :  they dry up the
branches, the grapes, and the foil ; and they produce, parti
cularly in strong foil, a hard compact crust, which impedes
the free   passage of the air and water, and by these means
maintains around the roots a putrid moisture which tends to
corrupt them. The farmers, therefore, carefully avoid plant'
ing vines in      situations     exposed   to wind :    they prefer calm
situations, well ssieltered, where the plants may be exposed
only to the benign influence of the luminary towards which
they are placed.
    Fogs are also exceedingly dangerous to the vine: they
are   destructive    to the blossoms,        and do essential hurt to
the grapes.       Besides     the putrid miasmata, which they too
often deposit     on the productions of the fields, they are al
ways attended with the inconvenience of moistening the sur
faces, and of forming on them a stratum of water, more sub
ject  to evaporation, as the interior        of the plant and the earth
are not moistened         in the fame proportion ; so that the rays
of the fun, falling upon this light stratum of moisture, caufc
it to evaporate in an instant; and the sensation of coolness,
determined by the act of evaporation, is succeeded by a heat
the more prejudicial as the transition is abrupt. It very often
 happens    that the clouds suspended in the atmosphere, by
concentrating the rays of the fun, direct them towards parts
 of the vines, by which means they are burnt. In the scorch
 ing climates of the         south   it is sometimes    observed that the
 natural heat of the         soil, strengthened    by the reverberation
 from certain rocks, or whitish kinds of soil, dries up the
 grapes exposed to them.
    Though    heat be necessary for ripening         the grapes,   giving
                                                                    them

them    a saccharine      taste and a good  flavour, it would be erro
neous to believe that its action alone can produce every effect
required.      It can be considered only as a mean necessary for
maturation, which supposes that the earth is sufficiently fur
nished with       the juices      that ought to supply the materials.
Heat is necessary ; but this heat must not be exercised on
¦dried earth, for in that case it burns rather than vivifies. The
good state    of vines,      and   the good quality of the  grapes, de
pend    then on a just proportion — a perfect equilibrium be
tween the water, which furnishes the aliment to the plant,
and the heat, that can alone facilitate its maturation.
   5. Culture.
                   —The vine grows naturally in Florida, Ame
rica, and almost every part of Peru. In the south of France,
even almost all the hedges abound with             wild vines ; but the
grapes they bear are always smaller, and, though they come
to maturity, they never acquire the exquisite taste of the
grapes that are cultivated.             The vine then is the work of
nature, but aTt changes its products by bringing the culture
of it   to perfection.         The difference which exists at present
between      the cultivated vine and that which grows wild, is
the fame     as that established by art between the vegetables of
our gardens       and those of the same kind which grow acci
dentally    in  the   fields.
    The culture of the vine, however, has its rules as well as
its boundaries.         The soil where it grows requires great care ;
it must be often dug up ; but it refuses the manure necessary
for other plantations.           It must here be remarked, that all
those causes which powerfully concur to give activity to the
vegetation of the vine, alter the quality of the grapes ; and
here, as in other delicate cafes, the culture ought to be di
 rected  in  such a manner that the plant may receive only poor
 nourishment       if   grapes   of  a good quality are required.    The
celebrated     Olivier    de Serres fays on this subject, that,   " by    a
 public decree, dunging is forbidden at Gaillac for fear of les
sening the reputation of the white wines, with which the
 people of that district supply their neighbours of Toulouse,
 Montauban,        Castres, and other places, and of thus depriv
ing   them    of   the   great profit thence arising, which forms the
 best part of their revenue."

Ii8                    On the Cultivation       of the, Vine,
     'There are some individuals, however, who,              in   order to have
a more abundant crop, dung their vines ; but they thus sa
crifice the quality to quantity.
   The dung most favourable to the vine is that of pigeons or
poultry ; dung fœtid or too putrid is carefully rejected, as it
Ikls been proved by observation that the wine often contracts
from it a very disagreeable taste. ;
     In   the ifles   of lihe   and Olerort the vines are dunged            with
sea- weed {Jucus); but the wine thence acquires a bad quality,
and retains the peculiar odour of that plant.   Chasseron has
observed, that the same plant decomposed into mould ma
nures the vine with advantage, and increases the quantity of
the wine without hurting the quality.     Experience has also
taught him  that the ashes of sea-weed form excellent manure
for the vine. This able agriculturist is of opinion that vege
table manure is not attended with the fame inconveniences
as animal manure ; but he thinks, and with justice, that the
former cannot be used with advantage except \vh/en employed
                                                                  '

     the state                                ,
   The method of cultivating vines on poles;w props ought
to be commanded by the climate.     This method belongs to
cold countries, where the vine has need of the whole heat of.
the fun, naturally weak.            By   raising them, therefore, on poles
placed perpendicular            to the ground,    the earth, being unco
vered, receives all the activity         of the rays, ;and the whole sur
face    of    the plant is completely exposed to their action.               An
other advantage of cultivating on props     that       is,
                                                    allows the    it
vines to be placed nearer to each other, and that the produce
ismultiplied on equal surfaces.   But in warmer climates the
earth requires to be sheltered from the excessive heat of the
fun   ;the grapes themselves have need of being protected
from its scorching rays, and to accomplish this view the vines
are suffered to creep on the ground    they then every where
                                                 ;

          a
eartb, and   great part of the grapes, from the direct action
                 a
of   the fun.     But when       the increase   of   the grapes has attained
to its maximum,          and nothing      is   necessary but to bring them
to maturity,         the cultivators collect in bundles the different
branches of        the vine, uncover the grapes,        and     by    these means
                                                                        facilitate

fame effect as is produced                   by propping; but recourse  had               is.
to this method only when                     the grapesare too abundant, or
when   the vines grow in foil too fat or humid.      In some
countries the vines are stripped of their leaves, which pro
duces nearly the              fame effect;         in others, the pedicle of the
grapes      is   twisted      to determine the maturity
                                                  checking the          by
 vegetation.  The antients, according to Pliny, prepared their
 sweet wines in this manner     Ut dulcia prætereajlerent, af-
                                              :
servabant uvas diutius in vile, pediculo intorto.
  The method of pruning the vines has also great influence             a
on the nature of the wine.    The greater the number of
                                                                                                '

but the worse    the quality of the wine.

     The    art    of cultivating        the vine, and the method                of planting
it,   have       a     powerful influence on the quality and                     quantity of
the wine.              To show the effect which cultivation has on the
vine,      it   will   be sufficient to observe what takes place in regard
to vines left to themselves;                 it   will   be found that the          foil,    soon
covered          with foreign plants,              acquires    firmness,      and    is     after
wards but imperfectly accessible to the air and to water. The
vine, being no longer pruned, sends forth weak shoots, and
produces grapes which decrease in size year after year, and
which       scarcely ever come to maturity.                      It    no longer that
                                                                       is

soil to     a    great distance.             The    grapes are no more that             well-

     We     mav therefore consider the good state                      of   the soil as the
work of nature           :    all the art consists           in stirring     it,    turning         it
up several times, and at favourable periods.                           By        these means

II. Of     the Time mojl    favourable     for   the Vintage,   and the
               Procejses employed during       that  Period.
    Olivier  de Serres observes,      with great justice, that if the
management       of  the vine  requires great skill and intelligence,
it is at the period of the vintage that these things are neces
sary, to obtain in perfection        and abundance the fruits which
Providence thence distributes to us. Every body allows that
the moment most favourable for the vintage is that when the
grapes come to maturity ; but this maturity can be known
only by the union of the following signs :
    1st, The green stalk of the grapes turns brown.
    ad, The grapes become pendulous.
    3d, The stones of the grapes lose their hardness          ; the pel
licle becomes thin and transparent,           as is observed by Olivier
de Serres.
    4th, The clusters     and    grapes can be easily detached     from
the twigs.
    5th, The juice of the grapes is savoury,          sweet, thick, and
viscid.
    6th, The stones of the grapes are free from any glutinous
substance,    according to the observation of Olivier de Serres.
    The fall of the leaves announces rather the return of winter
than the maturity of the grapes ; this sign, therefore, is con
sidered as very uncertain, as well as putridity, which a thou
sand causes may occasion, none of them sufficient to enable
us to deduce      from them       a  proof of maturity.      When the
frost,   however, makes       die   leaves  to fall,  the vintage ought
not to be longer deferred,           because the grapes are then sus
ceptible of no further maturity.             Their remaining on       the
 vine could tend only to promote putrefaction.
    *' In  1769, the grape.-, still green,"    saysRozier,   "were   sur
                                                                  prised

                     and the Method       of making Wines.                     13 1
prises by the frost on the 7 th, 8th, and 9th of October. They
gained  nothing more by remaining on the vines till the end
of   the month ; and the wine was acid and                   of   a bad colour.
   There are some qualities in wine which cannot be ob
tained but by suffering the grapes to dry on the twigs. Thus,
at Rivesaltes,       and    in the    islands    of Candia    and Cyprus,       the
grapes      are suffered     to remain exposed         to the winds          before
they are cut.         The          furnish tokay are dried j
                                 grapes which
and the fame process is employed for some of the sweet wines
of Italy. The wines of Arbois, and of Chateau-Chalons, in
Franche-Comte, are produced from grapes which are not
cut till towards the end of December ; at Condrieu, where
the white wine is celebrated, the grapes are not cut till near
the middle of November.      In Tourraine, and other places, a
kind of wine called vin de faille is made, by collecting the
grapes during dry weather, and when the fun is in full force                          5
they are spread out, so as not to touch each other, on hur
dles, which are exposed to the sun, and then sliut up when he
is set; the grapes which rot are carefully removed, and when
the whole are well dried, the juice is expressed and made to
ferment.
  Olivier de Serres fays, it has been proved by experience,
that the best period of the moon for collecting grapes in
order that they may keep, is her decrease rather than her
increase.'      He, however, allows, that when the                     grapes, are
ripe it is better to consult the weather than the moon; and
in this we perfectly agree with him.
   But then; are some climates where the grapes never come
to maturity:        such are almost all the northern parts             of France;
and       in that   cafe the grapes must be collected green, that they
may not be exposed to rot on the twigs.   A moist and rainy
autumn must increase the bad quality of the juice. All the
vineyards in the neighbourhood of Paris are in this situation ;
the vintage there          is,   of course, earlier than     in   the south, where
the grapes never            cease     to ripen though the heat          of   the sun
 continually        decreases.
   When the necessity of commencing the vintage has been
 ascertained,        a   great  many precautions must be taken before
it   is   begun.      In   general, the vintagers ought not to venture

13 a                  On the Cultivation      of the Vine,
to labour but when the soil and the grapes are dr}', and              until
the weather appears so settled as to give reason to believe that
their occupations will not be interrupted.               Olivier de Serres
recommends, not to collect the grapes till the fun has dis
persed     the    dew deposited on them by the coolness of the
nights   :   this   precept, though generally true, cannot be uni
versally applied ; for in Champagne the vintagers collect the
grapes before sunrise, and suspend their labours towards nine
in   the morning, unless the fogs occasion humidity throughout
the whole day : it is only by this care that they obtain white
and brisk wines.             It is well known in Champagne, that
twenty-     five   casks of   wine are obtained instead of twenty-four,
when the vintagers labour during the continuance of the dew;
and twenty-fix during the fog. This process is every where
useful when wines exceedingly white and brisk are required.
Except in the above cases the grapes ought not to be cut until
the fun has dispersed all the moisture from their surface.
    But some precautions are necessary to ascertain the period
most proper for the vintage, and some must be observed in
regard to the mode of operation.                  An intelligent agricul
turist will not commit the care of cutting the grapes to in
expert mercenaries         :   as this part of the labour is not the least
important,        we fliall here give a few observations on it.
    1st, A sufficient number of vintagers ought to be engaged
that the vat may be filled in one day : this is the only method
of obtaining an equal fermentation.
    2d,  Women on             the  spot should   be preferred ; and none
ought to be employed but those who have become expert in
 this kind of labour.
    3d, The labourers ought to be under the superintendance
 of a strict and intelligent overseer.
    4th, They ought to be prohibited from eating the grapes,
 both to prevent crusts of bread and other food from being
 mixed with the juice, and to preserve for the press the ripest
 and most saccharine           grapes.
    5th, The tails of the           grapes   ought to be cut very short,
 and the operation ought to be performed with a pair of good
 scissars.     In the Pays de Vaud the grapes are detached by
 means      of   the   nail, in Champagne        a pruning- knife   is em
                                                                   ployed :

                   and the Method    of making Wines.            133
employed     :  but the two last methods are attended       with the
inconveniency of shaking the stem.
    6th, No grapes ought to be cut but those sound and ripe :
those which are putrid ought to be rejected, and those still
green must be left on the twigs.
    In all   places    where the cultivators are desirous to obtain
wines of a good quality, the grapes are collected at two or
three different times.        In general, the first vat-full of juice
is always the best.           There are some countries, however,
where the grapes are almost collected without distinction,
and at one time; the juice is expressed without picking, but
the wines are very inferior to what they might be, if more
care were employed in the operations         of the vintage.         ,
    When the        grapes are to be picked, the following rules may
be observed      :  To cut only those clusters which     are best ex
 posed,   those    the grapes of which are equally      large and co
 loured ; to reject all those which have been sheltered, and
 near the ground ; and to prefer those which have ripened at
 the bottom of the vines.
    In  the vineyards which furnish the different kinds      of Bour-
 deaux wine, the grapes are carefully picked ; but the method
of picking     the red grapes differs from that employed for pick
ing the white       : in picking the white, neither the putrid nor
 the green grapes are collected ; in regard to the white, the
 putrid and the ripest are preferred, and the picking is not
 begun till a great many of the grapes have become putrid.
 This operation is so minute in certain districts, such as
 Sainte-Croix, Lousliac, &c. that the vintage there continues
 two months. In Medoc the operation of picking is performed
 twice for the red wines ; at Lagnon it is performed three or
 four times; for the white grapes at Sainte-Croix, five or
 six ; at Langoiran       from two to three ; and two in all the
  Graves.
     In some countries a vintage composed         of grapes perfectly
 ripe is dreaded.        The cultivators apprehend that the wine
 will  be too sweet, and they remedy this inconvenience by a
  mixture of large grapes less ripe.         In general, the wine is
 not brisk and pungent, but when grapes are employed which
                                                                 have

   134        Extraction of Qpium from Garden Lettuce.
  have not acquired perfect maturity. This is what is practised
  in Champagne and other places.
      In some countries where the grapes never come to absolute
  maturity, and consequently cannot develop that portion of
  saccharine principle necessary for the formation of alcohol,
  the cultivators proceed to the vintage before the appearance
  of the hoar-frosts; because the grapes still possess a sliarp
  principle,    which gives a peculiar quality to the wine. It is
  observed in all those places, that a degree more towards ma
  turity produces wines of very inferior quality.
      7. When      the  grapes    are    cut they ought to be put into
  baskets ; taking care not to employ any              of  too large a size,
  lest the   juice   should  be lost by the superincumbent weight.
  As it is   very difficult, however, to transport the grapes front
  the vineyard to the vat without altering them by pressure,
  and consequently without expressing more or less of the juice,
  baskets    ought not to be employed but to receive the grapes
   as they are cut ; and when full they ought to be emptied into
  boxes or scuttles,     that they may be more conveniently con
  veyed    to the vat.      They ought to be carried in carts, or on
   the backs of men, or of mules           :  which of these three means
   are to be employed must           be determined by local circum
   stances.   Carts are, no doubt, less expensive, though attended
   with this inconvenience, that the grapes may be injured by
   the repeated (hocks they experience : the motion of a horse
  is gentler, as well as more regular.               Scuttles are employed
   in all countries where the grapes are not very ripe, and where
   there is little danger of their being injured by the carriage.

    A HE       plant   which    has    hitherto    been  cultivated for the
   production     of opium is the papaver fomniferum, or white
  soppy, in the class of polyandria, and order monogynia, of
   Linnæus. It is an annual plant, from the heads or capsules
   of which this drug is obtained in Persia, Arabia, and other
                                                                      warm

spissated, forms the officinal opium.
   According      to  M.  Baume,   4 pounds of common opium

   It has been long known that lettuce possesses narcotic pro
perties ;  till lately, however, none had extracted from it a.
substance possessing all the properties    of opium.
   Dr. Coxe, of Philadelphia, has proved (American Philoso
phical Transactions, vol. iv.) that the inspissated milky juice
of the LatJuca fativa, or common cultivated lettuce of Lin
næus, is real opium, and, according to every appearance, of
a better quality than the eastern ; for the principal virtues of
this medicine are believed to reside in the extractive matter;
and, by comparative experiments, it was found that 10 grains
of extractive matter were taken up by two ounces of rain
water from 20 grains of lettuce opium ; while, from the fame
quantity of common opium, only nine grains were taken up
by an equal quantity of the fame water.
    The ten grains of the former which were left on the filter,
being assused with half an ounce of alcohol, and again filtered
on the tenth day after, left on the filter seven grains.        The
quantity of resinous matter, then, was three grains.
    The 11 grains left from the common opium, by a similar
treatment, were found also to contain three grains j the por
tion insoluble either in water or alcohol being eight grains.
    The resin, being afterwards precipitated from the alcohol
by the addition of water, that      of the lettuce appeared   whiter
 than the other.
    By trials made in the Pennsylvania hospital, and by expe
 riments made by Dr. Coxe upon himself, the lettuce-opium
 was found to possess all the properties of the common.
                                                                The

 136         Extraction    of Opium from Garden Lettuce.
   The milky juice from which the opium is prepared exists
in the stalk and in the leaves of the plant. It is not indiscri
minately deposited throughout, but is placed in appropriate
vessels running longitudinally         in the woody or fibrous part
of the stalk. The internal or medullary part of the plant is
soft, and perfectly bland to the taste ; abounding in a trans
parent mucilaginous juice, which has not the smallest ana
logy to the milky one above mentioned.               The best time for
collecting the milky juice is when the plants are beginning
to feed : before this it has not acquired its medical proper
ties, and at a later period the produce is by no means so
considerable.
   It is procured in the fame manner          as from the poppy, viz.
by incisions ; with this difference, that in the poppy they are
longitudinal, but in the lettuce they must be circular.               A
very moderate depth suffices.        It exudes freely in milky drops,
which may       be either immediately collected, or suffered to dry
on the stalk,       and then scraped    off and deposited    in proper
vessels.
   Some attempts were made to obtain it by pressure, but the
other juices of the plant seemed to alter it considerably.
   All   the species of lettuce contain opium in a larger or
smaller proportion.          The common lettuce, as has before
been observed, produced that made use of by Dr. Coxe; but
the lafiuca Jylvejlris or virofa of Linnæus contains it most
abundantly.        The former, however, sliould perhaps be pre
ferred : it will serve the double purpose of cultivating for the
table  as  well  as  for the druggist. The sale of the supernume
rary plants would probably more than repay the expense at
tending the cultivation of those intended for opium : indeed,
a number      of plants generally run     to feed and are lost, at pre
sent, which might,         and we hope in future will, be made to
turn lo good account.
   It is a curious circumstance, that while Dr. Coxe was
engaged     on this interesting business in America, Mr. Cart-
wright (to whom the world is indebted for the discovery of
the efficacy of yeast in curing putrid fevers) was engaged in
similar experiments in England.             The arrival of the fourth

however, anticipated his intention of making the fact public,
that as good opium may be obtained from lettuce as any that
is imported.

      interior Parts of Africa, from the Capt of Good Hope to

    A HE       kingdom of Haoussa         our traveller describes    as  the
 mbst beautiful country he had           seen since his departure     from
 ihe Cape. • On the cast it is bounded by the kingdom of
 Mophaty (Zanfara), on the north by Fomingo, on the west
 by Fecne, and the south by the kingdom of Sahara.                      The
 river Niger, which intersects a part of this country, renders
 it fruitful, and conduces greatly to facilitate its commercial
  intercourse ; for a great many small vessels go from Tambuk-
  too to Boosu, where the goods are unloaded and conveyed to
  the more distant parts of the country by caravans. The land
  is fruitful, and if well cultivated would be exceedingly pro
  ductive.       It abounds with animals of every kiud,         and is well
  supplied    with timber and various sorts of fruit : in       the moun
   tains are found salt and saltpetre, and in the forests honey and
   wax.     The greater part of the inhabitants wear long dresses
   of coloured cotton cloth fastened round their bodies, and in
   stead   of  shoes have    leather thongs tied crosswise over their
   feet  : on the head they generally wear a piece of cosoured
   cotton or woollen cloth.        The city of Haoussa       is one   of the
   largest in   Africa.    According to Dambcrger it        is half a day's
  journey     in  length  and  two  miles  in  breadth.
       During the course of his military expedition our traveller
   endeavoured       to secure the friendship of some Moors, and to
   obtain from them information respecting his future journey,
    as he had resolved to effect his escape the first favourable op
    portunity.      With this view,     and to make himself better ac
    quainted with the route,        he obtained permission        from the
    king to repair frequently       to the suburbs and neighbouring
    country ; but on these occasions he was always accompanied

 138                     Travels    through the
 by a Moor, who had orders from the king to watch his mo
 tions. Finding it difficult, therefore, to put his design in exe
 cution, he resolved to pursue another plan : he went no more
 abroad,   "but  remained at home, pretending to be sick.         The
 officer who had the care of the Moors having inquired, the
 second day after, what was the matter with him, he replied,
 that he apprehended being attacked by a fever.            When this
 ¦was told to the king, his majesty consulted one of the priests
 in what manner Damberger could             be cured ; and the priest,
 much to our traveller's satisfaction, replied, that it would be
 necessary for him to bathe several times a day.            In conse
 quence    of  this  prescription    he  was  ordered  by the  king to
 bathe in a small      lake   before    the city under the care of a
 Moor.     This   he did for eight days without any hope      of being
 able to effect his escape; but on the ninth day, after going
 out, he pretended to be exceedingly weak, and said he had
obtained leave on that account to remain abroad till the even
ing.    His attendant, believing that he spoke the truth, in
formed him that he would in the mean time go back to the
town,    and return for him in the evening.           Scarcely, how
ever, was the Moor out of fight, when our traveller set off as
fast as he could,      taking the road to the capital of Feene, at
which he arrived on the 20th of September, and where he
remained some months.
    This city is situated on a barren eminence, which in the
rainy season, that is to fay, in the months of June and July,
is so entirely surrounded with water that it is impossible to
walk from it the distance of half a mile.          Those whose busi
ness or occupations       render   it  necessary for them to proceed
further,   must    employ camels      or horses  ; but the water is so
deep that they are often in danger       of being drowned. The city,
which is well built according to      the African mode, is about two
milesin circumference. It containssour principal streets, which
cross each other, forming at the place of their intersection
a market   ;  where there are exposed for sale, not only the pro
ductions of Africa, but European articles, brought thither by
caravans, such as looking-glasses, buttons, needles, toys, &c.
which    are sold chiefly for money or       bullion. The castle lies
on the west, and is surrounded by a wall,          which on one fide

is connected        with the walls of the town.               These walls are con-*
structed       of common stones and flints ; but                  the houses,     which
are sometimes   two stories high, are                   built,    for the most part,
Of straw, leaves, timber, and clav.                     The town is divided into
two parts ; one, consisting of houses                   called Konko borrob         jam-
gala, or the hill of the free town,                      is inhabited by the mer
chants, priests, and magistrates ;                    the other part, called Iliny
dabo konko, the hill of the black land, received this appel
lation, in all probability, because the huts it contains, and
which      are inhabited     chiefly by Arabs and indigent Moors*
stand     in    a place   where the foil is a kind of black earth.
Besides eighty public temples                   and    mosques,     there arc here a
great many private temples   in the houses of the principal in-
labitants. Damberger     found  here what he had not seen for
a long time, viz. four public wells : each of them was walled
round in a neat manner with flints, and had a winding stair
that conducted down to the water.     They were not supplied
with  water   from  springs, but by the rain which fell in the
rainy season ; at other times water was conducted to them
by conduits from the Niger.     They were under the inspec
tion of persons appointed to take care of them, and who had
servants whose business was to open and (hut them ; for they
Were always kept shut during the night.                          According   to   Dam
berger,    the people here, in cafes of fire, do not employ water
to extinguisll      it,
                     but in its stead use sand.   The king resides
here only four months       in the year; the remaining part of                        it
he spends at      Sille, or  some other town, and sometimes also
                               in
in camp.         The Arabs employ themselves in agriculture, and
though the ground       covered with sand they obtain good

structed       of palm branches interwoven with                        each other, and
are covered in the fame manner as the huts.
   After leaving SiHe, our traveller set out with caravan,                      a
and pasting Muta, Saatata, and Sanoho, or the Gold Moun
tains, reached the confines of the kingdom of Nytokka.
Here the caTavan rested               a   day, and then crossing the Gatta
Mahara, or Desert of Lions, which                     fix days journey in
                                                           is-
length,       arrived among    people called the Seegmarlons, who
                                  a
reside   in    holes and caverns of the mountains.    These people
have neither king nor ruler, but live                   in a      state    of unrestrained
freedom, and form excellent soldiers,                      who, on the breaking
out of a war, are taken into pay                  by   some  of the neighbouring
nations.
   On      the 24th        of May      the caravan         ascended         a   Targe    chain
of mountains, and, continuing their journey through      sandy                       a
desert, arrived on the 1st of June at  village of the kingdom
                                                       a
of Watometh, where they halted. On the 5th of June they
ascended another chain of mountains, crosled the Sampi
river     by
         swimming, but were exposed to- great danger oiy
account of its being at that time nmeh swollen, and, pasting
some sandy plains, reached the boundaries of the kingdom of
Tamohata.              Here they      were    attacked
                                                                 by
                                                                 a        horde of Arabs>

boundaries of the large desert of Sahara,
   After this oar traveller fell             sick nsar     a     place called Eaysach,
and, being left behind            by   the caravan, remained*                   in   the next
village, under the care of         a      Jew, until    he recovered.                He then
proceeded on horseback, accompanied     some Moors, tœ            by
Tegorarin, where the Moors sold him to   slave-merchajit,          a

carried him, along with four young female slaves, to Omo-

    After living for        some time      with this master,   who, instead
of treating him        as a slave,     behaved    to him  with great kind
ness,    he was redeemed          by a private agent of the French Re
public,     and,    taking   his  passage on board a Dutch sliip bound

    by the Officers of the French Army.                 Read in the public
    Sitting of the National Institute on the ^tb of January . By
    C. Ameilhon.
   JL H E        valuable monument which contains these inscrip
 tions was found near Rosctta in Egypt *. Exact impressions
of them were taken from the stone itself by a particular pro
 cess, invented by         Marcel and Galland, the former director,
 and the latter      corrector,     of the national printing-office esta
 blished at Cairo : and these impressions were transmitted to
 the National Institute at Paris, who entrusted them to me
 that   I  might first examine the Greek inscription.               The first
 of  these inscriptions       is in  the  hterogryphical  or sacred charac->
 ters; the second         in the characters of the language of the
 country, that is to fay, the language spoken at that period by
 the vulgar in Egypt ; and the third in the Greek characters.
 The     last   informs    us that they all contain        one decree     ex
 pressed    in   three languages.
     It was no doubt to secure to this monument an unalterable
 existence that the authors           of the decree declared that it should
 be engraven on one          of those stones distinguished by their hard
 ness; which agrees with the report of general Dugua, who
 certifies that the stone is a granite.           This wise precaution has
 not, however, been attended with complete success : Time,
  which     devours every thing,          has corroded the stone in several
  places,     so  that none of the inscriptions are entire.

 14"                Inscriptions brought from Egypt
of which       is the most interesting, is mutilated in every part ;
and what remains of it is not above half what it ought to be.
    The inscription in the vulgar language of the country,-
which deserves also to engage         the  attention  of  learned   ori
entalists,' is the least effaced;
    The Greek inscription has suffered much more than the
preceding.        Of the fifty-four lines it contains, twenty-four
have been more or less altered : some of them have lost above
a fourth of their length, which disfigures the text so as to
render it sometimes altogether unintelligible.
   But, however defective this inscription maybe, we wils
venture to assert that there is nothing hazardous in what We
are going to fay respecting it.
   This inscription attests that it was a monument erected in
honour of Ptolemy Epiphanes, the son of Ptolemy Philo-
pater and Arfinoe.          Ptolemy Epiphanes was the fifth of the
fourteen sovereigns who reigned over Egypt after the death of
Alexander, from Ptolemy the son of Lagus, furnamed Soter,
or the saviour, to the famous Cleopatra. This monument
was erected in consequence of a decree issued by the autho
rity of the priests, who had assembled at Memphis from all
the districts of Egypt to celebrate the inauguration of the
new king, the son of Ptolemy-Epiphanes.              The name of the
Ptolemy     who    is  the object of the  infcriptron is scarcely ever
repeated in it without being accompanied with the epithets
always-living or immortal, the beloved son os the god Ptha
or Vulcan, the gnd Epiphanes, mojl gracious.                lie is there
compared      to  Vulcan, the great Hermes, Orus        the   son of IsiY
and Osiris.       His father, his grandfather, and the other Pto-
kmys his ancestors participate with him in the honours of
this pompous preamble ; after which comes the first part of
the decree.
   The     priests    explain there the motives on which it iy
founded. These motives, in general,- are the piety of the
prince towards the gods and his beneficence towards men.
The inscription        says that Ptolemy Epiphanes had given ter
the temples, and the priests who served in them, large dona
tions in money, and corn, and other largesses of every kind ;
that by the sorec of his arms he had restored tranquillity to
                                                                 Egypt;

                by the Officers of the French Army.             143
Egypt;      that he had afterwards endeavoured to repair the
 evils occasioned by war, and to make the people comfortable
 by remitting, either entirely or in part, the taxes that were
 due, or by diminishing the burthen of those which had been
established in the course of his reign.       The inscription adds
 that he had caused the prisons to be opened to those detained
in them, and had discharged a great number of accused per
sons who for a long time had been waiting for their sentence;
 that he had ordered that all the rents which constituted the do
 mains of the temples, and all those which under the reign of
his father Ptolemy Phjlopater had been raised annually, either
jn money or in kind, from the vineyards and gardens, for the
behoof of the gods, should continue to be punctually paid as
before;, and that the priests should not pay more for their
 personal taxes than what they had been accustomed to pay
.from the beginning of his father's reign.
    This inscription here calls to remembrance a particular
 fact, which is worthy of notice.        It informs us that there
 were manufactories of linen cloth denoted under the name
of byjjiis, depending on     the temples, and that a certain quan
 tity of this merchandise was collected every year for the use
of the navy and for the particular service of the prince ; that
 Ptolemy Epiphanes on a certain occasion remitted a part of
 fhjs tax, and that on another he suspended the levying of it-
 Thjs prince also established, in favour os the people and their
 religious worfhip, various ordinances, into the particulars of
 which    we cannot enter without transgressing the  limits allowed
 for this extract.
     In  the eighth year  of the reign of Ptolemy Epiphanes there
 was   a great inundation of the Nile. This prince caused dykes
 to  be constructed to confine the river to its bed, and to pre
 vent it from overflowing the plains, which it was accustomed
 to do almost every year.    The inscription speaks also of the siege
 and capture    of Lycopolis (the city of the wolves), which this
 prince carried by assault.      The inscription is here supported
 by history, from which we learn that Lycopolis actually re
 volted against Ptolemy Epiphanes, and that after entering it as a
 conqueror he treated the inhabitants with great severity. But
 is he punished with the utmost rigour the rebels who persisted
                                                                   in

144                  Inscriptions brought from Egypt
in their revolt,       he generously pardoned       those who returned to
their duty ; he was even desirous              that their property should
be restored to them.
   The ox Apis and, the ox Mnevis, the two chief deities of
the religion of the antient Egyptians, participated also in
these acts of pious liberality. " Carrying his foresight fur
ther than any       of his   predecessors,"     fays the inscription,
                                                                         "   he
                    funds for defraying the expense of their
assigned considerable
funerals and interment, for supporting their worship and
maintaining their temples. The gods therefore," continues
the inscription, " to reward these noble actions, conferred on
him health, strength, victory, and all those advantages which
can render a sovereign happy."
     The    priests then proceed            This second part
                                     to the decree.
of the inscription is unfortunately that which has suffered
most from the injury of time.      It may however be clearly
seen, beyond all manner of doubt, that it is there said that
all the temples which had been before constructed in honour
of Ptolemy Epiphanes,           and the other four Ptolemy^ his pre
decessors, were to be greatly enlarged             and   embellished ; that
in   each   of   these temples a statue should be erected        to Ptolemy
Epiphanes, to be called the statue of Ptolemy the defender of
Egypt ; that before it mould be placed the principal divinity
of the temple presenting to him the attributes or trophies of
'victory; that the priests         should perform        their service near
these images three times          a day ;     and that there should be de
posited in the sanctuary of the temples a small statue of the
new god inclosed in a small temple or stirine ; that the small
temple and statue should be carried like those of the other gods
during those grand solemnities, when it was customary to
take them from the temples to bear them in public proces
sion,      on which account these solemnities, were called Exntlia,
or issuing from the temples.
   Notwithstanding the ruin of this part of the inscription,
and the disorganisation of the text, which increases as we ad
 vance, we can discover   that it contains certain details re
specting the worship of the new deity.   Allusion is made                     in,
particular to  grand
                   a festival, which was  to commence at the,
neomenia of the month Thouth, and to continue five days,

                                                                        during

during which the priests were to appear with crowns on their
beads.
   In regard to the date of this curious monument, it may be
fixed, without much fear of being mistaken, at the year 186
before the Christian æra. Ptolemy Epiphanes, indeed, hav
ing died, according to the best chronologists, in the year 177^
before the common æra, it follows, that the inauguration of
his son, which took place nine years after, must be referred
to the year j 86.  But the inscription and inauguration of
Ptolemy Philqmetor, the son of Ptolemy Epiphanes, are of
the fame epoch as the inscription attests.
   We (hall not here attempt to supply what is wanting in
the text of the inscription.    This attempt would be useless
and rash; useless, because the second inscription, which is in
the antient language of the country, and the third, viz. the
Greek inscription, must reciprocally supply what has been
                 in the latter cafe it might happen that the
lost ; rash, since
restitutions made in the Greek inscription by that which pre
cedes   it,
          might formally contradict the supplementary addi
tions of the commentator.
  It must however be acknowledged, that       have not carried

                       a
doubtful when the words preserved necessarily suggested those
which had disappeared.      have not even abstained from
                                 I
making some conjectures respecting certain parts of the in
scription where the text was  much destroyed that the least

trace of did not remain.

   This first labour on the Greek inscription of Ptolemy Epi
 phanes may be of some utility to those who are to exercise
 their talents on the second, in order to proceed afterwards to
 the explanation of the first.  But     must he confessed that

the state of these three inscriptions, and that in particular of
the hieroglyphical characters, gives reason to think that great
difficulties must be overcome, and great efforts made, to ac
 complish the proposed end.

 XVIIT. Researches re/peeling the Laws ofAffinity. By C. Be<1-
       THOILET, Member of the National Institute, &fc.
 V^HEMISTS            have long been looking for Berthollet's work
 on this subject, which has at last made its appearance, and
contains much new and useful matter. A mere analysis of
 the work would be of little use to our readers; we shall there
fore present extracts of such parts as may tend to make
them acquainted with the nature of the facts on which he
 founds his theory, and which deserve the attention of every
chemist.
    Berthollet divides his memoir into fifteen articles.
    I. In  the first,  after  an eulogy on Bergman,       he states his
intention    to be,    "  to prove that elective affinities do not act
like absolute forces, by which one substance in a combina
tion would be displaced by another; but that, in all the com
positions and decompositions which are produced by elective
affinity, there is a distribution of the combined substance
among those which exercise contrary affinities ; and the pro
portions of this distribution are determined not only by the
energy of the affinity of these substances, but also by the
quantity with which they act; so that quantity can make up
for the force of affinity, in order to produce the same degree
of saturation.
    " If I  establish," adds the author,        " that the quantity of
a substance can make up for the force of its affinity, the re
sult  will  be, that    its action is in proportion to the quantity
necessary to produce a determinate degree of saturation.          I give
the name of mass to that quantity which js the measure            of the
capacity of   the saturation    of the different substances.   In com
paring, therefore, the affinities of substances, I shall pay at
tention to the ponderable quantities, which in this comparison
ought to be equal ; but in comparing their action, which is
composed     of their affinity and their proportion,         it is their
mass that ought to be considered."
   The author then announces, that in the following discus
sions  he will chiefly employ " acids and alkalies, (compre
hending among the latter those earths which have the fame
             9                                                 gction,)

                       On the Laws     of Affinity.                  147
action,) because they act with a force             so  great as to make
the influence of little causes disappear         ;   because they often
produce comparable degrees of saturation ; and because they
give results easy to be observed."            But the consequences
which Berthollet draws from their properties he applies to
all combinations ; and several examples are adduced to prove
that the principle which he establishes extends to every che
mical action'of bodies.
    After having proved, by direct experiments, that the che
mical action of bodies, the forces of which are contrary, de
pends not only on their affinity but also on their quantity,
the author announces,          that he mean? to select observations
respecting      the different kinds     of combinations,      which will
confirm       this  principle,  and    which   will   prove   its extent.
 " I    shall   then examine,"      fays he,
                                              "  the circumstances by
 which it is modified, or the affections       of  bodies which favour
 or  lessen   their chemical action, and which occasion          a variety
 of proportions in      the combinations     they    can  form.    I shall
 apply these considerations to complex affinities and to those
 of compound bodies ; and, in the last place, I shall endea
 vour to fix the basis on which the general and particular the
 ories of chemical phænomena depend.
 II.   Experiments which prove that in Elective Affinities the
     Subjlances ivbicb exercise opposite Affinities divide them-
    selves in that ivbicb is     tbe SubjeEl of the   Combination.
     To   demonstrate     the truth   of this principle, C. Berthollet
 describes several experiments, of which we shall mention the
 following: " I kept in a state of ebullition," says he, " in a
 small quantity of water, an equal weight of potash, purified
 by alcohol, and of sulphat of barytes.               The operalion \vas
  performed      in a retort, and, consequently, without the contact
 of the air : the mixture was reduced to a state of dryness, and
  the residuum being treated with alcohol, which dissolved the
  potash,    and after   that with water,    the latter effected a solu
  tion which still exhibited alkaline properties.         The alkali was
  saturated with acetous acid, after which there was formed,
  by evaporation, a pretty considerable quantity of small crys
  tal', which had all the characters of sulphat of potash ; so
                                     T%                                that

  J 48                    Researches refpefting
  that the fulphat of barytes was in part decomposed,              and thv
 sulphuric acid was divided between the two bases.
      "  The other experiments        were made, 1st,     with fulphat of
  potash and lime ; ad, oxalat        of lime and potash ; 3d, oxalai
  of lime   and    nitric  acid :  4th, phosphat of lime and potasti :
  5th, potash and carbonat of lime : 6th, soda and fulphat of
  potash.
      "  In  all these experiments the       bases, which    pass to    form
  with acids the strongest        and firmest combinations,        are seen
  in part eliminated by a         base
                                        to  which   a weaker affinity it
  escribed,  so that the acid is divided between two        bases.     Acids
  are  seen also  eliminated in part from their       base by others,     the
  affinity of which is considered as inferior,         so that the    base
                                                                            is
  divided between 1wo acids."
     The author    observes, that    "  if only  a small quantity     of the
 decomposing substance be employed, the effect will not be
 sensible;" and concludes, that " when a substance acts on
 a combination, that which is the subject of the combination
 divides itself between two other substances, not only according
 to the respective energy of their affinity, but also according to
 their quantity."
 III.   Observations     which confirm the Principle, that Chemical
                 Atlion is in the Ratio of the Mass.
     The author      makes   observations     on the different kinds of
 combinations exposed to elective affinity, and examines whe
 ther the principle, that chemical action is in the ratio of the
 mass, cannot be exactly applied to explain them.
     " If carbonat    of potash,"   says he,
                                               "  be treated  with lime,
 the whole    of the carbonic acid cannot be taken from the pot
 ash even   by performing successive operations with more lime ;
 and, if the liquid be evaporated, the residuum still effervesces
 when saturated with acids — because the potasli which re
 mains present with the lime opposes its action; and the
 more carbonic acid the lime has taken up, the more powerful
 the potash becomes to defend its own combination with the
 carbonic acid;" or, in other words, to resist decomposition.
     "  When an- equilibrium is established between the action
,of the lime and the resistance of the potasli, if the liquor be
                                                                   filtered

   filtered    and evaporated,       the alkaline    part, which • is super
  abundant to the constitution of the carbonat of potash, that
   is to fey, all the portion not defended by a sufficiently large
   mass    of carbonic acid, may be taken away by a weak affinity.
   Alcohol has this property : by its means a separation may
   be effected j the carbonat of potajh remains in solution in a
   little water, while the alcohol of the potajh is supernatant. The
   carbonat of potash which is separated might be treated also
   with lime, and by this second operation be reduced to a quan
   tity which might be neglected."
       C. Berthollet    quotes also other experiments respecting         che
   mical action being in the ratio of the mass.
       **
           If a carbonat with excess of potash be treated with al
   cohol,     a part only of its excess of potash is taken from it.
       "   The other neutral salts have also the property of retain
  ing a part of the potash when the latter is in excess.
       " It is known also that the phosphat of lime cannot be
   entirely decomposed         by the sulphuric acid, though the latter
  js ranked      as having a stronger affinity for lime than the phos
   phoric acid has.
       " The cafe is the fame when sulphat of alumine is decom
   posed by ammonia : the precipitate always contains sulphuric
    acid.
        " If magnesia      be precipitated from its sulphat by potash,
    the magnesia      retains also sulphuric acid ; for, when the mag
    nesia is urged by heat,       it has afterwards a pretty strong savour
   of sulphat.
       " All     these experiments prove that,         in chemical   analysis,
   chemists fall into an error when they take for the real weight,
   either of the alumine or of the magnesia which may be found
   in   the compound substance, that          of  the precipitate formed by
    an elective affinity.
        "  It  results   from the preceding observations,         and many
    others which       might be quoted, that in elective         affinity the
    subject    of the combination divides itself between two sub
    stances,    which   act on   it in  the ratio  of the forces which they
    may oppose to each other.
        " One circumstance which merits attention,                and  which
   particularly proves that chemical action depends as              much on

IV. Of the      Modifications      the Chemical Aclion which arise
                                            of
                from   the Insolubility   Subjlances. os
   The author successively examined the affections of bodie9
which may disguise or alter the modifications of the principle
established in the preceding articles. He proves, by  number                         a
of experiments,       The manner in which an insoluble sub
                          1    st,
stance acts when opposed to                    a   combination          :    ad,     If   a    sub
stance has any solubility, its action                   is   composed         of that of the
part dissolved and            of that which retains               its solidity   : 3d, That
ifan insoluble combination be attacked          liquid substance, by   a
the inconveniences of insolubility soon disappear, when                                        it   is
sufficient that the insoluble substance sliould lose   part of its               a
constituent principles to become liquid.
     The author then                 proceeds      to the examination              of the dif
ference    of    the specific gravity between the insoluble and                                 li
quid substance.    According to him,      has an influence onit
their respective action, even when agitation and heat are em
ployed, because    continually tends to separate the insoluble
                          it
substance, and to withdraw      from the force opposed to
                                              it                                                it   :
thus there      is  a     difference        in this   respect between the sulphat
of barvtcs and alumine.
   In the last place,   insolubility if                 prevents            the proportions
which      ought      to result            from the opposite            forces from being
established,    it      occasions          slowness   in   those       which can          be esta
blished   ;   and    may easily give rise to deception

pearances       which    produces at the commencement of an.
                              it
operation, such as when concentrated sulphuric acid                                   is   mixed
with solution of potash, or any other salt that requires
       a                                                 large                             a
portion of water to dissolve it: the acid immediately com
bines with the water, and the salt, which loses its liquidity,
is   precipitated    ;     but,       by   prolonging       the operation and mul
tiplying the contact, the salt dissolves,                         and      enters into com-^
 bination with the liquid.
                     V. Of           Cohesion and Crystallisation.
     The   cohesion of the moleculæ of                       a     body     is  owing to the
 reciprocal affinity of these moleculæ                  ;    it   is   a   force which must

                        the  Laws of Affinity.                       i$t
be surmounted       by the action of the substance that tends to
combine with these parts, or to decompose their combination-
 It  is well known that argil,         the parts of which, by  desicca
tion, have acquired a strong adhesion, is no longer attacked
by an acid which has the property of dissolving it when it is
 in another state.
    It  is this reciprocal      affinity, also, of the saline parts that
produces crystallisation, and the latter in chemical action has
effects which deserve attention.           On this subject the author
presents some considerations, as well as on the force produced
by crystallisation in a saline solution.
                                                 " It establishes," fays
he,    "  a boundary to the degree of the saturation with a salt
to which the water can attain ; so that, if it does not dissolve
a larger quantity, it is not because its affinity for it is satisfied,
but because it has no longer sufficient power to overcome the
resistance of the crystallisation."         From these and other con
siderations    Berthollet concludes, that the force of cohesion,
which      had been considered only as an obstacle to solution,
determines the quantities of the substances which can be
put in action in a liquid, and thereby modifies the conditions
of the chemical action       :  it is that  also which causes those   se
parations that take place either by crystallisation or precipita
tion, and which establishes the proportions of the combina
tions which are formed in separating from the liquid when
the property of being insoluble depends on these proportions.
VI. Of       the Elasticity    of  those  Substances  whi.h   exercise   a
                            Chemical Action.
    When a substance escapes in the form of gas, in proportion,
as it is disengaged from an intimate combination, the whole
portion which assumes the elastic state does not contribute to
the resistance    ; so that this substance no longer acts according
to its mass    : the  substance opposed to it may then render the
decomposition complete, and it will be sufficient to employ
the quantity which would have been necessary to form imme
diately the combination into which it ought to enter, or, at
Jeast, a small excess only will be required.            " This is what
Jiappens," fays Berthollet,
                                   "  in regard to carbonic acid when
it forms    a carbonat, and when another ac;d is opposed           to it :
                                                                      the

 1,5*                   On the Laws       of Affinity.
the latter, which acts according to its mass, even if it should:
have an affinity inferior         to that of the carbonic acid, may
successively expel it from the combination            until no more of it
remains, provided         it   be employed      in  a quantity somewhat
superior to that which would be necessary to form its com
bination immediately with the base.
    Tt results  from all the facts exhibited by the author, that
elasticity   produces effects analogous to those of the force of
cohesion, by modifying, in a contrary manner, the effects of
the affinity proper to each substance,
                   VII. Of       the Aaion of Caloric.
    Under this      head Berthollet examines the action             of caloric
on bodies, and        the phænomena it produces in the different
combinations or decompositions.               He also gives a great many
experiments on efflorescence and on solvents.
    What     the author understands         by efflorescence      is the pro
perty which a substance has of rising above the mass, and of
thereby separating itself from the chemical action.
    "  To make soda,"           says he,   "  to rife by efflorescence       it
must be combined with carbonic acid, which               it  is able to take-
up from the atmosphere ; but the action of carbonic acid,
furnished in very small quantity, and in an elastic state, can
not add sensibly to the force that produces the separation of
the   soda   from the combination           in which it     exists ;   it only
withdraws the eliminated portion, and prevents it from con
tinuing to act on the combination."
    In   regard to the employment of solvents, the author esta
blishes    as a principle, that the object is to overcome the resist
ance arising from the cohesion           of the parts required to be put
}n action,     or from   their   elasticity, and to multiply their na
 tural contact.              (
    Solvents act on the substances they dissolve, by their af
 finity and by their quantity, as do all the substances which
 tend to combine,       and every thing that belongs to combina-
 ation must be applied to them : the author, for an example,
 takes water, which is oftenest employed as a solvent.                    Ber
 thollet then examines those circumstances in which this action
 can sensibly change or modify the results.             This    leads  him to
                                                                       present

present a series   of experiments, according to which          he esta
blishes his theory;     and he concludes      with some observations
on caloric.     "   It acts,"   fays  the  author,   " on bodies    not
equally dilatable, in    a manner analogous to solvents, by com
bating    the  force of cohesion, and thereby putting the parts
in a state to exercise their reciprocal action.        Its action con
curs with that of the solvents to oppose the force of cohesion;
and hence it happens that the solution of a salt by water
varies according to the degrees of temperature.             When ca
loric acts on bodies unequally dilatable, it produces separa
tions and new combinations independently of the affinity
peculiar to these substances, in the fame manner            as solvents
when acting on bodies unequally soluble.
            XIX.    On   Air. Wedgwood's          Pyrometer.
  Ix S    the construction    and   use of this valuable instrument,
 the only one yet invented which can convey to the mind any
 accurate   ideas respecting     high degrees of heat, and enable us
 to compare them with each other and with lower degrees,               is
 very generally known,        a  long description of it would be su
 perfluous.     We stiall therefore briefly observe, that its indi
 cations are obtained from the property which all clays          possess,
 of shrinking or being diminished in bulk by exposure           to heat ;
 that, consequently, any piece fitted into a tapering gauge (for
 instance, a sector opened a little,) will, after exposure to a
 sufficient degree of heat, pass further into the gauge ; and
  that, the greater     the degree of heat it has experienced, the
  greater will be its diminution of volume, and the deeper will
  it go into the gauge.       Different divisions marked on the fide
  of  the gauge   will, of  course, give the comparative degrees of
  heat, to which pieces     of the fame clay, size, and form, may
  have been exposed.       Mr. Wedgwood's gauge consists of two
  rulers or flat pieces, a quarter of an inch thick and 24 inches
                                                                          '
  long, fixed upon a smooth flat plate, 5- ioths of an inch asun-
  der at one end and 3-ioihs at the other, so that they include
  between them a long converging canal or groove; and the
  rule which     forms one of the       sides of this groove is divided

 into inches and tenths.        The pyrometer       pieces  are made of
 a particular kind     of Cornish clay by        means  of moulds, and
 are pared afterwards, when dry, by a paring-gauge,             to insure
 their being all of one size as to length : a variation in the
 other dimensions is of no consequence, as it is by the length
 their shrinkage is to be afterwards measured.
    By  means  of   a similar gauge, but by employing the expan
sion   of a piece    of silver by heat,     Mr. Wedgwood       succeeded
in obtaining a knowledge of the intermediate degrees of heat
between that of boiling mercury and the zero of his own
scale ; from which he ascertained, that one degree of his was
equal to 1300    of Fahrenheit's scale, and that the zero of his
corresponded    to 1077^ F. Consequently, to accommodate
the results obtained by the pyrometer to Fahrenheit's scale,
all that is necessary is to multiply the pyrometric degrees
by 130, and to the product to add 1077-!-.
    It is pretty generally believed that the pyrometer pieces
which have of late been prepared, do not give the fame re
sults with those which were first made by Mr. Wedgwood ;
a circumstance which makes it extremely desirable that the
quantities and kinds of earth, necessary to form such rolls as
will always give correct results, should be accurately ascer
tained.
    From Mr. Wedgwood's own experiments, it appears that
the clay he made use of in the construction of his first pieces
consisted of two parts of pure siliceous earth to three of
argil *.
    C. Vauquelin, who has analysed Mr. Wedgwood's pyro
meter pieces f, states, that they contain 64'2 parts of pure
files, 25 parts of argil, 6 of lime, o-a oxyd of iron, 6~z of
water.    These quantities, consequently, with an addition of
water to convert the whole into a paste, should serve for
making    pyrometer pieces equal          in powers    to those  of Mr.
Wedgwood.
    Whether C. Vauquelin           analysed     new or old pieces, that
he obtained results so different from those        of Mr. Wedgwood       ;
whether he be aware           that there     is any difference  between

may arise from the force applied in filling the moulds in
which the pieces are formed, are points which we cannot
determine.
    However this may be, C. Gazeran, proceeding on the idea
of Vauquelin,     has been endeavouring, and with some success,
to make from the clays found in France (which contain from
30 to 40 per cent, of argil) pyrometric rolls applicable to
Wedgwood's scale *. He finds the white clays which con
tain the largest proportion of alumine to answer best. That

    Of this clay   he took 150 parts by weight, which he passed
through a fine sieve ; to this he added 63 parts of Fontaine-
bleau sand,     washed    and    well triturated,      and   200 parts  of
water.      This mixture, having        been     stirred  once a day for
three weeks, was kneaded, for the space of two hours, till the
paste was perfectly homogeneous.               It was now allowed to
dry in the air till it had lost 170 parts out of the 200 of water
which had been employed, and then moulded in cylinders
made of tinned iron and of a proper size.                   The paste was
pressed    in the moulds for two hours with the weight of a
 kilogram (two pounds three ounces).               The pieces were then
 dried in a stove for 24 hours in a heat of 122° of Fahrenheit,
 and afterwards adjusted to sit zero of Wedgwood's scale.
    Two of these agreeing in weight, within a centigram, with
 those of Wedgwood,         having been exposed with two of his to
 a strong heat in a close crucible for an hour and a half,
 Gazeran's indicated the temperature by one of his pieces
  1590 and by the other 1600, i. e. 159"- °.            Wedgwood's gave
  150"  and  160,  i. e. 1590,   which   is a  striking coincidence.
     C. Gazeran      observes    that   Mr. Wedgwood's pyrometers
 have    frequently varied 40, 6°, and 90 from each other,             (we

  wish he had mentioned whether all were                  taken from the
  same box,)       whereas   with    his own,     he fays,  the variations
  have only been from a        half to  a  whole degree, and they exhi
  bited no signs of vitrification when exposed to a heat able to
  fuse iron and destroy the best Hessian crucibles.
      From his experiments he infers, that, if a clay be employed
  which contains 34 per cent, of argil, and either rock crystal,
  triturated white sand, or pure filex be added to it to make up
  the proportion before noted, pyrometer pieces may at any
  time be formed equally refractory with those of Mr. Wedg
  wood, and whose power of contraction will be exactly the
  same as his.
      But why     should   natural clays be made use of at all for
  forming pyrometers, which must sometimes vary in the pro
  portions of their component parts, even when taken from dif
  ferent parts of the fame bed       ?
      If  there be any difference      between   the English pyrometers
  now     made     and  those first prepared      by Mr. Wedgwood, it
 most probably arises from some such cause; and the same
  difference may be expected to be found in beds of clay in
  France.     It  does not seem impossible that chemists every where
  might agree to employ the fame proportions of pure argil,
  filex, and water, in the formation of pyrometers. Even if the
  argil were not absolutely pure,        if they employed argil obtained
  always by the fame means (as from alum by ammonia, the
  alum having previously undergone several solutions, filtra-
  tions,    and crystallisations to free it from foreign matters),
  they would be sure to form pyrometers which would give
  similar results. Lime and iron ssiould be completely excluded,
  as  ingredients which must render           the pyrometers   less, refrac
  tory.
      If, in making      pyrometers     by such means as we have pro
  posed, such proportions could be fallen upon as would agree
  in the results with Mr. Wedgwood's first-made pyrometers,
  it would be      a great convenience to men of science,          as many
•
   facts have already been established by the indications they
   afforded.     If this cannot be done, one of the two following

wood's scale.    Or,
   2. The object in view might perhaps be more easily at
tained by accommodating the width of the two pieces of brass
in Wedgwood's scale to      the shrinkage   of the new pyrometers,
in such a manner, that      at the wide end, or zero, they mighf
remain as at present, and, by making them approach to or
recede from each other at the other end, receive the new
pieces at that part of  the gauge which shall indicate the proper
degree, obtained by comparing         the results of some experi
ments made      with them and some of Mr. Wedgwood's old
cylinders, which, though scarce, may still be had.
   We    shall make ourselves,     perhaps, better understood by
assuming supposed results to show the kind of alteration that
would be necessary to accommodate the indications of the
new pyrometers which we propose, to those which have been
determined by Mr. Wedgwood's.
   Expose one of each to a strong heat in a close crucible.
When withdrawn,        say Mr. Wedgwood's indicates ioo°,           and
that the other would reach 110°.          In this cafe the new      py
rometer would have shrunk more in the same degree of heat
than the old one ; and to make it stand at 100°, the true de
gree by Wedgwood's scale, (which we think ought by no
means to be altered,) all that would be necessary would be
to bring the fides of the gauge so much nearer to each other
at the narrow end of the groove as to make the new pyro
meter piece stop at the proper degree.           If these two pieces
were again exposed, together,      to a stronger degree     of  heat,  it
would    be found, that whatever degree Mr. Wedgwood's
 might  indicate in a gauge that had not been altered, the new
 pyrometer would also indicate in the one that had been
 accommodated    to  it after the former exposure to heat.
    If the new pieces      were  found to shrink    less  than the old
 ones, the gauge,   of  course, would require to be proportionally
 widened at the narrow end, to allow it to reach the degree
 indicated by  Mr. Wedgwood's pyrometer ;         and    in either case,

    Substances,      possesses not only Volume but         Gravity   ; being a
   Second      Essay     on   Caloric.    By   Alexander Tilloch.
    Read before the Afkejian Society November                 1800.
IN
our last
         the hasty essay read before this Society
              session
                       *   I "ventured    to call
                                                             in the course of
                                                    in question the truth of
certain commonly received doctrines respecting heat or ca
loric, mentioned          several facts which admit of conclusions
very different from those which have been drawn from them
to support       the doctrines       referred    to ;  and endeavoured       to
show that heat retains uniformly              the fame character, proper
ties, and mode         of action   ; in opposition to those who contend
that it is sometimes         sensible ox free, and at other times latent
or fixed.
    I also endeavoured         to prove that heat is a real distinct sub
stance, and not a mere quality or accident resulting from the
modification        of matter.       I showed, by many proofs, that it
possesses     volume, which         is a characteristic of matter; that,
when expelled          by chemical combinations, the volume of the
 compound         is less than the sum of that of the ingredients ;
 and that, probably,          the diminution        is exactly equal    to the
 volume of the heat that has been thrown out                    : that, on the
 other hand, when the compound is increased in volume, it
 has acquired, from the contiguous bodies, a portion of ca
 loric, probably, exactly equal in volume to that increase :
 and, to be brief,          that the general        laws enumerated in my
 former     essay,    and   which, I    believe,   are universally admitted,
 being sufficient to explain all the known phænomena, with
 out having recourse to the doctrine of latent, as diflin-

                                                                    '

guishod from free beat, the doctrine ought to be rejected, on
the received axiom, that no more causes should be admitted
in   physics    than what are true, and sufficient to account for
the phænomena.
    I also suggested the propriety      of philosophers turning their
attention to the determining the masses or volumes of heat
necessary to produce the various effects and changes which
that substance operates upon bodies, instead of contenting
themselves with speaking of degrees, to which they annex
no correct idea ; and expressed a hope that, at no very distant
period, this improvement might be expected in science.
    In venturing      to call in question the truth of the received
doctrines,      it was   not my intention to depreciate the disco
veries of a Black, a Crauford, a Lavoisier, or a Cavendish ;
men whose memories will be cherished, while the world en
dures, by every lover of science.           Their genius, their per
 severing    industry, their penetrating judgment,         first brought
 to view those luminous facts which must serve           as the basis   of
 all true theory respecting the subjects of which they treated ;
 and those facts will remain, whatever may be the fate of the
 ories already established, or of others that may supersede
 them.
    But as truths, once established, become a common property
 in science, those whose genius would never have discovered are
 not debarred the use of them.          It may also be observed, that
 the original discoverers of important facts have often, in draw
 ing their inferences and making their deductions, given an
 undue weight to considerations that were no other way con
 nected with the subject than by being unfortunately Jiumbled
 ever  in  some part    of  the journey,    in which they chanced to
 be out   of   the right road  ; for who, that first explores an un
 known region, can be expected           to get on without interrup
 tion or impediment ? Such accidents, however, have an un
 avoidable influence on the mind ; and to exempt any man
 from their consequences,        when they occur, would be to deny
  that he is human.
     Those who are not aware of the difficulties of this kind
 with which genius       has to encounter, can never rightly appre
 ciate the merits of     those who,   in  spite of their influence,   give
                                                                        an

ihe   greatest efforts      of human probity             to give them undisguised,
unwarped by            theory. This praise is            due to the men to whom
I have alluded : their labours, therefore, are invaluable, even
ifit should be proved that, in some few instances, they have
been mistaken in their inferences.
     It
      was my intention, in addition to the facts generally
mentioned in my former essay, to have brought forward, on
the present occasion, a number of further evidences of the
substantiality of heat ; but my state of health, since our last
session, has been such that I have not been able to go into a
wide field.           I
             shall, however, bring to the recollection of the
Society       well-known facts, which, according to my
               a few
view of them, serve to prove that heat is a substance fui
generis.
  Volume,      I frequently had occasion to notice in my
                      as
former essay, is a characteristic of matter ; but liquids, on
being mixed, are reduced in volume, without parting with
any thing except heat — therefore heat is matter.
  The fame effects take place when gases are presented to
any substances to which they can unite. ThuS, muriatic acid
gas easily combines with ice cold water ; but in doing so it
parts with its heat, which forms the greatest part of its vo
lume.          The     gas is in fact decomposed               :     one   of   its principles,
the muriatic acid, joins the water, and its other, the heat,
being thus separated from its former associate, then, accord
ing       to the general        law, first heats        the        substances      nearest          to
it,the acidulated water and the containing vessel, and after
wards passes off to surrounding objects till equilibrium                                            is
restored.             If   ice, instead          of water,         be   presented         to    this
gas,      it   will   be melted        by   it   as speedily       as   if   thrown into the
sire.
      If certain
              gases be united, this diminution of volume, this
pasting off of matter, (which, though in union in the ingre
dients, finds the capacity of the new compound for                                             it   so
different that     must diffuse itself,)
                           it                                  is,
                                             possible, still more  if
striking. When, for example, oxygen gas and nitrous gas,
in the proportions necessary to form nitrous acid, are pre
 sented to each other,               in     a    bell-glass, over water, what an
                                                                                 abridgement

                       rifpecllng Heat or Caloric.                                       l6t
abridgment 6f volume takes place ! It cannot be otherwise,
the capacity of the new compound for heat being so much
lessthan the sum of that of the ingredients; for the mole-
Culæ now respectively arrange themselves with each other in
such a manner, that they can afford                       but
                                                   quantity or    a small
lodging-room for the heat, compared with what it occupied
in the gases; and it is therefore forced, by the general law,
to diffuse itself among and through the contiguous bodies till
each is   with     each in equilibrium.                 But     each thereby receives
an increase .of volume, that is, ast increase of matter; and it
is extremely probable that, if we could get at the sum of
their increase, il would be found exactly equal to the differ
ence     between     the volume of the                   gases    before        mixture and
that of the acid produced.
   If any quantity of nitrous gas be joined to twice its bulk
of atmospheric air, we all know that the same effects take
place    as   in   the cafe just mentioned ; that                       is,   the substance
beat changes        its associates.
  We may observe here that, as heat passes freely through all
bodies, and tends to an equilibrium and as this equilibrium,
                                                        ;
when established in any system of bodies,   sometimes higher      is
than at others,   seems far from being correct to talk of heat
                     it
being then in ajlate           ofconfinement.
                                                         If
                                                    colder body be made
                                                    .         a
one of this system        it    will soon be seen that the heat, instead
of being latent in             the other bodies, finds itself                   free   to pass
from them into the colder body till      has received the por
                                                            it
tion suited to its capacity compared with that of the others.
   If there be any state in which heat less in state of con is              a
 finement than another,             it   is   when in equilibrium; and                   it
                                                                                         is

                         any means, been accumulated         indi                   in
vidual bodies, in greater proportion than,          their capacity,    by
compared  with   that of the surrounding  bodies, they ought to be
supplied with, that any thing like restraint can be considered as
 imposed   upon it. The impediments that retard its equal dif
 fusion, are, in fact, the only restraints    experiences and to

when in equilibrium it suffers no restraint whatever, for then
every individual substance has its own proper quantity of the
common stock.
     I shall now examine for a little several facts          which   appear
to prove,       if duly weighed     and applied,    that heat possesses an
other characteristic of matter,             I mean    gravity. If this
fact can be established,          we shall have another strong proof      of
the substantiality of heat ; and the facts I mean to bring to
your recollection are, I think, sufficient to establisti it as a
truth — a truth which has been forcing itself on the notice of
men, for many centuries, with much stronger evidence than
many others which have received general admission, though
it has not only been overlooked, but many experiments have
been brought forward to establish the opposite.
    Heat poured into         bodies lessens   their specific gravity; and
yet heat may not be weighed, even comparatively ! ! There
appears to me to be something so extremely repugnant to
reason in this assertion, that ever since           I have dared to reason
for myself         I  have  found myself forced to refuse my assent
to it.       If heat lessens the specific gravity of bodies, (and we
can even determine, in many cafes, the ratio in which this
lakes place,) I think we are then weighing the heat itself,
or, rather, the difference of the quantity in a body at one tem
perature       and at another.
    In    the various direct attempts           that have been    made    to
weigh        heat,   I  fear philosophers have been following        a plan
just about as rational         as it would be in the inhabitants of the
ocean to attempt to weigh water by employing a balance
suspended in the medium that surrounds them, and putting
into one (hell         a substance   that to them should    seem  wet, and
into the other a substance which they might call dry !
     If we could abstract heat entirely from a body, as we can
air from a glass balloon, we should be at no loss in weighing
it :   but is there      no other way of weighing air but that one ?
If    I take a bladder containing an unknown quantity of air,
 I easily find out how much weight is required to sink it in
water     :   if I afterwards pour into the bladder       a known bulk of
 air,   I   can come at a knowledge          of  the  weight of the air so
 added by attending to the quantity of weight now necessary

water being known.   But if I weigh, in water, any substance
containing an unknown quantity of heat, and find that, upon
adding a known bulk of heat to the body, it will then require
a less weight to make                   it fink,     I   am to draw no inference re
specting the weight                of    the caloric that has been added                   ! !    Is
this reasonable              Should philosophers stop short in this man
                             ?
ner, and not seize upon             the truth which such effects exhibit
to them          ?    Is it not obvious, in all experiments which have
for their object the determining the specific gravity of any
body in different temperatures, that thev are doing nothing
but weighing comparative quantities of heat, by observing
how much water is displaced by those quantities ?
  Though I think the truth I have just fiated is self-evident,
I   hope     I        not be thought tiresome if I endeavour to
                     shall                                                                        set
it in   a   clear point of view by an illustration.
    If I    suspend a piece             of metal in water            at one- end      of    a ba
lance, and            if   to this metal      I join      a small    bit of any substance
lighter than water,                 say a    bit of cork, will not the mass, by
having its absolute gravity increased, have become specifically
lighter? I am now considering the metal and cork as one
compound body.      In this cafe no one hesitates in admitting
that the addition of the cork, though possessing absolute gra
vity, is the cause of the compound body appearing lighter
when weighed in water; a medium more rare than one of
the ingredients, but denser than the other : but if beat injlead
of cork bad been added to the metal, would not the effect have
been    tbe same, an               increase     of volume           and   a   diminution           of
       gravity ? And for the same reason too, the metal
specific
being heavier but the heat lighter than water.
  Let us reverse the case. —A compound body, iron and
cork, possefles a certain specific gravity.   Remove the cork,
that       is,
         take away from the mass          portion of its absolute
                                                             a
bulk and weight, and on weighing what remains              found                 it   is
to be increased in weight — rin water.
    Yet,    if
            I         detach from        a   piece   of gold,    silver, plntina, copper,
a certain quantity of heat,                    by
                             mechanical means, and thereby
reduce its volume,    am not to conclude, though
                                  I                 find its                       1
specific         gravity increased,          that the matter expressed                possessed
                                               X     2                                absolute

  Is this consistent with sound physical principles ? I think not                                            :
  for the fame effects should always be ascribed to one cause.
     It is admitted on all hands that cast metals, that metals                                    is,
   n their       natural volume, are specifically lighter than
                   largest

        The   fact   is, I   suspect, universally true, that where the spe
cific gravity of            a     body        is    diminished,          its absolute gravity               is
and must be increased                  j      and these terms ought always to be
                                                                                             considered

considered  as convertible. When a diminution of the specific
gravity is declared, an increase of the absolute gravity is by
the fame enunciation asserted, whether the speaker means to
do so or not.            Now, in      the cafe before             stated, the diminu
tion of the specific gravity is admitted ;                      and therefore    a ques
tion naturally presents itself — Why has                        the increase    of   abso
lute weight not been hitherto observed ? I take the reason to
be this: they attempted to determine it in the air; overlook
ing this plain fact, namely, that air may                               be considered      as
bearing the fame relation to heat that water does to gold, or
rather, to a substance many times heavier, if such could be
found ; that           is,
                  the air, though rarer substance than the
                                                     a
solid    bodies     weighed in        it,   is   a   denser     one than heat     ;     and
they have          been
                  demanding,                     that
                                                 specifically
                                                          a     substance
lighter than air should descend in it. In other words that                        :
the laws of nature should be inverted, and that the heavier
fluid, air, should ascend to make room for                        a   lighter one, heat,
to descend.
   But Nature will not bend                 to our whims and fancies.                   We
must court her, and take her                 as (he       is,   or remain in error.
The heated body, though                  increased     in size, remains in equi
librium in the balance;               and      it    ought to do so (if not to
                                            is by
Udcend),         being buoyed up  greater quantity of air than
                                                 a
before      it    was heated. Butthis  the only cafe in which
that effect takes place, and where we know at the fame time
that not only volume but real substance      added to one end    is

bodies can be made specifically lighter    heavier at plea      and

 heat is material.        But, when I consider the rapid advances
 that have been        made in various branches of science within
 these few years past,       I cannot allow myself to believe that its
 votaries will much longer doubt of the existence of the most
 powerful and most generally diffused substance in nature, or
 long remain of the opinion, " that all attempts to discover
 any effeel     of  beat upon the apparent    weight  of bodies will   be
fruitless."
      The ingenious philosopher (Count Rumsord)           whose words
 I have    just quoted, and to whom every inquirer into Nature
 must feel himself highly indebted for the unwearied patience
  with which he has watched and traced her steps in many of her
 most intricate operations, and for the zeal which he has ma
  nifested in applying scientific truths lo the common purposes
  of life, will   be among the first to abandon the opinion ; for,
 when he (hall have better considered the subject, he will find
  the evidence      lies wholly on the other fide.      If the opinions
  I   have controverted were held only        by men, like him, en
 lightened and candid, I should be sanguine enough to believe
  that what I have advanced would suffice to convince all of
  their absurdity without the necessity of saying a word more
  on the subject : but we know well how difficult it is for the
  human mind to shake off imbibed prejudices, especially when
  they have been theorised, and applied, like the salt, sulphur,
  and mercury, of the alchemists, and the phlogiston of the
  Stahlians, to explain all the phænomena of nature ; and
  therefore I cannot promise myself, that the mere treaders in
  trammels       and   day-labourers in science will adopt my ideas
  without something more level to their capacity being first
  offered in addition to the evidence already produced.           Indeed
   it would be unreasonable to expect that men of the cast to
  which I now allude should at one glance perceive the force
  of truth when         presented to their view.   If they  ever appre
   hend truth,     it is when it chances to be a part of the system
   they have been taught ; and that system, however false, they
   always adhere to, till every person of superior intellect has
   abandoned it.
       With   a  Society, however, instituted for purposes like ours,
    truth   will  meet with a proper reception.         Those who are
                                                               associated

facts, will ever lend a ready hand to separate the sine from the
dross ; and, I doubt not, will by their labours give form and
solidity lo the structure for which      I have   humbly endeavoured
to collect a few materials.
     I intended, before concluding these remarks, to offer a few
experiments for the consideration of the Society, which, if
properly conducted, would,         I persuade myself, furnish direct
evidence of the gravitating power or property belonging to
heat in common with other kinds of matter : I consider the
point as established by the arguments already advanced, but
 I  mean to fay, that, by certain experiments, (if I have been
 under no mistake in the reasoning that led me to frame them)
its absolute weight, in certain specific cases, may, I think, be
 ascertained; but having run the present essay to a greater
 length, and encroached further upon the time of the Society
 than was perhaps proper, I shall reserve them for a supple
 ment, which       I  may offer hereafter, or perhaps make them
 the subject of a future essay.

 vessel with a thick cloth, and set it in a place of moderate
  warmth, leaving it to rest for twenty-sour hours ; at the end
 of which the milk will have become four, and a thick sub
  stance gathered at top : then with a stick, made at the lower
 end in the manner of a churn staff, beat it till the thick sub
  stance above mentioned be blended intimately            with  the sub
 jacent fluid : let it rest twenty-four hours in a high narrow
  vessel like a churn.    The agitation must be repeated as before,

 il     CASE       of chylous dropsy (if I may use the expression)
 lately occurred in my practice, which I judge to be rather an
uncommon one ; at least it is new to me, and my memory
does not serve me with a similar instance on record brought
 to a favourable termination.
     In December 1799, T. L. of South-River, applied to me
 for worm medicines for         a boy twelve       years old, described
 to have an enlarged abdomen, and very insatiable appetite.
 Calomel, pink-root, &c. were administered and repeated
 without any beneficial effect. On visiting the lad afterwards,
 it appeared evident that his abdomen contained a large quan
 tity of some fluid, so much as to prevent a recumbent posture
 altogether.      He laboured under none of the other symptoms
 of dropsy, such as cedematous swellings, or much relaxation
 of the solids : he only appeared somewhat leaner than usual.
     The patient was brought to town, a few days after, and
 tapped.      On withdrawing the stilette, you may judge our
 surprise   to find a most      pure, white, and fragrant chyle, or
  milk, to follow, which continued to flow until we obtained
  between    seven and eight quarts.      This chyle had rather more
  of a chalky-white colour than cow's milk. It was perfectly
  sweet and     pleasant   both to the smell       and taste ; and, after
  standing through the night, afforded          a good cream, though

  hot quite so much as is usually obtained from the same quan
  tity of cow's milk.
       After   the operation, the boy was restored to his usual feel
  ings, and, in fact, seemed to have no complaint, save a con
  stant craving for food.          He was taken home three days after,
  and I heard no more of him for fourteen days, when I was
  requested       to visit him in the country.          I found him, in all
   respects, as before,      save a greater degree    of emaciation ; and,
   by repeating       the operation j    I obtained   a fluid of the same
   kind, and nearly the same quantity, as before.                 From this
   time until the aoth of March I heard nothing of my patient:
   as his friends had determined to yield him to his fate,               pro
   vided     the   last attempt    should   prove  unsuccessful,    I had, in
.  my imagination, numbered him with the dead.                   Having   oc
   casion to visit the neighbourhood at this time,             I  was agree
   ably disappointed        in finding him in perfect health, without
    any intumescence        of the abdomen, and with an appetite re
   duced to due moderation.
        It  is evident, from the circumstances of the above com
    plaint,    that some of the larger chyliferous vessels were either
    eroded or ruptured ; and the emaciation which was taking
    place, and the short spare of time which had elapsed between
    the operations, induced me to conclude the cure beyond the
    bounds of our art.         I  therefore contented     myself with order
    ing a few doses of calomel and laudanum, with a view to
    excite absorption ; but more with a view to satisfy the minds
    of those concerned, than from a prospect of any permanent
    Utility. I advised an adherence to solid rather than fluid foodj
    and, being requested, permitted a moderate use of Geneva.
        On inquiry, I learned that no medicine of any kind had
    been given after the day         of the second operation ; and, by the
     positive    order  of the  mistress   of the family, the patient was
     entirely, restrained from the use of every fluid, except gin,
     and confined to bread toasted brown, and fresh meats, boiled
     or roasted, without pepper or salt.             This regimen was en
     forced, without       the   least  relaxation, for the first ten days.
     For the two succeeding weeks, a small portion of water was
     sometimes added to the gin, but never to exceed it in quan
     tity. After which period, perceiving no tendency to the former
         V01. IX.                          Y                       complaint,

complaint,          the boy was permitted           to return gradually to his
usual modeof living,           and has since continued in good health.
During the time of            the above regimen, he was two or three
times fairly intoxicated, and that too by design.
   You will,        doubtless,     esteem the above mode           of treatment
such as would hardly have                 been    ventured     on by   a    judicious
practitioner ; and yet to           it,  I   am inclined to      think,       the boy
owes his life.
   From       the    nature   of    the food      and drink,     the quantity      of
chyle generated           must have been much less than usual.                 And,,
admitting that proportion of was discharged into the cavity
                      a                    it
of the abdomen, we may suppose this to have been taken up
by the increased action of the absorbent vessels of that cavity,
excited into more than ordinary energy                    by
                                            the stimulus of the
gin.   The diseased vessel or vessels being less distended than
heretofore, would, of course, be more disposed to heal.

               FRENCH NATIONAL INSTITUTE.
    The following account of the labours of the Mathematical
 and Physical Class of the Sciences during the last three months
 has been read.
    Chemistry.   — C. Berlhollet    has proved that the propagation
-of  the chemical      action is lessened,      1st, by the weakness of
 that action   :   2dly, by constitutional changes to which the
 substances that exercise it are subject.        He has established the
 limits of the chemical knowledge hitherto acquired in regard
 to vegetable physiology.       He has shown also that motion ac
 celerates the communication       of  heat, by bringing nearer those
 parts which are at a distant temperature            ;  so  that their reci
 procal action becomes thereby more lively and instantaneous;
 but that it ought not thence to be concluded that liquids and
 elastic fluids are incapable of transmitting heat.
    Guyton is employed       on the means      of purifying the air and
 checking the progress      of contagion.         He has carefully exa
 mined all the methods hitherto            followed for this purpose,
 and even his own,       and determined those which ought to in
 spire the greatest confidence.        He  has read also a memoir on
 the preparation of mortar, lime, and different kinds of pozzo-
 lano, in which he compares the nature of these substances,
 and gives the result of experiments, made on a large scale,
 even under the water of the sea, with some matters which he
 proposes to substitute in the room       of  the pozzolano       of Italy.
    Experimental Philosophy. — Halle         has given an account of
 experiments respecting galvanism,           either    repeated or made
 for the first time at the School of Medicine by means of
 Volta's apparatus.       The  general result     of   them    is a proof   of
 the identity    of the galvanic principle and electricity.
    Meteorology. — Testier has presented a series of questions
 to be proposed to the constituted authorities and the corre
 spondents of the Institute in the departments, in order to
 obtain from them every information necessary to make known
 the extent of the effects oi the storm which took place in the
 month of November.
    Lamarck has endeavoured          to fix the nomenclature          of cer
tain    meteors.     According    to   his opinion,        hurricanes    and
                                  Y    %                              squalls

174                French National Institute — Botany.
squalls      take   place   only under certain clouds, which con
ceal the cause os them : they traverse a hand of the atmo
sphere in a straight line, and in the direction of the wind by
which they are impelled ; produce only transient effects, and
either do not make the barometer fall, or make it fall very
little.      Storms, on the other hand, extend their effects to a
distance ; continue at least ten or twelve hours, and may even
prolong their duration to thirty-fix : they do not come on of
a sudden, and make the barometer fall.                 According to these
observations,        the violent winds in November last were the
result    of   a real storm, and    not of  a hurricane.
    Botany. —Ventenat, in             a memoir on the plants called
arum, has shown, that several of those which the botanists
have hitherto referred          to that class are so different as to au
thorise       their being formed into a particular genus, the cha
racters       of which Ventenat determines, and which he calls
caladium.
    Beauvois has presented several drawings of plants growing
in the country of            Ovvare and Benin, a Flora of which he
 intends soon to publish.           He has given a particular descrip
 tion of a new genus of the family of the cucurbita, which
 he calls myrianthus ; the only one of that family which is a
 tree properly so called.           It   might   he distinguished   by the
 name of the melon-tree.
     Ramond has discovered in the Pyrennees a new genus of
 plants which approaches near to the colchica, bulbocoda, and
 saffron    :   he has called    it minderera    with the Spaniards,      and
 has sent a figure        and   description of it. He has also made a
 curious observation, hitherto unique of its kind : he has
  found the aquatic ranunculus flourishing, not as usual at
  the surface of the water, but at         a  certain depth under it.
     Picat-Lapeyrouse         has announced      that he proposes to pub
 lish   a  particular description of the plants named Ja\ifragi\
  and he has communicated              the motives which induce him to
  do so, and the         bases  on which      he proposes    to establisli it.
  The    leaves,    according to which he has hitherto distinguished
  these plants, do not afford constant characters : besides, in
  this genus there arc more hybridæ speeies ; that is to fay,
  species arising from a mixture of two, than has been hitherte
                                                                   believed.

believed.         Lapeyrouse has sought for their distinguishing
markB     in the figure,      the proportion, and the relation of the
parts    of fructification     : he has divided the whole genus into
several natural groupes, and collected from the works of the
old botanists,       and in their herbals,     a more correct synonymy
than any hitherto obtained.
     Zoology. — Lacepede has described a serpent hitherto un
known to naturalists; he has formed of it a genus to which
he gives the name of erpeton tentaculatum.                    Its characters
are,    that  it  has a row     of large scales below   the  body, and the
lower part of the tail covered with small scales like those of
the back.
     Cuvier      has  made      us acquainted with      the present state of
his researches         in regard      to quadrupeds  ;   he has now found
twenty-three kinds of these animals, none of which has ever
 been seen alive on the earth.
     Medicine.     —Halle       has   given an account of the symptoms
 of that contagious malady which lately occasioned so much
 devastation in Spain.             He has proved that it was not the
 plague common in the Levant, but that malady known                       in
 America under the name of the yellow fever.
     Lafosse      has   read    observations   on different ligaments in
 man and animals;            and by reasoning     and    practical examples
 has shown that there are cafes            in which    the cutting of these
 ligaments may be highly advantageous.
                          PHILOMATIC          SOCIETY.
     Labillardiere       read    a memoir on two species of the litchi
 of   the Moluccas.         The two species here described are ori
 ginally from China, and were introduced into the Moluccas
 by the Chinese, who inhabit these iflands.                  One of them,
 called ramboutan by the Malays, is the nepbelium lappaceum
 Linn.;     the other, which they call ramboutan-ake, is unknown
 to botanists.
      The   nepbelium was so little known that it has been succes
 sively classed      among the compojita, the amentaceœ, and the
 eupborbia.         Labillardiere proves that it belongs to the family
  of the Japonariee ; and he even unites it to the genus of the
  litchi.      Its calyx     has    four or five divisions covered      with
                                                                        hair,

 174                 Philomatic Society — Botany.
hair,   and no corolla.        It  has from four to six stamina     in
serted in the pistil, and     of  very fliort duration, which made
it be considered    as a  monoecia.     Its ovarium has two rounded
lobes, and its style divides       itself into two hollow stigmata.
One of the lobes of the ovarium generally miscarries, and the
other forms a red oval berry full of sharp points, terminating
in hooks and covered with a coriaceous and tuberous rind.
The kernel is oval, a little flatted, and lodged in a pulpy sub
stance,   to which it adheres by the base.         It is here seen that
this tree differs from the litchi only by the absence        of the co
rolla, and because it has only from four to six stamina instead
of six or eight. The points of its fruit, though long, are not
sufficient to make it be considered as a distinct genus; since
the fruit of the common litchi is also interspersed with small
points, which arise, in the like manner, from tubercles cir
cumscribed by irregular polygons.             The pulp of this fruit is
somewhat acid : it is used in the Moluccas for allaying the
thirst of those attacked with malignant fevers.           The surgeon
to the expedition sent in quest of La Peyrouse used this juice
with success for the dysentery.            The second covering of the
fruit does not appear to Labillardiere a character sufficient
for retaining   the genus nef helium ; he founds his opinion on
the exajpple of the magnifera indica, the fruit of which have
sometimes a second covering almost ligneous, which is want
ing in the other varieties.
   The litsea ramboutan-ake differs from the preceding by
the divisions of the calyx being more obtuse; the stigmata
pointed ; the being interspersed with tubercles truncated at-
the summit, and the external covering thicker ; by its rising
only to the height of fifteen or sixteen feet; and by its
branches beina; horizontal,        and its leaves having from fix to
eight folioles.    Its pulp is as agreeable to the taste as that of
the litsea cbinenfis.     The taste of its kernel resembles that of
a nut.     An oil similar to olive oil, and superior to that of the
coco nut, is extracted from it.
   The   fame author read another memoir on a new genus              of
palm called arertga.       It is the palma indica vinaria fecund a,
Suguerus feu    Gomutus.     (Rumph. Herb. Amb. Vol. I. p. 57.)

From areng, the name given to it             in  the Moluccas.      Its  na
tural characters are      as  follow   :
   Male Jlowers. —The          sheath    of one piece  ; the spadix much
ramified;    calyx divided into six folioles; the three exterior
short, in the form of a heart, and having a protuberance at
their base ; the three interior oval, and in alternate order with
the former.       Stamina fifty or sixty filaments, almost          as  long
as the interior folioles, and the rest almost united or adherent
to a short receptacle      which rises from the centre of the flower.
Theantheræ linear, indented like            a heart at the base, and ad
hering to filaments the summits of which project over them.
    Female jlowers on the fame stalk.              The sheath and spadix
as in   the males.       The calyx divided into six folioles ; the
three   exterior semicircular, the three interior much larger,
and having the form of an isosceles triangle.                     Pistil : a
simple   oval  ovarium,      terminated      by  three pointed   and   sessile
stigmata.     Fruit  :  almost spheric,      bacciform, with three cells
containing each       three feeds bearing three protuberances op
posite to the stigmata ; feeds oval, convex on the exterior and
depressed on the interior side, where they have two facets se
parated by an angle.          The    external    skin of each    seed   thin,
friable,   and    covered     on   the   outside   with asperities.      The
embryo lateral, and situated in a peculiar cavity.
   The arenga differs from the boraffus by its lateral embryo,
its sheath of one piece, and, in particular, by its fifty or sixty
stamina : a remarkable conformation in a family, all the ge
nera  of which     have six stamina, except the caryota         Linn,     and
the manlcaria Gærtn. which have from twenty to twenty-five.
   The only kind of arenga known is the arenga facebariftra,-
which rises to the height of fifty or sixty feet ; its pinnated
leaves are about fifteen or sixteen feet in length ; the folioles
are dentated at the extremity, and have one or two appendages
at their base   :  the petioles are broad towards their base, and
furnished with long black filaments, of which the Malays
make very durable ropes and cables.                  The petioles are em
ployed in the construction of their houses, and the folioles
for covering them.
    A very saccharine liquor is obtained from this palm by
piaking incisions in it : if properlv managed, the liquor may
                                                                            be

be obtained from it for more than        half  the year.     By  simple"
evaporation this liquor produces a kind of sugar, which has
the colour and consistence of chocolate newly made ; but
which, in all probability, might be susceptible of purification.
Excellent preserves are made of the kernels and young fruit
of the arenss, and very good sago is extracted from the trunk/
     Decandolle read     a memoir on the vegetation of the missel-
toe, which, as is well known, is a parasitic plant, that grows
on several trees and in all directions.        Duhamcl has given A
very accurate       and interesting account  of it.      Respecting this*
singular vegetable,        Decandolle  made   the following      experi
 ments :
     i ft.  To  prove  that the mifleltoe derives      it3 nourishment
 from the tree on which it exists, he immersed in water, co
 loured red with cochineal, a branch of an apple-tree on which
 a mifleltoe was growing.         The coloured water penetrated the
 bark and wood of the apple-tree and passed into the misseltoe,
 where its colour was even more intense than in the tree itself.
 It   does not,    however, appear that there is a real anastomosis
 between the fibres of the misseltoe and that of the apple-tree;
 but the base of the misseltoe is surrounded with a kind of
 cellulosity where the fibres of the apple-tree seem to deposit
 the sap, and where those of the misseltoe seem to imbibe it/
 The pith of the misseltoe is green in the young stems; and,
 by inspecting a transversal section of the vegetable, the opi
 nion of Desfontaines, that the cellular tissue is an external
 pith,     rendered green by the light, seems to be fully confirmed.
      2d. Decandolle took a branch of an apple-tree bearing a
  misseltoe, and immersed        the latter in coloured water.          Its
  leaves dropped, and the cicatrices became red.              The liquor
  followed the ligneous fibres of the misseltoe, descended into
  its root9, passed into the wood of the apple-tree, and de*
  scended towards its roots.
      3d. Having taken two branches of an apple-tree bearing
  two misseltoos of equal size, and having stripped of their
  leaves both the branches and one of the misseltoes, he intro
   duced the ends of these branches into            tubes   hermetically
   sealed, and silled with water;     he then inverted these tubes        in
   a vessel containing mercury, and observed          that the misseltoe

was implanted on a part of the root of the apple-tree, and
the other immersed immediately in water ; and having dis
posed them as in the preceding experiment, the first misseltoe
raised the mercury about 4^48 inches;                        the other once
raised    it -42,    and another time did not raise it at all.              This
singular experiment shows, that the misseltoe,                  by itself, is al
most entirely destitute         of the faculty of raising the sap.
     Decandolle        on this occasion observes, that the faculty of
raising the         sap by a root is intimately connected with a per
pendicular direction.             In regard to their nutrition, he divides
vegetables into two classes.                The first receive their nourish
ment through their whole surface ; do not live but in one sur
 rounding medium, of air, as the lichens ; of water, as the fuci ;
 or of earth, as rsustirooms.             Vegetables of the first class have
 no tendency to a perpendicular direction.                     Those of the se
 cond receive their nourishment through a determinate place
 called their root : they always live in two or three surround
 ing mediums ; in the earth and water, like the potamogetons ;
 in water and air, as the Jlratiotes ; in the earth and air, as the
 oak ; in the earth, water, and air, as the nymphæa.                          The
 plants of the second class all tend to the zenith with more or
  less energy.
     Decandolle         has also read a memoir on the pores              and the
  bark    of leaves.      The word gland in         the anatomv       of animals
  signifies     a secretory   organ   ;  but in the anatomy of plants this
  name has been given to several organs which are not, or at
  least have never yet been known to be, secretory organs, and
  which      differ considerably from each other.                  The miliary
  glands-     of    Guettard    have    particularly   fixed   the  attention of
   Decandolle; they are those which De Sauffure has described
   under the name of' cortical glands,               and    which by Hcdwig
   are called vafa lymphatica cuticuhe.               Decandolle gives them
   the name of cortical pores ; an appellation that relates only to
   their form and their position, which are certain things, and

 not to their use, which is uncertain.        He   first examines    their
 essential nature, and then follows their variations in the            dif
 ferent parts and different classes of vegetables, and under va
 rious circumstances. From these facts he endeavours to de
 termine their use.
    The cortical      pores   form part of the cortical tissue of the
 leaves.   It may be     seen by the   microscope that they are oval,
 and surrounded by an oval border, which connects them, by
 two or three fibres, to the rest of the tissue. The meshes of
 the tissue are more lengthened, and always without pores on
the fibres; the bristles, on the other hand, are always placed
on the fibres or ramifications.         Decandollc is of opinion that
these cortical pores are placed at the extremity of the fibres
which compose the leaf.           This idea was suggested to him by
the conformation of the craffula, laclea, cotyledons, &c. j^
bundle of fibres traverses the parenchyma of their leaves, and
ends at the bark ; the place where it ends is an assemblage of
pores,   whereas     scarcely any are found on the rest       of the sur
face.    This idea is confirmed by the pores being very nume
rous on coriaceous leaves, and very little so on those that are
pulpy, which have more juice and fewer fibres.
    The cortical pores are found in particular on the leaves.
The leaves of herbs, in general, have some of them on both
faces, and those of trees on the lower surface only ; which
coincides with the experiments of Bonnet on suction. The
stems have no pores, except tho'j df plants which are very
herbaceous     ;  such as the cucurbitœ,    grasses, and those      which
are destitute    of leaves,  as the caclus, epbedra,    &c.    The roots
never have pores.         Some are found on the stipulæ, and the
foliaceous and durable bracteæ.           The caliccs in general are
furnished with them ; but, on the other hand, the corollas
have none    :   this rule, however, is liable to some exceptions,
which Decandolle proposes           to explain   in   a particular me
moir. The pulpy pericarpia           are unprovided with pores,        but
those which        are coriaceous have them.        The    skins of feeds
have none, but they are found on the seminal             leaves.    None
of them, however,          are  found on the cotyledons which re
main on the ground, nor on those of French beans.

found, that in plants really destitute of cotyledons, such as
mushrooms, the byjji, fuci, lichens, and hepatica, no pores
are found, nor even real bark, nor perhaps epidermis.         This
absence   of the epidermis explains why mushrooms are so pu-
trescible; why the fuci, &c. imbibe water so easily; why
coloured water penetrates into the leaves of lichens, which
does   not take place with other plants.       Plants which have
cotyledons have bark : mosses have no cortical pores ; ferns-
have them, but oniy below.          The monocotyledons with
longitudinal fibres have pores between the fibres ; and hence
the distinguishing characters of tlie different families may he
deduced.     The cortical   pores are found only on      phnts or
parts  of plants exposed to the air, and never on those which
are under water: immersed plants, therefore, are destitute of
them, and floating leaves have them only on their upper
surface.    Decandolle has seen an aquatic ranunculus, which
Visually has no pores, acquire a great number when it grew
in  the open air.   He also made an inverse experiment, and
found that mint, made to grow under water, sent forth leaves
without pores.
   Light    also is necessary for the development of pores,
felanched plants have none ; cresses which grew exposed to
the light of six lamps had only half the number they usu
ally have when in the open air. The coats of bulbous roots
 have none in the parts below ground ; but those parts ex
posed to the light and the air have pores.
   The cortical    pores do not serve for the production     of the
blue pollen, for plums have no pores; oily plants, which
nave few pores, have blue pollen in abundance ; and from
twelve to fifteen   thousand plants have      pores  without   pro
ducing blue pollen.
   They   serve only for sensible transpiration, for the diversity
of   the matters exhaled seems to indicate a diversity in the
organs : besides, they are found in all vegetables, and that
function takes place only in some.
   They do not serve for the escape of oxygen gas, though the
want of them in blanched plants and the corollœ gives reason
to think that they are destined for that purpose ; but they are-
 sound in leaves coloured red which emit no air : they are

  Decandolle is of opinion that the cortical pores serve, ill, For
insensible          transpiration;         and indeed this function is exercised
in all terrestrial vegetables; it is unknown and improbabl«
in aquatic plants; oily plants, which have few poree, trans
pire little, but herbaceous plants transpire a great deal ;
the corollæ and blanched plants transpire very little : in
a word, it may be easily conceived that the lymph, after
having traversed the fibres throughout their whole extentj
and  having deposited in its course the alimentary mo-
leculæ, is exhaled at their extremity.      20, The author
thinks that, in certain cafes, these pores may serve for the
absorption of vapours ; and he thereby explains the agree
ment of his observations with those of Bonnet on suction,
the effect             on withered plants, and the increase of
                 of watering
oily plants when    hung tip in the open air.   lie proves by
an experiment that oily plants, when cut and exposed to the
air in a dry place, gradually lose their weight; but that it is
restored   them by immersion in water.
                to                           It may easily be
comprehended,  if Scnnebier's theory of the ascent of the sap
be admitted,     that when the extremity of the fibre is more
humid    than   the air, it gives up to it its moisture; and that,
if it is drier, it attracts that of the air.

                        CHEMICAL NOTICES.
    The following     is an extract     of a letter  from  U. P. Salmon,
Physician to the French Army in Italy, to Professor Maseagni,
of Sienna :
    "  Brugnatelli     is much      employed at present in repeating
the experiments of Volta on the solution of metals by what
he calls the electric acid. I have seen some of his electratsof
silver, which are the most singular phenomenon               I  ever heard
of.    Besides other curious observations,           Brugnatelli has con
firmed the discovery of the chemical alteration of metals by the
electric fluid.     He has proved, by an exceedingly curious ex
periment, before made by Volta, that electricity decomposes
water ; that it seizes on the oxygen disengaged ; and that, in
this combination,        it acquires the astonishing property of dis
solving silver and reducing it to the saline state.          This   may be
easily tried  : nothing is necessary but to adjust to Volta's appa
ratus a silver conductor the two branches           of which are each im
mersed in a glass of        water;     Scarcely is this communication
established,    when you will observe a multitude of small bub
bles moving in a vortex around the branch of the conductor,
which receives from the apparatus the electric fluid, while
from the opposite branch there proceeds a cloud of a cylindric
form, which descends to the bottom of the vessel. If the free
gas, disengaged from the branch where the electric fluid
enters,   be collected,       it will  be found to be pure hydrogen         :
you will find    also, by inspecting the branch          immersed in the
second vessel, that the silver has not only, been dissolved,            but
that a large quantity of very brilliant dodecaedral crystals has
been formed.        If an arc of gold be substituted for the silver
conductor, the branch which receives the electricity and the
extremity where it issues will in like manner be covered with
bubbles, and the aeriform fluid collected is detonating gas.
The gold, however, has experienced no alteration.                     It is
therefore evident that electricity acts            as a powerful acid   ; it
appears also to be susceptible of becoming oxygenated in the
decomposition of water, of being strongly charged with the
acidifying principle, and of afterwards extending its action
 to the metals, with which            it produces peculiar     salts.  Th«
                                                                       salts

salts already     known,              of copper, which is of a
                             are the electrat
beautiful green colour ; the electrat of zinc, which is of a
dark gray; that of iron, which has a reddish-yellow colour;
and the beautiful electrat of silver, which crystallises in re
gular and exceedingly transparent dodecaedra.   These me
tallicelectrats are insoluble in water. They, however, cart
be carried in the electric current to a considerable distance,
and cover other metals with their saline      coating.   Hitherto
the electrat of silver is that which has exhibited the greatest:
constancy and regularity in its crystallisation : it deposits itself
on conductors of gold and silver,              on glass,   and other bodies
with which it is in contact.
     "    Brugnatelli   has endeavoured        to determine the properties
of these metallic       crystals   :   he has found that they are insipid,
that they are insoluble in water, and that they effloresce
in an atmosphere of a high temperature. The nitric acid
dissolves them       with   a strong      effervescence.         The solution is
limpid, but alkalies render it turbid and decompose it. There
is precipitated from it an oxyd of silver, which can be attacked
by all the acids. The gas disengaged during the effervescence
has not yet been examined, but it is supposed to be of a pe
culiar nature.
     "
     Gold and platina are not sensibly altered by the electric
matter which passes through them ; though it often happens
that the electric current deposits on gold a stratum of zinc,
                                                     "
copper, mercury, or silver, according to whichever of these
metallic bodies it traverses.
     "Some are disposed to believe that the electric matter
possesses the property of conveying at the fame time two
metals through a third body.        If the tongue, indeed, be
touched   in  two  different points with different metals, two
pieces of coin for example, one of gold and the other of silver;
and if the upper edge of each of these pieces be brought into
contact so as to form an arc, a strong favour will be perceived ;
and the   nature of this savour will be different according to
the diversity and combination of the metals; which evidently
appears to indicate an association of the substances.
1    "    To conclude   :   The    discovery   of Volta    is"   still   in its in
fancy     ;   as yet we have       only   a   small number        of facts,    ancf
                                                                         prudence

prudence seems to require that we                            should determine the ge
neral laws which the electric matter follows in its combina
tion with oxygen before we attempt to form theories."

    Respecting Volta's discovery, Mr. Gottling has published
the following notice                :
     "
     The galvanic battery, constructed by professor Volta,
with plates of silver and zinc, having bits of pasteboard,
moistened with salt water, interposed between them,     no                             is,

how interesting this discovery                      is   to chemists, and         what im
portant discoveries             may be expected from it.                    There     is   rea
son, therefore,          to wish that the researches on this subject may
be       multiplied and rendered more general.                              The    plates    of
silver,     however, necessary for this purpose,                           seem to be an
obstacle    as the pieces of coin, commonly used, too soon lose
            ;
their brilliancy, and cannot be procured in sufficient numb&r
by those who have time and opportunity to make the expe
riments.             Copper, indeed, may be                 used instead    of silver; but
it   soon becomes oxydated.                    I    have    therefore      endeavoured       to
find some other metal to be used instead of silver; and of all
those mixtures         tried, that formed of one part of fer
                         which  I
ruginous antimony and two parts of lead,     found to be the          I
most useful: that             is,
                    regulus of antimony, prepared with iron
in the common way,      to be fused with lead in the above
                                        is
proportion.   This mixture   exceedingly fusible, and may be

formed into plates of the required size    being poured into
moulds.     The effects when this metal    employed are not
so   strong as with silver; and according                        to      my experiments,

                                             and
equal to 80 pairs of zinc and silver plates.    This metal, how
ever,   to be
          is   recommended    on account   of its cheapness, and
because       not easily oxydated. The mixture employed for
               it   is
printing-types produces nearly                      a    similar effect."

 of uncrystallised slimy matter remains              at the fame time     undif-
 solved.      The    crystallised  part, however, is far from being
 sugar; though when treated with nitrous acid it furnishes
  very pure oxalic acid, and, like sugar, is soluble in alcohol ;
  but in regard to taste it has a great similarity to manna.                    It
  differs from sugar, in particular, by the following circum
  stances : — That concentrated sulphuric acid perfectly colour
  less is not rendered black by it: that by combustion it leaves
  a residuum      of vegetable alkali, and is decomposed neither by
  the spiritous nor acid fermentation, nor by slow putrefac
   tion.    I am of opinion, therefore, that these crystals are to
   be considered     as a peculiar component part of beets, not yet
   known,      which exists in them in considerable quantity ; and
   I  think myself authorised to assert, that perfectly pure sugar
   cannot be obtained from beets when the roots are cut and
   the juice expressed, or when they are boiled with water, and
   the juice afterwards inspissated by boiling, because some of
   this component part will always be mixed with it. To be
    convinced of the presence of this substance the following me
    thod may be employed with most advantage: — When the,
    beets are dried, and the sugar has been extracted, more water
       * Professor Guttling's method   consists  chiefly  in extracting   the sugar
    from the dry beets by infilling them in cold- water.

    be brought     to spiritous or rather acid fermentation in the
    usual way,         that the sugar it contains may be decomposed.
    When          the fermentation is over, pour off the clear liquid and
    evaporate   it to dryness at a gentle heal ; and heat over the
    residuum, in a retort or other convenient vessel, rectified
    spirit of wine till it begin to boil.    Then decant the clear
    spiritous liquid,  and   deposit it in a cool place, where this
    component part will crystallise from it. To obtain the cry
    stallised part perfectly free from spirit                   of wine, the latter may
    be made to evaporate in a gentle heat."

medied by the excitement of pain, has been published in the
third volume of the American Medical Repository, by Va

says   Dr. Seaman, "the great quantity of opium that a person,
under the operation of acute pain, will take, without having
any soporific effects induced by                   it,

I then procured a small switch, and applied it pretty freely to

upon the application of this remedy, (he roused up, and

white vitriol were then administered, followed, in about fif
teen minutes, by       half a dram of ipecacuanha; notwithstanding

     The Medical Committee for the Vaccine Inoculation at
 Paris has lately publiflied the following notice :
     " The committee has just inoculated some cows with the
  vaccine matter. This experiment has succeeded.                     The pus
  tules appeared in the most regular manner, and following
  the fame progress as in man.             The committee will speedily
 publish a detailed account of this noble experiment, which
  had been before tried at Rheims with             full success.       A great
  many medical men and curious persons came to be con
  vinced, by ocular demonstration, of the truth of this fact,
  so interesting in the history of the vaccine."
      A memoir      has been publiflied      at Geneva on         the vaccine
  inoculation      by Dr. Oder,     professor  of medicine,        in order to
  be submitted to the         minister of the interior,         which,    after
  giving    an    account of this important discovery, and of the
  progress     and nature of the disease, concludes with the fol
  lowing observations on the certainty of its bein^ a pre-
  ventative: — " We have acquired certain proof, in two ways,
                                     A  a 2,                               that

 that the vaccme       inoculation is a perfect security agajnst the
  small-pox.
     " ist, By the direct or indirect communication which all
 our inoculated patients had with a great number of children
 attacked with the small-pox in every quarter of the city.               It
 is well known that the small-pox is infectious long after the
 patients are in a condition to go abroad.           Van Swieten esti
 mates that the disease     is still capable   of communicating         it
 self sixty days after it has made its appearance;         but molt pa
 tients, after the twentieth day, go about as        usual in the streets
 and public places, and wherever their business             or occupa
 tions may lead them.         It is impossible, therefore, that nearly
 four hundred children, inoculated for the vaccine sour months
 ago, stiould have all escaped if they were susceptible of infec
 tion from an epidemic distemper           so  general   as that    which
 prevails here at present, and to which 150 children have
 fallen a sacrifice within our walls.        None of them, however,
 have    had   the small-pox     except four,   who certainly had the
 geirm   of the disease before they were inoculated.
    "   ad,  We    have even    inoculated the small-pox from arm
 to arm, and with all the precaution necessary lo insure the
 success of the operation, on ten or twelve of those inoculated
 with   the vaccine,    and seven weeks after, the scars     of   the vac
 cine had dropped       off; but none of them         showed    the   least
 symptom of general infection.          The incision became slightly
 inflamed ; but it speedily dried up without arcolæ, and with
 out any appearance of fever.
     "  We    have   acquired also, by repeated trials, the moll
 complete proof that the vaccine is not a contagious disease.
 In several families we have inoculated two, three, or four
 children after each other.        Those who had the disease slept
 with   some    who  had  not  been  inoculated, and the latter were
 not affected till they were inoculated in their turn.           In other
 respects we saw no instance of contagion.
     " I  shall  add,"   says Dr. Oder, "     that it did not appear to
 us that the      inoculated vaccine was followed by any other
 malady;     neither  pimples nor eruption, neither fore eyes nor
-had ears, nor any accumulations of matter so often observed
                                                                      aster

after the small-pox, both when inoculated and when the dis
ease takes place in the natural way : on the contrary, we have
inoculated several very delicate children, whose health seemed
to be much improved by the operation in every respect.
Extract of a Letter from Dr. Marshall, dated Valet ta
                    {Malta), January 21, 1801.
    "   Since my last,    I  have   the pleasure     to inform you that
Dr. Walker      and myself have been very successful in pursuing
the object of our mission. We have had the happiness to ar
rest the destroying progress of the fmall-pox, which has raged
very much, and has been very mortal at              Minorca and Malta,
and on board the fleet.         The Minorqueens,        who at first re
ceived the vaccine inoculation cautiously, are now very happy,
and it is generally adopted among them.              At Malta, the most
complete success has attended us.           When     we arrived here, we
at first inoculated some children belonging to the             Foundling
Hospital, and from them several others ; but, finding it difficult
to persuade    the  people    of its efficacy, we subjected       many of
these to the test of the insertion    of  the matter   of the soiall-pox,
upon all of whom it had not the least effect. This experiment
was publicly made in presence of the governor*, the Tunisian
ambassador, the British consul, and many of the principal
inhabitants.      In going    to the hospital      we formed a proces
sion  :  the governor walked       at our    head in his uniform,       the
clergy in their canonicals ; and we were accompanied by most
of  the medical professors.       The success attending our experi
ment, and the publicity of the efficacy of the Jennerian in
oculation, has caused the inhabitants to come in great num
bers to be inoculated.        The governor has had Dr. Jenner's
work translated and printed for the inhabitants, and he ha3
also established an hospital for the inoculation of the poor,
under the name of the Jennerian Institution j and as on our
arrival we found the fmall-pox in the island, the inhabit
ants have pressed in crowds, both the mass of the people and
the nobility. Dr. Jenner's discovery is held here in such
high esteem, that the governor, who is the idol of the Mai-.

  and has allotted to us, for our residence during our stay here,
  the most beautiful palace ofValetta, heretofore the grand

  fleet, it became necessary, on account of its short stay here,
  that one of us should accompany the expedition to complete
  the inoculation ; and Dr. Walker's enterprising spirit could
  not rest till it was determined that he should go; and he has
  sailed in the admiral's ship.

    The Free Society of Agriculture, Arts, and Commerce, in
the department of the Ardennes, has lately published a select
collection of memoirs ; among which are : a paper on the
causes    of  the smut     in grain, and on the means of preventing
it ; on the cultivation of the fuller's thistle {dipsacus fullo-
num); on the culture of a kind of poppy; details on the
turnip-rooted cabbage 9s Lapland, cultivated at Bouillon ; and
simple and easy means for preserving              grain from weevils and
other insects.         These means      are as  follows : — Immerse some
pieces of hemp cloth in water ; wring them, and cover with
them your heaps of grain : two hours after you will find the
weevils adhering to the cloths ; which must be carefully col
lected that the insects may not escape.                 You may then dip
them some time in water to drown them.
     A  plant of the hyoscyamus placed in the middle of a heap
of gram       drives away these insects : in that cafe you must
watch, in order to crush them as they are endeavouring to
escape; which will not require long time.
     The   last article    of this collection  is a recipe for a vegetative
 liquor proper for accelerating the blowing              of bulbous-rooted
 flowers in winter in apartments.                It is as follows : —Take
 nitrate of potalh (nitre) three ounces ; muriate of soda
 (common salt) one ounce; carbonate of potash (potash)
 half   an ounce ; sugar        half an ounce ; rain water one pound :
 make the salts dissolve in         a gentle   heat in a glazed     earthen
 pot, and when the solution is completed, add the sugar and
 filter the whole.          Put about eight drops of this liquor into a
 glass jar silled with rain or river water.               Thejarsmustbe
 kept always full, and the water must be renewed every ten or
 twelve days, adding each time a like quantity of the liquor :

TiHIS
king's
               celebrated
          taxes,   was
                            chemist, the son of
                        born at Calharinaberg,
                                                      a   collector of the
                                                         in West Goth
land,    on the 9th of March 1735.              At an early period he
stiowed a great deal of spirit and vivacity, which approached
almost to giddiness ; but, by application to study under a pri
vate tutor and at the school of Skara, this youthful fervor
gradually subsided.       At   the age    of   17  he    was sent to the
university of Upsal, where he first applied, in consequence of
the natural bent of his genius, to mathematics and various
branches of philosophy, which he studied with unremitting
diligence, though one of his relations, under whose care he
had been placed, often represented to him that these were
pursuits not likely to procure him a livelihood.                As he was
obliged to obtain instruction in these sciences merely from
 books, and often employed whole days in study, slmt up in
 his chamber from morning till night, his health was consi
 derably impaired ; and in order that he might restore it he
made a tour to the country to fee his parents, during which
 he amused himself with the study          of natural history.       When
 at the school    of Skara    he had     been initiated in botany and
 entomology, particularly the latter, to which he             applied with
 so much zeal that he formed a system of insects              according to
 their state of larva, which was so wqll arranged             that it could
 not have been considered as the work of a youth               of eighteen.
 It is to be regretted that his other occupations prevented him,
 from pursuing this subject further, and that only the clafle3
 of the larvæ were engraved and published. Dc Geer and
 Linnæus were both sensible of the value of his knowledge in
 this respect; and the latter, to sliow his esteem for him, gave
 the name of Bergman to a fort of phalæna.                     During this
 time, however, he did not neglect bis favourite pursuit, and
 studied    Palmquisi's   algebra,    so   difficult   to be    understood
 without assistance.                ^

194               Account      of the Life and Writings
    At  the end   of   fifteen months he returned      to Upsal,   and  in
1755 gave a proof of the progress he had made in mathema
tics and philosophy by a disputation De Crcpusculis. Soon
after he transmitted to the Royal Academy of Stockholm two
dissertations  ;  one     of them, Dc    Cocco  Aquatico, and the other
De Hirudin'tbus      ;    which   were   much approved      by Linnæus,
though he entertained          an opinion   on these subjects    different
from that of the author.             He defended also a disputation on
astronomical intercalation,          in consequence of which he got
the degree of doctor in 1 758 ; and bv another disputation on
general attraction he obtained leave to become a private
teacher of philosophy.          'Having improved himself in practical
astronomy at the observatory of Upsal, lie assisted in observing
the transit of Venus in 176 1, and was rewarded for his dili
gence     and application bv being made assistant protestor of
mathematics and philosophy.
    He sent different papers to the Royal Academy of Stock
holm;      one of which        was on the rainbow,        another on the
aurora borcalis, and         a third on the twilight. The northern
lights and electricity attracted         his particular attention, and
he at length laid before the Royal Society of Upsal a series
of observations which he had made on these subjects during
the course os four years, together with a variety of informa
tion collected by learned men both in Sweden and in other
countries.       His observations on electricity were so much
 approved, that an extract from them was inserted in the
 Philosophical Transactions by Dr. Wilson.               The same work
 contains his letters on the electric nature of turmalin, which
 nearly put an end to the dispute between Dr. Wilson and
 Æpinus.
    In the   year  1763 he obtained a prize from the Royal Acar
 demv of    Stockholm for an answer to the question, How those
 caterpillars which destroy the leaves of fruit-trees can be ex
 tirpated ? and two years after a double prize for some new
 observations on the fame subject.             He was so zealous for the
 interest of the Academy of Stockholm' that he sent it forty-one
 papers, each of which contained either some new observations,
 or illustrated and explained what had been known before.
 The Academy were so sensible of his services that in the
                         6                                             year

                     of Olos Tor hern Bergman.                      195
year 1777 they allowed him an annual salary            of  150 rix-dol-
lars from their funds in order to defray the expense to which
he was exposed        by his experiments.         Though most of his
time was occupied with natural philosophy he still retained
his taste for entomology : he discovered a new sort of gall-
apple   in   the bark    of the oak    ; wrote   a dissertation  on the
saw-fly,     tenlbredo ;   on   the   worms so pernicious to the
pine-fir; and, towards       the   latter part of his life, he wrote
on the care and management of bees.
   In the year 1758, in conjunction with some of his friends,
he had established a cosmographical society, who undertook
to  give   a   description of the earth. The physical part was
allotted to Bergman ; and when it appeared in 1766, it was
so well received that the whole edition was fold in the course
of half  a year: the work was soon after translated into Ger
man, Danish, French, and other languages.                A second edi
tion, much enlarged, appeared in 1773 under the title of
A   Physical Description of the Earth.         In this work Bergman
displayed    a greater   knowledge of mineralogy and chemistry
than was expected ;       and his reputation as a chemist was still
further increased by     a dissertation  on the method     of preparing
alum, which he published afterwards. In consequence of the
last-mentioned work he was appointed professor of chemistry
in 1767.      About this period, in consequence of a proposal
which he made, a new laboratory, models, various kinds of
apparatus,     and a new house for the professor,       were provided.
Under     such   circumstances it is not to be wondered at that,
besides    his young countrymen, pupils from distant parts
should be anxious to repair to Upsal, that they might prosit by
the instruction of    a man who had acquired so much celebrity.
   His pupils    admired   not only his zeal and diligence in com
municating instruction and in making experiments, but the
wonderful perspicuity with which he explained the most dif
ficult subjects.     Bergman, however, did not confine himself
to oral instruction: he enlightened the world by his writings;
and his first attempt this way was Scheffcr's Chemical Lec
tures, which he arranged, and enriched with valuable ob
servations.      His next publication      was    an  Introduction    to
Chemistry;       and this was    followed by his Sciagraphia of the
                                 B  b 2,                        Mineral

Mineral Kingdom ; which appeared also in French under the
following title : Manuel de Miner alogijle, &c. traduit et

endeavoured also, by examining a variety of substances with            -
unremitted diligence, to enlarge chemical knowledge; and
the result of his experiments, which he communicated to the
public in various papers, was, for the most part, afterwards
collected by himself and published in three volumes, with the
title of Opufcula Pbyfica et Cbemica plerumque anieafeorfum
edita,jam ab Auclore collegia et aucla; Holmiæ 1 779. 8vo. A
new edition of this work was published under the inspection
of the celebrated professor Lcske at Leipsic; and, after Berg
man's death, professor Hebcnstrcit added three more volume*
of his  detached pieces, and published the whole with the title
of Bergmanni Opufcula Pbyfica         et Cbemica,   plcraque scorfum,

Italian translation of Bergman's physical and chemical works
was published by subscription at Fsorence under the title           of
Opufcoli    Chimici  e
                       Fifici   di  T.   Bergman;     Florence 1790,
Tom. III. 8vo. The third volume of this translation con
tains considerable additions by Dolomieu, which form nearly
one-half of it.
    Though it would be impossible, in the space allotted for
this sketch, to give a detailed account of all Bergman's dis
coveries   and  the  improvements he made in chemistry, by
which he acquired so much reputation, we cannot omit enu
merating some of them.         He explained, in the most satisfac
tory manner, why an alum ley, without any addition, does
not crystallise; and showed that this phænomenon arose from
its containing an excess of acid.          He rejected the common
addition, and instead of     it used    pure argil, which, without
doing any hurt, increases the quantity of the alum.           He first
flowed that fixed air is a real peculiar acid, which is not in
debted   for its properties to the substances employed for ex
tracting it.    He considered it as the principal component
part of mineral waters,    and gave a most ingenious method         of
decomposing them; which          is a process exceedingly difficult.
                                                                  He

He     showed    also how      to imitate them by art, and prepared
different kinds, which          had a perfect    resemblance   to those  of
Seltz, Spa, Pyrniont, and other places.                By a careful ana
 lysis of the hot waters he was led to an equally successful
 method of imitating them also.             In a word, we are indebted
 to him alone tor the great improvement which has been made
 in  the analysis of mineral waters, and the art of ascertaining
 their real component parts.             He was the first who gave a
proper account of the properties of the newly discovered acid
of sugar, and its mode of union with other bodies. He not
only explained, in the clearest manner, the nature of cobalt,
nickel, and platina; but declared, many years before the dis
 covery was acknowledged, that manganese, molybdena, and
tungsten, must contain peculiar semi-metals ; and this con
jecture was afterwards fully confirmed by the experiments of
 the ablest chemists.        He    was the first also who gave a proper
 account of the properties          of manganese and of its regulus.
 He discovered the cause of the phosphoric quality of blende
 in the sparry fluor with which it is mixed. He was the first
 who discovered sulphurated tin.            His examination of iron is
 a masterpiece,       and to him       we   are indebted for our know
 ledge    of   the   cause   of   the  brittleness    of cold short and
 red short     iron.      He taught a most          excellent process for
 analysing ores         with the blow-pipe           by the addition of
 different saline       substances,    and    an   ingenious  method     of
 analysing ores in the wet way. The discovery of this last
 method, before unknown, gave rife to a great many others,
 and in all probability will produce more. Such are the im
 portant discoveries which he made in regard to the nature
 and properties of bodies ; he was fully sensible that 30,000
 experiments would be necessary to bring them to perfection,
 and he clearly saw that more time would be required for this
  purpose    than he could hope to command, even if his life
 sliould be prolonged to a more distant period than he had
  reason to expect ; but he opened the path and pointed out
  the way which his followers ought to pursue.
     The causes which enabled this eminent man to make such
  progress in chemistry were,         besides great    ingenuity and    in
 defatigable application,        his extensive      knowledge in natural
                                                                   history,

   I98              Account os the   Life and Writings
  history, natural philosophy and mathematics, which he applied
  to his favourite science. He introduced mathematical accuracy
  into chemistry, and, by his example, induced others to call in
  the aid   of calculation   to give more precision to their results.
  Analysis   enabled    him   to examine the component parts of
  bodies, and by subjecting these parts to calculation he could
  determine the quantities with more accuracy and truth.
     To him is modern chemistry indebted for many of those
 luminous     facts which serve to support it ; and it may be
 asserted, without taking from the merit of those who esta
 blished the new system, that the spirit of accuracy and pa
 tient investigation, introduced in a great measure by Berg
 man, has tended not a little to give solidity and beauty to the
 edifice.
     His writings are all distinguished by great order, perspi
 cuity, and neatness of language. The most celebrated of the
 learned societies in Europe; those of London, Stockholm1,
 and Gottingen ; the Academies of Dijon and Turin, the
Medical Society at Paris, the Society of the Searchers into1
Nature at Berlin, and the Imperial Academy of the Searchers-
 into Nature, all chose him a member of their different bodies.
 He was made a member also of the Academy of Montpellier
after he had gained the double prize, for a paper on the di
stinguishing marks of those kinds of earth which are most
useful    in agriculture. The Royal Academy of Sciences at
Paris,    which admitted only eight foreign members, made
choice of Bergman to be one of that number.               The Royal
Academy      of   Berlin  invited  him   to  that city in 1776; and
on his. declining this offer, the king of Sweden, who soon
after his coronation in 1772 had raised him to be one of the
first twenty-eight knights of the order of Vasa, made a con
siderable addition to his income.           The students of the pro
vince of Finland caused a medal, of ten ducats value, to be
struck as a testimony of their esteem and respect for his ta
lents ; on the one side of whirh was a good likeness of him,
with the inscription : Tori. Bergman Patriee Dectts, ac
Decus    Ævi   ;  on the reverse,    Epboro egregio Natio Fennica,
die   I Maii m.dcc.lxxxiv.
    When it      is considered   that Bergman was of a weak con
                                                            stitution,

                     tf Olof Torhem     Bergman.                    199
stitution, and that his labours were often interrupted by his
bodily infirmities, it will appear rather surprising that he
should have been able to accomplish so much.                 He was fre
quently tormented with the head-ache, and suffered also con
siderably from the hæmorrhoids.         Finding his health declining
he repaired to Medwi, to have the benefit of the waters there,
from which he had often before experienced relief; but a
few days after his arrival he was seized with convulsions,
which attacked him several times, and expired on the 8th of
July 1784.    All    the company then at the baths attended his
funeral.    He left    a widow,     by whom he had two children,
who died young     ;   and   from her the king purchased his li
brary and apparatus for the          use   of  the chemical professor,
giving her a handsome pension         as a   compensation for them.
   Bergman's character and disposition were well calculated
to conciliate respect and esteem.            He was far from being
morose,   or an enemy to innocent             mirth.     Whenever     he
thought he could gratify his friends, he was always ready to
participate in their amusements.            He never appeared obsti
nate or supercilious in delivering his opinions : if they were
thought dubious, he explained them; but, if he found suffi
cient reason,   he    retracted   them.      This candid   and masrna-
nimous    conduct     he displayed     also as a writer    ;  but, when
fully convinced of the truth and solidity of any point, he
adhered to it with unstiaken firmness.              However ardently
attached to his favourite sciences, he never despised other
knowledge, or rejected any thing with the utility of which
he was unacquainted; on the contrary, he valued and pro
moted every thing that had the least tendency to enlarge
human knowledge.           A stranger to vanity, he never solicited
for worldly honours or dignities ; and those which were of
fered to him he used as a philosopher ought.
   Towards his friends his heart was ever open and warm.
When asked advice, he gave it with readiness and sincerity ;
and his benevolence never          stood   in  need  of being solicited.
His intimacy with         Scheele  is well known     :  he was the first
person who called the attention        of  the Swedish    nation and of

Bergman, the world would have been deprived of the greater
part of his important discoveries.         The many literary friends
Bergman had in all nations, are a testimony of the esteem in
which he was universally held ; and his letters not only (how
how capable he was of maintaining a literary correspondence,
but that he possessed a feeling heart.         For the sacred writings
he always entertained the utmost reverence; he made them
the constant rule of his actions; and if any one in his com
pany attempted either openly or indirectly to attack them,
or to question their divine origin, he defended them with a
warmth which on other occasions he seldom manifested.
XXV.     History  of the   Art of Dyeing, from       the earliest Ages.
                     By   J. N. Bischoff          *.
H<.OWEVER           useful and laudable may be the exertions           of
those who trace back the various steps by          which the   arts have
risen from infancy to a state of improvement, and who en
deavour to throw light on the periods of their invention, and
to explain the means and accidental circumstanoes by which
they have been brought to perfection, it must be allowed that
this task is attended      with   great   difficulty as well as uncer
tainty.    Such inventions,      in general, have had so rude an
origin, that mankind did not think them worth their atten
tion till they had attained to a certain degree of perfection.
This difficulty suems in particular to occur in regard to the
origin of dyeing, as it appears to be much anterior to the
 oldest of the antient writers with which we are acquainted.
 Every things therefore, that can be said on the subject must
 be founded on conjecture.
    In my opinion the origin of dyeing may be ascribed to that
tiatural vanity inherent in human nature, and which inspires
 mankind with a desire to please, and to distinguish themselves
 above others.     The effects produced by the juice of certain
 plants or berries when bruised, by the rain on different kinds
 •f earth, or by the blood of animals applied to cloth, sug-

                                                                  gested,

gcsted,  in  all probability,   the  first idea  of this art;   and the
above    substances    were, no doubt, the first dye-stuffs with
which the inventors ornamented their clothing made of skins.
When      these appeared      among their neighbours with their
parti-coloured     garments, a spirit of imitation would natu
rally be excited among the latter; and this passion would
induce them to find out better dye-stuffs; such as, by imi
tating the blueness of the sky, or the beautiful tints of birds
and flowers,      might enable them to outshine those who had
preceded    them   in this new art.
   But it would soon be observed that this beauty was of short
duration, and that it was necessary to renew the tints by a
fresh   application    of  the colouring substances.        The many
experiments which         mankind might easily make while they
lived under the freedom of the early ages, and perhaps some
fortunate accident, may have at length taught them how the
colours could be fixed, by preparing their skins with salts and
other substances of the like kind.
    As mankind      began to multiply, new wants were created,
empsoyments       were increased,    and those devoted to the ser
vice of religion began to be distinguished by a certain kind
of dress from the other classes of society.           Hence arose par
ticular ranks and conditions,       to which     certain distinguishing
marks were assigned according            to their functions ; and for
this purpose no better or more certain means could be found
than diversity of colours.       In the earliest ages, therefore, par
ticular colours were allotted to the leaders of armies, judges,
 and priests ; and for festivals, funerals, and religious cere
 monies.
    Mankind would now begin to consider dyeing as an art
not merely calculated to gratify vanity or to give pleasure to
 the eye, but a6 an invention of the utmost utility to society.
 No longer contented with         the dye-stuffs    furnished by vege
tables and land animals, they began to search even the ocean,
with which they were become more familiar, and discovered
a substance proper for dyeing purple, — the first colour respect
ing the origin of which we find any certain information in
 the  monuments       of antiquity.      Almost all thole antient au
thors   who   speak   of  this invention,     ascribe it to love and a

shepherd's           sweetheart          having seen this colour, was so struck
with     it,    that   she        requested   her lover to procure her    dress               a
dyed     with it.            In consequence of this request the shepherd
endeavoured                to find out the substance which had produced
such    a       beautiful colour, and                by   these means discovered                    the
art of dyeing purple *. Some, however, ascribe this inven

of his      first experiment                to the   king of Phœnicia, who was
so captivated              with    it,   that he   made purple one of his prin

   merly was held in so much estimation ; which is mentioned
  so often by profane            as well as sacred writers; which still
  makes a figure in our poetry, or which is so often used as a
   figure in common life, and which many are acquainted with
   only by name.
       The   substance employed         for dyeing this expensive colour
   was the liquor of a kind of (hell-fish called by the Hebrews
  argaman, by the Greeks vroptpupx, and by the Romans pur
  pura, mttrex, and ojlrum. It has been often described, and
  the shell of it may often be seen in collections of natural
  curiosities.      There were two kinds         of this shell-fish, both of
  which      were employed in dyeing purple.              One of them, from
  its figure, was called bucc'mum.             The other was the purple
  shell-fish properly so called {purpura, pelagium), and con
  sisted of several kinds, some of which were sitter than others
  for dyeings. The best were found in the neighbourhood of
  Tyre, on       the coast     of Gætulia,   and near Lacedemon.             It is
  described     by Pliny in the following manner            J:
       "  The purple shell-fish has a conical shell surrounded with
  a seven-fold       row of prickles which proceed to the mouth,
  through which the animal can project its tongue. The latter
 is as long as the singer, and so hard that it can penetrate the
  shells   of other   fish and nourish itself on their substance.           This
 also affords      an    easy method of catching it.            The fishermen
 take a net with         wide meshes, into which, instead of bait, a               .
 few muscles are put.            As   soon as these are immersed          in the
 water      they again become fresh, and when the purple fish
 observe that they open their (hells they thrust their tongue
 into them ; but scarcely do the muscles perceive this when they
 again shut their shells, and in that manner they are caught.
      " In fresh water these shell-sish soon die ; but they can live
 fifty days on their own saliva.            In the spring they emit a fort

or after the dog-days *."
    The animal itself consists of three parts ; between the two
first is found the valuable liquor, to the quantity of a few
drops, in a white receptacle.     This liquor the animal emits
with   its life, and is lost when it dies slowly f.    They are
therefore caught alive, and killed by a blow \. When a
sufficient quantity of the liquor has been obtained, a little salt
is added to       and  it,   suffered to stand three days.
                                       it   is               The

over      a    flow fire, and                the fleshy                   particles which float               at the
top must from time to time be scummed off.                                                     It   isthen kept
for ten days, after which the colour tried on                                                        bit of pure
                                                                            it is
                                                                                                 a
wool, and the colour                             is    boiled till               no longer appears red,
but has        a    blueish cast.
     Thus         far the process for preparing the liquor seems to have
been the fame                  among all the antient nations.                                         But in the
operation for dyeing there appears to have been some differ
ence. The Jews immersed the wool in lime-water before
                                                                 it
it   was dyed, and then washed                                   in       a     ley§.
 I        am of opinion                 that among other nations the wool was
subjected           to     a    sort    of boiling, and that the antient authors
have omitted to mention this circumstance, as well      as other
processes,  merely because they were things universally known.
At any rate, the first ground of the colour was given to the
wool       means of
            by        kind of sea-weed {fucus iharinus), and
                                   a
then      it   was dyed.               Hence                the colour acquired the name of
fucus       \\.     Alkanet             {anchufd)                was        also employed                to    lay   a
foundation for the purple                        f      .

    The Tynans                  ground of their purple dye by
                          gave the          first
the unprepared liquor of the purpura, and then improved or
heightened it by the liquor of the buccinum.   In this manner
they prepared their double dyed purple *, purpura dibapha,
which was so called either because it was immersed in two
different liquors, or because it was first dyed in the wool and
then in the yarn.
   The Greeks, according to the account of a certain Demo-
critus, poured the liquor as it came from the fire into a vessel}
immersed the wool in      and sufferedit,to remain in that state
                                                              it
a   day and     a    night.        Between this method and that of the
Romans there seems to be no essential difference.                                     The latter,
according to         Pliny,     suffered the wool to remain                     in    the liquor
five hours,       after which           they dried       it; they then immersed                        it
in   the liquor again, and continued                      in this manner till had           it
imbibed all the dye.                   The liquor of          the buccinum atone gave
a false dye;         it   was therefore             necessary to fix      it    by    the liquor
of the purpura in order to render durable.              it
   To fifty pounds of wool two hundred of the liquor of the
buccinum, and    hundred and ten of that of the purpura
                          a                                                                        \t
were employed.                By      these means the wool acquired a colour
like that of the amethyst, and thence   had its name.          it
   The colour called conchylium     was dyed almost in the

    These are all the different methods of dyeing purple among

           Whether the scarlet of the antients was the fame
 as ours, cannot be easily determined, but we are told by                                              Pliny
    that it was          a very agreeable           rose colour.
         All      these dyes,             the preparation       of which       I    have here de
 scribed, are frequently confounded by antient authors, who
 often give the name of purple to all red colours $; and from
 this circumstance, and from that of various other colours
 being produced by the mixture of the before-mentioned four
 kinds of dye, the confusion and uncertainty which prevails
 on this subject have, in my opinion, arisen. But this uncer
 tainty might perhaps be in some measure removed by making
 the following distinction. The purple colours of the antients
 were:

 cloth or wool should be immersed in two different liquors.
This was the purple properly so called. The colour was a
dark red, like that of curdled blood ; but it shone with most
 splendour when one looked at the cloth from the bottom up-

the African provinces,                    and Lufitania.

of the antients :
   The Gœtulian purple, for which the sliell-fisli found on the
Gætulian coast were employed.   A great deal of cloth, &c.
was dyed in particular in the island of Madura and Porto
Sancto, which on that account were by the antients called
the Purple Islands (Infulte Purpurin<e-f).
   The Lacedemonian %.
   The Tarentine. This had somewhat brighter shades §.
   At first these kinds of purple were exceedingly rare ai
Home, but under Augustus they became the fashionable co
lours ; though a pound of purple wool could not be procured
for      less           denarii, somewhat more than 32/.
                 than a thousand
sterling. The almost incredible prices at which this purple
was fold among the antients, is to be understood,   in ge
neral, as applicable to these kinds,                     as the   others were much
cheaper.

of which I have described as above. It was not such a dark

Tyrian purple colours.
   These are the colours which, in the works of the antients,
are particularly distinguished   the name of purple. As noby
specimens               of   them have been preserved, we must be contented
with the descriptions given of them                                 by   Pliny and others              ;   and
it would be fruitless to attempt to obtain                                         a    more accurate
knowledge of them                      \.
     Of their durability, Plutarch gives                             a     remarkable instance
in the life of Alexander.   This prince,      said, found in the         it   is
treasury   of the Persian monarch     large quantity of purple, a
 180 years old, which still retained all its beauty; and the
cause, according                      to Plutarch,        was, that       it   had been prepared
with honey.
  As the antients had no colour                                equal to the purplein beauty,
                                                               not surprising that they en-

nobled it by the particular purposes to which it was destined.
In the earliest periods, and immediately after its invention,
it was considered as the favourite colour of the gods. Nay,
the Deity himself seems to have conformed to the Weakness
and ideas       of man by choosing it to be the most distinguished
ornament of his house and his ministers .*.
     As  the power and respect                 of kings    increased,       it was made
a symbol         of    majesty      f 5   and this was carried so            far, that in
^ie time of the emperors it was considered as a particular
right belonging to the princes of the imperial house ; so that
immediately after their birth they were wrapped in purple
swaddling-clothes, and by these means obtained, as it were,
a   title to the empire.              Nay, it was        considered        as an almost
indispensable         ceremony in the choice of an emperor % that
the successful candidate should be clothed in purple; and we
 have instances of the soldiers, when nothing else was at hand,
tearing the purple from their standards and wrapping it round
the newly chosen emperor.
     In   free    republican states this colour was a mark of the
 highest official dignity.                 Thus the supreme magistrates at
 Rome were distinguistied by broader or narrower purple
 stripes {last et angusti clav'i), with which their clothes were
 bordered behind and before.                     Hence it happened that purple,
 which every one had been before at liberty to use, was by the
 emperors made a regality; and when assumed by private per
 sons, or when a piece               of purple     was applied to another colour,
 this crime was puniflied with death                  as a  kind of high treason §»

  % H3                   History    of the Arl of Dyeing*
       In   every province, and particularly in Phœnicia^ there were
   certain houses for dyeing purple belonging to the emperors,
   and     each    of  these was under the           inspection of an overseer
   {procurator bupbiorum) , whose chief business was to take care
  that the articles were well dyed. These overseers were also
  under the inspection of a comes sacrarum largitionum *.
  Neither the dyers nor their children durst follow any other
  occupation, but formed a peculiar tribe and had their own
  symbol, which was a small basket containing purple wool f.
       Though the art of dyeing purple was so highly esteemed
  and so much practised, it was at length forgotten in the west
  and afterwards in the east, so that the                learned  consider   it as
  now totally       lost ;   while others doubt whether such a colour
  ever existed,       and whether         it was possible to prepare it from
  the liquor of a shell-sish £. But these opinions are evidently
  refuted by the unanimous testimony of antient authors, and
  particularly by the experiments and attempts which have been
  made by the moderns to revive this art.
       Thomas Gage speaks of a shell-fish of this kind found in
  the neighbourhood of Nicoya, a small Spanish town in South
 America, which has all the properties of the purple fliell-sistj
 described        by Pliny and other antient authors. The Spaniards
 dyed with it Segovian cloth, which cost twenty crowns
f   er ell.
       About the year 1686, a Mr. Cole discovered on the coast
 of    Somersetshire       a thell-fish of the like kind §. Plumier also
 found at the Antilles the fame species, which he calls piffhtrs,
 because they can spirt the sea water from them to a great
 distance     || .

made by Reaumur* and Du Hamelt-       The latter found a                                          .
buccinum       on the coast of Poitou                    ;    but in particular, certain
balls shaped like an egg, which                              he calls purple eggs, and
which contained   a yellowish liquor.      This liquor, when
dropped on a piece of linen, gave it a pale yellow colour ;
but in a few minutes, to his great astonifliment, it changed to
all the shades of yellow, green, and sky-blue, till it at length
was converted into purple. The experiment must be made
in the open air ; and Du Hamel observes that the sim-beams
contribute a creat deal to the durability and darkness of the,
colour.
   That this       great influence              of

left us of this colour by a Greek female author J, and which,
in all probability, first induced the above writers to undertake
 their experiments.    As the passage which contains this in
 formation §, and which was pointed out to me by a friend,
 deserves to be better known, I shall here subjoin the follow
 ing translation of it :

 this animal (the purple sliell-fish) in the following manner,

     baskets have spikes at the mouth ; for the points                   of  the rushes
     or reeds all run towards each other inwardly, so that, when
     looked at from without, the entrance seems easy, but when
     the fish have got into it they cannot return *. These baskets
     the fishermen let down to the rocks, fastening to the upper
     end of the rope a piece of cork that it may float ; and in this
     manner they are left night and day, and when the basket is
     drawn up it is found to be full of the purple shell-fish.                      The
     animals are then cut in pieces, and when freed from dirt
     are salted ; after          which they     are thrown       into   a kettle    over
    the fire.            When     heated    the  blood separates itself, becomes
    fluid, and begins to throw up scum ; a part of it turns red and
     another blue, and another assumes some other colour.                            If a
    piece of cloth be now put into this liquor, it acquires the fame
    colour after it is thoroughly impregnated with it.
         "     The purple colour does not acquire all its brilliancy till
    it has been exposed to the sun ; for the rays of that luminary
    give       it more brightness,           and render the colour darker;          and
   its splendour,            by the celestial sire, is brought to the greatest
   perfection."
         This      passage, combined with            the newest discoveries and a
   little       practice, might         easily enable    us to prepare purple as
   beautiful as that of the antients. But the perfection to which
   other dyes have been brought, and the dye-stuffs discovered
   in modern times, render this method of dyeing unnecessary.
         One might almost be induced to believe that the antients
   had no other colours besides purple ; but the contrary is
   proved by the whole history of antiquity.                    Nay, it is probable
   that they had other colours before purple, only they were
   either not so durable or so pleasing to the eye, and therefore
  the antient writers did not think it worth their while to fay
   any thing respecting them.
        The Greeks,          about the period       of Alexander     the Great, and
  under his successors, first began to render black, dark blue,
  yellow, and green dyes, &c. more beautiful, and to learn the
  art      of fixing them on linens.                  We find, however, among

 the various companies established             by Numa at Rome, a dyers'
 company, collegium          tinclorum     ; but   these I consider to have
 been at first purple dyers*. Afterwards the art of dyeing con
 tinued to increase among the Romans, and they began to di
 vide colours into general (principales) and particular (minus
principales) , according as they were usual among both sexes,
 or were exclusively worn by either f. Thus the antient au
 thors frequently speak of the colours by which the four dif
 ferent parties (facliones) at the Circensian games were distin
 guished      from each other, and which, on that account, were
 called the color es cir censes.       These were green (color prajinus),
 aurora colour (ruffatus),          ash colour (venetus%),           and white §.
     But the art of dyeing was not confined merely to the Phœ
 nicians, Hebrews, Greeks, and Romans ; it was soon com
 municated to other nations, each of which employed for this
 purpose such minerals and plants as their different countries
 produced.         According to the account of Pliny || and other
 authors, the Gauls who inhabited beyond the Alps dyed the
most beautiful purple and other colours with herbs ; but they
were not acquainted with a method                 of fixing them.            We    are
    * Plutarch in the Life of Numa.
    +  Thus,    for example,  yellow  was commonly       used as the colour     of the
 veils {fiammea) worn by brides on the day of their nuptials,            and peculiar
to the female sex alone. — Pliny, lib. xxi. c. 8.
    \ This, in particular, was the colour of the clothing          of mariners and
 of the fails of (hips.
    § This colour afforded employment in particular to           the   fullones,  who>
washed and scoured white as well as coloured clothing.             For this purpose
they employed urine, chalk, saltpetre, and fumigation with sulphur.               The
processes   to be used were prescribed by a peculiar law    (Lex McleUaua) issued
by the tribune       Metellus in the year    3 54 after the  building of the city.
•They were required, in the first place, to waft the clothes with Sardinian
earth, then to expose them to the vapour of sulphur,             and to scour them
with unadulterated Cimolian earth, (from Cimolus, one of the islands called
the Sporades,) which restored the splendour of the colour that had been
destroyed by the sulphur.       In the last place, they smoothed the pile of the
cloth with the (kin of a hedge-hog or the fuller's thistle (carduus fullonius),
and then pressed it.     A passage in the gospel according to St. Mark, c. ix.
ver.   j, alludes to this process.    Luther translates   the word y/a-ptue
                                                                              (Julio)

told also by Tacitus that the German women manufactured
linen dresses, and dyed them of a beautiful purple red colour.
Some, however, assert that these dyes were communicated to
the cloth merely by dipping it in the blood of men or of ani-                         .
mals.        But this opinion is evidently erroneous ; as it is im
possible that cloth could acquire a good colour by being dipped
in blood ; and because it is highly probable that the Ger
mans would            learn from their neighbours the Gauls, with
whom         they had so much intercourse, their art of dyeing,
which is so highly celebrated by Pliny.
     This writer gives us a very obscure description of an inge-.
niotts mode of dveing, which has a near resemblance to our.
«»tton and flannel printing, practised by the Egyptians. They
applied to the white cloth certain tinctures more or less ca
pable of imbibing the dves (colorem Jorbetttibus medicamentis) t
and which were not visible.                    The cloth was then put into a
hoiler containing the dye or colouring composition (cortina
frgmenti ferventis), and after it was taken out it appeared as.
 ii   painted with various colours.                 These colours never faded;
and the cloth, by the              boiling,     was  rendered more durable *.
     Something of the fame kind is related by Herodotus, who
informs us, that certain people, who lived near the Caspian
sea, by means of the leaves of trees, which they bruised and
 steeped     in water, could form on cloth the figures of animals,
flowers,      Sec. which were as lasting as the cloth itself t.
     The    art  of dyeing       was also     in great esteem among the Per
sians at an early period.                Nay,    the   Persian  dyers, notwith
standing their being Mahometans,                        have chosen Christ as
their patron ; for they have a tradition among them which
 fays that he was of that profession J.                   On this account they
 call    a  dye-house at present             Christ's   work-sliop§.       Among

tation of flowers and birds, that they might serve as marks of
distinction to the high and the low, the rich and the poor,
in his empires.
   More instances which show that the art of dyeing was
held in high esteem at an early period among other nations,
might eatily be 'collected from antient history; but what has
been said is sufficient to prove the great antiquity of   and                             it,

left us       by
          the antients on this subject  exceedingly defective        is
and obscure         :   for their philosophers and historians did not
think         it   worth their while to give     minute description of

men for the purpose of making themselves acquainted with
the processes which they followed in their different arts                                         J.
Even Pliny deserves reprehension on account of this mistaken
pride when he fays
                      " should have described the art of
                                       :       I

J f      Of    all the antient           philosophers none seems to have entertained more
just ideas on this subject than Socrates, who thought that the hand                             of the
artist ought to be guided                 by   the eye   of philosophy, and for this   reason   oftwi

must not, however, be confounded with our alum, for the
antients were not acquainted with the art of lixiviating salts

twelfth century in the east, and therefore the antients com

 3l8          Experiments with Volta    s  Galvanic Pile.
 experiments alluded to in my former communication, I {hall
  now, in compliance with your obliging request, state to you
  briefly such of the results as seem to me most deserving of
 notice.
     ist. When two gold wires, connected with the extremities
 of   a galvanic column containing 400 square inches of zinc
 and 400 of copper, were inserted into the legs of an inverted
 glass syphon    2-ioths of   an inch in diameter and containing
 thirty grains of distilled   water,  the    water in one    leg gave
 oxygen gas, and that in the other hydrogen gas, without any
 apparent diminution of rapidity during a period of 24 hours.
     2d. When the wires were inserted into two glass tubes
 closed at bottom with double bladders, each tube containing
 twenty grains of distilled water, and partially immersed in a
 glass of water ;' the water in the one tube gave oxygen gas, and
 that in the other gave hydrogen gas, without any apparent
 diminution of rapidity as long as the experiment was con
 tinued, which was sometimes upwards of a whole day : but
 when the quantity of water in each tube exceeded not in
 weight seven or eight grains, the production of gas soon began
 to be sensibly retarded, and in nine or ten hours totally ceased,
 though the water in the tubes during the process had lost but
a small proportion of its bulk; and the power of the column,
which was carefully examined from time to time, sustained
no perceptible    degree  of diminution.
    3d. When      the  wires were inserted into the legs of an in
 verted glass syphon containing a solution of white arsenic,
 the fluid contained in one of the legs, namely, in that which
was connected with the least oxydable extremity of the co
 lumn, acquired, in the space of          an hour and     a half,  the
power of reddening the tincture of        turnsol ; a fact which was
expected without any trial by our ingenious friend         Mr. James
Wood.
    4th. When the syphon was filled with a purple infusion
of red cabbage, every thing else remaining the same, the
liquor or fluid in one leg soon became red, and that in the
other    as soon became   green.
    5th. When     the  wires  were inserted into two glass tubes,
closed at bottom with double bladders, each tube containing
                                                               twenty

             Experiments with Vblta's Galvanic Pile.                  219
twenty grains of a purple infusion of red cabbage, and par
tially immersed in the same kind of fluid, the fluid in one
tube soon became red, and that in the other             as soon became
green, whilst the colour        of the fluid into which        the tubes
were immersed       sustained no perceptible change.
     6th. When the galvanic column was placed under an ex
hausted receiver, its power of giving shocks was almost en
tirely suspended ; but it detached from water also in the re
ceiver both oxvgen and hydrogen with a degree of vivacity
remarkably greater than that which            it exhibited when the
whole was placed in the open air.
     7th. When the column was placed without the receiver,
and the water on which it acted was placed within, the evo
lution of gas was seemingly the same              as it  was when both
1vere within the receiver ; and in either         cafe the evolution    of
gas was accelerated      and retarded in a striking degree by dimi
nishing and increasing the atmospherical pressure.
     8th. When a communication was made between the ex
 tremities of a powerful galvanic column containing 800 square
 inches of metal,       a sound  like that of  a small    electrical spark
 was distinctly heard, and a flasti was as distinctly seen every
 time a communication was made, even in the full light of
 the day.
     9th. When the above column was at the height of its
 strength, its sparks were seen in the light of the day even
 when taken with a piece of charcoal held in the hand, the
  body forming the rest of the circuit; yet neither extremity
  of this powerful machine discovered any tendency to attract
  or repel the lightest bodies which were placed in its vicinity.
  Its shocks were greater than a man could well bear.                    It
  maintained its power with little diminution for more than a
  period of eight days, yet it moved not perceptibly a sine linen
  thread which was attracted        by a small piece   of sealing-wax    at
  the distance   of  more than three inches.
      From  these   and other analogous experiments, which were
  repeated,   I think,     with sufficient attention,      we may draw,
   I presume,   the following      conclusions  : — 1st, That    no quan
  tity of pure water can ever be totally changed into gas by
                                  E e 7,                               any

*ao           Experiments  ivitb Volta'i GalvAnic   T'hi
 any known action of the galvanic influence,          ad, That th«
 weight of the gases which any given quantity of water can
 yield to any known action of the galvanic influence, must
 ever bear but a small proportion to the weight of all the water
 employed.      3d, That two vessels filled with water may be
 so exposed    to the galvanic influence, that one of them shall
 yield hydrogen gas and it only, whilst the other shall yield
 oxygen gas and it only.        4th, That, by help of the galvanic
 influence, we can extract at pleasure either hydrogen or oxy
 gen from one and the same quantity of water. 5th, That,
strictly speaking, water is not decomposed by furnishing gas
 to the galvanic influence ; it giving no oxygen where it fur
nishes hydrogen, and no hydrogen where it furnishes oxygen.
6th, That the proportion subsisting between the elements or
component principles of water may be sensibly changed by
the galvanic influence.        7th, That, if the properties of com
pounds be more or less changed by every change in the pro
portions of their principles, the properties of water may be
more or    less changed by a proper application of the galvanic
power.     8th, That water, after being duly exposed for a proper
length of time to the galvanic influence, must certainly de
serve a medical inquiry, as in all probability it will have me
dical powers different from those of ordinary water. 9th, That
hydrogen and oxygen, at the moment of their galvanic separa
tion from water, are peculiarly disposed to a state of combina
tion. 10th, That, at the moment of their galvanic separa
tion from water, both hydrogen and oxygen are disposed to
combine with atmospherical azot ; the one to produce the
volatile alkali, and the other the nitrous or nitric acid.
Iith, That the galvanic separation of oxygen and hydrogen
from water under an exhausted receiver, is probably accele
rated by two causes, a great diminution of atmospherical
azot, and a great diminution of atmospherical pressure.
13th, That, when a galvanic column is placed under an
exhausted     receiver, its power    of communicating     shocks  is
almost entirely suspended ; probably in consequence of the
extremely attenuated fluid surrounding it being a better con
ductor of the galvanic influence than the sentient parts of the

animal frame       :  and lastly, That,  if the galvanic influence     in
some    of  its  properties be apparently analogous to the elec
trical fluid, it differs from it in others in a striking degree.
    These, Sir, are some of the positions which the foregoing
experiments appear to support.          If they fliall happen to afford
you any entertainment, you may probably receive another
supply j and I hope to be also, at some future period, able to
afford you some account        of some trials of the galvanic influence
in the cure and mitigation of various diseases. The galvanic
influence, as you very well know, happily admits of an easy
application to any part of the human body. It may steadily be
applied for any length of time, with very little labour on the
part of the operator, and with less inconvenience on that of the
patient.     Its action may be easily increased or diminished. It
may be rendered, at pleasure, perceptible or not, as the in
dications of cure may happen to require; and I have lately
contrived     a piece of apparatus      by which a succession of gal
vanic shocks, weak or strong, as the cafe may require, may
be given to any part for any length of time at the rate of ten
or twenty per second.
                        I am, with great esteem and regard,

XXVII. Account of "Experiments               made   in  Germany with
    Volta's Galvanic Apparatus.                 Communicated      to  the
    French National Institute       by Dr.  Frulander        of Berlin*.
  A    HE first account of Volta's galvanic apparatus was
communicated to Sir Joseph Banks on the 2d of March 1800,
and the first experiments made in England were undertaken
by Messrs. Carlisle and Nicholson, who, by its means, de
composed water; they also reddened tincture of turnsol, and
precipitated metallic solutions in agids.           Mr. Cruicksliank,
           *  From the Journal dc Pbyjique, Pluviose, an. 9-
                                                                        of

of Woolwich, published in Nicholson's Journal, that                he had
formed the arbor Dianæ,              and  had  reason to believe that he
had produced an acid and an alkali.               Mr. Henry, of Man
chester, said he had decomposed ammonia and fixed alkali,
and had found that air was not a good conductor of galva
nism.     This     is all the information       that had reached us in
Germany through the medium of the French papers,                       and
particularly the Physical Annals, published by Gilbert.
    M. Richter, well known in Germany by his Beitrtige zur
¦nahern kentnifs      der Galvanifmus,       saw the first notice  of it in
the Brussels Journal, and had made the greater part of the
discoveries above mentioned when he received it.                  The fol
lowing is a brief account of what he had discovered up to the
30th of September 1800.
    Exp. I. A zinc wire applied to the eye, and communi
 cating with a piece of some other metal, touched by the
 moistened finger to form the galvanic chain, exhibits to the
 eye looking towards the column a blue colour, which be
 comes    reddish     when the finger is removed. The eye must
 be a little     accustomed      to this experiment before it can be
 fully sensible of the effect ; the phænomenon then become*
 constant.
    Exp.   II. A      frog, galvanised in the usual manner, which           •
 at the end     of half   an hour exhibited no more movement, still
 showed     some after five hours and a         half when Volta's    appa
 ratus was employed.
    Exp.    III.    Gold, the     flame   of  a taper,  heated glass,   and
 rarefied air, are conductors          of galvanism almost in the sama
 manner      as   they are of electricity: they cannot therefore ba
  employed to insulate.
     Exp. IV. When two metal wires are brought together in
  a glass tube, formed almost as in the galvanometer of C. Ro
  bertson, no effect is produced^            The cafe is the fame when
  removed too far from each other.             See Plate V. fig. 1.
     Exp.    V.    Tin,   lead, iron,   copper, or bismuth, placed at <t
  and b, exhibit different degrees         of galvanic force proportioned
  ot the degrees        of the oxydability of       the bodies employed.
  Mercury     and    silver   produce the fame effect.       Gold experU
  ences no oxydation.
                                                                       Exp,

          Experiments with Volta's Galvanic Apparatus.             2*J
I'    Exp. VI. By employing gold on both sides M. Richter ob- I
served that there were formed bubbles           of air arising from the
two wires.         He observed also that the air-bubbles which
 arose from one of the wires were larger than those from the
 other; and he thence concluded that the specific gravity of
 the one kind of air mull be greater than that of the other.
      Exp.    VII. M.    Richter endeavoured   to separate the two airs,
 and for that purpose invented          the   apparatus represented by
 fig. 2. He introduced two gold wires into a marble vessel
 filled with water, and applied the zinc at a and the silver at b;
 the wire a was about an inch distant from the wire b.               He
 closed      the chain,     and  found, after sixteen hours, that the
 bell s, which he had suspended over a, contained one part of
  air ; while the bell w, suspended over b, contained two and
   a half.
       By putting phosphorus into the air s, he saw vapours
   formed, which became more abundant in proportion as the
   operation advanced, and the volume of air at the end of six
  or eight hours was diminished.          There remained only about
   a third part : it is not impossible that a portion of azotic gas
   was disengaged from the water during the experiment.
       The air in    <w,  which occupied about a cubic inch, being
   inflamed     as it passed in large bubbles into the atmosphere,
   detonated     with the same force as a mixture of equal parts of
   hydrogen and atmospheric air.
       M. Richter had placed two glasses, a and z, below the wires:
   that placed under b contained some metallic parts, arising, in
    all probability, from a little copper contained in the gold.
       The two gases when placed together produced water, at
    usual, on an electric spark being made to pass through them.
       Exp. VIII. By employing on the side b, zinc, tin, copper,
    charcoal, and plumbago, M.Richteralwaysobtained hydrogen,
    provided the wire brought into contact with the zinc of the
    apparatus was of such         a nature  as not to become oxydated.
    He   employed also, instead of gold, charcoal, plumbago, and
    crystallised    oxyd of manganese at a and b : the phænomena
    were always the fame as well as when he placed platina at a,
    keeping the gold, charcoal, plumbago, and oxyd of manga
     nese at b.
                                                                    Exp.

  S54       Experiments with Volta's Galvanic Apparatus.
     Exp.   IX.    The  effect is stronger as the wires approach, but
  without    touching each other; and particularly ii the wires
  are of zinc. It is of less strength with gold, and weakest
  with oxyd of manganese.
     The high       temperature    of the water     also  contributes to
  strengthen   it.
     Exp.   X. M.      Richter   observing that the effects took place
  even when the wires were far removed from each other, he
  did not think it probable that a particle of water at the one
  wire, so far distant from the other, would give hydrogen when
 oxygen is produced at the other wire. He therefore asked him
  self whether it was really the fame drop of water that furnished
 the constituent parts, or whether the water was not rather
 the conductor of the galvanic fluid, which produced the dif
 ferent gases by a peculiar composition.              He endeavoured,
 therefore, to separate the two wires by a body different from
 water.     Fig. 3. shows how this was accomplished.
     He filled two tubes with water, and formed a communica
 tion between them by means of a gold wire, c : the two
 wires at the extremities, a and          i, were   also  of gold.    He
 employed in the two fides the zinc and silver           of his battery j
 and, putting his apparatus into action, found afterwards in
 each of his tubes oxygen and hydrogen gas, produced in the
 fame manner as       if there  had been only one tube.
     Exp. XL M. Richter then endeavoured to find a body
which might serve as a conductor of the galvanic matter
without decomposing it.           He found none among the solid
bodies,   as  gold had produced the decomposition of the water.
He employed spirit of wine and sulphuric æther : they pro
duced no air, but were good conductors.             He then took con
centrated    alkaline solutions, which were better          conductors,
but produced gases. M. Richter at length found that co
lourless concentrated sulphuric acid gave no gas, though a
good conductor.          Fig. 4 and 5 show in what manner he
employed it.        The two glass tubes, combined in the form of
a V, being half filled with acid, he made water to flow
gently down the sides of the glass upon the sulphuric acid
until the tubes were silled ; and this succeeded          so  well, that
the fluids did not mix, since a       bit of paper,  tinged with tine-
                                                                    lure

  and b the silver,     of the apparatus ; when brought into contact
   he received   in the tube next the zinc oxygen gas, and in that
  towards the silver, hydrogen e;as.
      Exp. XII. He obtained the fame result by separating the
  two tubes : fee fig. 6. The two tubes were filled half with
  acid and half with water, and one of the gold wires was in
  the acid    and the other in the water.           These two wires im
  mersed in the acid communicated with a third wire,                 and the
  other two with         the  zinc and silver of the battery.         When
  the apparatus     began to operate,      oxygen gas was        seen to rise
 in   the one tube, aud hydrogen         gas in the other.
      To produce     a  contrary effect, nothing was necessary but to
  turn the zinc towards a.
      Exp.   XIII.     M. Richter combined several tubes in this
  manner. (Fig. 6.)          All the wires which produced oxygeft
 were in the water, and al! those which produced hydrogen
  in the acid. The wires in the water in contact with the zinc
 of    the battery gave immediately oxygen gas;              and when the
 zirtc was applied on the contrary fide they gave hydrogen gas.
     Such are the experiments, from which M. Richter concludes
 that the two airs cannot be considered           as  constituent parts of
 water, but      as   two matters     produced by a part of the water
 combined with the galvanic fluid, and that the generation of •
one is in no manner dependent on the production of the other.
     E\p.XlV. M.          Richter filled the tube of    sig. I. with nitric
 acid    mixed with       water:  he employed     two wires of different
 metals, p e, being of copper. The metal began to be dis
 solved ; but, when he brought the tube into contact with his
 galvanic battery in such a manner that they formed a chain,
 the wire of zinc towards a dissolved much sooner; whereas
that of copper towards b ceased to be dissolved.
     Exp. XV. M. Richter filled the tube with                a  solution of
 copper in sulphuric acid.        The two wires were of iron.           The
precipitation     was as usual ; but when         he brought       the tube
into     the  galvanic chaiu the precipitation was increased to
wards a, while it decreased towards           the silver.

mained     as usual; but, when he exposed it to galvanism, the
wire a began to be oxydated, while the -wire at b precipitated
 the copper from its solution. The wires a and b being ot
silver, and the tube silled with          a   solution of silver in nitrous
acid, the effect was the fame.             The lame thing took place in
a solution    of zinc in the muriatic acid when the wires a
 and b were    of zinc.
    Exp. XVI. The fame effect is produced if the affinity of
 the bodies dissolved     is greater for        the acid    than that of the
 wire immersed     in it.
    The wires a and b were of copper, and the tube contained
a solution of zinc; c. and b were of silver, put into a solution ot
copper or zinc ; a and b were of gold, put into a solution of zinc.
    In all these cases there was a precipitation at b, and an ox-
ydation at a. It was not necessary that the wires should be
of different metals. The law was always constant.
    Such is the series of phænomena observed by                 M. Richter.
The celebrity     he has so justly acquired            give3 reason to think
that these experiments have been made with exactness.                      If
the commission appointed by the Institute to pursue this
labour examines and confirms them, it is to be expected that
they will produce changes in the laws of affinity.

it into the river.
     Western bank,        a range   of low   sandy islands, covered     with
a luxuriant       growth     of  reeds.     These at present     narrow the
stream to three quarters, and            in some places to half a mile,
but are overflowed in the rains : the main bank rather low
and sandy,       subject to be overflowed, its whole breadth about
 three miles to the foot        of a range of low woody hills, which
in point of     vegetation    form   an agreeable contrast to the eastern
 stiore: these hills are bounded to the westward, at the distance
 of about twenty miles from the river, by an extensive range
of high mountains clothed with wood to their summits.
     At half past ten A.M. came to the lower town of Rain-
 anghong; a temple in it of the antique Hindoo style of
 building.
      At noon came         to the   centre town     of Rainanghong (lite
  rally, the town through which               flows   a river of earth oil),
 situated on the east bank of the river, in latitude 200 a6'
  north, and longitude 94° 45' 54" east of Greenwich.                  Halted
  to examine the wells of petroleum.
      The town has but a mean appearance, and several of its
  temples, of which there are great numbers, falling to ruins :
  the inhabitant's, however, are well dressed, many of them
  with gold      spiral   ear ornaments,        and  are undoubtedly     rich,
  from the great prosit they derive          from their oil wells, as will
  be seen below.
      At two P.M. I        set off from my boat, accompanied by the
  mewthagbee,       or zemindar       of the district, and several of the
  merchant       proprietors, to view the wells.            Our road led tu
  the cast-north-east,        through dry beds of loose sand in the
   water courses,      and over rugged arid downs and hillocks of
   the fame foil      as described    above   ;  the growth on them con

lastly the hardy b'tar or wild plum, common in Hindostan.
      The    sky was cloudless,                    so   that the sun shone on us with
undiminished force; and being also unwell, I walked slowly;
and as we were an hour walking to the wells, I therefore con
clude they are about three miles distant from the river : those
yre  saw are scattered irregularly about the downs at no groat
distance from each other, some perhaps not more than thirty
or forty, yards. At this particular place we were informed there
are 180 wells, four or five miles to the north-east 340 more.
      In making             a    well,       the    hill      is cut down so as to form a
square       tablet        of fourteen or twenty                   feet for the crown             of    the
well, and from this table                       a road           is formed by scraping away
an inclined            plane for the drawers                      to descend,        in railing the
excavated           earth from the well, and subsequently                            the   oil.         The
shaft is funk          of       a square       form, and lined,             as the        miner pro
ceeds,       with          squares of          cassia      wood      staves    :    these staves are
about        six    feet        long,    six    inches broad, and two thick                         ;   are
rudely jointed,                 and  pinned at right angles         other,          to each
forming        a square          frame, about four and a half feet in the
clear for the uppermost ones,                                 but more contracted below.
When the miner has pierced           or more feet of the sliaft, a
                                                           six
series of these square frames are piled on each other, and re
gularly added to at top ; the whole gradually finking as he
deepens the shaft,                 and securing him against the falling in of
the sides.
      The    soil or strata to be pierced                          is nearly such          as   I   have
described          the cliffs to be on the margin                      of

"strongly    of it.   This, they fay,    is very difficult to work ; and
grows harder as they get deeper, ending in schist or slate, such
 as found covering veins of coal in Europe, &c.               Below this
schist, at the depth       of about 130 cubits, is coal. I procured
 some,    intermixed      with   sulphur and pyrites, which had been
taken from a well, deepened a few days before my arrival,
 but deemed amongst them a rarity, the oil in general flow
 ing  at a smaller depth.         They  were piercing a new well when
 I  was there, had got to the depth            of eighty cubits,   and ex
pected oil at ten or twenty cubits more.
    The machinery used in drawing up the rubbish, and after
wards the oil from the well, is an axle crossing the centre-
of the well,        resting   on two rudeforked staunchions, with a
revolving barrel on its centre, like the nave of a wheel, in
which is a score for receiving the draw-rope ; the bucket is
of wicker work covered with dammer, and the labour of the
 drawers, in general         three   men, is facilitated by the descent
of the inclined plane,         as water is drawn from deep wells         in
 the interior of Hindostan.
    To   receive the oil, one man is stationed at the        brink of   the
 well, who empties the bucket into a channel made on the
surface    of the earth leading to a sunk jar, from whence it is
 Jaded into smaller ones, and immediately carried down to the
 river, either by cooleys or on hackeries,
    When a w.ell grows dry, they deepen it. They fay none
 are abandoned for barrenness.              Even the death of a miner,
 from mephitic air, does not deter others from persisting in
 deepening them when dry. Two days before my arrival, a
 man was suffocated in one of the, wells, yet they afterwards
renewed      their attempts without        further accident.     I  recom
 mended      their trying the air with      a candle, &c. but seemingly
 with little effect.
    The oil is drawn          pure   from the wells, in the liquid state
as used, without variation ;          but in the cold season it congeals
in   the    open air, and always loses something of its fluidity ;
 the temperature of the wells preserving it in a liquid state sit
to be drawn.         A man who was lowered into a well of net
cubits, in my prelence, and immediately drawn up, perspired
copiously at every" pore       :  unfortunatclv    I had no other means

230                 An Account of the Petroleum Wells
of trying     the temperature.        The oil is of a dingey green, and
odorous ; it is used for lamps, and boiled with a little dammer
(a resin of the country), for paying the timbers of houses and
the bottoms of boats, &c. which it preserves from decay and
vermin ; its medicinal properties known to the natives are as
a lotion in cutaneous         eruptions, and as an embrocation in
bruises and rheumatic affections.
     The miners positively        assured me no water ever percolates
through       the    earth  into   the wells, as has be*en supposed ;
the rains in this part of the country are seldom heavy, and
during the season a roof of thatch is thrown over the wells,
the water that falls soon runs off to the river, and what pe
netrates     into the earth    is effectually prevented    from descend
ing     to any great depth by the increasing hardness           of the ole
aginous argil and schist:          this will readily be admitted-when
it   is known that the coal mines at         Whitby are worked below
the harbour,        and the roof    of the galleries not more than fifty
feet from the         bed  of  the   sea: the deficiency    of rain in this
tract may be          owing   to the high range      of mountains    to the
westward, which           range parallel to the river, and arrest the
 clouds in their passage, as is the cafe on the eastern side of
 the peninsula of India.
      Solicitous to obtain accurate information           on   a subject   so
 interesting as this natural source       of wealth, I  had all the prin
 cipal proprietors assembled on board my boat, and collected
 from them the following particulars ; the foregoing I learned
 at the wells from the miners and others.
      I  endeavoured     to guard against exaggeration,       as well  as  to
 obviate the caution and reserve which mercantile men in all
 countries think it necessary to observe when minutely ques
  tioned on subjects affecting their interests, 'and I have reason
  to hope my information is not very distant from the truth.
      The property of these wells is m the owners of the soil,
 natives of the country, and descends to the heirs genera! as
  a kind of entailed        hereditament, with which, it is said, go
  vernment never interferes, and which, no distress will induce
  them to alienate.         One family, perhaps, will possess four or
   five wells ;   I  heard of none who had more, the generality
   have less ; they arc funk by and wrought for the proprietors              ;
                                                                          the

                   in the Bufmba Dominions.                        23 1
the cost of sinking a new well is 3000 tecals flowered silver
of the country, or 3500 ficca rupees ; and the annual average
uet prosit 1000 tecals, or 12J0 sicca rupees.
   The contract price with the miners for sinking a well is as
follows :— For the first forty cubits they have forty tecals, for
the next forty cubits three hundred tecals, and beyond these
eighty cubits to the oil they have from thirty to fifty tecals
per cubit, according to the depth (the Burmha cubit is nine
teen inches English) : taking the mean rate of forty tecals
per cubit,  and one hundred         cubits  as  the  general  depth at
which    they come    to  oil,   the  remaining twenty cubits will
cost 800 tecals, or the whole      of the miner's wages for sinking
the sliaft 1140 tecals; a well of 100 cubits will require 950
cassia staves, which at five tecals per hundred will cost 47 '-
tecals.  Portage and workmanship in fitting them may amount
to 100 tecals more;    the levelling the hill for the crown of the
well, and making the draw road, &c. according to the com
mon rate of labour in the country, will cost about 200 tecals          ;
ropes, &c. and provisions for the workmen^ which are sup
plied by the proprietor when making            a new well   ; expenses
of propitiatory  sacrifices,   and perhaps   a signiorage  fine to «o-
vernment for permission to sink           a new well, consume       the
remaining 5 12 \- tecals. In deepening an old well they make
the best bargain in their power with the miners, who rate
their demand per cubit according to its depth and danger
from the heats or mephitic air.
   The amount, produce, and           wages    of the labourers who
draw the oil, as stated to me,       I suspect was exaggerated or
erroneous from misinterpretation on both fides.
   The average produce of each well per diem, they said, was
500 vifs, or 1825 Ibs. avoirdupois, and that the labourers
earned upwards    of eight tecals each per month : but I appre
hend this was not meant as the average produce, or wages
for every day or month throughout the year, as must appear
from a further examination of the subject; where facts are
dubious we must       endeavour to obtain truth from internal
evidence.     Each well      is worked by four men, and their
wages is regulated   by the average produce of six days labour,
of  which they have one-sixth, or its value, at the rate of one
                                                                  tecal

  ZjZ              An Account of the Petroleum Welts
 tecal   and    a quarter per hundred vise, the price of the oil at
 the wells: the proprietor has an option of paying their sixth
 in oil; but I understand he pays the value in money ; and if
 so,  I think this is as fair a mode of regulating the wages of
 labour as any where practised ; for in proportion as the la
 bourer works he benefits, and gains onlv a3 he benefits his
 employer.        He can only do injury by over-working himself,
 which     is not likely   to happen to an Indian : no provisions
 are allowed the oil       drawers, but the proprietor supplies the
 ropes,   &c;     and, lastly, the king's duty is a tenth of the
 produce.
    Now, supposing a well to yield 500 vise per diem through
 out the year, deducting one-sixth for the labourers and one-
 tenth for the king, there will remain for the proprietor, re
jecting fractions, 136,876 vise, which atlj tecal, the value at
 the wells, is equal to 17 10 tecals per annum. From this sum
 there is to be deducted only a trifle for draw-ropes, &c. for       I
 could not learn that there were any further duties or expense
to be charged on the produce          ; but the merchants fay they
gain only     a neat  1000   tecals per annum for each     well, and
as we advance we shall have reason to think they have given
 the maximum         rather than the minimum        of their profits :
hence, therefore, we may infer that the gross amount produce
per annum is not 182,500 vise.
     Further   :  the four labourers sliare, or one-sixth, deducting
 the king's tythe, will be 2250 vise per month of thirty days,
 or in money at the above price twenty-eight tecals fifty avas, or
seven tecals twelve avas each man per month          : but the wages
of a common labourer in this part of the country, as the
fame persons informed me, are only five tecals per month
when hired from day to day : they also admitted that the
labour of the oildrawers was not harder than that of com
mon labourers, and the employment no-ways obnoxious to
health. To me the smell of the oil was fragrant and grateful,
and, on being more indirectly questioned (for on this part of
the subject, perhaps owing to the minuteness        of my inquiries,
I observed    most reserve), they allowed that their gain was not
much greater than the common labourers of the country :
nor is it reasonable to expect it should 5 for, as there is no
                                                             mystery

or risk of health, no compulsion or prevention pretended,
and as it is the interest of the proprietors to get their work.
done at the cheapest rate, of course                            the numbers that would
flock to   regular and' profitable an employment would soon
               so
lower the rate of hire nearly, at least, to the common wages
of the country : besides, I observed no appearance of afflu
ence      amongst    labourers, they were meanly lodged and
                             the
clad, and fed coarsely, not on rice, which in the upper pro
vinces is an article of luxury, but on dry grains and indige*
nous roots of the nature of cassada, collected in the wastes
by their women and children.   Further, it is not reasonable
to suppose that these labourers worked constantly } nature al
ways requires a respite, and will be obeyed, however much
the desire of gain may stimulate, and this cause must more
particularly operate in warm climates to produce what we
often improperly call indolence! Even the rigid Cato em
phatically fays, that the man who has not time to be idle is
a slave.  A due consideration of this physical and moral ne
cessity ought perhaps                     to vindicate religious              legislators   from
the reproaches               too liberally bestowed on them for sanctioning
relaxation          :   be that as it may,           I  think it is sufficiently appa
rent that the article of wages                       is also exaggerated,     and that
500    vis's   must          only       be considered          as the      amount produce of
working days, and not an average for everv day in the year^
The labour of the miners, as I have observed above, is alto
gether distinct from the oil-drawers, and their pay propor
tioned to the hardships and risks they endure.
  Assuming, therefore, as data, the. acknowledged profit of
jooo tecals per annum for each well, which we can hardly
suppose exaggerated,                 it would expose the proprietors to an
                                        as
additional tax,              and the common wages of precarious em
ployment            in the country,               that   is,   one month with another,
including holydays,                 the year round, four and                 a quarter tecals
per month,              as   the pay         of   the oil-drawers,            which includes
the two extremes                   of    the question,         it   will   make the average
produce of each well per diem 300 vifs, or 109,500 viss
per annum, equal to 399,675 lbs. avoirdupois, or tons
178,955 lbs., or in liquid measure 793 hogsheads of sixty-

government, the gross amount produce of the whole per
annum will be 56,940,000 vise, or 92,781 tons 1560 lbs., or
412,360 hogsheads, worth at the wells, at one and a quarter
tecal per hundred vise, 711,750 tecals, or 889,737 sicca
rupees.
   From the wells, the oil is carried, in small, jars, by coolers,
or on carts, to the river ; where it is delivered to the merchant
exporter at two tecals per hundred vise, the value being en
hanced three-eighths by the expense and risk of portage ; there
fore the gross value or prosit to the country of the whole, de
ducting five per cent, for wastage, may be stated at 1,081,860
tecals, or 1,362,325 sicca rupees per annum, yielding a direct
revenue to the king of 136,232 sicca rupees per annum, and
perhaps thrice as much more before it reaches the consumer ;
besides the benefit the whole country must derive from the
productive industry called into action by the constant em
ployment of so large a capital on so gruff an article. There
were between seventy and eighty boats, average burthen sixty
tons each, loading oil at the several wharfs, and others con
stantly coming and going, while I was there.        A number of
boats and men also find constant employment in providing
the pots, 8cc. for the oil ; and the extent of this single branch
of internal commerce (for                 almost   the   whole is consumed       in
the country) will serve to give sonic insight into the internal
commerce and resources of the country.
      At the wells         the    price of the oil is    seven   annas seven pies
per 112 lbs. avoirdupois;               at the port      of Ranghong it     is sold
at the average rate of three sicca rupees three annas and six
pies per cwt. or per hogshead of sixty-three gallons, weigh
ing 504 lbs. fourteen              rupees seven annas nine pies,        exclusive
of the    cask, or per Bengal buzarmaund                 two rupees five annas
eight pies, whereas the mustard-feed                  and other vegetable oils
soil at Ranghong at eleven rupees per buzar maund.
      To conclude      :    this oil is    a    genuine petroleum,      possessing'
all    the    properties         of coal-tar, being, in fact,       the self-fame
thing;       the only difference          is,   that nature elaborates      in the

XXIX.          Account of       Mr. Mushet's new Method of mating
                              Steel of various Qualities.
.TOR           this invention           Mr. Mushet*              has obtained his           Ma
                        ; and, certainly, few discoveries of
jesty's royal letters patent
so much importance to this country have, been made for a
number of years past. The manufacture of call steel, which
has hitherto been tedious                    and expensive,            is now reduced to a
process    of      a few hours;         and.thc quality of the article at the
fame    time        so   much improved, as to be applicable to many
purposes       to   which    steel of the common manufacture cannot
be applied.              We   shall not, however, dwell on the                        utility of
the invention, but lay before our readers an account of                                         it,
extracted from Mr. Mufliel's specification, which will speak
more to an                intelligent        mind      than would           a        volume     of
eulogium.
   "   The         principles of my process or processes are
                general
the fusion of malleable iron, or of iron ore, in such manner,
and     by   such     means,' as immediately to convert them into
cast   steel   ;    and, likewise, in certain cases, the after cement
ation of this steel to give             it it  malleability, and the property of
welding, in order 'to sit                     for such purposes as require steel
possessing these properties.   These principles can be acted
upon  for the produdtion of  the various qualities of steel in a
varietyof ways but the principle of my invention, and the
                          ;
mode  of operation, may be fully understood      the examples              by
which   I shall adduce, and which will enable any person to
perform  the same, and to vary and alter the mode of operation
according to his intention, and the particular quality of steel
 he may wish to manufacture.
   " Thus,          cast steel    may be made                 by   taking any convenient
 quantity of malleable iron, according                         to the size      of   the furnace
 and crucible orcrucibles to be employed, and                             introducingitinto
 the crucible            or crucibles         along with           a   proper proportion of
 charcoal, charcoal dust, pit-coal, pit-coal dust, black lead, or

2$6                Ne-w Method     of m. king  Steel
plumbago, or of any substance containing the coally or car
bonaceous principle ; but, in general, charcoal,pit-coal, or pit-
coal cokes, especially if prepared in the manner herein after
described,   will  be found to answer best.      For this process not
only bar iron may       be employed, but also what is commonly
called scraps, or waste iron : but, when the latter is used, a
little more carbonaceous matter must be added to the mixture,
to revive   the   rust,  or oxyd of iron, adhering to the scraps.
The mixture in       the crucible   or crucibles must then be put
into a furnace capable of giving a sufficiently intense degree
of heat to run down or fuse the mixture, which must then be
poured out into bar, ingot, or other moulds, according as the
manufacturer intends to produce bars or ingots, or various
articles or utensils that are, or may be, made of cast steel ;
for the whole iron, by fusion with the charcoal or other sub
stances or things containing carbonaceous matter, will be
found to have pasted into the state of cast steel.        If cast into
bars or ingots, and a proper quantity of charcoal, or other
substances or things containing carbonaceous matter, has
been employed, such bars or ingots will be found in a state
ready to take the hammer, and to be drawn or rolled into
other sliapes, according to the intention of the manufacturer.
In some cases, especially where a heavy charge is to be run
down, the crucibles must be previously properly disposed in
the furnace, and the mixture           introduced into them after
wards.
    " By   the  process    before  described,  and   which may      be
varied with circumstances by any prudent operator, call steel
may be made in a few hours, which, by the process or pro
cesses hitherto discovered,       has usually required many days,
and sometimes weeks; for cast steel, by the common method
of manufacture, has been hitherto made from bar steel,
which    had previously required,      for its own conversion     into
that state, from the state of bar-iron, or of scrap-iron, a
tedious cementation with charcoal, in a furnace constructed
for the purpose, and usually known among manufacturers
by the name of a converting furnace.
    " It cannot here escape observation, that this is not the
only faying in point of time and expense, gained by my pro
                                                                  cess

                        of various Qualities.                     237
cess  or processes ; for, when I meet with or procure iron
stones   or iron-ores sufficiently rich, and free from foreign
mixtures, I save even the time and expense necessary for the
conversion of such iron-stone or iron-ore first into cast or pig-
iron, and afterwards by a tedious and expensive process,
accompanied with a great waste of metal, into bar-iron.
For such ore or iron-stones, being previoufly roasted or
torrified, when that process may be found necessary, which
will often happen, may be           substituted   for the bar-iron,
scrap, or waste iron, as before      described,  and the result   will
be cast-steel,   if a proper quantity   of charcoal, charcoal-dust,
pit-coal,   pit-coal-dust,     plumbago or black lead, or of
any substance containing         carbonaceous matter^ has        been
used.
   "  For the common and ordinary qualities of cast-steel, a
much smaller quantity of carbonaceous matter is requisite in
the mixture than perhaps could have been suspected before
my invention.       When charcoal from wood is employed, a
seventieth  to a ninetieth    of the weight of the iron will gene
rally be  found sufficient.     When the quantity of the carbo
naceous    matter or principle exceeds one seventieth, and is
increased to from one sixtieth to one fortieth or more of the
weight of the iron, the steel becomes so completely fusible
that it may be run into moulds of any shape, and be capable
afterwards of being filed and polished. Hence by casting
may be constructed stoves, grates, kitchen utensils, many
kinds of wheels and mill works, a great variety of small
machinery, and many other articles, which could not be so
 made by the processes now in use, and which way           of making
such articles constitutes    a part of my invention.
   " By   my process    various  kinds of steel, differing as much
from each other in their qualities as the various kinds of pig
or cast-iron differ from each other, can be formed by merely
varying the proportion of carbonaceous matter.              Cast-steel
of the common and ordinary qualities is too volatile when in
fusion to admit of being run into any shape except straight
 moulds of   a considerable    diameter  ;  but steel of such density
 as to admit   of being  cast into any form may be produced         by
 my process, by increasing the quantity of charcoal, or matter
                                                           containing

    338                   New Method of making Steel
containing the carbonaceous principle, and then fusing the
mixture as before directed. When I wish lo produce qualities
of steel softer than is usually manufactured by the common
    processes,   I    find it best to     proportion of charcoal,
                                        use a small
    sometimes so little as a two hundredth part of the weight of
    the iron.  Steel produced with any proportion of charcoal,
    not      exceeding a hundredth,               will generally be found to
    possess    every property necessary           to ils being cast into those
    stiapes   which require      great elasticity, strength, and solidity.      It
    will also be found generally capable of sustaining a white
    heat, and of being welded like malleable iron ; and, indeed,
    as the proportion of charcoal or other carbonaceous matter is
    reduced, the qualities of the steel will be found to approach
    nearer to those of common malleable iron.
         "   By further pursuing the principle of my new invention,
    I  fuse down malleable bar or scrap-iron in a crucible or
    crucibles, without any visible addition of carbonaceous mat
    ter, and run it into bar, ingot, or other moulds.     In this
    state the     metal is nearly of the fame quality as when put in,
    only      altered by the combination of a small portion of
'
    carbonaceous          matter,       which
                                     the iron by its chemical
    affinity attracts from the ignited fuel, or from the ignited
    carbonic gas of the furnace, and which enters by the mouth,
    or through the pores of the crucible or crucibles, probably
    dissolved in caloric at a very high temperature. But whether
    so dissolved or not, the fact      that is,
                                            portion of the carbon
                                                       a
    passes    from the   sire into union with the iron, and thereby
    converts     itinto an extremely soft steel.
          " Besides the different modes of operation above specified,
I        further reduce iron-ore, bar-iron, or scrap-iron,        the     by
    addition of lime or chalk, or other carbonats, or of carburets,
    with clay, glass, and other fluxes, in various proportions,
    and form all the various qualities of steel formerly enume
     rated.
          " If
             the various kinds and qualities of steel obtained by
     the process or processes above mentioned be introduced into
     the common converting or other steel furnaces,        contact   in
     with  carbonaceous   matter, or with earths, and heated for
        five days, or more or less, according to the thickness            of    the
                                                                               bars

                       of various Qualities.                        239
bars or other forms, and the quantity introduced, the bars,
ingots, or other shapes, being then taken from the furnace,
will be found to possess all the solidity which they formerly
were possessed of as cast-steel, with that property of welding
peculiar to blistered, faggot, or German            steel of  the usual
mode of manufacture.
    " By  this invention   I obtain    steel  which for solidity may
 be used for the purposes     of  cast-steel ; uniting     at the fame
time the property of welding, without destroying the solidity
or quality of the metal : — a circumstance of the highest im
portance to our manufacturers.            Ingots, bars, plates, and
every shape   into which   this steel is  cast, rolled, or hammered,
will   be possessed of uniformity of quality, without those
numerous reeds, flaws, bisters, and disjoined laminae found
in steel made by the processes in use before my invention.
   " When pit-coal cokes are to be used in any of the foregoing
 operations, either in mixture with the ore, or with the iron,
 or for fuel in the furnaces, in which the crucibles containing
 the mixture are exposed to the action of the sire, it is of the
 utmost importance that the cokes be properly prepared.
 The process which I have found to answer best for this pur
 pose,  though common cokes will also do, is founded upon
 the principle, that all access of oxygen to the coals to be
 coked, should be prevented : this end is gained by preparing
 the cokes in iron vessels, in the fame manner as wood is now
 charred for the purpose of being employed in the manufac               -
 ture of gun-powder.      The bitumen, or coal-tar as it is com
 monly called, which is volatilized from the coals to be coked,
 by the heat, applied to the exterior of the iron vessel or other
 chamber containing the said coals, is thus saved, instead of
 being burnt or dissipated in the atmosphere, as is the cafe in
 the common process of coking, in which the coals are
 exposed to combustion in open heaps, and which also par
 tially, though in a less degree, takes place in the process
 xommonly     known by the name of Lord Dundonald's              process
 For preparing coal tar."

A«.S      I   propose to examine in this memoir the vital power,
I    have thought proper, in order that the subject may be ren
dered easier,       to take vitality at that period              of life when the
number        and   complications of its functions                   are the least;
that is to fay, in the embryo             : — it   is then reduced              to simple
nutrition and       a speedier increase.
     We                           with the powers by which
          are as yet little acquainted
the embryo    is animated and expanded j the only object of
the observations hitherto made on different kinds of eggs
and feeds,      was to prove or refute the system              of the pre-exist-
ence    of germs or      at most to throw              light on the formation
and expansion of some of their parts. It is on this power,
however, with which living bodies are endowed, and the
action of bodies which have some influence on                             it,    that the
phænomena of life         depend.
  But how comes          it   that certain agents            which        act with so
much energy on adults seem to have no action on the foetus,
since the vital power and thtjlimnlus employed are the fame?
Is there then at certain periods of life, particular stimulus,
                                                         a
destined to act on particular organs               ?    or does sensibility         vary-
in   the different periods     of life   ?
   In support of the first hypothesis we might take light,
for example, which appearing to be one of the vivifying
principles of animals and vegetables, seems, however, to have
no influence on the expansion of germs, since the greater
part of them pass the first period of life in obscurity.
  But   ifwe suppose   different sensibility in the various states
                          a
of life, we                that the vivifying principle of the
                shall observe
animal ought to be more energetic in proportion as                                 it   is
nearer its source, since the whole space passed over ought to
be at the expense os the force employed to make                       It   pass.
   One of the first modifications under which the vital power
presents itself   that of irritability
                    is                    and  ;      exactly during

may say, the most          impatient irritability       is observed.     But
why docs a stimulus so powerful as caloric, in a certain dose>
extinguisli the life of the adult, without altering, or, at least,
without     altering much,        the    life  of the   fame    animal still
in embryo?
    We    have as little knowledge respecting          the action of gases,
odoriferous or narcotic effluvia, miasmata, Sec.                 In a word,
there would be many agents to examine by applying them
to animals externally; but I shall confine myself to an ex
amination      of  the   principal     ones, and     in the simplest     and
easiest   manner.       1st, Has     light any action on the embryo
still contained in the egg?           Is its action useful or prejudicial
to it?
    To   decide   this question, I took on the 5th of December
 1796,    sour glass jars    of the fame size, two of which I co
vered with a coating        of black wax, and I put into each an
equal quantity      of  the  eggs of the fbalecna difpar Linn. 1
closed each     of them with a pierced stopper, through which
I   inserted   a bent tube, coated in the same manner, to
maintain      a free   communication          between     the  internal and
external air, preventing,         as  much     as possible,   the passage  of
light into the coated jars.        I   then placed in a northern expo
sure a black     jar   and a transparent       one in a situation where
the   sun   had no access      ; the other two were exposed to the
south, that is to fay, to the most powerful action of that
luminary.
    In both places the greatest cold during winter was + 1SI0
Fahrenheit, and the greatest heat towards the north, that at
the period     of  the birth   of   the caterpillars, was + 66°, while
towards the south in the fun it was             as high as + 109;°.
    On   the   aoth    and  aist   of   April 1797, when the eggs of
these phalænæ were not hatched in the fields, on visiting my
black jar towards the south, I sound the greater part of the
eggs already hatched; the small caterpillars had ascended to
the highest part of the neck of the jar, to which they had,
no doubt, been attracted by some rays of light that, not
withstanding my precautions, penetrated through the benjt
tube. On inspecting at the same time the other jar towards
    Vol. IX.                                II h                          the

 84*                 Experiments and Ohfervations
 the south,     which    was   transparent,     I  found only one egg
 hatched.      In another     small   transparent bottle, which con
 tained   some thousands       of  eggs,  there were only five capable
 of being hatched,      as all the red had perished.           I removed a
 bit of the black coating from the jar, that I might be able
 to observe the caterpillars j I left it exposed to the sun along
 with  its companion,      and   I  can assert, that after       that" period
 not one of the eggs was hatched,                if I except the first and
 second day, when a few came forth.
    The   speedier hatching      of  the eggs in the coated        jar might
 be ascribed to the greater degree       of   heat  it experienced, if the
 air contained in the jar had not had free communication
 with the external air.
    The jars    exposed to the north, in such a manner as to re
 ceive   only   a reflected   light,   must    inform us whether this
 light was equally sensible to the tender germs. On the aist
 of April, indeed, I found several of them already hatched in
 the black jar, and three days after they began to become
 animated in      a paper cornet, in which I kept a great number
 of them    shut up, and it was not       till the  end   of five days that
 they began to be hatched in the transparent               jar    exposed to
 the north.
    I repeated these experiments in 1798,            with this difference,
 that I varnished my glasses with oil colours, and that to the
 black transparent ones I added others covered with red and
 white paint.
    The    results  were equally decisive, since at noon I saw all
 the eggs contained in the black jar hatched first, then a great
 part of those in the white, but none of those I left in the
transparent      one;    on the     contrary, they soon assumed a
pearly grav      colour, which      I found bv experience to be a
certain sign that the eggs were no longer susceptible of being
hatched.
    The remaining      eggs contained in the red jar and the white
one towards the       south became also gray, and incapable of
being hatched.          The experiment         was    attended      with the
fame success      towards the north,     since the first hatched were
t|)ofe in the black jar, then those in the red and white ones
                                                                      almult

                  on the Vitality and Life of Germt.                      itf
aJmost at the same time          :  those     in the  transparent   one were
the last.
    To    answer    an objection that might be made, that the
different varriislies produced a considerable difference in the
heat in the glasses, (though this difficulty can have no rela
tion to those exposed to the north,) I prepared, on the
                                                                           5th
of February 1798, two bent glass tubes, one of them varT
niffied black, and put into each about a hundred of the
fame eggs.         These I inserted in a pretty large bottle, not
varnished, silled with water, which I took care frequently to
thange, left it should become corrupted, and exposed them
to the south.
    On the ist of March the eggs began to be hatched in the
black tube, and eight days after in the other ; before the
end ot the month
                         94 were hatched in the black tube, while
in    the   transparent    one     there     were   only 41, the remainder
having become gray, that is to fay, having perished.
    The considerable anticipation in the birth of the cater
pillars in these tubes ought, in my opinion, to be ascribed
to their being immersed in water, where they were not
 liable to changes of temperature so violent, since the cold
 was not greater than it had been the preceding year, and
 as the water contained in the bottle, during the greatest heat,i
 did not exceed 66° above zero; while in the jars exposed to
 the sun      it rose to •+¦ 88      and    + 109,    but towards the north
 it was only from + 55° to -+- 65, a temperature sufficient to
 hatch the eggs of these insects; and as the present year this
 degree     of heal    had   been experienced more than usual,                it
 appears      to be very    probable that it is not a certain period
 of time that is necessary for hatching, but a certain degree of
 heat.
     I  repeated     the  fame      experiments on the phaltena mori
  Linn, (the silk-worm)        :    the results were      perfectly analogous
  to those above mentioned.            . I   (hall not enter into all the de
  tails, but relate those which            I   made on the eggs    of a fort of
  spider.
     These eggs being covered onlv with a very thin pellicle,
  appeared to me very proper for the experiment ; and besides
 this, the attention with which                  the mother envelops     them,
                                         HI)      1                         and

344                    Experiments and Observations
and conceals them in the crevices              of   trees,   prepossessed    me
in their favour.
  On the 26th of March 1 800, I put on two pieces of white
paper several of these eggs, which I covered with small bells
of very thin glass, taking care to leave a small aperture at
their summits to maintain a circulation of air.   I varnished
one of them black, and exposed them to the south.
  At the end of some davsi the esss
                                 CO which were under the
transparent bell became coloured and dry, and all those
under the black bell were hatched on the nth of April.                          I
repeated on these eggs the experiments of the tubes im
mersed     in water,        and   the result   was equally decisive,        since
I   saw hatchednot only all the eggs contained in a bent glass
tube covered   with a very thin plate of lead, but still they
preceded others which, -though placed also in a dark place,
were not immersed in water.
    In   regard to those contained in the transparent              tube, they
all perished. At first they exhibited no sensible sign of any
change : afterwards they began to become a little coloured ;
they then daily assumed a redder colour, but they did not
perish altogether till the last days, during which those
in the covered tube were hatched.
  From these different experiments    we may therefore con
clude, that light has a decided action on those germs which
are exposed       to    it;   that this action   is  prejudicial    to them    ;
and, in the last place, that        it   manifests its action
                                                     retarding   by
their expansion     the light be weak, or
                       if                  reflected light, or
                                                       a

                                                 if   it
that which comes directly from the fun.
  To these facts  add, that the expansion
                       if
                       I                   of viviparous ani

germs three different ways; either by the desiccation                         it may
produce by too much heating the bodies exposed to     or by                  it;
favouring new combinations between the almost  liquid parts
of the germ, in such   manner as to destroy their natural
                               a
disposition   ;   or, in      the    last     place,    because,    being itself     a
stimulus, that    to fay, an agent capable of affecting vitality
                       is
different ways,    may, it           by
                              the violence of its intensity, or
the continuation of its action, extinguish (he vitality, as all
stimuli too violent or too long continued exhaust the subject
on which they act.
  It may be readily seen                  that the first hypothesis, that of
the desiccation produced
                    ,                    bythe light of the fun,     void of
                                                                        is
all foundation,          as   is   proved      by   the black jars exposed          to
the north, and the tubes which were kept immersed                        in water.
   In regard        to      the influence which
                                        light may have on
germs,    by             or producing new combinations,
                  facilitating                                                      it
certainly deserves to be examined.  It may, indeed, be easily
conceived that     new disposition of the parts, contrary to
                        a
that which      necessary for the exercise of life, cannot take
                  is
place without  destroying it; and we know           the different  by
experiments of Hunter, how much power the vital principle
has to cause the germs of the eggs of fowls (which are easily
injured   by  frost when the vital principle    destroyed)   to
                                                              is
resist cold with efficacy.
    Harvey, and several other philosophers, have also observed
that the egg will keep as long as the membrane which con
tains the germ        sound
                         is     and various observers have re
                                     ;
marked,   that the   vital principle can even make the feeds of
certain plants resist the injury of ages.
   Infects which are susceptible of kind of resurrection are
                                                    a
so only as long as the vital principle exists in them,                              by
the means of which they resist the agency of destructive
powers; but,       if    these powers derange their organization,
                                                           they
irrecoverably lose the faculty of resuming new life. That
 to fay, in these animals, as in germs, the vital principle                          is is
always essentially united to   certain disposition of organiza
                                         a
tion, which        is    not changed till after the destruction of the
vital force.
                                                                                    It

i.ifi                Experiments and Observations
    It appears to me then that light            destroys the vital prin
ciple of germs, and that         after   its destruction new combina
tions are formed.
    The colour, indeed, which             the eggs assumed during my
experiments, never manifested itself without the destruction of
life, and it never showed itself till the light had exercised on
them a pretty strong action.
    The total exhaustion of vitality effected by light, ought
not to be different from that effected by other stimuli ; that
is to fay, light weakens the germ, and consequently retard*
its expansion: in a word, by weakening and exhausting it
it cxtinguisties its life ; which is perfectly agreeable to what
we have observed in eggs retarded in the process of hatch
ing, or which perished, according to the intensity of the
light   they had received.
     It might be conjectured that the light affects chiefly the
 nervous substance of the tender embryos, because we know
 the vehemence       with which      it affects,   and   in a  very   severe
manner, our retina, when its action on it is too long conti
 nued. The existence of the pupillary membrane in the
 foetus, and the pain experienced          by young animals when first
 exposed     to the   light,  are further      proofs in favour of this
 hypothesis.      In my    eggs  I  could discover on the head of the
 insect those two hemispheres, with facets which afterwards
 formed the eyes of the insect ; a proof of their advanced or
 ganization.
     However plausible this reasoning might be, I was desirous
 of putting it to the tost of experiment. As vegetables have
 no nervous substance destined for feeling, they appeared to
 me proper for this purpose.            I  therefore   took French beans,
  (phastohis vulgaris Linn.) chick peas, (cicer arietinum) lu
 pines, (lupinus al bus) and moistened them till they began to
  (how signs of germination.          I then removed the bark, and
  put them thus peeled into glass tubes with a little water.
  I immersed these tubes in a bottle of very thin transparent
  glass filled  with water ; some of the tubes I had wrapped up
  in  a plate  of lead, to ihclter them from the light of the fun,
  and they were all kept at the fame temperature.               I  first ob
                                                                       served;

                  on the   Vitality and Life of        Germs.             247
served    m all the tubes a more rapid germination;                I  saw the
seeds   in the transparent tubes become equally yellow, but
afterwards they began to putrefy without any further siga
of vegetation : on the other hand, the feeds contained in
the tubes darkened by the plate of lead became yellow also ;
but, assuming afterwards a darker colour, they in a little
time became green, threw out roots, expanded their coty
ledons, and appeared in full vegetation. As the smallness
of the tubes did not permit them to expand more, as soon as
they filled the whole capacity of them they ceased to veT
getate.
    The   different   degrees    of vegetation to which these feeds
 attained, showed        that   light may have an influence on the
 seeds of vegetables,      though destitute of nervous substance ;
 but, that I might be fully convinced of this fact, I proceeded
 in  the following      manner;
    I  put some feeds of lupines and chick-peas, freed from
 their bark, and in a state of germination, into two bot
 tles, furnished at the bottom with a little tow moistened
 with water.       I  removed      from the coated bottles a little of
 their varnifli on one side, in order that, being illuminated in,
 that part, I might be able to observe through the aperture
 the vegetation of the seeds without being obliged to take
 them out.
    The   feeds at first continued to vegetate equally            in  the twq
 bottles, aud to throw out roots            ; but  I soon observed that the
 extremity of the small roots of the feeds contained in the transr
 parent bottle began to assume a colour more and more dark,
 and they at length putrefied altogether. As some expansion of
 the germ of the plant took place at this period at the ex
 pense   of  the cotyledons,      and    as the   latter were moistened, it
 happened      that the     expansion      of  the   germ "did not totally
 cease, though       it  was   very     slow.     The principal     root even
 threw out some small roots           :  but they     soon rotted    with the
 rest ; so that, after having languished some time, the vegeta
 tion  ceased   altogether.
    In  the varnished      bottle the     case was   different: all the feeds
 vegetated completely,        sent forth numerous roots in the tow,
  aud only two feeds gave any sign              of putrefaction    at the ex-
              8                                                        tremity

 tremity of their principal root, while in the other parts they
 were sound and vigorous, some of the plants even rose to the
 summit of the bottle: in a word, I did not see any difference
 between      these plants and those which           vegetate   naturally in
 the earth, except that those in the dark bottle had the stem and
 small roots longer and whiter, and the cotyledons greener.
     From      these observations     there is reason     to conclude,    that
 if philosophers       have been long acquainted        with the influence
 of light on vegetation, they knew but imperfectly * that the
 first degree of vegetation, that is to fay, the expansion of the
 germs of plants, requires obscurity like that of the germs of
 animals, since light is evidently prejudicial to them.
     If we recollect that the feeds of vegetables are all covered
with a pretty hard opake bark, we (hall be inclined to be
lieve that this bark is not only destined to defend them fronv
the prejudicial influence of the air, gases, 8cc. but also to
shelter the tender and sensible germ from                the   action  of  the
solar light,      which would make them perifli.
     I  shall    terminate this memoir with a remark which has
occurred        to  me    in regard     to the life  of embryos. In my
opinion,       the vital power     of embryos    is expanded    in a manner
 very    simple    and common to all germs, and             the  only object
of it     is the expansion       of those organs, the exercise      of which
is to form afterwards real life.            Though    these organs all exist
in the embryo, they have scarcely any influence on the actual
life.      The facts which induce me to entertain this opinion
are, that the feeds of vegetables, destitute not only of eyes
but even of a nervous system, arc nevertheless affected by
light as well as the germs of animals.
     Observations made on the respiration of the eggs of ani
mals have stimvn me also that these eggs, during their ex
pansion, absorb oxygen gas; if this gas is not supplied to
them,       their expansion is suspended;          and this respiration     or
rather absorption of air may be accelerated or suspended
by accelerating or checking the influence os the oxvgen,
which has an influence on the expansion of the germ.

this absorption is in the ratio of the evolution of the germ.
At this epoch of life, however, as the tracheæ of plants
and animals do not seem to be proper for respiration, I am
of opinion that,       as the' germs which       formed the object of
my experiments were sensible to the light, though destitute           of
organs designed for feeling, these young beings, these germs,
absorb the air into those vessels which are one day to be their
organs    of respiration.    Germs,    in expanding, live then and
 feel m a new manner which is peculiar to them.
                           Additional   Note *.
     It has been long observed       in gardens, in hot-houses and
 hot-beds, that a sudden and strong light often destroys in an
 instant the young plants which have appeared.               There are
 none, perhaps, which dread more the cold and the light than
 the germs of the larch, and some other Alpine plants which,
 however, remain nine months of the year under the snow,
 and the other three under a scorching sun and the serenest
 sky.    They have need of being flieltered during their infancy,
 like the plants of the Cape.           Would the cafe be different
  with the human race ? It appears that general rules, like
 the maxims of philosophers, are every day contradicted by a
 kind and provident Nature, which knows to yield and to
 put herself within the reach of every being, and, without
  starts or agitation, to watcli over their preservation.      Nothing
  less than direct experiments can check the influence of opi
 nion, which, in consequence of the eloquence or reputation
  of great men, hurries away the indolence or indifference of
  the multitude.       Those of Dr. Michelotti, which are really
  original, raise up a corner of that veil which covers the
  mysteries    with which Nature is pleased to conceal her pro
  ductions.     They are a leilbn to mankind on the danger of
  deducing consequences too general from particular facts. In
   a word, they teach us, what it would appear good fense
   ought to have inspired long ago, that the first, the most use

XXXI.       Memoir on the Quantity of Vital Air in the Atmo
    sphere,  and the different Methods of measuring it. By
     M. Anthony de Marti, Member of the Royal Aca
    demy   of the Arts and        Sciences at Barcelona.
T,    HE       celebrated    Hales observed that common air, when
exposed with other substances, was reduced to a smaller vo
lume.   Dr. Priestley advanced further in this matter, having
discovered by his experiments that nitrous gas causes a dimi
nution in air more considerable according as it is more proper
for respiration ; and on the other hand, that inflammable air,
mephitic air, and other aeriform fluids incapable of main
taining animal life, do not in the like manner diminish ni
trous gas.  Other philosophers afterwards observed this di
minution of air proportioned to its purity by means of liver
of sulphur, a paste made of sulphur and filings of iron moist
ened with water, by the combustion of inflammable air, and
bv that of phosphorus. These substances, which absorh the
respirable air to the exclusion of other aeriform bodies which
may be mixed with         have served as the means of ascertain
                            it,
ing  the  purity of every kind of air whatever.  Different kinds
of eudiometric proofs have been employed: ist, That of ni
trous gas 2d, That of sulphuret
           :                           3d, That of paste of sul
                                          :                a

                                                           :
phosphorus.   But have all these proofs been carried to such
a degree of perfection as to render them equally convenient
and correct? This examination will form the subject of this
eflay, which will naturally lead me to the analysis of atmo
spheric air.
    This air   is   constantly    found more or   lessimpregnated with
different heterogeneous bodies, and             particularly water, the
quantity of which M. De Sauisure has shown us                  a   method
           4                                                           of

                    Vital Air in   the Atmosphere.                 25  1
 of measuring.      But it contains also two aerial        substances,
 vix. vital air, and mephitic air or azotic gas.
    In  a former memoir, publislied in 1787,         I mentioned the
opinion of Mr. Cavendish, that the vital air at London forms
nearly a fifth part of the atmosphere ; so that 100 parts of at
mospheric air contain 20 of vital air and 80 of mephitic air.
Dr. Priestley thinks that the quantity of vital air is between
C20 and 0*25. Scheele, who made his experiments at Stock
holm during the year 1778, found that the quantity of vital
air is between 0*24 and CV30. Lavoisier and other chemists
at Paris are    of opinion that it is nearly 0*28.        From some
experiments of Senebier there is reason to infer that the air
of Geneva varies some hundredth parts, and that its portion
of vital air exceeds CV25. But other observations made in
Europe, which are entitled to some confidence, seem to have
proved that atmospheric air contains not more than 30 per
cent, of vital air, nor less than 20. When I transmitted to
this Society, in the month of June 1787, my Observations on
the Vital Air of Plants, I announced that the common air
which    I  had breathed at    Altafulla, my native place, during
the four preceding months, was of from 97 to 100 degrees ;
vix. that ico parts of nitrous air and an equal quantity of
common air, mixed in the manner of Ingenhousz, were re
duced 100 or 103 ; consequently, from 97 to 100 parts had
disappeared.      Since that time       I have continued my experi
ments on the fame subject,        both     by this and other proofs,
to ascertain whether this small inequality might not arise
from circumstances attending the operation rather than from
the nature    of the air.
                       Proof   by  Nitrous    Air.
   The proof by nitrous air          is   that which   chemists   have
chiefly endeavoured      to bring to perfection.     Fontana, Priest
ley, Ingenhousz, and several other chemists, have made many
experiments to accomplish that object; but this method pre
sents many difficulties to be overcome.
   1st,  The water in which       the    experiment is made is never
pure.     It contains a greater or less quantity of oxygen, azot,
and carbonic acid, which it is not easy to determine.

      3d, The nitrous air is in part absorbed by the nitrous acid
which is produced.
                             Proof       by    Inflammable Air.
      It   is then demonstrated                that the eudiometric            proof made
with nitrous air is imperfect.                         The     second proof,    of which I
must speak, practised by the means of inflammable gas, from
its being an aerial body like nitrous gas, will be subject also
to the same imperfection.    For this reason I have not only
given over using      but, in considering the discovery of Mr.
                             it,
Cavendish, that     quantity of mephitic air may unite with
                             a
vital air in the state of ignition,   must observe that,  Ithe                         in
proof       by      inflammable air, which                is   burned with the air sub
jected to examination, the whole portion of vital air con
 tained in the latter may not only disappear, but     certain'                    a
quantity  of mephitic air be absorbed, unless the two airs are
entirely free from                it,   which cannot be known without great
difficulty       ;    and   it   will   be necessary to calculate how much
inflammable and azotic gas the residuum contains, to be able
to ascertain, with sufficient exactness, the quantity of vital air                                  *>

                                   Proof       by   Phosphorus.
   It      is    better that the substance employed for deter
                therefore
mining  the purity of the air sliould not be gaseous, nor                                  in   a
state of combustion.    For this reason phosphorus, recom
mended              by   M. Achard            as    proper for eudiometric            proofs,
though          a   solid matter,       may be liable to the same inconveni
ence; for not only the vital will lose its elastic form, but                                a
part of its mephitis air will be absorbed.
                   a Mixture byIron and Sulphur.     of
          Proof
   The proof which seems to be subject to no error,    that                           is
 by  moistened mixture of sulphur and filings
      a                                       of iron.  At
first Iemployed this method as much as that            sulphurct,           by
judging, with other philosophers,     that   they were equally
 proper.    \» true,
                 It  indeed, that both  these  substances absorb
only that portion of vital air which                       is   contained   in   the atmo
spheric air, leaving the mephitic                         air untouched     ;    and thus,
                                                                                            by

                     Vital Air in      the Atmosphere.                 253
by measuring the residuum of the quantity of air employees
the quantity which has disappeared, and which can be no
thing but vital air, will be determined. During some days
of the year 1787, in which the common air experienced no
variation by the means of nitrous air, since 100 parts of each
were uniformly reduced to 99 or ioo, I was desirous of
making      a comparative        trial   of the   fame   common     air by
means    of iron    and sulphur,       and  I observed that   of  100 parts
of air  there remained from 79 to 81, and that, consequently,
from 19 to 21 hundredths had disappeared.                 On similar days
I  exposed 100 parts      of atmospheric air         to liquid   sulphuret,
and found     that the air lost between         21  and 23 parts.    From
this circumstance of always finding the results of the last
proof higher, I began to suspect that sulphuret, and a mix
ture  of iron   and sulphur, ought not to be employed indiffer
ently, but that the former ought to be preferred.                  When I
recollected,   indeed,   the   observations     of Lavoisier on  the form
ation of the vitriolic acid, and those of Dr. Priestley, that a
paste   of sulphur     and   filings of iron gave inflammable air in
certain circumstances; I knew that during the absorption of
vital air the latter unites itself with the sulphur, producing
by the combination sulphuric acid, which, in exercising its
action on the iron, produces a little inflammable air, which
ascends to join itself to the azotic gas remaining in the upper
part  of  the vessel after the operation ; and though there really
disappeared from 21 to 23 parts of vital air which enter into
the composition of too parts of atmospheric air, it seems that
only from 19 to 21 were really wanting; since, besides the
077 or 079 of mephitic air, 01 or o-2 parts of inflammable
gas united themselves         also,    from which there      resulted from
079    to o*8i.      It appeared not only from the experiments of
common air, but from those also of another kind very supe
rior,   such  as   that extracted       from the American agave, that
a very small     quantity  more      was   diminished by sulphuret than
by the mixture of iron and sulphur; so that air, extracted
from that plant, with proper precautions, is so pure that some
 times it is found free from every other aerial substance, and
is absorbed by the sulphuret without the residuum of a hun
dredth part,
                                                                      Proof

                              Proof      by Sulphuret.
   The proof by sulphuret is that best calculated to ascertain
the quantity of vital air contained in any gaseous fluid, since
it will leave the mephitic air, and the other kinds of air which
do not combine with               it,   without     fear
                                                      gaseousof any other
substance being produced, or any lost, except the quantity of
vital air, which alone has an affinity with the sulphuret, as
I assured myself    1787. A hundred parts of atmospheric
                         in
air exposed to sulphuret lost between O'zi and C33    and as                 ;
several other proofs on the fame air, made with nitrous gas,
had taught me that     experienced no sensible variation,

was then convinced that the air which we breathe in Cata
lonia    constantly composed of from O'li to 0*23 of vital air,
         is
and, from C77 to 079 of azotic gas.     To ascertain whether
there might not be variations afterwards in the proportion of
these two principles which constitute in the atmosphere that
                  which our life chiefly depends,
elastic substance on                                                        I    conti
nued my experiments               by
                       means of sulphuret.
     In order      to shorten the operation,             I     provided some glass
flasks of different sizes, each ending in                    a  narrow neck, and
furnished with       ground stopper.
                     a                   silled one of them with
                                                  I
liquid sulphuret of lime, and, having immersed the neck of
it in water,       Iintroduced into               it,
                                         with the utmost speed,
through    its orifice,    portion
                              a    of atmospheric  air. The flask
being then stopped was shaken for     little time, and on exa

          it            found Iits diminution   complete. My
researches were soon after directed towards determining the
respective quantities         of air     necessary to be introduced to that
of the sulphuret, not only that           I   might learn the shortest pos
sible means of being able to                 effect my proofs, but also to
ascertain whether they would be equally correct    made with           if
alarge or   small portion of vital air.

stopped and immersed in the same liquid, contained in a
vessel.      Several  other experiments gave me the fame results.
      A   fourth part of a measure of common air, shaken with five
measures or twenty times its volume                       of sulphuret, lost o-a6.
I     supposed     that this substance,               except the 021 or 0'22 of
vital air, which composed         the atmospheric air, had absorbed
also 0-5 of its mephitic air.                     I
                               thence concluded, that if                                I
should shake another equal quantity of common air in the
same sulphuret,           which by the preceding manœuvre I consi
dered as already united        with all the mephitic air it could take
up, it would not decrease more than from 0*21 to 0*33; and,
indeed, this was the result.   I immediately introduced an
equal quantity of mephitic air, which sustained no loss by
the agitation of the fame sulphuret, which must have been
already impregnated with it. But on shaking this mephitic
air in a flask containing also five measures of sulphuret, differ
ing from the other only in this, that it had not been before
shaken      with any air, it         lost     005     ;    which is the difference of
21 and      26.     It   is therefore         evident      that sulphuret is capable
of containing    a certain portion of mephitic air; and the
more it is deprived of    the greater will be the absorption of
                                   it,
atmospheric air. This fact was proved by the following ex
periment :— filledI     flask, capable of containing five mea
                               a
sures, with sulphuret newly made, and still in    state of ebul        a
lition, and which, consequently, was free from gaseous mat
ter   :   and without giving    time to absorb any,
                                         it             corked             I           it
up, and when         had cooled
                     it            introduced the fourth part of
                                          I                                             a
measure  of atmospheric air, which being regularly shaken
from three to five minutes, lost 0-50 that to fay, one-half;      is
of the whole.            In this   cafe then, besides the           o-ai,   it   absorbed
0*29      of mephitic air      ;   and   I     really found this to be the cafe,
by    trying one-fourth        of   a    measure          of mephitic air, which was
shaken      in           with fresh sulphuret, in every thing
                 the same flask,
similar to the former.  The hundredths wanting between
39 and 50, which are 21, indicate the quantity of vital air
only which had disappeared in the proof of the atmospheric
air. After this    may be easily conceived that this air will

  I shall now proceed to explain my method of operation,
which, after several trials, appeared to me the simplest and
the most correct. I have employed it for a long time without
having observed the difference of a hundredth in the results.
  My whole apparatus is a glass tube five lines in diameter,
and ten inches in length              :    it   is closed at one    of   its extremities,
and divided on the side               into 100 equal         parts, each of a line,
and which         all      together       are capable      of containing about an
ounce of water.              As the common air                is found every where,
to take a quantity corresponding to the                       ioo divisions nothing
is necessary but to sill the tube with water, keeping it in a
perpendicular position, with the aperture downwards.. The
finger applied to the aperture must be removed at intervals,
and the tube inclined a little, by which means the external
air, if the tube be at the surface of the water, will enter it ; and,
when it occupies the ioo lines, it must be stopped, keeping the
orifice closed by the finger. The tube must be immersed in the
water tub, that it may aflume the same temperature. When
it            it must be examined whether the air
      is taken out,                                                             surpasses
or not the space of ioo lines, to take away or                                  add      the
quantity necessary to make it stand exactly on a level with the
place where the divisions begin.     I then introduce this air
in the        usual     manner into             a flask   containing     from twice to
four times its volume of liquid fulphurct of lime, previously
impregnated with azotic gas.    I then stop   and sliake  for      it,              it
 five       minutes   ;   after   which    I       transfer the air back into the
graduated         tube, and        find that the             aeriform      fluid,   which
 before occupied ioo divisions exactly, occupies, after the opera
 tion, only 79;  and, consequently, 21 parts have disappeared.
 If the graduated tube ends in neck with ground stopper,
                                                  a                 a

                                  may be first silled
  by    proceeding           operation will be speedier, without
                          as above the
 having occasion to employ water, or to introduce air into the
 flasks, and to transfer it.   To try another respirable air,
 however, not atmospheric, similar transfers are indispensable,
 as  evident, and they may be executed with the greatest con
      is
 venience,       by   means of Fontana's small measure.
                                                                                          In

                        Vital  Air   in the Atmosphere.                    2$J
    In examining vital air, such as that which issues from
plants exposed to the sun, it sometimes happens that the
eudiometric proof must be performed with a small quantity :
if the air collected occupies only the space of 25 lines,
instead     of a hundred, it is evident that a hundredth instead of
a line      will correspond to a fourth part of one ; but in por
tions    ofair still  less, as the divisions would be insensible,       a tube
of a   less  diameter must be employed. With this precaution,
and that of not forgetting to fliake the sulphuret before with
mephitic       air, in order to saturate it fully, and of employing
flasks proportionally less, those who have acquired the prac
tice and address necessary for such experiments will never find
the difference of a hundredth part.
    I repeated them so many limes with atmospheric air, and
on so great a number of days that the uniformity in my
 results demonstrates not only the exactness of this method,
 but it seems to result           from my observations          made   on the
 southern coast      of this province       :
     1st,   That   the    wind never        caused the variation    of a hun
 dredth part in the respective quantities of vital air and azotic
 gas which compose the elastic fluid of our atmosphere,                   since
 I  have    always found that a hundred parts contained 79 of
 the latter and 21        of the former, without ever reaching at 23.
     2d, That neither the moisture nor dryness as the atmo
 sphere,     nor the     state  of    the   latter in being more or less
 charged with exhalations, nor serene or rainy weather, occa
 sioned any difference.           It cannot be denied that, in an equal
 space     of  the   atmosphere,        as  the   aeriform   fluid contains a
 greater portion of water dissolved, and more impregnated
 with other heterogeneous bodies, there cannot be found the
 fame      quantity of air free from foreign matters; but the
 number 21 of the vital part, found lo many times in the two
 cafes, shows that the elements which constitute its elastic
 portion,    so valuable and     so abundant, are respectively invariable.
     3d, That the proportion of the quantities of the two fame
 principles was equally constant during the days that Reau
 mur's thermometer stood at the freezing point,                     as well as
 during those when it indicated 24 degrees of heat.

         If    the   greatest         variations in the heat and pressure of the
-
    atmosphere            observed        in this country did not occasion any
    variation        in    regard         to the     respective     quantities of the two
    aeriform fluids which compose                         it,   neither did the dilatation
    or               of the same common air, which
           compression                                      in the                      is

    occasion anv difference.  The mephitic air being the only
    one of all the aerial substances which     found incapable of  I
    being combined with water, this unalterabilily suggelted to
    me the idea of composing     permanent instrument for ascer

    air experiences cither from one of the two causes above indi
    cated, or from both of them united.                          I   took     a   glass tube        of
    a  small diameter, and, having filled     with water,    then  it                    I

             which was divided into hundred equal parts. This

    small tube       Iput into another larger one containing also water
    to   a    determinate and constant elevation, and which was left
    open to receive the impressions made                           by     the variation       of   the
    atmosphere, which, pressing more or                            less     on the column of
    mephitic air, made                 it   extend   in  proportion, and with much       so
    exactness        and permanency,                 that at the end of some months
    it   retained the fame dimensions,                          which the barometer and
    thermometer mowed to be those corresponding to the degrees
    of pressure and heat. This simple instrument enabled me to
    correct, with the          precision, the error which some
                                       greatest
    times arises from the difference in the dilatation of the air
    which   examined, and which might readily occur during

    the change of dilatation does not take place, the number

Open fields, to be always composed of from 21 to 22 parts of
vital air, and of from 78 to 79 of azotic gas; and if at any
time, which however very rarely happened, the result varied
a few hundredth parts,     the succeeding experiment, which I
 could repeat with the greatell facility, and in a few minutes,
soon detected the error. I was convinced that this small dif
ference did not arise from the nature     of the air, but from some
negligence in the operation.        I have often collected air in,
places where a great many persons were assembled, or near
ponds of stagnant water, and I always found this air as pure
as the   common air.
   Tt  cannot be denied      that stagnant    water, the surface "of
which occupies      a considerable   space, may produce insalu
brious effects; but it appears no less certain that insalubrity
cannot arise from the disproportion between the vital and
mephitic air in the atmosphere; for the difference was not
sensible   by a hundredth part.      It is well known that three
different kinds of air are disengag&d from stagnant water,
viz. mephitic air, inflammable air, and carbonic acid gas;
all incapable of maintaining animal life: but we must sup
pose that these fluids arc disengaged in bubbles and in a very
small quantity in regard to a great extent of atmospheric air;
that the last, being more ponderous than common air, must;
be immediately precipitated, or combine with the water sus
pended    in it; that the second, being lighter, must rise to the
higher regions   ; and, in the last place, that the first being of
equal   density  must rapidly penetrate and lose itself in the
immense space.
   It would therefore excite no surprise if all these aerial sub
stances should alter the quantity of the elastic portion of the
atmosphere, so that the difference      should become perceptible
by some hundredths in the proportion between the quantity of
vital air and that of the other fluids it is capable of contain
ing; but if this variation in air, collected in places where
emanations of non-respirable .kinds of air are known to exist,
does   not rife to  a hundredth part, how is it poslible that, at
a great distance from the sphere of the activity of these partial
causes, there should be greater variations, which some philo
sophers pretend to have observed not only in different month-;,

  but at different hours of the fame day ? It must certainly h*
  ascribed   to the imperfection of our instruments, or to some
  negligence in the mode of operation, if considerable inequali
  ties are sometimes observed in the purity of the air around
  US; and repeated experiments give me reason to think that,
 wherever there is a free communication with the vast recep
  tacle  of the atmosphere,   the air which we breathe       will always
 be found to consist    of from   crii  to 0*22  of vital air, and from
 078     to 079 of azotic gas, provided it      be examined with the
  precautions which I     have here pointed out.
      If eudiometric proofs    are   not sufficient for explaining the
 dangerous effects experienced        in the neighbourhood of stag
 nant waters, the cause might perhaps be found by analysing
 the water that floats in the atmosphere. The observations of
 Berthollet    prove that volaii^ alkali is composed of azot and
 hydrogen deprived of caloric, or of that principle which be
 fore kept them separate in an elastic form, and we know that
 these two fluids are disengaged from stagnant waters: may
 we not then presume that its alkaline portion, always the
fame in its modifications, is in part decomposed ; and that a
 large quantity, 11 >t decomposed, either alone or combined
with some other unknown substance, is eagcrlv absorbed by
the water, as its putrid smell in evaporating seems to indi
cate; and, consequently, remaining dissolved in the portion
of water suspended in the neighbouring air, it produces cer
tain alterations in regard to animal life?
     It is not impossible to collect such a quantity of -this water
as to be able to examine it : the products given by the means
of analysis, compared with        those  of other water    suspended in
air contiguous to running water, might serve, perhaps, to
make known the cause of the insalubrity of stagnant water,
Kudiometric experiments have not been able to throw light
on this difficulty) and have taught us only that we ought not
to ascribe the insalubrity of certain places to the existence in
the atmosphere os a quantity of aeriform fluids too great for
that of vital air.
     Hut though this proportion does not vary a hundredth part
in the course of several months, and even years, may it vary
a very small part, such       ao a  thousandth part, which aster        a,

very long time may become sufficiently sensible to make the
proportion of the vital air of the atmosphere experience a
progressive or periodical increase or diminution           ?   The   expe
riments which        I  have   hitherto   made    are   not sufficient to
enable   me   to ascertain   whether    there be    such  a difference of
some thousandth parts, and this could not be known even,
by employing more considerable portions of common air and
very long tubes.        Observation, indeed, shows that sulplniret
may contain, interposed between its particles, a certain portion
of mephitic air,    and we do not know whether it            mavnot   vary
some small part ; besides, the particles       of  the water, which arc
more or    less adhesive    to the inner surface      of the tube, what
ever care may be taken, difference          of temperature and other
causes united,     though they can be        so  far avoided     as not to
have   in the resust of the operation the error of a hundredth
part, are capable of occasioning, sometimes, others less con
siderable, such as of a thousandth part, unless a degree of
attention of which few persons arc capable be employed.
    Though we may consider, as exact, in general, the ana
lysis of natural productions carried to that degree of perfec
tion yielded by eudiometrip proofs; yet it is not impossi
ble, for several reasons, that greater exactness might be at
tained to resolve the proposed question. Those would cer
tainly be iu an error who should calculate the loss of vital
air produced in the atmosphere from the causes of its deT
Itruction already known : they would certainly find it ini-,
 possible that many years could elapse without its becoming
perceptible ;     the    quantity which animals consume being
very great, as well as that consumed by combustible bodies,
with which it combines during the act of combustion. Con
sequently,     posterity would be forced to respire an air more
charged with mephitic gas than that which we breathe at
present.     But we are not entirely ignorant of the means
 which the Divine Providence employs for restoring that
active fluid to the common receptacle, viz. plants acted upop
 by the rays of the fun. It is not, however, possible to calculate
the quantity of the vital air which the atmosphere recovers
 from that quarter.       We have reason to expect that the ob
servers of nature will discover other causes of the addition of

the atmosphere, to compensate                         the   losses   it sustains,   and    to
maintain constantly the quantity requisite for the preservation
of the inhabitants of the earth, without producing a conti
nued increase or diminution in the aerial substances of which
the atmosphere is composed.  What disorders might ensue
if a few hundredth parts of vital air only were wanting?
Fire would            lose its strength,            candles would not diffuse          such
complete light,              and animals            would with
                                                             difficulty              receive

atmosphere, on the other hand, were more charged with vital
than mephitic air.  Animals indeed, by these means, would
acquire a freer  respiration ; but let us only consider the-
activity which fire would acquire by air of superior purity.
We know that, on some occasions, the least spark excites the
strongest          combustible body, and which increases
                flame in      a
so much as to consume it in a few moments: candles then
would be no sooner lighted than they would be destroyed,
without answering any other purpose than that of dazzling
us for a few moments : iron would be calcined, instead of
acquiring from the sire that softness neceflary for transform
ing it into various instruments, and which it cannot receive in
a more moderate heat.      Nothing would be capable to check
the progress of this destructive element, which is nourished
  b*y         this aeriform substance 'were not abundantly
        vital air,     if
mixed with mephitic air, which serves to restrain it.

pressed   that this change is produced. The method of dis
posing grapes to fermentation varies in different countries;
but as the differences occasioned in so essential an operation
rest on certain principles,       I  have thought it proper to mare
them known.
    We    are  informed by Pliny (De Irio vim apud Grtrcos
clarilJimo),   that the     grapes were collected a little before
their maturity;      that they were dried by being exposed to the
ardent sun for three davs, turning them three times every
day, and that on the fourth they were expressed.
    In Spain, particularly        in the environs of St. Lucar, the
grapes are left exposed      lor two days to the full ardour of the
fun.
    In Lorraine, part of Italy, Calabria,             and the island of
Cyprus, the grapes are dried before they are               expressed.    It
is in particular when white sweet wines arc to             be made that
the grapes are dried, to thicken             the juice, and thereby to
moderate the fermentation.
    It appears that the antients were acquainted not only with
the art of drying the grapes in the fun, but even that they
were not ignorant of the process employed to boil aud con
centrate the must; on which account they distinguislied
                                                                            '
wines    into   three   kinds, pajjum, defrutum, and sapa.            The
first was   made    from  grapes    dried   in the  fun;  the second was
obtained by reducing the must one-half by the means of
heat; and the third, from must so concentrated that there
remained no more of it than            a  third or  a fourth.    For very
interesting details respecting these operations the reader may
consult Pliny and Dioscorides.             These methods are still used
at present, and we (hall show, when we come to speak of
fermentation,      that it may be directed and managed in an
advantageous      manner by inspissating a portion of must, and
afterwards mixing it with the remainder of the mass; we
shall (how also that this is an infallible method for giving to
all wines    a degree    of  strength    to wh\ch the greater part       of
 them cannot otherwise attain.
    Agriculturists were long divided in regard to the question,
whether it is most advantageous to free the grapes from the
stalks or not ?      Each of these methods has its partisans, and
                        8                                          writers

writers     of merit may        be quoted  who have supported bosh*
In my opinion, in this as well as in other cafes, both parties
have been too exclusive, and by bringing back the question!
to its real point of view it will be          easy   for us to terminate
the difference.
     It is certain that the stalks      are harsh    and austere,    and  it
cannot be denied, that wines produced from grapes not freed
from the stalks do participate in that quality : but these
are weak and almost           insipid wines, such as the greater part
of    those made      in  moist   countries, where the slightly harsh
talte of the stalks heightens the natural insipidity of that be
verage.       Thus, in the Orleanois, agriculturists, after freeing
the grapes from the stalks, have been obliged to abandon
this method, because they observed that the grapes freed from
the stalks furnished wines more inclined to become oily. It
results also,     from the experiments of Gentcl, that fermenta
tion proceeds        with more force and regularity in must mixed
 with    the stalks    than    in  that which     has    been  freed   from
them      ; so that in this point of view the stalks may be consi
 dered as an advantageous           ferment in all cafes where it is to
he apprehended          that the fermentation may be too flow or
 retarded.
      In  the environs     of Bourdeaux the red grapes are carefulfy
 freed from the stalks when it is proposed to obtain good
 vine. But this operation is still modified according to the
 degree of the maturity of the grapes.             It is much employed
 when the grapes have little ripeness, or when frost has taken
 place before their being collected ; but when the grapes are
 very ripe, it is performed with lei's care.            Labadie observes,
 in the information with which he has supplied me, that the
 stalks must be left to facilitate the fermentation.
      White    grapes are never freed from the stalks;        and experi
 ence proves, that grapes separated from the stalks give wines
  less  spiritous, aud more susceptible of becoming oily.
      The stalks, no doubt, add neither to the saccharine prin
  ciple nor to the aroma; and in this double point of view,
  they cannot contribute by their principles cither to the spi
  ritous quality of the wine or to its flavour, but their flight
   austerity may correct, with advantage, the weakness of some
                                                                     wines   j

wines ; and besides, by facilitating    the fermentation, they
concur to effect a more complete decomposition of the must,
and to produce all the alcohol it is susceptible of yielding.
  Without wandering from the subject in question, we may
consider wines also under two points of view, according td
the uses to which they are applied. They are all employed ei
ther as a beverage or for distillation. In the former, qualities
are  required which would be useless in the second.       Taste,
which forms almost the whole merit of the one, adds no
thing to the qualities of the other. Thus, when wine is
destined to be distilled, it is necessary to pay attention only
to the means of developing a great deal of alcohol : it is of
little importance whether the liquor be tart or not ; in this
cafe,       to free the grapes from the stalks would be lost labour.
But        if wine is prepared for a beverage, it is then necessary
to give it an agreeable taste and a delicate flavour, and for
this purpose, care must be taken to avoid every thing that
may alter these valuable qualities. On this account, there
fore, it is necessary to withdraw the stalks from the fer
mentation,            to   pick   the   grapes,     and   to    clean them with
care.
      It   is,
          probably, in consequence of     knowledge of these
                                                          a
effects, which experience every day places before the eyes of
the agriculturist, rather than from caprice or habit, that in
certain countries the grapes are freed from the stalks, and
that this pr6cess    omitted in others. To attempt to re
                             is
duce the whole to one general method would be mowing
ignorance of the effects produced    the stalks in fermenta
                                                     by
tion, and of the difference which exists    the various qua    in
lities of the grapes. In the south,                  where the wine          is   natu
rally generous^ the stalks would                     only add        a   disagreeable
harstmess        to   a  liquor already     too     strong     by   its nature.     All
the grapes,           therefore, destined         to form wines for the tablew
are freed from the stalks,              while those destined for distillation
are fermented with them.     But what may appear astonishing
is, that in different parts of the fame canton in France, we
fee some agriqulturists free their grapes from the stalks, and
extol their method, while others in the neighbourhood,
equally skilful,           reject this practice, and endeavour to sup-

port their method by the result              of their experience.      Th«
one makes wines more delicate, the other wines of a stronger
quality ; both find partisans of the liquor which they pre
 pare : but this is a matter of taste, which does not contradict
the principles we have here laid down.
    In general,     a fork    with three prongs, which the work*
man      turns   and   agitates in a circular manner in the vat
 where the grapes are contained, is employed for freeing
them from the stalks.           By this rapid motion the stalks are
 detached from the grapes, and, being drawn up to the fur-
 face,   are removed     with the hand.
    They may       be freed from the        stalks also by means of a,
 common      sieve  formed of osier twigs, distant from each other
about half an inch, and having above it a close osier pad or
presser, about four inches thick.
    But whether the grapes           be freed   from   the stalks or not,
it is indispensably necelsary         to tread them,     in order to facili
tate the fermentation,          and this process is performed as the
grapes are collected and brought               home from the vineyards.
The operation is nearly the            fame   in all the wine countries,
and is performed, for the most part, in a square box, open
tit the top, arid about A yard and a half in breadth. The sides
consist of wooden bars, with intervals of such a size that
the grapes may not pass through them.                 This box is placed
on the vat, and         kept in its position by two beams resting
on     the edge of the vessel.            The grapes are poured into
this box as they arrive from the vineyards, and are immedi
ately trod, in a strong and equal manner, by a man, having
on his feet large wooden clogs, or strong (hoes.               While em
ployed in      this  labour,     he   rests with   his  two  hands  on the
edge    of the box,     stamping with rapidity on the stratum of
the grapes,       while the expressed juice runs into the vat
through      the   interstices     left between     the bars.     Nothing
remains in the box but the pellicle and stalks of the grapes;
and when the workman finds that all the juice is expressed,
he raises a plank, which forms a part of one of the sides of
the box, and pusties the skins and stalks with his foot into
the vat.      This door     slides   in two grooves, formed on two
perpendicular bars.          As   soon as the box has       been  cleaned,
                                                                     anew

                    and (be Method   of making    twines.             267
a new quantity        of grapei  are introduced     to be trod     in the
same manner ; and this operation is continued             till  the vat is
full, or until the vintage is terminated.
    In    some countries the grapes are trod in tubs.           This me
thod is perhaps better in regard to the effect than the former,
but it is flower, and cannot be employed in countries where
the vineyards are of great extent.
    There are some countries also where the grapes are poured
into the vat as they come from the vineyards ; and when fer
mentation begins to take place, the must, which floats on the
surface, is carefully removed        in order    to be conveyed to the
 casks, where the fermentation is completed.              The residuum
is then squeezed under a press, to form wine of a higher co
 lour and less flavour.
     In general, whatever      be the method      employed in treading
 the grapes,       what concerns this important operation may be
 reduced      to the two following principles :
     Grapes cannot experience spirituous fermentation unless
 the sugar be extracted by proper pressure, in order that it
  may be subjected to the action of those causes which deter
  mine the movement of fermentation.
      It  follows from this fundamental        truth, that not only the
  means proper for treading the grapes ought to be employed,
  but that the operation will not be complete unless all the grapes
  are equally pressed ; without this the fermentation can never
  proceed      in an uniform manner     » the period   of the decompo
  sition of the expressed juice would terminate even before the
  grapes which escaped being trod upon had begun theirs, and
  there would thus be produced a whole, the elements of which
  would no longer bear relation to each other.              However, on
  examining the product deposited in the vat after the treading
  is finished, it will readily appear        that the compression       has
  been always unequal and imperfect          ; and by reflecting a mo
  ment on the rude processes employed for treading the grapes,
  there will be no reason for being astonished at the imperfec
  tion    of the  results.
       It  appears,   then, that to give to this very important part of
  the labour      of  the vintage the necessary degree of perfection,
  it would       be necessary lo, submit to the action    of   the press a'J

                              in a vat,
 taneous fermentation. By this method alone the movement
 of decomposition would be exercised on the whole mass in
 an equal manner ; the fermentation would                        be uniform        and
 simultaneous in regard to all the parts; and                    the signs which
 announce, accompany, or follow        would      it,           not be difhirlied
 or obscured         by
                particular movements.     The                   must, freed from
 the stalks and husks, would no doubt produce wine less co
 loured, more delicate, and more difficult to be preserved; but
        the inconveniences        of this method
it if
                                                        exceeded the advantages,
    would be easy to prevent                thein       by   mixmg     the expressed
 refuse with the, must.
        In         of these principles, care ought to be taken
             consequence
 to fill the vattwenty-four hours. In Burgundy the vintage
is  terminated        in in
                 four or five days. Too long time would be
 attended with the disagreeable inconvenience of      successive         a
 series of fermentations, which, on that account alone, would
 be all imperfect       portion of the mas* would be already fer
                          ;   a
 mented, while the fermentation would be scarcely begun in
 another.    The wine thence resulting would then be           real            a
 mixture of several wines more or less fermented.          The in
 telligent agriculturist, therefore, anxious for the quality of his
 products, ought to determine the number of the vintagers ac
 cording to the known capacity of his vat; and when unex
 pected rain makes him suspend the labour of collecting the
 grapes, he ought to leave to ferment separately the juice of
 those alreadycollected and placed in the vat, rather than run
 the hazard of exposing himself some days after to the danger
 of interrupting its movements and altering                      its nature     by   the
 addition of frpsti and aqueous must.

  exist    in  a natural state, and must be obtained by the asli              st
  ance    of art.    It   is one  of the constituent parts     of the nitrous
  acid   ;  and it would be nitrous acid itself,           were it not de
  prived of a large portion of its oxygen, which makes it cease
  to be an acid.          It is composed with the same base as that of
  the nitrous acid,        which is azot holding in       a state    of gas two

parts of oxygen ; that base being combined with caloric. In
this state it is not soluble in water ; but if you furnish it with
a third part of oxygen, by combining with that excess, it
becomes acid, and        very   soluble in water.      If   in one part
therefore of azot there are only two parts of oxygen, it is
merely a nitrous oxyd ; which is the base of nitrous gas ; if
there are three      parts of oxygen, it forms fuming nitrous
acid;    if there be four parts, the result is white nitric acid}
These two last compounds are acid, and perfectly soluble in
water ; the first is neither acid nor soluble.
    "  It may easily be shown, both by analysis and synthesis,
that the base of the nitrous acid is azot combined with
oxvgen, but not to saturation, which would make it nitric
acid.     1st, By analysis. Nitrous acid may be decomposed
by making it act on some metal (copper, for example) which
takes from     it a part of its oxygen, and    reduces    it to the state
of nitrous    gas ; if you then expose this nitrous gas over an
alkaline     sulphuret which will deprive it of the rest of its
oxygen, nothing will remain but azotic gas, therefore, &c^
 ad, By synthesis.       Mr. Cavendish formed nitrous acid by
exposing seven parts of pure air and three of azotic gas to
the    action    of the electric fluid ; the azot combined with
the oxygen of the pure air, and the result was nitrous acid :
the base of nitrous gas therefore is azot combined with'
oxygen,
    ff Nitrous gas therefore may be obtained from the nitrous
or nitric acid, made to act on combustible matters. These
 matters combine with a greater or less portion of the oxygen
as the acid, while the azot, which retains a part of the
 oxvgen by combining with caloric, forms nitrous gas, which
 pastes into the ball placed to receive it.       The substances pro
 per for this purpose are iron, copper, brass, tin, silver, mer
 cury, bismuth,      and  nickel.    It may    be   extracted     also by
 means     of gold   and antimony from       the   nitric acid, which
 makes    a  component part in the     nitro-muriatric acid employed
 to dissolve these metals.        It may be extracted also from the
 nitrous acid, by making it to act on alcohol,                ether, oils,
 resins, gums, charcoal, sugar, Sec.

metals.   There are some, however, by means of which you
extract only azotic gas, because they seize on all the oxygen
Of the nitrous   acid employed. The flask made use of to
cause the acid to exercise an action on the metal ought to be
entirely filled with the former, because, if any air were left in»
the gas in disengaging itself would combine with the oxygen
of the pure air, and this combination, dissolving in the
liquor, would occasion a vacuum which would permit the
water of the tub to pass into the flask.
     " Nitrous gas is a little heavier than atmospheric air : its
specific gravity is to that of air as 105*35 is to 100, and to that
of distilled water as 13*0170 is to 10000.          cubic inch of         A

as   may be easily proved by agitating            it in that liquid.
     " It
        gives no sign of acidity, as it does not redden blue ve
getable colours ; nor does it combine with alkalies unless it
be mixed with air, for it then becomes acid by seizing on the
oxygen            of the air.

     Nitrous              gas     speedily    destroys      plants and animals im
mersed in it;  and it extinguishes burning bodies, first making
the flame assume a green colour.
   " If nitrous gas be mixed with atmospheric air, it becomes
red, and has the odour of nitrous acid ; as may be easily
proved  by diffusing a little of it through the air: it then ab
                    of the air, combines with

the air be of a good quality.               What remains under the ga*
seous form is nothing but azotic gas.               The heat produced on
this occasion       is owing to the caloric         of these fluids, which
assumes the free state.           If,    instead  of atmospheric air, you
mix pure air with the nitrous gas, viz. two measures of gas
and one of pure air, the redness will be much more intense,
the heat produced far greater, and the mixture will be almost
entirely dissolved in the water.
    "  It may be here seen, that by means of this gas we can
ascertain   the salubrity of the air; for it combines only with
oxygen, or the base of pure air, which is the only respirable
part of the atmosphere.                Air subjected to this test ought
therefore to be considered          as so much        fitter for respiration,
according     as the   quantity of it absorbed is greater.
    " The water in which this mixture of nitrous gas                 and pure
air is dissolved,       becomes       liquid   nitrous acid ;    so much the
stronger    the   less   it contains of water,          ist, It  reddens blue
vegetable colours ; it is therefore acid : 2d, This acid unites
and combines with alkalies, and forms with them detonating
nitres  : it  is therefore    nitrous acid.        To   prove   this, affix to
the bottom of      a  bell-glass some concrete carbonat of ammonia
tied up in    a  small piece of gauze, and place the bell on the
flielf of a  pneumatic tub in such a manner that the bell may
be two-thirds filled with atmospheric air, while the other
third contains water.           If  you then make nitrous gas to pass
into the bell, the mixture will immediately assume a red co
lour : an effect produced by the combination of the gas with
the respirable part of the air.               By this combination the gas
has become nitrous acid.                You will then perceive a great
deal   of white vapours arising from the combination of this
acid with the carbonat of ammonia.                   These vapours are af
terwards     condensedj      and    crystallise.    The crystals collected
will  fuse on burning coals, and therefore              are nitre.

cited, during which the muriatic acid will be converted into

           " Mercury     or Quicksilver — Hydrargus, P. L.
     "   Scarcely any substance is so liable to adulteration          as
mercury,       owing to the property which it possesses of dissolv
ing completely some of the baser metals. This union is so
strong, that they even rife along with the quicksilver when
distilled.      The impurity of mercury      is generally indicated  by
its dull aspect; by its tarnishing, and becoming covered with
a coat of oxyd on long exposure to the air, by its adhesion to
the surPace of glass ; and, when shaken with water in a bot
tle, by the formation of a black powder. Lead and tin are
frequent impurities/ and the mercury becomes capable of
taking up more of these, if zinc or bismuth be previously
 added.      In order to discover lead, the mercury may be agi
 tated    with a little water, in order to oxydate that metal.
 Pour off the water, and digest the mercury with a little acet
 ous acid.       This will dissolve the oxyd of lead, which will be
 indicated by a blackisli precipitate with sulphurated water.
 Or, to this acetous solution, add a little sulphat of soda, which
 will precipitate a sulphat of lead, containing, when djy,
 JZ per cent, of metal. If only a very minute quantity of
 lead be present in a large quantity of metal, it may be de
 tected by solution in nitric acid, and the addition of sulphu
 rated water.        A dark brown precipitate will ensue, and will
 subside,    if  allowed to stand   a few   days.    One part of lead
 may thus be separated from 15,263 parts of mercury.                JJif-
 muth is detected by pouring a nitric solution, prepared with
 out heat, into distilled water; a white precipitate will appear,
 if this metal be present. Tin is manifested, in like manner,
 by   a  weak solution of nitro-muriat of gold, which throws down
 a  purple sediment; and zinc, by exposing the metal to heat."

Mr. Kirwan, intended           to effect the fame end, but differing             in
the mode.        They    are     transcribed from his paper                 entitled
' Experiments on the Alkaline Substances used in Bleach
ing.' — See Transactions of the Irish Academy for 1 789.
    " To discover whether any quantity of fixed alkali worth
attention exists in any saline compound, dissolve one ounce of
it in boiling water, and into this solution let fall a drop of a
solution of sublimate corrosive; this will be converted into a
brick colour, if an alkali be present, or into a brick colour
mixed with yellow, if the substance tried contains lime.
   " But the substances used by bleachers being always im
pregnated with an alkali, the above trial is in general, super
fluous, except for the purpose of detecting lime.  The quan
tify of alkali is therefore what they should chiefly be soli

170,8 parts of that earth.       Therefore the precipitation of 78

kind of kelp or kelps manufactured in different places, and
the different forts of barilla, may thus be compared, because
they  all contain the mineral   alkali. But kelps and pot-ashes,
as they contain different forts of alkali, can only be compared,

A,lT       the meeting of this learned body, on the 26th of
March, there was read an historical and anatomical account
of a dubious amphibious animal, only found in               a small lake
in Carniola : by M. Schrader.
     On account of Passion and Easter weeks there were no
meetings on the 2d and 9th of April.
     On the 17th the account of the animal was concluded,
and the reading of a paper, by Dr. Herschel, containing ob
servations on the nature of the fun, was commenced, and
was continued on the 23d, but not then concluded.                    The
 Doctor fays that continued observations have confirmed him
 in his opinion that the fun is a magnificent habitable world,
 and gives this paper as a more comprehensive view of the
 subject than the one formerly laid before the Society,               (see
 Philosophical    Magazine,     Vol. V.)    and  such    as  a series   of
 observations    with   an improved reflector has       enabled him to
 make    ; observations    which,   the Doctor conceives, will be of
 utility in future meteorological researches.           The names al
  ready in use for the solar phænomena he objects to, as con
 veying no meaning ; such as spots, maculæ, faculæ, penum-
 bræ, &c; and wishes to substitute for them, openings, flats,
  krancles, ridges, nodules, dimples, punctures.             The open
 ings are what were denominated spots, and he conceives are
 caused by an elastic but not a luminous gas being disengaged
  from the sun and driving away the luminous fluid, which en
  ables us to behold his body. Flats are what are usually called
  penumbræ, and are depressions below the general surface of
  the sun, but not       so deep  as  the  body of it.      Krancles are
  irregular elevations and depressions which cover the whose
  disk of the sun.     Kidges are elevations above the general sur
   face of the sun  : ridges generally accompany openings.           This
  paper   contains  many    most  curious  observations   on   the altera

  menced     at the institution,       on  a new branch of philosophy—
 we    mean     the   Galvanic        phænomena.       On this interesting
 branch      Mr. Davy      (late   of Bristol)   gave the first    lecture on
 the 25th     of April.     He began with the history of Galvanism,
 detailed the succeflive discoveries, and described the different
 methods       of accumulating            galvanic   influence.       Polished
 plates   of different metals,         and the effect   of their lying      to
 gether in contact with water and air, were exhibited.                     Air
 is  absolutely     necessary      to the oxvdating       process.     He  ob
 served that it was difficult to prove that hydrogen was given
 out in the decomposition of water in this way, and that it
 seemed rather probable that alkali was formed.                  He stiowed
the effects of galvanism on the legs of frogs, and exhibited
some interesting experiments on the galvanic effects on the
 solution of metals in acids.
    By   some recent experiments             of this ingenious chemist it
appears,      that with one kind of metal            only, more powerful
effects may be produced              than with     two as heretofore em
ployed    ;  but in this cafe there must be more than one liquid
interposed between the plates.               Mr. Davy states that copper,
for example, and discs of cloth or pasteboard moistened with
diluted nitrous acid, and solutions of muriat of soda and
sulphuret of potasti, (and arranged in the order in which
we have named them, viz. copper, nitrous acidj muriat of
soda, sulphuret of potash, copper, nitrous acid, 8cc.) give
much more sensible sliocks than the pile as at first con
structed.
    Sir Joseph Banks, Count Rutnford, and other distinguished
philosophers were present.              The audience were highly gra
tified,   and    testified   their satisfaction by general           applause.
Mr. Davy, who           appears     to be very young,     acquitted himself

         TETLER'S SECOND SOCIETY AT HAARLEM.
     This   society has proposed the following          prize subject :
     A  view or delineation supported            by sufficient proofs ahd
 illustrations of what peculiarly characterises              the eighteenth
 century in regard to improvements in science and morals
 in comparison of preceding centuries. The society requires
 that, agreeably to what has been formerly announced, the
 candidates will examine and point out whether the principal
 nations of Europe during the eighteenth century have made
 any progress in the above respect ? Should this be answered
 in the affirmative, it is required            to know    in what this   pro
 gress    consists    ?     If   answered    in the     negative,   to   what
 causes is this want          of  progress to be ascribed ?       The  society
 consequently       requires     to know : Whether, and          how far in
 general, that part of mankind whose history is best known
 have advanced in real knowledge and moral improvement.
     The society promises to the person who shall send the
  best answer     to these questions       before   the  1st of April 1803,
 a golden medal         of the value    of 400 florins.

  1799, respecting the aqueous phænomena of the atmosphere,
  no satisfactory answer to which has been yet received, and
  promises fer the best answer sent in before the same period,

    As it is of    the  greatest  importance to every branch of
natural philosophy, that the present state of our knowledge
respecting them should be clearly explained, and that every
thing proved by experiment should be carefully separated
from what is supported only by hypothesis, the society re
quires to know :
    What is   the present state of our knowledge in regard to
aqueous    phænomena? — How far can we ascertain from well
authenticated experiments the causes by which water is re
ceived into the atmosphere and retained there in the form of
vapour or in any other manner ? — And to what causes is it
to be ascribed that the water retained in the atmosphere is
set at liberty and falls down under various forms?             — Can   the
aqueous phænomena be ascribed             to  the    liberation   of   the
water retained in the atmosphere          alone? or are there any
observations    which     clearly show that, during some aqueous
phænomena, water is produced in the atmosphere ?
     The society renews also the following question, to which
no satisfactory answers have been received,                 and offers a
gold   medal   of  the  value  of 400  florins   for    the  best answer
transmitted to the society before the ist of April 1802 :
     What   do we know      with certainty respecting the nourish
ment and growth of plants? or how far can we determine,
from decisive and well-authenticated experiments, those sub
stances or matters which serve in particular as the pabulum
of plants, and      the mapner     in which     they receive,     secrete,
and assimilate    them? — How much of          the information      given
us on   this head   by  eminent   naturalists is  still  to be considered
 as doubtful ? — By what experiments might our knowledge
 on this subject be enlarged or confirmed ? and what in
 formation    does    our actual knowledge of the growth and
 nourishment    of   plants supply us with to enable us to raise
 and transplant with more success useful vegetables in different
kinds of soil ?
     The society require', in particular in regard to the two
 first members of this question, that the candidates will give
 an accurate account of the present state of this part of the
 natural history of plants, and at the fame time make a dis-
                   4                                             tinction

tinction between what        is doubtful   and  what has been fully
proved.     By   these means      this part of the question can be
answered in a satisfactory         manner, though the branch of
natural history      to  which it belongs may not be enriched
with new discoveries.
    The  candidates     are requested to turn their attention to the
 latest writers   on this subject, in which many hints will be
found to direct them in their researches, such as F. A. Von
Humboldt's Aphorisms, in          regard to the Chemical Physiology
of Plants, Leipfic 1794,       8vo. ; and C. G. Rash's Sketch of a
 Physiology    of  Plants,   Lcipjic  1798, 8vo.
    The answers to all these questions must be written in
Dutch, French, English, or German, but not in German
characters, and transmitted, in the usual manner, with a
sealed note containing        the  author's name, to Teyler's Insti

 may be adjudged on the 1st of November the fame year.
                  XXXV.        Miscellaneous Articles.
                           METEOROLOGY.
   1 HE     following curious notice has lately been published in
 one of the foreign journals by Schweighauser : — " A prelate
 in the neighbourhood of Bale, having extended in his garden
 an iron wire of considerable          length for the purpose of sus
 pending from      it   a moveable    mark to fire at, observed that,
 during variations of the atmosphere, which modified a change
 of weather, the wire emitted a stronger or weaker sound, ac
 cording to the nature of these changes.            He communicated
 this observation     to Mr. Haas, who had come to fee him, and
 who, on his return to Bale, having caused a similar wire to
 be extended'in his garden, observed          the same phænomenon.
 Some time after, the celebrated Volta, when on a visit to
 Haas, saw this new kind of barometer, and, in order to as
 certain the nature of the meteoric humming it emitted, ex
  tended wires    of different    metals  in different directions ; but
  found that no vibration took place,        except in regard to   those
                                                                   wires

 386                   Gaseous Oxyd      of Carbon.
wires extended       in the direction of     the meridian.       Volta, in
consequence      of this peculiarity,   ascribed    the phænomenon to
the magnetic fluid, and speaks of it in his works.               I do not,
however, know that this new effect of a fluid so universally
diffused has been sufficiently examined.
    " Mr.   Haas jun. informed me that the wires ought at least
to be   a hundred feet in length (those of his father were about
three hundred),       and that they must be stretched as much as
possible:    they do not sound    till they have     been exposed to the
air for several weeks.      Mr. Haas fen.       had extended, for some
time, fourteen, of different sizes,          which emitted      sometimes
very agreeable sounds."
    Humboldt at Caraccas, in South America, has made some
interesting observations on the motion of the barometer near
the equator. " I have read," fays he, " in the Transactions
of the Bengal Society, that the barometer rises and falls there
regularly every twenty-four hours. Here, in South America,
its motion is more astonishing. There are four atmospherical
tides   every   twenty-four    hours,    which     depend    only on the
attraction of the fun.       The mercury falls from 9 o'clock in
the morning till 4 o'clock in the evening. It rises from 4 till
II   o'clock; it falls from 11 o'clock till half past 4 in the
morning; it      reafeends from that time       till  9 o'clock  : neither
winds,    storms,    nor earthquakes, have any influence on this
motion."       This fact   goes a great way towards proving the
general    truth  of Mr. Howard's theory, given in' the Philo
 sophical Magazine, Vol.      VII.
                  GASEOUS OXYD OF CARBON.
    This name is given, by Mr. Cruickstiank,              of Woolwich,
to the inflammable gas liberated from a mixture of forge-scales
of iron and charcoal, the production of which has been held
by Dr. Priestley as a proof of the truth of the phlogistic theory,
as water could not be supposed present to assist in producing
the gas by being decomposed.
    If scales of iron and charcoal, both previously ignited to
drive off every Icind of moisture, be introduced into a coated
glass retort, or into an iron one, and the Vetort              be exposed,
                              .                                 connected

connected with    pneumatic apparatus, to a red heat, a quan
                         a
tity of a gas comes over which burns in a manner similar to
the hydrocarbonats.     It consists of about one part of car
bonic acid and           six parts   of   a species    of inflammable gas which
Dr. Priestley         considers as a species          of hydrocarbonat.
   A mixture of gray oxyd of iron (forge-scales) and carbonat
of barytes by similar treatment gives also an inflammable gas,
which Mr. Cruickstiank finds to consist of carbonic acid gas
2r parts, and gaseous oxyd of carbon one part.
   Mr. Cruickstiank obtained a similar gas from mixtures of
charcoal and sublimed oxyd of zinc, red oxyd of copper, li
tharge, manganese ; and concludes, that all metallic oxyds
capable of enduring a red heat, being treated with charcoal,
will yield not only carbonic acid but a species of inflammable
gas ; that the oxyds which    retain their oxygen most obsti
nately yield most inflammable gas, and those which part with
it readily most carbonic acid. The latter comes over chiefly
at the beginning, and the inflammable gas towards the conclu
sion   of   the process.
     Mr. Cruickstiank,
                     having repeatedly washed this inflam
mable air with lime water to separate the carbonic acid, found
it   to be only a very little lighter than common air, that is to
fay, in the proportion of about 22. to 23 ; the common hydro
carbonats are not more than half that weight.      Having en
deavoured        to estimate      the quantity of pure oxygen necessary
to saturate        it,   after several trials he found that four measures
of   it   and two      of oxygen, exploded in strong       a            glass   jar over
mercury       by      means of the electric spark, were                 reduced to   3
                                                                                      , '
which       by
          agitation with lime water were proved to be car
bonic acid, except about of measure which,

sures     of carbonic acid gas* with              a     little water. Six measures
of carbonic           acid gas require for their production at least seven

 of in  the present case; and therefore      Mr. Cruickshank infers,
                                   '
 with justice, that   the other 3 must have been originally com
 bined with the gas, constituting it a gaseous oxyd; and hence
 it appears that this gas bears the fame relation to carbonic
  acid, that nitrous gas does to the nitrous acid.
     This gaseous oxyd seems to owe its origin to          a decomposi
  tion of carbonic acid at     a high temperature; for it may be
 obtained from     a mixture of iron filings and carbonat of lime
 instead of gray oxyd and charcoal, and in more abundance.
 Twenty parts of the gas so obtained, freed from carbonic acid,
 mixed with eight parts of oxygen, and fired over mercury by
 the electric spark, the whole was reduced to 18 or 19 parts,
 which were found to be carbonic acid, being totally absorbed
 by lime water; it contains neither water nor the basis of
 water   :  that obtained by means of charcoal yields water, ow
 ing  to the hydrogen      which enters more or less into the com
 position of all common charcoal.
     None of the known hydrocarbonats               are similar in their
properties to the gaseous oxyds of carbon, being much-lighter
and yielding a far less proportion of carbonic acid when com
bined      with oxygen. They consist of carbonic acid united
with or held in solution by hydrogen ; but the gaseous oxyds
are nothing but carbon united with or held in solution by
oxygen, and rendered gaseous by caloric. In their production
from a metallic oxyd the metal is found revived, its oxygen
having gone into the composition of the gaseous oxyd and
acid ; and from their production by the decomposition of the
fame     acid, (as when chalk and iron filings are employed) it
would appear that carbonic acid, when at a high tempera
ture, may be decomposed by any fixed substance which has
a strong affinity for oxygen.        Thus the objections to the new
system of chemistry advanced on this head by Dr. Priestley
seem to have been sufficiently answered by           Mr. Cruickshank;
and the presence     of hydrogen or water seems by no means           ne
cessary to the production      of these gaseous oxyds *.

teresting experiments   on this subject, are referred  to Mr. Nicholson's

XXXVI.          Observations on Mosaic, and the most celebrated
           Works of that Kind, both antient and modern".
M<LOSAIC             is a kind     of painting by means of small bits
of    glass,  stone,   wood, enamel, and other substances of dif
ferent colours,        cemented      to some surface         by some sort of
mastic, and which may be executed in such perfection that
at a little distance a common eye would take it for real paint
ing.       The common name            mosaic       comes    from the Italian
 musdico,     derived from the Greek word musakion,                used in the
 Jower ages to denote           those   kinds of works called in Latin
 must'vum.
      Though this kind of painting               was very common among
 the antients,      Pliny speaks neither of works in mosaic nor of
 artists who exercised it.           We cannot judge, therefore, of the
 mechanism of the art but from the manner in which it is
  executed by the moderns, and from the antient monuments
  of this kind wnich have been preserved. To construct works
  jn mosaic, the artist first forms a ground of flat stones, bor
  dered with bands of iron and surrounded with a solid rim of
  stone.     This ground is covered with thick mastic, in which
  the coloured pieces of glass, stone, &c. arc implanted accord
   ing to the design traced out on the ground ; and during his
  labour the artist has before him the painting he intends to
   copy. This mastic acquires the hardness of stone, and when
   the whole has sufficient consistence it is polished in the same
   manner     as glass.    As    the splendour, however, which mosaic
   then acquires prevents the design from being accurately di-
   stinguistied,    large works intended to be viewed at a distance,
   such as those placed in ceilings, cupolas,             &c.  are not polished.
   The art      has been     discovered      of giving     to the colour   of the
    glass as many different shades          as    are necessary for executing
    paintings of   every kind.       The    artist  in mosaic, while    at work,

290                    Observations     on  Mofai6.,
to their different (hides,       like  a  printer's types.      The art of'
making mosaics in relief is said        to have been invented, several
years ago, by Pompeo Savini, of Urbino. Archenholz, in his
 Picture of Italy, asserts, however, that no work of importance
 was ever executed according to this method. Some have also
 tried to saw through mosaic works in a transversal direction,
 in order  to multiply them.         According to Bjornstahl, in the
 second   volume of his Travels, Pompeo Savini was the first:
 person   who tried this method at Rome.                  It appears that
pavements      in  coarse    mosaic, executed        among the antients,
 were not made at the same period as               those of more delicate
workmanship.         The place where it was necessary to implant
 the mosaics were in the former left more delicately termi
nated.     Thus    at Herculaneum,         according to Winkelman,
there was found, in the middle of           a coarse mosaic     pavement,
a portion of mosaic      of more    delicate   workmanship, which did
not adhere to the rest, and which only had a relation to it.
    It appears ihat the origin of mosaic ought to be ascribod to
the different compositions of hard stones employed bv the
orientals as ornament, and of which we find a striking ex
ample in the ornaments, of the high-priest among the Jews.
It  is observed in general      that all nations among whom civil
isation has made little progress are fond of splendid and varie
gated colours    :  we find, therefore,       that   mosaic   was in great
esteem    during    the  first centuries     of  the French monarchy,
as   is proved    by  the   mosaics    with which Clovis caused the
church of St. Peter and St. Paul,            at present that   of Sainte-
Genevieve, and the tomb of Fredegonda, to be ornamented ;
and    hence it became usual to cover surfaces with coloured
bodies according as their figures permitted them to be joined,
and to ornament buildings, pavements,                 ceilings, &c. with
stones of different colours.        It is probable that the Persians,
Babylonians, and other people of the East, whose countries
abounded with hard stones, were acquainted with this kind
of embellishment.        They displayed a considerable degree of
ingenuity in executing flowers, animals, &c. by the com
bination of pieces of stone of different colours: this was the
extent of their art ; but it was the Greeks who introduced
into this process that     taste  and    perfection which entitle it lo
                                                                       the

 the appellationof an art. These people, indeed, found means
 to manage the shades with so much dexterity, and to give to
 the figures and groups which they executed such order and
 harmony, that         at a distance      they resembled
                                                      paintings.
     This    art   was     conveyed    from the Greeks to the Romans.
 Sylla was the first among the latter who caused to be exe
 cuted in the temple of Fortune at Præneste, at present called
 Palæstrina,       a mosaic,      great part           of which         still    exists.    At
 first the pavements of buildings only were ornamented in
this  manner, but afterwards      walls and arched ceilings.
 Portable floors for the tents of princes and the commanders
of armies, in order        to guard against moisture, were orna
mented       also in the same manner. The invention of coloured
glass gave       to this art a greater degree of perfection.                               This
materials      in particular, was employed in the time of                                  Au
gustus.   But pieces of glass or marble were still of too large
size to admit of the stiades being; properly blended, and con
sequently     of giving the natural colour to the objects.                            Under
Claudius the Romans began to colour marble, and under
Nero to give it spots by an artificial process.
   In the fifth century, when the arts were expelled from
Italy by the invasions of the barbarians, mosaic painting and
sculpture were preserved much longer among the Greeks of
Bvzantium    for ornamenting the altars and utensils of the
church.    Mosaic, however, lost at Constantinople, as the
other arts did, that character of elevation which characterises
the monuments            of Grecian    art    :   besides, works             of this kind
were executed          with     pearls and precious stones,                     whereas     the
antient Greeks preferred marble for mosaic. Towards the
end of the 13th century an Italian, named Andrew Tasti,
learned the art of mosaic from one Apollonius, a Greek,
who decorated with it the church of St. Mark, at Venice,
where an excellent pavement               by him is           ill
                                                            It:     to be seen.            But
in general     these works want design,                  are in     a   bad taste, and,
besides, have      a   bad colour.        Since that period                  this art has
been carried to    high degree
                       a                      of perfection
                                                   Italy.   Pope        in
Clement      VIII.
                 contributed greatly to this improvement in
the 17th century,    causing all the interior part of the cupola
                           by
of the church of St. IVier to be ornamented with mosaic.

293                    Observations      on Mosaic.
Among     the artists employed       for this purpose the most distin
guished were Paul RosT'etti       and Francis Zucchi. These orna
ments were       finished    in 1603.       In  the   same century   John
Baptist Calandra,        of Vercelli, in Piedmont, who was born
in   1586    and   died   in 1644, invented a new mastic, which
greatly contributed to bringing the art to perfection. During
fourteen years he executed mosaics for the church of Saint
Peter at Rome, and particularly the figures of the four fa
thers of the church          in the cupola, alter paintings by Lan-
franchi, Sacchi, Romanelli, and Pellegrini.                 He copied also
the picture of the archangel Michael, by Joseph Cesari ; but
he gave it too sine a polish, so that it has too much reflection.
 Afterwards various artists in mosaic endeavoured to give faith
ful copies of the finest paintings ; such as that of the martyr
 dom of St. Petronilla, by Guerchin, in the church of St. Peter
 at Rome   ;   the death-bed communion             of St. Jerome, by Do-
 meniquin, formerly        in   the  church     of- Santo Girolamo della
 Carita at Rome, but now in the Museum of the Arts at Paris.
 The person, however, who carried this art to its highest degree
 of perfection was Peter Paul dc Christophoris, who founded
 at Rome a school of mosaic in the commencement of the
 18th century. He formed several distinguished pupils, among
 whom were Brughio, Conti, Coccei, Fattorr, Goflbne, and
 Ottaviano.      Alexis Matthioli found out, in 1730, the art of
 making glass of a bright red colour.               In modern times mo
 saic has been distinguished into two kinds: that of Rome, in
 which stones of a very small size are employed, which gives
 to works more delicacy and variety, and admits the execution
 of great historical paintings.         In this manner the most beau
 tiful paintings of Raphael have been copied, and Clement VI II.
 caused the cupola of the church of St. Peter to be decorated
 with mosaic of the same kind.                His succeflbrs continued to
 cause other paintings, both in oil and in fresco, to be copied.
 According to Bjornstahl,            the    number of sliades found in
 these mosaics       sometimes     exceeds 10,000.          In the palace
 Borghese     at Rome       there   are fix beautiful mosaics,      one   of
 which    represents Orpheus surrounded by animals              : it is said
 to be composed         of 9000     pieces.     The    mosaic of Florence,
 called by the Italians co/nmejso,        is executed with larger stones,
                                                                        and

and is employed for copying paintings       of less size. The best
works of this kind are in the chapel of the grand duke at
Florence.      Several beautiful mosaics of this kind are now in
the Musæum of the Arts at Paris.
     One of the greatest advantages of mosaic is its resistance to
every thing that generally alters the beauty of sine paintings,       ,
and the facility with which it may be cleaned, by giving it
 a new polish without any danger of destroying the colours.
 As mosaic, however, canbe executed only in a flow manner,
and as it requires considerable expense, it never can be
 brought into such general use as painting; it would never
'even have attained at Rome and Florence to that degree of
 perfection to which it was carried, had not the governments
 of  these two countries defrayed    the expenses.
     In modern times     very beautiful mosaics   in wood, known        '
 in England      by the name of inlaying, in France by that of
 marqueterie, and in Italy under that of tavsia or tarsia, have
 been executed in different countries.      Philip Bruneleschi and
 John de Vanone at Florence, who lived in the 15th century;
 John Marc, of Blois, who worked for the king of France ;
 and Melchior Rummer, who resided near Heidelberg, distin
 guished themselves most in the execution of this fort of mo
 saic. Shell-work may be considered also as a kind of mosaic.
  In one of the groves of Versailles there is a master-piece of
 this kind. Bonavita Blank, director of the cabinet of natural
  history atWiirzbourg, is the inventor of anew kind of mosaic,
 in which nothing is employed but different forts of moss, and
  has been able to execute, with the greatest fidelity, landscapes,
  marine views, volcanoes, ruins,       and buildings.    The beau
  tiful collection of this artist has been exhibited in four halls
  of   the castle  of Wiirzbourg   since 1794, the period when     it
  was purchased     by the bishop.
     The most beautiful mosaics preserved in the pavements or
  on the walls of antient buildings are : 1st, That found in the
  pavement of a chamber of the villa Hadriani, near Tivoli ;
  it represents a vase filled with water, on the edge of which are
   four pigeons, one of them in the attitude of drinking. The
  great merit of this work consists chiefly in its being composed
  of small stones, while in all the other mosaics pastes of glass
                                                                 are

     394                    Observations         on Mosaic.
    are employed     to obtain those shades             of colours which     do not
    exist in stones.    It  belonged        formerly to cardinal Furietti.         It
    was purchased,      together        with some centaurs, for the sum            of
    13,000 scudi, by Clement XIII. who caused it to be placed
    in the Capitol.      Furietti thought it to be the mosaic of Per-
    gamus mentioned by Fliny ; but Winkelman has shown the
    falsity of this opinion. This mosaic is commonly known
    under the name of the four pigeons, or the mosaic os the
    Capitol.    It has been copied a great number of times, on a
   small scale, for snuff-boxes and medallions. — 2d, The mosaic
   executed by the order           of Sylla in        the  temple    of Fortune    at
    Præneste,    at present       Palæstrina.        It   was  first published    by
    Kircher, Montfaucon,            and     Shaw    ;   and   afterwards    by   the
   abbe Barthelemy, who made it the subject of a particular
'
   memoir, in which he establishes, that the subject it represents
   is the expedition of Alexander to Egypt.                    Winkelman con
   sidered it as Menelaus          and    Helen in Egypt.           Count Cay I us-
   also published an engraving of it in the same colours as the
   original.    This mosaic, remarkable in particular for the light
   which it throws on the natural and local history of Egypt, is
   at present   at the     feat    of   the Barberini       family,   built on the
   mountain     where formerly stood the temple of Fortune, and
   at the bottom of which is Palæstrina.                        It is commonly
   known under the name of the mosaic of Paliejlrina. — 3d, In
   the pavement of the fame temple there was also found an
  other mosaic, of       less    size,   but of workmanship much more
  elegant than the former             :   it is at present in the Barberini
  palace at Rome.            It represents        the rape     of Europa.       The
  tipper part exhibits the sea-shore,              on which are observed the
  companions of        that     princess,      and Agenor her father.          The
  fame subject is represented on a mosaic engraved                    by the care
  of   the  prelate   Casali. — 4th,         In   the villa   Albani   there is a
  beautiful mosaic,        which       was    found in the territory of         Ur-
  bino, and which         represents a school           of philosophers. — 5th,
  A    mosaic representing       the history      of Hesione, the daughter of
  Priam,    exposed    on     a   rock to      a   monster, and delivered by
  Hercules, who gave her in marriage to his friend Telamon,
  was discovered about the year 1762.                   According to Winkel
  man, the workmanship has                as   great beauty aud delicacy as
                                                                               that

that of the pigeons of Furietti. — 6th, A mosaic, two palms
in height, was found in a villa hear Pompeii (perhaps that
of the emperor Claudius), in              the month     of April 1763.      It
represents three females with comic masks,                who play on dif
ferent instruments         :   near them is a child,       who plays on a
flute.     Winkelman fays that the workmanship of this piece
is so delicate that a magnifying glass is necessary to distinguish
it.   The name of the artist, Dioscorides of Samos, is inscribed
on it in Greek letters. — 7th, Another mosaic of the same
artist,   and    of workmanship equally delicate, was dug up in
the presence      of Winkelman in the month of February 1764.
It   also represents       three    females   with comic masks,        and a
child wrapped        up   in   a mantle which has no mask.         — 8th, A
mosaic pavement          twentv-seven palms in length and twenty-
five    in breadth was discovered            at Præneste in 1766.         The
design of it was sent to Rome at the time when Winkelman
was employed in explaining that of Sylla found at Præneste.
The    subject   of it is not known, nor do we know whether             it ha*
been engraved        and explained, or to what place it was carried.
 — 9th, An antique           mosaic dug up at Rome in 1769 ; another
 with flowers, from          the villa Hadriani ; and a modern mosaic,
 representing     St. Peter and the Virgin, are to be seen at Man-
 heim. —    10th, Bartoli's work on the tombs of the antient
 Romans       and    Etruscans,       reprinted in the twelfth volume of
 the Thesaurus Antiquitalum Gracarum of Gronovius, con
 tains several engravings of antient pavements with mosaics,
 viz. figs.   14, 17, and 18,        of  the tombs    of  the  villa Corfini ;
 fig.  lib   exhibits    a   beautiful mosaic      representing    Ganymede
 feeding the eagle      of Jupiter : it was taken from the catacombs
 of St.   Sebastian.     The first volume of the Lucernœ Sefulcbra-
 les  of Bartoli   and Bellori contains         also an antique pavement
 in  mosaic from the tombs            of the villa  Corfini.    It represents,
 amidst several other figures and ornaments, four naked                mimic
 dancers    of that kind who       preceded the funerals of distinguished
 personages among            the  antients. — nth, Three pavements in
 mosaic, one of which represents a comic scene surrounded
 by theatrical masks, flowers, birds, helmets, &c. ; the second,
 Theseus and the Minotaur; and the third, the combat of
 Entellus and Dares, were discovered, in 1790, without the
               5                                                          walls

walls of   Aix, in    the place occupied by the antient city in the
time of the Romans.           These mosaics, the destruction of which
Saint-Vincens could not prevent, were engraved by the care
of his son, and published in the Biographical Notice which
the latter gave of his learned father. He could procure only
some interesting fragments of them, which he affixed on the
walls of bis cabinet. Several other mosaics were found at
Aix, which have been engraved in the history of that city by
Menard. One of them represents a female with a dog and a
flambeau     : the female       has a great resemblance       to the goddess
Nehalennia       of   the Gauls.        Some pavements        which exhibit
nothing but compartments were dug up also at Auxerre.
    During     the   searches      which     the prelate    Cazali   caused to
be made at Rome,           there was found a very beautiful mosaic
pavement,      which contained          a representation     of  the   rape  of
Europa : it was removed to his house to ornament the floor
 of his apartment, and he likewise had it engraved.
    The   pavements      in the Pio-Clementine          musæum      are orna
mented with several beautiful mosaics.                 In the vestibule, at
the top of the stair-cafe, there is one, found at Rufinella, near
the antient Tusculum,            which represents      a   bust of Pallas in
the middle of an elegant grotesque.                   Another, dug up at
Otricoli, ornaments the grand rotundo : it is divided into
several    zones intermixed           with mæanders, large compart
 ments containing         tritons, nereids, and combats of centaurs,
 who    have   in  the middle         of them    a  buckler covered        with
 scales, and on    which      is seen the Gorgon.         This  large mosaic
 is surrounded     by a border of other mosaics white and black,
 among     which     is distinguished the adventure of Ulysses and
 the Syrens.      In an octagon hall close to this rotundo there
 is seen also a beautiful grotesque of mosaic with a Medusa in
 the middle,     found in one of the vaults of the palace Caetani
 on   the Esquiline      hill. Several other mosaics, representing
 animals and articles of provision, are observed also in other
 halls.
    In  the musæum         of   the Augustines there is a singular mo
 saic, executed     in   the    sixth  century.     It  is the tomb     of Fre-
 degonda,     composed       of  a great   number of small stones broken
 and pounded in a mortar,                like those coloured grains with
                                                                         which

    The Italians   at present often employ antique mosaics to or
 nament the floors of their apartments        ;  and they make use    of a
 very ingenious process, before they remove the mosaic, forfixing
 with cement the small cubes which compose it j also for de
 taching it from the place which it occupies, and for deposit
 ing it in a new one. They cut it into portions, fix them on
 large sheets  of   paper   called  perpetuo, surrounded      with iron,
 which they number, and afterwards, when they wish to make
 use  of them, they place the pieces on the floor according to
 the numbers ; and these portions, when joined, form a whole
 as smooth as it was before the mosaic was displaced.

tice of mosaic are the following : — J. Ciampini, On the

 XXXVII. On the Improvement os Time-Keepers. By Davi B
     Rittenhouse, LL.D. President of the American Phi
     losophical   Society  *.
 T.HE          invention      and  construction of time-keepers may
 be reckoned among the most successful exertions of human
 genius.      Pendulum clocks especially have been made to
 measure     lime with astonishing accuracy; and if there are
  still some    causes of inequality in their motions, the united
 efforts of mechanism, philosophy, and mathematics, will
probably in time remove them.
     The last and least of those causes, which perhaps may be
 worthy of notice when all others of more importance are re
 moved, is that rising from unequal density of the air, which
 by varying the actual weight of the pendulum will accelerate

or retard its motion.          The   effects arising from this cause         will
indeed      be found      very small ; for, if      we suppose the greatest
range      of  the   barometer to be three inches, which indicates
a change        of density in the air of above one-tenth of the
whole;       and supposing lead,       of which pendulums             are gene
rally made, to be 8,800 times heavier than air, the varia
tions of the actual weight of a pendulum may be i-88oooth
part of its whole weight, and consequently the change in its
 rate    of going    1- 176000th part.          And, as there are 86,400
 seconds in a day,        the clock may vary in its rate of going,
 from this cause, about half              a second      in 24 hours.      Men
 tioning the barometer, seems naturally to point out a remedy
for this cause of irregularity by means of that instrument.
 But my design is at present to describe a very different and
 extremely simple method, which, though only a matter of
 curiosity at present, may at some future time, perhaps, be
 found useful; especially as the variation above mentioned is
 governed      solely by the actual density           of  the surrounding air,
  and the barometer can only give the weight of an entire co
  lumn,     which     does not strictly correspond          with the density of
 its base; whereas         the  method       I  propose depends on the real
 density     of the air surrounding            the pendulum,       and nothing
  else.
      Let AB (Plate       VII.   fig. 1.) be a pendulum vibrating on
  the point     A,   and   removed     from the perpendicular line DE.
  Let    the inflexible    rod  be continued         from     BA  to  C,  and let
  a body     C, of    equal   dimensions with          the pendulum       B, but
   hollow     and   light   as  possible,    be fixed on the rod, making
   AC    equal to   AB.      Now it      is evident      that  B will  be pressed
  upwards by a force equal to the weight of its bulk in air, and
   its descent retarded.       But the body C will be equally pressed
   upwards, and consequently the motion of the pendulum to
   wards the perpendicular will be as much accelerated.                    These
   two forces, therefore, will destroy each other, and the pen
   dulum will perform its vibrations in equal times, whether the
   air be light or heavy, dense or rare.
       I  have, for greater perspicuity, described             the most simple
    case, but perhaps not the most eligible            j for, if we can enlarge

the   vessel of body C in       any proportion,       the distance    of its
centre from     A  may be diminished at the same rate.
   However      plausible the above may appear in theory, no
doubt difficulties will occur when we attempt to reduce it
into practice.      But I am persuaded they will not be found
insuperable.
   The only experiment        I have hitherto made       on this subject
has been     merely to (how that a pendulum can be made in
this manner which shall vibrate quicker in a dense medium
than in one more rare, contrary to what takes place with
common pendulums.
   I made a compound          pendulum, on the principles above
mentioned,       of about   one   foot in its whole length.           This
pendulum,      on many trials, made in the air 57 vibrations in
a minute.       On immersing the whole in water it made 59
vibrations    in the fame time, showing evidently that its mo
tion was quicker in so dense a medium as water than in the
air. When the lower bob or pendulum only was plunged
in water, it made no more than 44 vibrations in a minute ;
the remaining 15 being solely the effect of the pressure of the
water against the upper vessel C.

engine and the water-wheel are supplied.

   e, e, i, valves for admitting and excluding the water.
  ff,     the injection-pipe,         and   g the injection-cock.
   h,   the   condenser.
   It  does not appear necessary to fay any thing here on the
manner in which this machine performs its operations with
out manual assistance, as the method of opening the cocks,
by which        the steam       is admitted into the receiver and con
densed,     has been        already   well described    by several writers.
But it will     be necessary to remark that the receiver,          penstock,
and all the pipes, must be previously filled before any water
can be delivered on the wheel ; and when the steam in the
boiler has acquired a sufficient strength, the valve at i is
opened, and the steam immediately rusties from the boiler
at E into the receiver A; the water descends through the
tubes-  A   and    B,    and    ascends    through the valve    i,   and the
Other pipe or tube          B, into   the penstock    C.   This  part  of the
operation being performed, and the valve i shut, that at / is
suddenly opened, through which the steam rushes down the
condensing- pipe c, and in its passage meets with a jet of
cold water from the injection-cock g, by which it is con
densed.        A vacuum being made by this means in the re
ceiver, the water is driven up to fill it a second time through
the valves e, e, by the pressure            of the external air, when the
steam-valve       at  i  is  again opened, and the operation repeated
for any length of time the machine is required to work.
    There are many advantages which a steam-engine on this
construction possesses beyond any thing of the kind hitherto
invented     ;   a few    of which I     shall beg leave to enumerate.
    1.  It  is subject to little or no friction.
    2.  It  may be erected at            a small expense   when compared
 with any other         sort  of steam-engine.

Boulton and Watt's engines, by condensing out of the re
ceiver, either in the penstock or at the level of the water.
  4. Another very great advantage       that the water in tht      is,
upper part of the pipe adjoining the receiver acquires   heat,                               a

equal to that of boiling water  hence the receiver  ;  always                           is

I F       the history      of dyeing in the former period appears im
perfect       and     deficient,    will be found still more

excite no wonder           if      great silence prevails respecting                     an art at
that time        so   little valued,           as   we are left           in   much uncertainty
in    regard        to many other things         of great importance. This

among the number.       It cannot, however, be denied that
there occur traces of this art being practised in some of the
Italian monasteries and other places.   But the articles dyed
were of little importance, being chiefly brown or black linen,
or skins, so that the art in this state scarcely deserves the name
of dyeing.
-
    Ofthis art Muratori gives only one instance in the eighth
century from an old manuscript preserved in a monastery *,
which, on account of the barbarous Latin in which it is
written, and the illegible passages in                   it,
                                            scarcely intelligible.

This, however,      sufficient to give us an idea of the state of
                        is
dyeing in the west at that period but,     more should be;           if
thought necessary, have no doubt that there are documents
                           I
in old        monasteries       to satisfy        the curiosity of those who wish
for further information on the subject.
    It   certain, indeed, that the art of giving cloth and other
         is
articles   beautiful dye, had disappeared from the west in the
              a
fifth century, and was to be found only in the east       But                    f.
even there little attention was paid to improvement and new
discoveries, as dyers were satisfied with those colours which
had been long usual,              and which, in               a     great measure,    have
been already described.
    The Greeks            and    Saracens were               for    a   long time the ex
clusive possessors        of this art,        and furnished the west            with dyed
                            which, according to the ac
stuffs, and particularly purple,
count of the female Greek writer mentioned in the former
part of this paper, was prepared there of a. beautiful colour in
the nth century.     The public taste, however, was at length
changed, and people began to set as great value on the
scarlet then dyed as upon purple, and at length to prefer                                it  ;
and on this account, in the lath century, the art of dyeing
purple in the east was entirely forgotten                          J.

  following centuries, this art began to be revived                in  the west,
  as the Christian princes who went on these                        expeditions
 brought back with them            a great   many     Greek    artists, dyeing
 had been so little improved, that, according to the testimony
 of an old English poet, Gualfred de Winesauf, who wrote a
  satire about the year 1202, the Romans at that period ob
  tained their scarlet from Greece *.             Soon after, however, the
  Italians,    and particularly      the Venetians,      made considerable
 progress in this art : for, as the crusaders were conveyed to
 the Holy Land and brought back from it chiefly in Italian
 ships, the Italians had the best opportunities either of learn
 ing the art of dyeing beautiful colours themselves, or of carry
ing back      expert dyers, whom they must have found very ne
 cessary to their manufactures,           which were then beginning to
increase    f.    About     this period, therefore, we find here and
 there traces of new dye-materials, or, at least, materials
 not before mentioned.           Thus, a charter of the year 1194,
which is a contract between the inhabitants of Bologna and
those of Ferrara respecting certain duties, speaks of Brasil
grains {gratia de BraJUe) and of indigo as articles which were
 obliged to pay duty at Bologna J.
     In regard to the indigo here mentioned,               I can hardly be
lieve that we are to understand           by   it our  dye-stuff of the fame
name ;      as  a more modern writer, Plictho, whom I shall men
tion hereafter, was unacquainted with our indigo. It is much
more probable that what is here meant is the substance
which occurs in Pliny under the name of indicum, and
which was merely a paint §. In the like manner, a paint
was known in Germany called endicb before real indigo was
known ; which, as we are told by Crolach in his description

                            History    of the Art of Dyeing.                                    305
of woad, taken from                an old author,             was made        of what the
dyers at present call the flower                   of   the woad.
   But the Brasilian grains and Brasilian wood are mentioned
in more old charters, as, for example, of the years 1198 and
1305, under the name of braxilis.        This wood, therefore,
may have not taken its name from the country called Brafil ;
but the latter rather got its name from the wood, which was
found there in abundance, and in the language of the country
was called ibirapitanga. In my opinion the name brafilU
comes from bragia, in French braise, a burning coal, which
it   may have obtained both from its colour and its having the
property of communicating it to others. But, as I (hall have
an opportunity hereafterof enlarging further on this dye-stuff,
I shall proceed to another discovery of that period, made by
a    Florentine, viz. that of dyeing by orchilla-weed.
     A Florentine merchant, who about the year 1300 traded
in the Levant,   happening to make water on a rock, observed
that the green colour of the moss which grew on        and on                      it,
which the urine accidentally fell, was changed to beautiful                        a
blueifli colour.  Reflecting   little further on this circum
                                             a
stance, he found, after several experiments, that when mixed
with urine and other things    communicated to cloth
                                              it           co                               a
lumbine colour.   This process he long kept as    secret, and                a
acquired      by   it
                great deal
                        a  of money.   The  invention  at that
period was         so
                 profitable to the Florentines, and excited                                      so
much wonder, that the family of the inventor, which still
exists in Italv, were called Rucellai, from the name of the
moss,     which     in      Spanish    is   distinguished          by   the appellation          of
orciglia, and the dye made from        called orchilla
                                                    it   is                            *.
  After this period the manufactures in Italy increased                                          so
that the attention of the different governments was particu
larly directed      to the       art   of dyeing.             In   the' year 1429 there
were published   at Venice some regulations respecting dyeing
(Mariegola   dell' Arte del Tintori), in which certain precepts
were given for dyeing, and according to which dvers were
to exercise their arts. These regulations were renewed in the
year 1510, with       great many improvements.

 Ventura Rosctti, however, finding these precepts too imper
 fect, made a tour, at considerable expense, through Italy and
 other countries to procure information respecting the art of
 dyeing, and on his return wrote, under the assumed name
 of Plictho,     a book on       it ; the first, perhaps,    that ever appeared
 on this subject, and which undoubtedly laid the first founda
 tion for the improvement in this art which afterwards took
 place*.
     The title of this work, exceedingly scarce even in Italy, an
  original edition of which is preserved in the royal library at
  Gottingen, is as follows: — Flictho's Art of Dyeing; which
 teaches how to give to Cloth, Linen, Cotton, and Silk, real and
 beautiful     as well as false and common Dyes. Venice J548. 4to.+
  The whole work is divided into three sections ; the first of
  v hich treats on the dyeing of wool, linen, cotton, chintz, &tc.
  the second on the dyeing of silk, and the third on the dyeing
  of skins.
      However      difficult it may have been at that time to write
  upon this art, Plictho, in the preface to his book, where he
  speaks of the period in which he lived with a candour pecu
  liar to himself, says : " I will therefore, dear reader, no
  longer keep back these three works.                    I have exerted myself
  with all my powers by day and by night for months and
  years, with danger and loss, at the expense of much hard
  labour, and as far as my poor circumstances would permit, to
  improve this important art, for sixteen years past, and with
   God's help to bring it to a proper state." — This author was
  not acquainted either with indigo or cochineal ; but he speaks
   of brafil wood, which            he calls verzino,      a name   still given to
     *  Beekmann's    Technology, p. 60.

it in Italy, and from which the word brajilis, as appears, has
been derived.    Though Hellot and others despise this work
as a wretched collectionof recipes, we cannot deny the author
the  merit of having first opened the way to improve the art
of dyeing; of having brought it into high reputation ; and,
in particular, of having                    excited         towards it the attention of
foreign nations.
   For about two hundred years before, the Italians, and par
ticularly the Venetians, had a monopoly of dyeing, and pro
cured large sums by it from neighbouring nations, who made
no exertions to practise the art themselves; for statesmen
and men of letters did not think it worth their while to give
themselves any trouble about                         it,
                                    and from dyers no change
whatever was to be expected.     But Plictho was the first who
exhibited this art in its full lustre, and excited the French,
English, and Germans, to apply in earnest, in their different
countries, to the improving                     so
                             useful and extensive    branch                     a
of manufacture.
     In Francesome progress towards this object had been                                     al
ready made.    One Giles Gobelin, who had learned from                                        a
German the art of dyeing scarlet, endeavoured to establish                                   it
in that country, and for this purpose erected  dye-house, in              a
the suburbs of Paris, on small stream called the Bievre, the
                                          a
water  of which was found peculiarly favourable to that co
lour.  This undertaking was at first considered to be work                          a
of    much difficulty that no one believed he would be able
      so
to complete            it,
               and for that reason this dye-house was called
La Folie Gobelin, that                    is,
                          Gobelin's Folly*.
     Gobelin, however, continued his                         business,    and scarlet dyed
after his manner    still called Gobelin's scarlet, and
                               is                            build               a

state             the great minister of Louis XIV. in the
          till Colbert,
year 1669, undertook to pay attention to its improvement.
With this view he examined the establishment and defects of
the French dyeing, and                         a   M. d'Albo,          at his desire, composed
a set of regulations respecting dyeing, which were printed and
published at Paris in the years 1669 and 1672*.
   The introduction to this book contains a proof of Colbert's
mode of thinking in regard to this art: — " if the silk,
woollen,           and        linen manufactories,"                     savs he,      "    are those
which contribute moil                           to the      support       and advancement           of
trade and commerce,    dyeing, which supplies that variety                                          of
colours by which the molt beautiful things in nature are
imitated and represented, may be considered as the foul of                                             it,

 articles of little value, now  find sale in the country, when
 they have received from dyeing those attractions which render
 them valuable and agreeable to the most savage nations."
       The                 divided into twelve chapters
               treatise itself           is              the first                        :

logue of the dye-stuffs permitted to be used for dyeing the
 fine and common colours; the eighth gives an account of
the reasons why certain kinds of dye-stuffs are prohibited ;
 the ninth treats entirely on dyeing black ; the tenth, of the
 ground and bath proper for each colour ; the eleventh treats
 on the dyeing of linen and hats; and the twelfth recom
 mends the use and cultivation of indigenous dye-stuffs, a lift
 of which is given.
     That    these regulations might be properly observed,                 certain
 inspectors and commissioners were not only appointed to visit
  the dye-houses and repositories of the merchants, but orders
  were afterwards given to a member               of  the Academy          of Sci
  ences    to make experiments for improving and beautifying
  different dyes, and to lay the result of his discoveries before
  the academy, which were afterwards to be published for the
  practical     use  of dyers.
      The    great    advantage    of this    establishment may be easily
  conceived from the preference given to the French dyes; and
  the works which Du Fay, Hellot, and others, have written
  on    this    subject,    and   with which       every    dyer ought to be
   acquainted.
      About this time the dye-stuffs brought to Europe from the
   newly discovered countries, but especially indigo and cochi
   neal, began to be employed with great advantage.                            The
   Netherlanders, in particular, endeavoured, by means of these
   new dye-stuffs, to discover more durable and livelier colours ;
   for though they had begun, almost at the fame time as the
   Italians, to apply to the art of dyeing with great zeal, and to
   take advantage of the troubles in the East, they had never
   been   so    fortunate,    notwithstanding all their exertions, as to
   make any great progress in it.

   France,   as  proved   by a French ordinance    of Nov. i-j, 1383; but it had
   not been so strictly  observed till Colbert found it .necessary to define it more
   accurately.

310                            History      of the Art of Dyeing.
     At     last a Flemish
                      painter named Peter Kloeck, who, dur
ing his long travels in various parts of the East, had learned
the art of giving the most beautiful colours to silk and woollen
stuffs, as well as that of dyeing scarlet, which he acquired
from the German inventor whom                               I     shall mention hereafter,
returned to his own country *, excited as much attention by
his method as Gobelin did at Paris, soon brought dyeing into
repute, and continued to practile his art till 1550,                                         when he
died      f.
  After that epoch this art was exercised by the Flemings
with so much zeal, that the Netherlands afterwards supplied
not only France,                     but even England and Germany, with ex
perienced dyers.
     Dyeing            seems to have been practised                   also in England               at a
very early period, for in the 14th century Edward                                      III.   brought
a great         many dyers from Flanders                J   .    Under Edward                IV.   dyers
were     numerous in London, that in the year 1472 they
            so
were established into a particular company, which at present
forms one of the ninety-two incorporated companies, and
holds the thirteenth rank : this company has its own, arms,
and its hall on                Dowgate-hill §.
     After       the discovery            of America            the   new dye-stusss began
to be used also in England ; but here people were at first so
mistrustful of them, that under queen Elizabeth dyeing with
indigo was not only limited, but the use of logwood was en
tirely prohibited, and it was burnt wherever it was sound                                              ||.
This prohibition                 was afterwards        repeated, but              it   was annulled
under Charles                  II.   in   1661. f

  But, notwithstanding            the attention hitherto paid to dyeing
by government, it still remained in a languifliing state till the
year J 643, when a German named Kepfler first brought to
England his new-invented method of dyeing scarlet; and
because he established a dye-house at the village                       of Bow, the
scarlethe dyed was called the Bow dye *.     At length a
Fleming  named  Brauer, who in 1667 went to England with
his whole family, brought the dyeing of woollen there, in
general, to that degree of perfection at which it has been
since maintained by the English f.   Men of letters in Eng
land now began to turn their attention to this art, and we
find a treatise on dyeing publiflied in 1667                    J,   which   was soon
followed by others of the fame kind.
   As     a distinction had always been              made       in Italy, France,
and the Netherlands,              between    fine and common dyers,           the
ease appears to have been            the fame in'England               from the ear
liest periods ; so that blue, red,           and yellow,             belonged   exclu
sively to the fine dyers ; but both the fine and common dyers
were allowed to dye brown,             fawn colour, and black §.
   Since the art of dyeing, as we have already seen, could
not be revived in Italy, France, and the Netherlands, from
its long state of depression to which it had been subjected in
the fifth century, it will not appear surprising that the Ger
mans, who during the middle ages paid very little attention
to manufactures, should begin to apply later than other na
tions to this art, which                      of manufac
                                    is always an attendant
tures. All     beautiful, lively, and high colours, which
                    the
are mentioned by the German writers of that period, were
procured from the Italians,            as these had procured them from
the Greeks.
   It is probable that the Germans had dyers of their own
for black and brown colours, as the former was their gala
colour or colour of honour, and the latter the common co
lour of the monks and other people, both of which required

 no foreign dye-stuffs   or expensive preparation.     But this
 scarcely deserved the name of dyeing, and extended at most
 to linen or coarse woollen stuffs, and even to these the dyers
 could not communicate fast and durable colours.
       As    the number          of     those who prepared                   these colours after
wards increased,                the     first   dyers   were        under the necessity of
forming themselves  into.                   a          and
                                                company to secure themselves
their occupation from the encroachment of foreigners ; and
this was the origin of that company known in Germany at
present under the name of black dyers; but whether this
                   under Henry I. in the year 925, as the
 society was -formed
chancellor Von Ludewig asserts *, cannot be with certainty
determined.             With      the above two colours the Germans were
Jong satisfied,          till    at length,        in
                                  the 12th century, a great
many artists and manufacturers   took shelter in Germany in
consequence   of Milan being over-run by the emperor Fre
deric I. and by the crusades the Germans in the East became
more and more acquainted with the woollen manufactories,
which they afterwards brought back with them into their
own country f-
  These circumstances, and the encouragement given to the
German navigation and trade with foreign nations J by the
Rhiniih     Hanscatic league in the 13th century, encou-'
                and
raged the Germans not only to apply with more ardour to
their home manufactures, but rendered it necessary for them
to obtain better dyers and dye-stuffs, that their manufactures
might find a good sale in foreign markets. They endeavoured,
therefore, to procure from Italy and the Netherlands, where
the art of dyeing, as is well known, had been much culti
vated, expert workmen §, who, from the woad which they
chiefly employed for dyeing blue and green colours, were
called woad dyers and also cloth dyers because they dved            \\,

  either because the Rhenish league encouraged cloths of beau
  tiful colours, or because a great many dyers from Rhincland
  had settled in other provinces               of Germany.
      The     above     league,     however, endeavoured               to encourage
  dyeing in Germany,             not only by promoting trade and pro
 curing expert dyers, but also by various laws and regulations.
 Thus we find, besides others, an ordinance of the Hanfe
  towns, written at Lubec, in Latin, in the year 1418, the
 sixth section of which contains the following passage : — " No
 merchant shall purchase undyed cloth in any town and dye
 it in another; but the cloth shall be dyed in the place where
 it   is bought,       under the penalty of forfeiting the cloth and
  the   dye-stuffs*."
      After this period       we find two kinds of dyers in Germany,
 •viz. the before-mentioned cloth, ivoad, or Rbenifh dyers, and
 the old black or ordinary dyers.                     The former endeavoured
 chiefly to improve their art by new inventions, as was the
 cafe in the 16th century, when a fine dyer, whom some call
 Kiister, others KiifHer, some Kepfler, and the Dutch Drebel,
 found out, by means of a solution of tin, the art of dyeing
 the new scarlet colour \.                 From this dyer the before-men
 tioned German painter, Kloeck or Gliick, learned the art;
 and Gobelin having been taught it by the latter, it was soon
 made known over a great part                  of Europe.        Besides,     the Ger
 mans now began to establish silk manufactories ; and as silk
 required a particular method of dyeing, there arose a new
 kind of dyers called silk-dyers, of whom mention is made in
 the laws      of  the empire in the 16th century               J.

being imported into Europe, were much employed by the
German, Italian, and French dyers.    By these productions
they were enabled to prepare dyes much more beautiful and
at less expense than they had ever been able by means                of   the
dye-stuffs before known.
  As the Germans did not obtain these new dye-stuffs so
early, and were not yet acquainted with the art of treating
them,  the Flemish and French dyers came to Germany in
great numbers,  and united themselves to the German cloth
and woad dyers, under the name of the art, worn!, and fine
dyers*.
  Thus, in the middle of the 16th century, a Fleming, named
John Nicolaus Schmidt, established a house for fine dyeing at
Geraf. But on this occasion the jealousy and envy of the
black dyers, who had hitherto been secret enemies to the
woad dyers, were displayed in their full force. They not
only persecuted with all their might the new strangers, but
they endeavoured          to make the new dye materials, which the
sine dyers particularly used, to appear to the different princes
contemptible and pernicious ; especially as they were already
disagreeable to financiers, because they lessened the consump
tion of indigenous productions, and especially of woad. The
elector of Saxony { and duke Ernest the Pious §, therefore,
not only issued severe prohibitions against indigo ; but it was
made a subject of discussion at the diet, where it was de
scribed as a pernicious eating devil and corrosive dye-stuff              ||.
   The use of these ingredients, however, had become    pre         so
valent, and their superiority to the indigenous was too evi
dent to admit of their being entirely banished. On the other
hand, the division into sine and common dyers, to which the
French and Dutch dyers were already accustomed, was more
firmly established; and both kinds distinguished themselves
by  their greater or less dexterity                  by
                                    the dye-stuffs they em-
                                                 ;
  * Hence arose, no doubt, tiie connection which still subsists
                                                                between the
German    fine dyers and the French, English, and German       dyers, i.% the
black dyers cannot go beyond the boundaries of Germany.

the common linen dyers, as they were then called.                       They

        XL. A       Biographical Sketch       of Count Rumford.
 OIR BENJAMIN                  THOMPSON, Count of               Rumford,     a
 native of America, was born in the town of Rumford, in
 the province of Massachusets.                 In the American war he
 raised a regiment        of dragoons, and signalised himself on dif
 ferent occasions        in the service of the mother country. In
 February 1784 he received from his Majesty the honour of
 knighthood ; and in the fame year, with his sovereign's per-
 miffion, engaged in the service of his Serene Highness the
 Elector of Bavaria.
     In that     electorate  his services were     of the    most active and
 useful kind ; for, iri addition to the duties           of his military pro
 fession,    he devoted himself to the amelioration            of the condi
 tion    of   the vagrant     poor   : a  Herculean labour, of which no
  one can form an adequate idea without                perusing  the account
 since    published by the Count, and yet managed with so
 much address as to conciliate the good wishes of even the

mendicants themselves,         and to beget    in them habits of in*
 dustry, cleanliness, and sobriety.
    In pursuing     the plans    of  oeconomy     necessary to give the
greatest efficacy to these improvements in Bavaria, he was led
to devote hie attention to the means of providing the greatest
quantity of nutriment with the least poflible expense, and at
the same time pleasing and palatable.            The oeconomy of fuel
 also claimed his attention ; and to these laudable motives we
 think   the world is chiefly indebted for the philosophical in
 vestigation   of those important particulars so ably conducted
by   count   Rumford    in his various Essays, and from which, in
 former volumes, we have laid several interesting abstracts
 before our readers.
    The estimation in which        these services rendered    to Bavaria
were held by the elector may be estimated by the marks of
 honour conferred by him on the person who rendered them ;
who was created count of Rumford, knight of the orders of the
white eagle and St. Staniflaus ; and appointed chamberlain,
privy counsellor of state, and lieutenant-general in the ser
vice of the duke of Bavaria, colonel of his regiment of artil
lery,   and   commander in chief of the general staff of his
army.      The monument erected at Munich in 1795, in com
memoration of his public services, of which our readers will
find an account in our fifth volume, pages 205 and 312, will
serve to band down to posterity        the remembrance of the gra
titude of those who erected it.
    To dwell upon the benefits resulting to society from pur
suits like those in which the Count has been occupied is al
 together    unnecessary  : the public     kitchens in almost every
town and village in the kingdom are practical commentaries
upon them, which speak more to the feeling mind than could
the most elaborate eulogium.
    Of living characters propriety demands that we should say
but little.    Before closing, however, this very brief sketch, we
must take notice of the zeal manifested by the Count for even
the future furtherance of the advantages resulting to mankind
by the oeconomy       of fuel.    For this   purpose,   on the iath of
July   1796, he deposited with the Royal Society one thousand
pounds stock in the three per cent, consols,
                                                      " to the end that

Ihe interest may be applied once every second year as a pre

improvement which shall be made and published by printing,
or in any way made known to the public in any part of Eu
rope during the preceding two years, on heat or on light ; the
preference always being given to such discoveries as shall, in
the opinion of the president and council of the Royal Society,
tend most to promote the good             of mankind."
    The formalities       to be observed by the president and council
in deciding on the comparative merits of those discoveries
which in their opinion might entitle the authors to be con
sidered as competitors for this biennial premium, the            Count
left to the president and council to determine as in their
wisdom and judgment they might judge necessary.       But in
regard  to the form in which this premium is to be conferred,
his request was, " that it may always be given in two
medals, struck in the fame dye, the one of gold and the
other of silver, and of such dimensions that both of them
together may be just equal to the amount of two years interest
of     the stock   ;   that is to fay, that they may together be of the
                                                                    '

     "   Should it     so happen   at any time that no new discovery

                 heat or light should be made in any part
within two years from the preceding adjudication, which in
the opinion of the president and council of the Royal Society
should  deserve this premium, in that cafe the Count desires
"  that the premium may not be given ; but that the value of
it may be reserved, and, being laid out in the purchase of
additional stock          in   the English funds, may be employed to
augment the capital of this premium ; and that the interest
of the fame, by which the capital may from time to time be
augmented, may regularly be given in money with the two
medals, and as an addition to the original premium, at each
succeeding adjudication of it." And it is further his " parti
cular request that those additions to the value of the pre
mium, arising from its occasional non-adjudications, may be
 suffered to increase without     limitation."
       It is principally to the exertions of this active individual,
 iun    which he was ably supported         the worthy president of

  To conclude : The different productions of count Rumford
on scientific subjects, published in the Philosophical Trans
actions and in separate essays, are so well known to the public
that any enumeration of them in this place is unnecessary.
His writings       are also well known                on the continent;     indeed
many of them            have been        translated,        and from all of them
large extracts have been given in different European languages.

T,HE           inventors of this method have secured the same
by patent, and the present account is extracted from their
specification.
    The goods to be bleached or cleansed are directed to be
first washed, and freed from the dirt and foreign matters that
may be adhering to them, and from any kind of paste or
dressing (as the workmen call which may have been used

  When thus cleansed they are put into         lye of vegetable or

thods usually followed by bleachers ; the present invention
not consisting in the kind of alkaline lyes or other liquors
employed, or in the way of preparing them, but in the mode
of applying such alkaline, soapy, or other lyes, and in the
method of obtaining and applying the volatile alkali or am
monia to the fame purpose ;' for, when the goods or articles
to be bleached are immersed in the alkaline, soapy, or other
lye or liquor zs before directed, instead of boiling or bucking
them in      it,
             as   the practice usually followed, the patentees
                         is
only steep them, or keep them long enough in the said lye to
be thoroughly impregnated with        which requires it,longer                 a
or shorter   time according to the quantity and texture of the
articles or goods. The goods are then drawn out upon      rack                     a
over the vessel  in which they were impregnated, and suffered
to drain,that the superficially adhering lye or liquor may
run from them back into the said vessel. After this draining,
the goods will still hold   sufficient quantity of the lye or
                                            a
liquer employed to answer the end in view. They are then
put into  vessel of sufficient strength and dimensions, which
             a

                 a                   boiler, kettle, or cal  a
dron, which they call the steaming-kettle, and which may
be of any convenient form and dimensions.   The tube above
mentioned may         from any part of the edge or of the fide
                              pass
of the steaming-kettle, or even from its cover, which ought
to   steam-tight into any part of the fide or bottom of the

nished with          a   stop-cock,        a   valve, or any contrivance that           will
answer  the purpose of shutting and opening at pleasure the
communication between the said kettle and vat. The steam-
ing-vat ought, for the convenience of lifting out the goods,
to be furnished with                 a   false bottom   of   some kind   in   the inside,
as   of    wood or       of rret-work, for         the goods to lie upon      ;    and to
this false bottom should be attached ropes, means of which,       by

J20                        New Method of Bleaching
communication    between the steaming-kettle and steaming-
vat; the former, which contains some water or aqueous solu
tion, being kept at a proper heat by means of a sire put under
it, and the latter having previously its cover fitted on steam-
tight.        The       steam   is   were, pent up in the kettle
                                      thus,     as   it

fired, or that the strength of the vessels may be able to sustain.
To    secure the safety              of the        people      employed, the apparatus
ought always to be furnislied with  safety-valve, attached toa
any part of the steaming-kettle or of the steaming-vat, or of
the tube of communication, that, when the elastic force of
the inclosed           steam reaches           a   determined point, the valve may
open     of   itself, and        allow    a    portion of            it   to escape.           By    th'13
process the goods can be heated considerably                                  above the boil

               ;   a                     much to the dissolving     so
power of the alkaline or soapy or other lye, that the quantity
left in the goods after draining, as before described, , found                              is
sufficient to dissolve and discharge     one steaming as much  by
of the resinous, gummy, or other impurities from the goods!
under process, as could have been discharged       long boiling              by   a
of the goods in the lye itself, as the usual practice isand by                             ;
this means         a     great saving           is   made in the alkalies and other
ingredients employed for whitening the goods. For in the
common method the colouring matter, as discharged from
the fibre or texture of the goods, diffused throughout the
                                                            so is
whole lye      ;   which        soon renders          it        foul, that    it      is   obliged to
be changed long before                    it   has become saturated               with         the sub
stances       or matters         on which
                                  exercises its power.
                                                     itBut                                             by
this method there      no more lye employed for one steaming
                                is
than what     sufficient merely to impregnate the goods tho
                   is
roughly;  and  the alkali, thus deposited in the texture or
fibre of the goods under process,     more or less disengaged is
from the said texture or fibre                       by
                                 the action of the steam, and
is   found at the bottom of the steaming-vat, of                                  a   dark colour,
occasioned         by    the matters           it    has dissolved and carried down
with it.   The steaming-vat may be very commodiously freed
from this deposit                by
                         common siopcock, or even
                                      a               plug, at                             a
or near its bottom, to be opened as often as may be necessary.
     The      fame      end     is   also effected         by    using     only   a   -deep      boiler

impregnated with the alkaline or other lye, as before directed,
on frame or net-work over boiling water in the said boiler,
and employing oxygenated muriatic acid, acidulated waters,
mill-washing, or      exposure to the sun and air when these
may   be   necessary.    Particular care must be taken to keep
a supply of water or some aqueous solution in the lower part
of the boiler below the frame or net-work on which the
goods lie, as otherwise     they may be singed or actually burnt,
and   a loss  be consequently incurred.       But putting them in
steaming-vats is preferable to putting them in a boiler in the
manner just described ; and that on several accounts, but espe
cially because by means of one steaming-kcttle steam can be
thrown into as many vats as can be conveniently ranged
round it ; which is a mean of making a considerable saving
in the article of fuel.
    One steaming generally requires from four to eight hours ;
but the length of time will vary according to the kind or
quality of the goods to be whitened, and the strength of the
lye that has been employed for impregnating them.              After
the steam has been continued a sufficient length of time, the
cover of the steaming-vat is taken off, the communication
with   the steaming-kettlc is cut off by means        of the soresaid
cock or valve provided for that purpose, and the goods are
lifted out by means of a crane or pulley, or other fit mecha
nical power, as before mentioned. They are then well washed
by milling, or by any of the processes followed by bleachers :
after this they are again impregnated with lye, steamed, and
then washed; and these manipulations are repeated in the
manner that has already been described,          till the goods   are
brought to the required degree of whiteness and purity.          The
visual operation   of steeping in acidulated waters, and exposure
to the sun    and air, or to the action    of the oxygenated    mu
riatic acid, in such stages of the process as the bleacher may
think proper, may be employed with advantage in this me
thod as well as in the common and usual method of bleach
ing.    Every bleacher's own experience         must   point out to
him, that when acidulated        waters, exposure   to the  sun and

JM                    New Method as Bhdching
 air, or the oxygenated muriatic acid, are to be employed after
 any steaming, the goods should first be washed.
    When silk,     sheep's wool, or goods containing sheep's wool,
 or animal hair or fur of any kind are wished to be cleaned,
 scoured, or whitened by the above-described method, the lye
 employed ought to be much weaker than in the case of cot
 ton, flax, or hemp, or of goods manufactured of these or any
 of them ; for a strong caustic lye would entirely destroy the
 former, and convert them into          a saponaceous   matter.
    By the means above described, or by another or different
 application of the volatile alkali or ammonia, the manner of
 performing which shall be immediately described, a degree
 of  whiteness   and purity may be given to cotton-wool, flax,
 hemp, filk, and sheeps' wool, and to goods of every description
made or manufactured of any of them, or of mixtures of all
 or any of them, which cannot otherwise be obtained but at
 a much greater expense.
    When     the volatile alkali is to be employed      in place of that
 already described,    that as little  of the volatile alkali as possible
 may be lost, it is recommended, that instead of the safety-
 valve being affixed to some part of the stcaming-kettle or of
 the steaming-vat, or of the tube of communication between
 them, so as to allow the steam to escape when it acts with a
 certain force, it may be attached in such a manner that
 when opened by the internal pressure the vapour may not
 escape into the atmosphere and be lost, which would occasion
 a waste of the alkali, but may pass into a worm passing
 through a refrigeratory, that it may be condensed, and fall
 into a receiver adapted to the lower extremity of the worm.
 This part of the apparatus is exactly similar to that employed
 in the distillation of ardent spirits; but the receiver should be
 surrounded     with cold water       as  well  as the worm, the more
 effectually to condense the volatile alkali.       The worm-tub     and
 receiver   may either be elevated higher than the steaming*
 kettle, for the purpose of returning the condensed alkali from
time to time from the receiver into the steaming-kettle, by
means     of  a tube  of communication         and a stopcock   between
 these two,    in this manner    to keep up a continual circulation

of   the  volatile alkali    ; or they may stand at any convenient
place at the fide of        the steaming-kettle or of the steaming-
vat, and the condensed alkali, instead of being returned into,
the steaming-kettle, may be laid aside for other purposes, or
for sale, as the way and manner ia which the patentees ob
tain the volatile alkali and apply it to the purpose intended,
and which constitutes a part of their invention, may some
times render      such sale advisable; that is to fay, instead of
employing      volatile  alkali or ammonia in the prepared state,
as usually sold in commerce, they employ either urine or soot>
or any substance containing it naturally, or which may be
made to produce it by either putrefaction or lixiviation, or
any of the common chemical processes that may not be too
expensive for such an application and use.
    Thus,   if urine   be the material employed for producing the
volatile alkali, it should be allowed to stand till it putrefy or
become stale ; for which about a week's time in summer, and
three or four weeks in cold weather,              will generally be requi
site ;  but, indeed, the longer the        better. By this putrefaction
an internal movement and new arrangement in the elementary
principles of the urine is effected by nature so as to produce
in it  real volatile alkali, which only requires         to be called forth
and brought into action by the aid of proper means, of which
the following may serve as an example : — To about eight
parts of stale urine add one part of caustic or quick-lime,
the freslier    burnt the better      ;  stir the ingredients, and allow
them to    rest for about     six or eight hours, to give time to the
sediment    to settle at the bottom       of the cask or other vessel in
which the mixture         is made.      The clear liquor or lye may
then be drawn off bv a plug or cock at such a height from
the bottom of the vessel as to allow the lye to run off without
disturbing the sediment.           By this means the volatile alkali
which was formed in the urine by the putrefactive process is
rendered caustic, the lime seizing on the carbonic acid which
served to neutralise     it and render it mild ; and all that is now
necessary is to put this lye into            the steaming-kettle before
described,    and then, by means         of   heat, the whole alkali wiH
disengage itself from the urine and pass into the steaming-
vats, to exercise its action upon the goods deposited therein,

     If   soot be           employed to furnish the volatile
                     the substance
alkali, a lye must be prepared from it by lixiviation with
water.   For this purpose, a cask or other vessel mould be
provided with a double bottom, the upper one perforated
with a number of small holes, and the space between the
two filled with straw, or with any material -which will lie
open   enough to allow the lixivium to percolate, and yet
close enough to prevent the soot from pasting with the clear
liquor, such straw or other material being intended merely
to perform the office of a filter. Into this cask or other vessel
the soot is to be introduced above the double bottom, and
water is to be thrown upon                  it,   in which       it   sliould be allowed
to remain for some hours;                        after which   the water maybe
drawn off       by   a   hole    in   the side   close to the lower bottom of the
cask or other vessel aforesaid,                  and    will    be found to have ex
tracted  considerable quantity of volatile alkali from the soot,
           a
and to have become an alkaline lye, which, after being ren
dered caustic        by   the addition of about one pound of quick
lime      to every eight pounds      of the lye, may then be conveyed
to the steaming-kettle, and applied to the purpose of bleach
ing, whitening, and purifying, in the manner before directed
respecting the lye prepared with stale urine and quicklime; or
it may, before being rendered caustic, be again put upon                              a
second and    third quantity of soot, and made to pass through
                a
them      as at first     to render       it     more alkaline,         and being then
rendered       caustic      by   quicklime,            as before      directed,   may be
applied to the purpose aforesaid.
  Where such simple and cheap     materials as urine or foot
cannot be procured in sufficient quantity, other substances
may be employed for the production of the volatile alkali, or
for extracting from; or the common volatile alkali of com
                     it

varied in form, shape, and arrangement, to ans.ver the scite
and other  circumstances connected with particular buildings.

than any other that has heretofore been made use of, the
action    of the alkali being much more powerful when pent
up in close vessels than when otherwise applied, and all waste
being thereby prevented.        Even the volatile alkali that may
remain condensed in the fibre or tissue, or on the surface of
the goods when taken from the steaming-vat, ought not to
be lost.    The goods should be rinsed in water to extract the
alkali from them, and this water should be employed for the
next lixiviation    of the  soot, where soot is made use of, or
should be thrown       into the steaming-vat, and the volatile
alkali be separated from it by means of heat, and made to
pass into the receiver before described,     which will never re
quire a long time or a waste of much fuel, being so much
more volatile than the water that it soon     passes over.
    In the application of the volatile alkali, the goods may be
taken from the steaming-vat or vats from time to time, and
the operations of washing, steeping in acidulated waters, ex
posure to the sun and air, or to the action of oxygenated
muriatic acid, be employed with advantage in such stages of
the process as the bleacher may think proper, as has been
above observed respecting the application of fixed alkaline,
soapy, or other lyes, to the bleaching, whitening, and to the
purifying     and cleansing of the various goods above enume
 rated, by   the use or through the medium of any apparatus
 constructed on the principles before stated. When cloth or
 garments are to be washed         and cleansed   by means  of the
 steaming apparatus before specified, they may be impregnated
 with a strong solution of soap made from tallow, or from oil,
 or from fish, or from bones, or from wool, and with or with
 out an addition of fixed alkali, and with or without the ap
 plication of the volatile alkali in the manner before specified.
 It  is only necessary further to observe, that oak should not be
 employed in the construction of the steaming-vat or other
 necessary vessel, nor any kind of wood that contains that sub
 stance known      among chemists by the name of the gallic
 acid, and formerly called the astringent principle, becaute a
  portion of it might be dissolved in the lye, and would not fail
  to exercise its action upon the steaming- kettle if made of
  iron, (which is the best material for that vessel,) and would
                                                           produce

 goods : nor should any kind of brass or copper be made use

 an action on these that they would be partially dissolved, and
 prove injurious to the process.

                        IV. Of     Fermentation.
   1 HE     must   is scarcely put into the vat when it begins to
 ferment.     That which flows from       the grapes by the pressure
 or agitation they receive during the carriage, works and fer
ments before it arrives at the vat.           This is a phænomenon
which any one may easily observe by following the vintagers
in warm climates,        and carefully examining the must       which
issues from the grapes and        remains mixed with them in the
vessel used  for carrying them.
    The antients carefully separated the first juice, which can
arise only from the ripest grapes, and which flows naturally
by the effect of the slightest pressure exercised on them. They
caused it to ferment separately, and obtained from it a deli
cious beverage,     which they called     protopon.    Mujlum fponte
dejluens,   anlequam     calcentur  uva.    Baccius has described      a
similar process practised by the Italians 1 Qui primus liquor
non calcatis uvis defluit, vinum efficit virgineum, non inqui-
natum fœcibus ; lacrymam vacant Itali; cito potui idoneumft
et valde utile.     But this virgin liquor forms only one part of
the juice which the grapes can furnish, and it cannot be
treated separately, except when it is required to obtain wine
very delicate and little coloured.       In general, this first liquor
is mixed with the rest of the grapes which have been trod,
and the whole is left to ferment.
    The vinous fermentation is always effected in vats of stone
or of wood. Their capacity in general is proportioned to the
                                                             quantity

                and the Method of making Wintt.                     327
quantity of the grapes collected from one vineyard.              Those
constructed of mason-work are for the most part of good cut
stone, and the inside is often lined with bricks, joined toge
ther by a cement of pozzolano or strong clay.             Wooden vats
require more care to maintain them, are more subject to
variations of temperature, and liable to more accidents.
    Before the vintage is put into the vat, care must be taken
to clean it.    It  must   therefore    be washed     with warm water
and well scrubbed,      and  the   sides   must be covered    with two
or three strata of lime.       This covering is attended with this
advantage, that it saturates a part of the malic acid, which
exists abundantly in the must, as we shall show hereafter.
    As the whole process of vinisication takes place during
the fermentation, since it is by it alone that the mufl passes
to the state of wine, we think it necessary to consider this
important subject under several points of view.               We shall
first speak of the causes which contribute to produce ferment
ation;    we shall then examine its effects or its product,         and
shall conclude   with deducing, from what we actually know on
the subject, some general principles which may direct the
agriculturist in the art of managing it.
    Of the Causes which have an Influence on Fermentation.
    It is well known that to establish fermentation, and make
it follow all its periods in a regular manner, some conditions
with which observation has made us acquainted are necessary.
A certain degree of heat, the contact of the air, the exist
ence of a sweet and saccharine principle in the must — such
are nearly the conditions that are requisite;          we shall endea
 vour to make known the effects produced by each of them.
     I. Influence  of  the Temperature       of  the Atmosphere   on
                             Fermentation.
    The 54th   degree of Fahrenheit      is pretty generally considered
 as the temperature    most favourable to spiritous fermentation ;
 below that degree it is languid ; above, it becomes too tu
 multuous.     At a temperature too cold or too hot, it does not
take place at all.    Plutarch observed that cold could prevent
fermentation,     and that the fermentation        of must was always
                                                          proportioned

gat                   On the Cultivation                of the Vine,
proportioned to the temperature of the atmosphere *. Bacon
recommends the immersion of vessels containing wine, in the
sea, to prevent its decomposition. Boyle relates, in his Treatise
on Cold, that         a        to keep his wine in the state of
                          Frenchman,
must, and preserve to it that sweetness of which some persons
are fond, closed the cask hermetically, and immersed it in a
well or a river.   In all these cases the liquor was not only
kept in a temperature very unfavourable to fermentation, but
it was secured from the contact of the air, which checks,
or at least moderates, fermentation.
   An extraordinary phænomenon, but which seems con
firmed by a sufficient number of observations to merit full
belief,    is,
         that fermentation                    is
                             slower as the temperature has
been colder            collecling the grapes. Rozier found
                  at the time      of
in 1769, that grapes collected on the 7th, 8th, and 9th of
October remained in the vat till the 19th without showing
the least sign of fermentation   the thermometer in the morn
                                              :
ing  had  been  at     degrees
                          3\   below  freezing, and maintained
itself at  + 4. The fermentation was not completed till the
35th while similar grapes collected on the 16th, at
      ;                                              tem                                a
perature much less cold, terminated their fermentation on
the aist or 22d. The fame thing was observed in 1740.
   In     consequence         of    these principles,              it   has      been   recom
mended      to place the vats            in    covered places    to remove them
                                                                        ;
from damp and cold places                 ;       to cover them, in order to mo
derate the cold of the atmosphere         to heat again the mass

day for collecting the grapes, or to expose them to the sun, &c.
                 2. Influence       of   the     Air   on   Fermentation.
   We      have     seen   in      the preceding article that fermentation
may be moderated and retarded                           by
                                       withdrawing the must
from the direct action of the air, and keeping   exposed to                     it              a
cool temperature.   Some   chemists, in consequence of these
facts, are of opinion that fermentation can take place only
by  the action of the atmospheric air but      more attentive -,            a
observation of all the phænomena      presents in its different
                                                        it

states,                       just value on all the opinions

    The air, no doubt, is favourable to fermentation. This
 truth seems established by a concurrence of all the facts
 known ; for, when preserved from the contact of the air,
 must    will  keep a long time without any change or alteration.
 But it   is proved also, that though must shut up in close vessels
 undergoes      very slowly the phæuomena of fermentation, it at
 length terminates, and that the wine produced by it is more
 generous.       This is the result of the experiments of D. Gentil,
    If a little yeast of beer and molasses, diluted in water, be
 introduced into       a flask   with   a bent   beak, and      if the beak  of
 the flask be opened under a bell silled with water, and inverted
 over a pneumatic tub, at the temperature of 60 or 65 degrees                  j
 according to my observations, the first phenomena of fer
 mentation will always appear a few minutes after the appa
 ratus has been thus arranged ; the vacuum of the flask soon
 becomes filled with bubbles and foam ; a great deal of car
 bonic acid passes under the beli ; and this movement does
 not cease till the liquor has become spiritous.                    In no cafe
 have I ever seen an absorption of atmospheric air.
    If, instead   of giving    free vent to the gaseous matters which
escape by the        process   of fermentation,       their disengagement
be checked       by keeping      the fermenting      mass   in close vessels,
the movement then slackens, and the fermentation termi
nates only with difficulty and after a very long time.
    In all    the experiments which           I tried   on fermentation,      I
have never seen that the air was absorbed.                 It neither   enters
into the product as a principle, nor into the decomposition as
an element;        it is expelled from the vessels with the carbonic
acid, which is the first result of the fermentation.
    Atmospheric air, then, is not necessary to fermentation j
and if it appears useful to establish a free communication
between the must and the atrnosphere,             it is because the gaseous
substances      which     are formed     in the fermentation may then
escape, by mixing          with   or  dissolving in the surrounding air.
It follows ajfo from this principle, that when the must is put
into close      vessels the   carbonic acid     will find     obstacles to its
volatilisation : it will be forced to remain interposed in the
liquid ; it will be dissolved there in part, and, making a con
tinual effort against the liquid, and each of the parts of which
   Vo^.lX,                             T<                                    H

it is   composed,          it will slacken and extinguish                           almost com
pletely, the act         of fermentation.
   That fermentation therefore may be established, and pass
through all its periods in a speedy and regular manner, there
must, be a free communication          the fermenting mass
                                                     between
and the atmospheric air. The principles which are then dis
engaged by the process of fermentation easily enter the at
mosphere, which serves them as a vehicle, and the ferment
ing mass from that moment may,' without any obstacle, ex
perience movements of dilatation and expansion.
   If wine fermented in close vessels is more generous and
more agreeable to the taste, the reason     that     has retained    is,        it
the aroma  and  the alcohol, which are  in part lost  in ferment
ation that takes place in the open air for, besides their being;
dissipated     by
               the heat, the carbonic acid carries them to                                          a
state of   absolute solution, as we shall show hereafter.
    The    free     contact of the atmospheric air accelerates fer
mentation,         and occasions           great loss of principles in the
                                            a                                                      al
cohol and aroma               ;   while, on the other hand, the withdraw
ing of that contact               slackens the movement, threatens                          explo
sion and rupture, and the fermentation requires                                      a   long time
to be complete. There are therefore                                 advantages           and disad
vantages on both fides but perhaps      might be possible to
                                        ;                           it
 combine these two methods with       much: success as to re   so
 move all their disadvantages. This, no doubt, would be the
 highest point of vinisication. We shall see hereafter that
 some processes practised in different countries, either for
 making brisk wines, or preserving to them  certain agreeable              a
 perfume, give us reason to hope    for  more happy result of       a

   In general, fermentation    is the more rapid, speedier,          more
tumultuous, and more complete, as the mass is more consi
derable. I have seen the fermentation of must in a cask not
terminated till the eleventh day; while a vat filled with the
same liquor,    and containing twelve times the volume              of the
cask, ended on the fourth day.       The    heat    in the    cask never
exceeded 70 degrees j in the vat it rose to 88.
   It is an incontestable principle, that the activity            of    fer
mentation     is proportioned   to the mass ; but we must                not
thence conclude that it is always of advantage to carry on
the process of fermentation in a large mass, or that the wine
arising from fermentation established in the largest vats has
superior qualities : there is a term for every thing, and there
are extremes    equally dangerous, which must be avoided.                To
have complete fermentation, care must be taken not to obtain
it with  too great precipitation.    It is impossible to determine
the volume most favourable to fermentation; it even appears
that it ought to be varied according to the nature of the
wine and the object proposed.        If it be the preservation of
the aroma, it ought to be performed with a smaller mass
than when it is required to develop all the spiritous part to
make wines proper for distillation.       I have seen the thermo
meter rise to 92 degrees in a vat containing thirty muids*
of vintage Languedoc measure. In that case, indeed, all the
saccharine principle is decomposed; but there is a loss of a
portion of the alcohol by the heat and the rapid movement
which the fermentation produces.
    In general, the capacity of the vats ought to be varied
 according to the nature of the grapes.         When they are very
ripe,  sweet,  saccharine, and   almost  dry,  the   must has a thick
consistence,    &c. fermentation takes place with difficulty,
and a great mass     of liquid is required that the syrupy juice
may be entirely decomposed; otherwise the wine remains
thick, sweetish, and too luscious. It is only after being long
kept in the cask that this liquor acquires that degree of per
fection to which it is capable of attaining.

       4.    Influence of the constituent       Principles    of Must     on. ¦
                                  Fermentation.
       The sweet and saccharine principle, water, and tartar, are
  the three elements of the grape which seem to have a power
  ful influence on fermentation: it is not only to their exist
  ence that the first cause of this sublime operation is due, but
  it  is to the very variable proportions of these different con
  stituent principle:> that we must refer the principal differences
 exhibited by fermentation.
       1st,   It appears proved,    by comparing the nature        of all   the
  substances which        undergo spiritous fermentation, that none
 are susceptible      of it  but those which contain a sweet and sac
 charine principle ; and it is beyond a doubt that it is at the
 expense       of this principle that alcohol is formed.         By   a  con
 sequence which naturally flows from this fundamental truth,
.bodies       in which    the saccharine principle is most abundant
 ought to furnish the most spiritous liquor.                This is what L
 confirmed by experience.             But it  is   impossible to insist too
jnuch on the necessity of making a careful distinction between
sugar properly so called and the sweet principle.                      Sugar
 without doubt exists in grapes, and it is to it in particular
 that is owing the alcohol which results from its decomposition
 by fermentation ; but this sugar is constantly mixed with a
 sweet body, more or less abundant, and               very   proper for fer
 mentation : it is a real leaven, which               almost   every where
 accompanies sugar,          but   which  by   itself cannot    produce al
 cohol.         Hence it happens that, when it is necessary to fer
ment        sugar   in order to obtain rum, it is employed in the
 state of syrup called vezou, because it then contains the sweet
.principle which facilitates the fermentation.
     The distinction      between the sweet principle and sugar pro
perly so       called has   been very well established by Deyeux in
the Journal des Pbarmacuns.
     This     sweet principle    is almost inseparable      from the prin
                                                                        ciple

ciple of sugar in the products of vegetation ; and these two
principles are so well combined in some cafes that they can
not be completely disunited but with difficulty. This is what
will long prevent sugar, perhaps, from being extracted for
commerce from several vegetables which contain it. The
sugar-cane appears to be that of all the vegetables in which
this separation is easiest.          Many facts induce us to believe that
this sweet principle approaches near in its nature to the sac
charine principle; that, under favourable circumstances, it
may even be converted into sugar : but the present is not the
moment for discussing this important point.
    Grapes, then, may be very sweet and very agreeable to the
taste, yet produce very bad wine ; because sugar may exist
only in very small quantity in grapes which to appearance
are highly saccharine.            This   is the reason why grapes exceed
ingly sweet       to    the   taste  do not always furnish the most spi-
ritous wines.          In   a word,      a very little   practice is sufficient
to enable us to distinguifli            the really saccharine      savour from
the sweet     taste,  which some grapes possess.             Thus the mouth
habituated to taste the highly saccharine grapes of the south,
will not confound with them \\\tcbaffelas} though very sweet,
of Fontainebleau.
    We ought        therefore     to consider sugar as the principle       which
gives rife     to the     formation       of alcohol by     its decomposition,
and sweet and saccharine             bodies as the real leaven      of fpiritous
fermentation.           That    must, then, may be proper for under
going     a  good      fermentation,        it ought to contain these two
principles in proper proportions: sugar alone does not fer
ment, or at least the fermentation of it is slow and incom
plete.      Pure mucilage does not furnisli alcohol ; it is only to
the   union      of these two substances that we are indebted for
good fpiritous fermentation*.
    2d, Very aqueous must, as well as too thick must, experi
ences fermentation with difficulty.                 A proper degree of fluid
 ity, then, is necessary to obtain good fermentation ; and this
    * There arc     some   mucous    bodies   capable of undergoing fpiritous fer
 mentation ; but it is probable       that   these mucous bodies contain sugar,
 which  is more difficult    ro be extracted in proportion as the quantity is les;.

  is presented by the    expressed    juice of grapes which     have  com*
  to perfect maturity.
      When the must is very aqueous the fermentation is flow
  and difficult, and the wine arising from it is weak, and very
  susceptible of decomposition.          In this cafe the antients were
 accustomed      to boil    their must    : by these means they caused
 the supernatant      water to evaporate, and brought back the
 liquor to the proper degree of thickness. This process, al
 ways advantageous in the northern countries, and in general
 wherever the     season   has been rainy, is still practised.     Maupiii
 has even contributed to make this method be more adopted,
 in proving, by numerous experiments, that it may be used
 with advantage in almost all the wine countries. It however
 appears to be useless       in warm climates ; it is not applicable
 but in   cases  when the season having been rainy has not per
 mitted the grapes to attain to the proper degree of maturity^
 or when the vintage has taken place during wet or foggy
 Weather.
     There   are some countries where baked             piastre  is mixed
with the     grapes to absorb      the excess of humidity they may
contain.      The custom established in other places of drying
the grapes before they are fermented is founded on the fame
principle.      All these processes tend in an essential manner to
remove the humidity with which the grapes may be impreg
nated, and to present a thicker juice to fermentation.
    3d, The juice of ripe grapes contains tartar, which may
be shown in it merely by concentrating the liquor, as we
have observed : but verjuice furnishes a still greater quantity ;
and it is generally trite      thaj grapes    give less tartar the more
sugar they contain.
    The marquis de Bouillon extracted from 2\ wine pints of
must about 10 dwts. of sugar and j \ dwt. of tartar. It ap
pears from the experiments           of the  fame chemist, that tartar
as well as sugar concurs to facilitate the formation           of alcohol.
?o    obtain three times       as  much ardent spirit, nothing is ne
cessary but to increase         the proportion     of the tartar and the
sugar.

                   a
without fermenting. About 16 pounds of pounded vine-
leaves were added,             and the mixture fermented               strongly for
fifteen       days.      The   fame      quantity of water         and vine-leaves,
left to ferment without sugar and without tartar, produced
only an acidulous liquor.
      In 500 quarts of           caflbnade         and    10 pounds     of cream of
tartar fermentation was fully established,   and continued
forty-eight hours longer than in vats which contained simple
must. The wine resulting from the first fermentation furnished

      appears, then, from these experiments, that tartar faci
     It
litates fermentation, and concurs to render the decomposition
of    the sugar more complete.
              Pbœnomena         of   the      FroduSs     of   Fermentation.
      Before we enter into  detail of the principal phenomena
                                     a
exhibited          by
               fermentation, we think        proper to trace out
                                                           it
briefly the progress   follows  in
                               it  its periods.
   Fermentation first announces itself                     by
                                            small bubbles which
 appear on the surface      of the must;                 by   degrees some      are seen
to arise       from the centre even of                  the mass   in   a   state   offer-
 mentation, and to burst at the surface; their passage through
 the strata of the liquid agitates all its principles, displaces all
 their moleculæ, and there soon results      biffing noise similar
                                                              a

                                a
    Small drops, which immediately fall back, are then seen
 to rise several inches above the surface of the liquid.   In that

 336                On the Cultivation   of the Vine,
 slate the liquor is turbid, and every thing is mixed, con
 founded, agitated, &c; filaments, pellicles, flakes, grapes,
 and stones, float separately, and are pushed, expelled, preci
 pitated, and thrown up, till they at length settle at the sur
 face, or are deposited at the bottom of the vessel.             In this
 manner, and by a series of intestine movement,                 there   is
 formed at the surface of the liquor a crust of greater or less
 thickness, called by the French le cbapeau cle la vendange.
    This rapid movement           and  continual   disengagement       of
 these aeriform     bubbles considerably increase the        volume of
 the mass.     The liquor     rises in the vat above its primitive
 level.   The bubbles, which experience some resistance to
 their volatilisation by the thickness     and  tenacity of the cba-
ftau,   force a passage   to themselves in certain points, and pro
 duce abundant froth.
    The heat increasing in proportion to the energy of the fer
 mentation, an odour of spirit of wine is disengaged, and dif
 fused every where around the vat ; the liquor assumes a darker
 colour;   and after several days', and sometimes         even   after   a
 few hours', tumultuous fermentation, the symptoms decrease ;
the   mass   resumes    its  former volume,     the   liquor   becomes
bright,    and the fermentation is almost terminated.
    Among the most striking phænomena and the most sensible
effects pf fermentation there are four principal ones which
require particular attention; the production of heat, the dis
engagement of gas, the formation of alcohol, and the co
loration of the liquor.
    I (hall here speak of each of these phænomena, according
to what we know of them with certainty from observation.
    1st, Produflion of Heat. — It sometimes happens in cold
countries, but particularly when the temperature is above
55 degrees, that the liquor put into the vat experiences no
fermentation, unless some means can be found to heat the
mass.     This may be done by introducing into it warm must,
stirring the liquor strongly, heating the atmosphere,             or co
vering the vat with cloths.
    But  as soon   as the fermentation begins the heat acquires
intensity. Sometimes a few hours' fermentation is sufficient
to carry it to the highest degree. Ib general it is in the ratia

established         in      every point.
     We may admit                    as incontestable truths             :    1st,   That,    at an
equal temperature, the greater the mass of the vintage the
greaterwill be the effervescence, movement, and heat,   ad,
That the effervescence, the movement, and heat, are greater
in vintage where the juice of the grapes     accompanied with           is
the pellicles, stones, stalks, &c. than in must separated from
all these matters. 3d, That fermentation can produce from
59 to 95 degrees of heat      at least, have seen

tion, have been known since fermentation itself was known.
This         gas escapes           in bubbles from            every point      of    the vintage,
rises      in   a   mass,          and bursts at the surface.                 It    displaces       the
atmospheric air which rests on the vintage, occupies every
where the vacant parts of the vat, and flows over the edges,
precipitating itself in the lowest places on account of its gra
vity.        to the formation of this gas, which takes

tion of oxygen and carbon from the constituent principles of
the must, that we shall in future refer the changes which
take place in fermentation.
     This       gas, retained           in   the liquor        by   all the means that can
be opposed             to      evaporation, contributes to preserve the
                             its
aroma and           a    portion of alcohol which exhales along with it.
The antients                were     acquainted with                these means, and they
carefully distinguished the product                            of   a

 it till the moment when, the effort of the compression having
ceased, by the opening        of the   vessels  it can escape with force.
     This acid    gas gives     to all   liquors impregnated with it a
 tartish savour.     Those mineral waters called gaseous waters
 are indebted to    it for their principal virtue.         But it would be
 having a very incorrect idea of its real state in wine, to com
 pare its effects to those which it produces by its free solution
 in water.
     The carbonic acid       disengaged     from wine holds in solution
a pretty considerable portion of alcohol.                I think I was the
 first who made known this fact, when I (howed, that by ex
posing pure water in          vessels   placed    immediately above the
chape au    of the vintage,     at the end     of two or    three days this
water is impregnated with carbonic acid, and that, to ob
tain very good vinegar, nothing is necessary but to put it into
uncorked bottles, and to leave it to itself for a month.                 At
the same time that the vinegar is formed, abundance of flakes,
which are of a nature analogous to fibrous matter, are preci
pitated in the liquor.        When water containing earthy sul-
phats, such as well-water, is employed instead of pure water,
there is disengaged at the moment of acetisication an odour
of sulphurated hydrogen          gas,   which     arises from the decom
position of the sulphuric acid itself.             This experiment suffi
ciently proves that the carbonic acid gas carries with it al
cohol and a little extractive matter;           and that tliese two prin
ciples, necessary    for  the  production     of the acetous acid, being
afterwards decomposed by the contact of the atmospheric air,
produce acetous acid.
     But  is the   alcohol dissolved in the gas, or is it volatilised
merely by the heat       ?   This question cannot be determined by
direct experiments.         Gentil observed in 1779, that when a
glass bell was inverted over the vintage in fermentation, the
inside of it became covered with drops of a liquid which had
the smell and properties of the first phlegm that passes when
spirits are distilled.      Humbojdt has proved that if the vapour
of champagne be received under bells, in an apparatus for
collecting gas, surrounded with ice, ajcohol is precipitated on
                                   <5                                   the

 the sides merely by the         impression of the cold.        It appears,
 then, that the alcohol is dissolved in the carbonic acid gas,
 and it is this substance which communicates to the vinous
 gas a part    of its properties. Every one feels, by the impres
 sion   which the vapour of champagne makes on our organs-,
 how this gaseous matter is modified,-           and differs    from pure
 carbonic acid.
     It is not the most saccharine must that furnishes the most
 gaseous acid, nor is it that employed           in general for making
 the briskest wines.       If the  fermentation of this kind of grapes
 were     checked by shutting them up in casks or jars to pre
 serve the gas disengaged from them, the saccharine principle*
which abounds in them, would not be decomposed, and the
wine would be sweet, luscious, thick, and disagreeable. There
are some wines all the alcohol of which is dissolved in the
gaseous principle      :  thafrof Champagne furnishes a proof of it.
    It   is difficult   to obtain    wine red and brisk at the same
time ; especially as, to make it acquire colour, it must be suf
fered to ferment over the skins, stalks, &c; and as by these
means the acid gas is dissipated.
    There are some wines the flow fermentation of which con
tinues for several months.           These, if put into bottles at the
proper time, become brisk : there are none, strictly speaking,
but wines of this kind capabk of acquiring that property.
Those the fermentation of which is naturally tumultuous
terminate this process too soon, and would break the vessel*
in which they are inclosed.
    This acid gas is dangerous to be respired.                Al) animals
exposed     to it arc suffocated.      Such   melancholy    accidents   are
much to be apprehended when the vintage is made to ferment
in low    places where the air is not renewed. This gaseous fluid
displaces the atmospheric air, and at last fills the whole cellar.
It  is the more dangerous as          it is invisible like air; and too
much       precaution cannot be taken against its fatal effects.
To    ascertain whether there be any danger, those who enter a
place    where vintage is in        a   state of fermentation ought to
cause a lighted candle to be carried before them          :  if the candle
continues burning, there is no danger; but if it is seen to
grow dim, and then to go out, it will be prudent to retire.
                                    U  u a                            This

    This danger may         be prevented      by saturating the gas in
proportion as it is precipitated on the floor, by scattering in
 several places milk of lime, or quicklime.            A place rendered
 noxious by this pernicious gas may be purified by throwing
 upon the floor and against the walls quicklime diluted in
 water    : a caustic alkaline ley, such as soapmakers'        ley or am
 monia, will produce       a similar effect.     In all cafes the gaseous
 acid instantly combines with these matters, and the external
 air descends to occupy its place.
     3d, Formation of Alcohol. —The saccharine principle exists
 in must, and makes one of its principal characters : it dis
 appears by fermentation,          and is replaced    by alcohol ; which
 essentially   characterises   wine.
     We fliall mention      hereafter    in what manner this pheno
 menon, or this interesting series of decompositions and pro
 ductions, may be conceived. Our business at present is to
 indicate the principal facts which           accompany the formation
  of alcohol.
     As the object and          effect of spiritous fermentation are
  merely    the  production    of   alcohol by decomposing the sac
  charine principle, it thence follows that the formation of the
  one is always in proportion to the destruction of the other,
  and that the alcohol will be more abundant as the saccharine
  principle is greater : for this reason, the quantity of alcohol
  may be augmented at pleasure             by adding to the must the
  sugar    which  seems to be wanting.
     It  invariably follows from these principles, that the nature
  of the vintage in fermentation is every moment modified and
  changed : its smell, taste, and other characters, are continu
  ally varying.      But as there is a very constant progress in the
  process   of fermentation,    it may be followed in all its changes,
  which may be considered as invariable signs of the different
  states through which the vintage passes.
      ist, Must has a sweetisli odour, which is peculiar to it,
  ad, Its favour is more or less saccharine. 3d, It is thick,
  and its consistence varies according as the grapes are more
  or less ripe, more or less saccharine. I have/ound by ex
  perience that some marked 75 degrees of the areometer, and
  others only from 40 to 43.          It is exceedingly soluble in water..
                                                                  Scarcely

                  and the Method     of making Wines.               341
    Scarcely is the fermentation determined when all the cha
racters are changed       : the odour begins to become pungent by
the disengagement of carbonic acid ; the savour, still very
sweet, is however already mixed          with  a little of the pungent ;
the consistence decreases ; the liquor, which hitherto presented
only one uniform whole, exhibits flakes which become more
 and more insoluble.
     The saccharine savour becomes gradually weaker, and the
 vinous stronger : the consistence of the liquor is sensibly les
 sened: the flakes detached from the mass are more com
pletely insulated. The odour of the alcohol is perceived at
 a greater distance.
     At  last the moment arrives when the saccharine principle
 is no longer sensible ; the savour and smell now indicate no-
 thiug but alcohol : all the saccharine principle, however, is
 not destroyed ; a portion of it still remains ; the existence of
 which is not masked by that of the predominant alcohol, as
 is confirmed by the very correct experiments of Gentil. The
 further decomposition of this substance takes place by the aid
 of the tranquil fermentation which is continued in the casks.
     When the fermentation has pasted through, and termi
 nated    all its periods, no more sugar exists; the liquor has
 acquired fluidity, and presents only alcohol mixed with a
 little extract and colouring principle.
     4th, Coloration of the vinous Liquor. — The must which
  flows from the grapes transported from the vineyard to the
  vat before     they have     been   trod, ferments alone, produces
 virgin ivine,       the frotopon    of   the antients, which is not
  coloured.
      Red grapes, the juice of which is expressed by mere
  treading, always furnish white wine when not fermented
  with the skins, stalks, &c.
      Wine    becomes      more and more coloured as the vintage
  remains    longer     without   being fermented.          Wine is less
  coloured    as   the  grapes  have    been  less  trod, as greater care
  has been taken to cause them to ferment in the skins, &c.
      Wine is more coloured         as the grapes      are riper and less
  aqueous.
                                                                     The

   The liquor furnished by the skins, &c. when subjected \o
 the press is less coloured.
   The southern wines, and, in general, those made from grapes
collected in places well exposed to the south, are more coloured
than the wines of the north.
   Such are the practical axioms which have been sanctioned
by long experience. Two fundamental truths thence result ;
the first   that the colouring principle of wine exists in the
           is,

                        ;                       is,

some of its properties,       it    is,   however, essentially different.
   Any one, after this         short explanation, may account for all
the processes usual for obtaining wines more or less coloured;
and may readily conceive that        in the power of the agri
                                           it   is

chooses.

         X. Of the      Determination           of   Eltflive Affinities.
 A   O   determine the elective affinity of two substances for
                                                                                        is a

to ascertain     in what ratio this third             substance ought to divide
its action between          the    two former, and at what degree                       of
saturation each of them ought to be when their forces arc
equally opposed.  The respective affinities will be propor
tional to the degree of saturation which each has attained in
proportion to the quantity which has acted        that,   the   ;     so      if
quantities are equal, the comparative degree of saturation                        wilt
give the measure of the respective affinities.
  ad, When       I   speak    of   the     saturation of        a    substance,
                                                                              I     do

not mean the absolute                          saturation at which all reciprocal
action would cease;                     but    a degree  of saturation which it is
easy to ascertain,               and which is common to all combinations :
it is that of neutralisation, when              the properties of neither of
the constituent parts predominate.     The term of the crystal
lisation of salts does not always coincide with neutralisation:
for example, in regard to alkaline carbonats, which still give
signs of alkalinity, and in regard to the acidulous tartrite of
potash, which, on the other hand, retains an excess of acid.
The last combination, however, may be taken at the term at
which it         is neutral,           because it still has          the property     of crys
tallisation       :   it    is even this tartrite that is necessarily                obtained
when in the experiment there is present an excess of the base;
but when there is an excess of acid, the degree of saturation                                           .
of the acidulous tartrite of                     potash may be determined by the
quantity of           potash necessary to neutralise it.
   3d,      A    consideration which                 seems to deserve some atten
tion   is,
         that in comparing affinities    would be necessary to  it
employ in all the experiments the fame proportions of all the
substances successively subjected to operation because,    the           ;                    if
proportions vary, the result of the action not being the same,
the affinity could no longer be represented          the same                  by
number.          I     (hall render this observation                  more sensible           by   an
example      :
     Let    100 represent the potash,                     which ought        to be saturated
by 100 parts of sulphuric acid, and let 100 parts of soda be
opposed to it. Let us suppose that after the action    found                        it   is
that the potash has taken up 60 parts of acid, and the soda 40.
I should thence conclude that the affinities of these two bases
for the sulphuric acid are in the ratio of 60 to 40 but there                  :
remain 40 parts of potash uncombined, which really continue
to act, and            which           by   their action contribute           to divide the
acid        so   that,           this quantity be varied, the result cannot be
                            if, if
      ;
the same        ;     for            instead  of 100 parts of potash, and 100 parts
of   soda, we take 80 parts                    of each, we shall have for the un
combined              portion 30            parts of potash and another quantity
of   soda   ;    so    that the forces exercised                by   these two parts are no
longer in the former ratio                     :   hence   it   results that the two satu
rations cannot be in the ratio of 60 to 40.
                                                                                               4th,

    4th, But to ascertainthe degree of saturation to which
 each of these substances can attain, a separation must be
 made, which can only be effected by the elasticity, crystal
 lisation, precipitation, or action of a solvent : but we have
 seen that these different means ought to be considered as
 foreign forces, which alter the results, and which determine,
 the combinations formed, without a possibility of our measur
 ing their effect so as to disengage from it that of the elective
 affinity;     so   that the separations      which in articles   I. II. III.
 were considered only as an effect of elective affinity and of
 proportions, are really the effect of a concourse of several
 forces,   as is proved      by the observations     which followed    these
 articles.
   When it is necessary, for example, to ascertain the quan
tity of the sulphat of potash and of soda formed, as the force
of cohesion of these two sulphats does not much differ, it is
probable that it would not occasion much change in the pro
portions of the two salts which would crystallise, but it would
be necessary to separate the excess of the alkali by means of
alcohol in order to obtain the whole crystallisation ; but al
cohol not acting with equal force upon potash and soda,
would   produce a new change.     To these considerations we
may add, that  a change of proportions would not only make
the force of the soda and the potash (No. 1 .) to vary, but
also that of the alcohol, not to mention the affinity of the
water, which serves as the solvent.
   If barytes       were to be compared with either potash or soda,
 we should have changes still more considerable : in that cafe,
.the force of cohesion of the sulphat of barytes would be such
 that it would leave to the alkali but a very small quantity of
sulphuric acid, which would be the expression of the ratio of
the force of the cohesion of the sulphat of barytes to that of
the solvent,        rather than of the affinity of the barytes to that
of the alkali.
   This      is so certain, that     if,   with the view of comparing the
affinity of the acids fer barytes, we should begin     treating   by
the barytes   with an excess of sulphuric acid,      would beit
almost entirely precipitated, unless the acid were highly con
centrated;      it   would    even     be impossible to distinguish     the
                                                                  combined

                       the  Laws of Affinity.                       345
Combined portion from that which is not, and to fay that
the barytes has more affinity for the former than for the
latter. This, however, is what is really said when it is af
firmed that the sulphuric acid has more affinity for the ba
rytes than any other acid has, because a sulphat of barytes is
formed by precipitation; and thus an effect, which depends
in particular on    the force   of  cohesion peculiar to the sulphat
of barytes, is  ascribed to elective affinity.
   It  is manifest, therefore, that the elective affinity of two
substances in regard to a third, cannot be determined by a
direct experiment even when trial is made on two substances
which are in a liquid, and which may become neutralised
by saturation;    since, in order to ascertain     the saturation,   it is
necessary to employ the intervention         of foreign forces.
   5th, We     have shown     in articles II.  and   III. that the affi
nity of a substance may be compensated by its quantity.
   From this consideration it would appear that it is sufficient
to ascertain the capacities of saturation of different bases for
an acid, or of different acids for a base, in order to establish
the ratio of their affinity; for it ought to be in the inverse
ratio of the quantities necessary to produce the same degree
of saturation.
   This consequence, however, is erroneous when we               arc de^
firous of applying it to the elective affinities ; because,      as soon
as the    two substances are put in circumstances to combine
with   a third, new forces are established, which not only de
termine other results, but even change the constitution of
these substances.      Thus, if    we compare      the sulphuric    acid
with carbonic acid, it     is certain, that   if a quantity of potash
be brought to the term         of neutralisation by carbonic acid>
it exercises a  force   as great as the quantity of sulphuric acid
which would       be necessary    to produce    the same effect   :  and
yet if sulphuric acid be poured on the combination thus
formed, all the carbonic acid is disengaged ; because, not
being retained by an equal force, it resumes the elastic state :
and even if it be retained by a sufficient quantity of water,
it will no longer be in the same state of compression ; it will
no more have the same constitution         ; it will no longer be the
same substance     in  regard   to chemical action.        In a word,
   Vol. IX.                        Xx                                 we

  345                         Researches  respecting
- we must apply to the action of substances unequally saturated
   the observations made in the preceding articles.
      A    comparison, then, of the capacities of saturation, though
   it may conduct       to important considerations, cannot be ap
   plied to the determination of elective affinities.

  have, and shall oppose to them the application of principles

  solved, by means of heat, in an equal weight of nitric acid,
  crystals of nitrat of potash were obtained by cooling.             He
  ascribes (his decomposition of the sulphat of potasti to reci
  procal affinities, which produce opposite combinations with
  out determining the cause of this contrary effect.
      2d, The explanation of this remarkable fact has been con
  tradicted by Bergman. He observes that there are salts which
  tend to have an excess of acid, such as the acidulous tartrite
  of potash. He is of opinion that, when these salts are in a
  state   of neutralisation,    we must consider their base as divsded
  into two parts     ; one upon which the whole action of the acid
  is particularly    exercised to form an acidulous fait, while the
  other part only tends to satisfy the excess of acidity in the
  acidulous salt.      This part of the base is retained then only
  by   a weak acidity,     and it may be taken away by an acid very
  inferior to that which enters into the first combination. Thus
  the acetous acid may take away part of the potash, which in
  the tartrite of potasti is superfluous, to the combination that
  constitutes the acidulous tartrite of potash, though this acid
  has    a  much weaker affinity than the tartareous acid.
      But the sulphat of potash is among the number of those
  salts which tend to form an acidulous salt; nearly two-thirds
  of   its base enter into this combination,         and it is only this
  portion which is subject, to all the affinity of the sulphuric
  acid ; the other third may be separated by an acid of an affi
  nity inferior to that of the sulphuric acid, such as the nitric,
                  4                                            muriatic,

 muriatic, or tartareous acid.         When the decomposition is
 carried to its boundary, it stops, whatever may be the quan
 tity of the acid opposed; and if the quantity is not too great
 to prevent crystallisation, or if the excess be expelled by heat,
an acidulous sulphat, which forms crystals permanent in the
air, will be obtained by solution and evaporation.
    3d, How could the illustrious Bergman deviate from the
route traced out to him by observation ? His own experi
 ments, even, prove that the acid, which is superabundant in
the acidulous sulphat of potash, exercises its affinity; that it
is in combination ; and that it acts in the ratio of its quan
tity : for he fays, that if sulphuric acid be added to the acidu
lous sulphat of potash, this salt dissolves, and loses its property
of crystallising   ; that this excess of acid can with difficulty be
expelled even by distillation in a retort; and that, to produce
this effect, the saline combination must be fused in a crucible,
or be exposed several times to the action of very pure alcohol.
    4th, The limit, then, which Bergman          gives  to the action
of acids    on the acidulous sulphat is ideal.      This sulphat ex
hibits the fame phænomena as         all the salts which are capable
of  resisting, to a certain degree,   the actioixof an excess of acid
or base (Art. V. No. 4.), as well as the action of another
acid or    a foreign base.    The only difference there is between
them in this respect depends on the force of cohesion which
may act more or less to produce crystallisation, and which is
proper to certain proportions of acid and base ; probably a
consequence      of the figure assumed by the moleculæ of their
combination.
    5th, When an acid has the property of forming a preci
pitate by combining with a base, it is concluded that it has
more affinity for that base than for the acid with which it
was first united,    without examining      how    far the new acid
may have operated the decomposition, and without reflecting
that an opposite decomposition takes place bv a simple change
of proportions, and might consequently conduct to an opposite
conclusion.
    Thus, as the tartareous acid has the property of forming,
with potash, an acidulous fait very little soluble, and con
sequently forms a precipitate with all salts having a base of
                                 X  x  %                      potash,

348                             Researches    respeEling
potash,      and not diluted with            too large a quantity of water,
it    has been concluded that it has more affinity for potash than
the other acids.    Bergman has excepted the sulphuric acid,
because he supposed   that the tartareous acid could act only
on the potash redundant to the combination of the acidulous
fulphat of potash ; a supposition which, I think, I have al
ready destroyed in the preceding articles.    He has excepted
also the         nitric   and   muriatic acids, because he supposed that
the tartareous acid showed the same phænomena in regard to
the nitrat and muriat of potash as in regard to the fulphat;
though he has not ascertained the existence of an acidulous
nitrat and muriat of potash analogous to the acidulous fulphat
of potash.
      He    also concludes,        from experiments made on salts having
a base      of   soda, but without making the experiments known,
that the tartareous acid ought to be placed after the oxalic
acid : but, not to dwell on these exceptions, the tartareous
acid, according to him, decomposes completely all the other
salts with a baseof fixed alkali.
      Whatembarrasses Bergman                    is,
                                      that the tartareous acid
produces  no precipitate with salts  that have     base of soda.  a
In his opinion, this apparent difference depends on the soda
not having the property of forming    salt but little soluble,
                                                       a
 bytaking up an excess of acid but in that cafe there
                                             ;             no                 is
evidence of decomposition, and we are to be satisfied with
                   a
the probability that the affinities of the one fixed alkali follow
the fame order as those of the other.
      All   this classification       of affinities    is   sounded   on the false
supposition, that one acid expels another from its combina
tions       by
          its affinity alone considered as constant force; and
                                                         a
this supposition renders others necessary in order to explain,
 as    exceptions, those facts necessarily               arising from   a   general
property.
    6th,  have examined the decomposition of acidulous tar-

                    the nitric acid, which, according to the
received ideas, which   then adopted, ought to decompose
                                 I                                                  it

                                              cooling, beautiful
crystals     of nitrat of       potash.   I   repeated      the operation     J
                                                                            sever
                                                                            times,

                       the  Laws of Affinity.                       349
times, adding nitric acid until no more nitrat of potash was
separated.     I then exposed the liquor to a heat sufficient to
cause the nitric acid which might be free, to evaporate with
out altering the tartareous acid. After this the liquor had
an oily consistence ; it was destitute of smell, and announced
neither the existence of nitric acid nor that of potash; but
when exposed to a strong heat there was disengaged a great
deal of nitrous gas, the tartareous acid was reduced to char
coal, and its ashes gave a considerable           quantity  of carbonat
of  potash.
    7th,  In this operation there     is separated  a part of the nitrat
of  potash, effected by the crystallising force       of that salt, and
carried by it just to the degree when that force is exceeded
by the superabundant acid. The acidulous tartar is rendered
soluble by the action of the nitric acid, which takes from it
at the fame time, by crystallisation, a part         of the  base neces
sary for its insolubility.
    On the other hand, tartareous acid added to a solution of
nitrat of potash, takes up, to a certain term, the potash from
the nitric acid, and forms an acidulous tartrite, which is pre
cipitated ; but, as it has not the property of forming an
acidulous tartrite of soda little soluble, it does not produce a
 precipitate with salts having a base of soda.
    In both     these cases, every thing that cannot be separated
 by the force    of cohesion    forms    a  liquid, in which    the sub
 stances exercise an action proportioned to their present masses.
    Nothing, then, can       be concluded      in regard to the respec
 tive affinity from these separations, which are effected by pre
 cipitation or crystallisation ; since, by the change of the pro
 portions alone, opposite decompositions may be often obtained.
    8th, The precipitation observed to take place, when, in
 comparing the affinities of two bases, one of them was
 found to have formed an insoluble combination, gave rise to
 an error of the same kind ; and it is on this foundation alone
 that it has been      asserted   that   lime has more affinity than
 alkali   for the fluoric,    phosphoric, and arsenic acids : in a
 word, for all those which form with it an insoluble combina
 tion ; and, consequently, that it has the property of decom
 posing entirely the salts formed by an alkali and these acids.
                                                                     This

35<5                             Resesrchis rtspeS'mg
This precipitation  is not the result of elective affinity, and it
is not complete, but its quantity is determined by the ratio
of the action of the liquid to the cohesive force of the preci
pitate z hence it happens that the precipitate is often re-dis
solved     on augmenting the quantity of the substance opposed
to it.
   9th,Though Bergman has explained very clearly the
changes which heat may produce on chemical action when
the substances have a disposition to volatilisation ; 3nd though
he even recommends to avoid too strong heat in evaporation,
the extent      of the influence which it may                 have   in the   opera
tions by which salts are separated, in order to form a judg
ment of their affinities, has not yet been fully discovered.
   It ought not to have been concluded that the sulphuric
acid has more affinity for fixed alkalies than the nitric or
muriatic acids, merely because that by a strong heat it expel9
these acids from their combinations.   Chemists should have
observed  that, even by the heat employed to produce eva
poration, and to cause salts to crystallise, the proportions of
the volatile acids may be considerably changed in regard to
the sulphuric acid which remains opposed to them, and that
the latter may at length entirely expel them, by means of
the difference which exists between its fixity and that of these
acids. (Art. VII. No. 5.)
   10th, We are indebted to Bergman for useful observations
on the errors which may arise from the solubility of one sub
stance,    which        is eliminated,            of which
                                             the separation is
                                            and
not observed.   He remarks that potash and soda do not dis
turb the transparency of the solution of a salt with a base of
lime,    if thissolution be diluted with fifty times as much water,
because      the lime separated, being soluble, remains in the
water j but he did not reflect that,                 if   the lime, in that cafe,
had no more than its natural solubility, it would be a very
weak obstacle to its precipitation, for it requires nearly seven
hundred parts of water to dissolve it : what adds greatly to its
natural solubility    that is,continues to be in combination
                                     it
with the acid (Art. V. No. 5.),                   and that   it   cannot be    sepa
rated     but      by   retaining   a   part (Art.   III.   No. 9.), which in
creases its solubility.
                                                                              nth,

  nth,                     his general observations, Bergman
              Notwithstanding
mistook the effects of solubility in several cases : thus, he did
not think that the nitric and muriatic acids had an action on
the combination    of the phosphat of lime, though the only
difference that can be established in this respect between these
two acids and the sulphuric acid, the comparative force of
their affinities not being known,                 is,
                                   that the two former form
only soluble combinations, while that produced by the sul
phuric acid may be withdrawn,                       in   a    great measure,            by   the
force of crystallisation.
   iath,       the solubility of the lime as well as of the ba-
              It   is
rytes, increased by the action of the acid on these earths,
which causes ammonia not to produce any precipitate in
the solution of the salts of which they are the base. The
first portion of the ammonia, however, mixed, for example,
with     the muriat         of lime,     scarcely suffers any odour to be ex
haled which indicates that
       ;                       has entered into combination,
                                           it
and that its action may be rendered sensible, as (hall be here
shown.
 I     mixed ammonia with                 a   solution of the muriat of lime,
andI     caused the liquor to evaporate                  in   a   retort   :    when    it   was
reduced        certain point, there was formed
              to    a                            pretty consi            a
derable precipitate.    continued the operation, at the end
                               I
of which the quantity of the precipitate was very much                                         di
minished;           there    was formed       a   pellicle    ;   and,         by   cooling,    a
large    quantity of crystals in pretty long needles. It was                                    a
triple   salt, from which the ammonia could be disengaged by
lime.      This salt, when redissolved, and evaporated in the
open     air, gave no more indications of ammonia in the proof
 bylime.
   It    is   seen, then, that, when the water has not been too
abundant,           the ammonia
                           precipitated     part of the lime, a
though        it        much
                   was renderedmore   soluble by the acid, and
though the action of the ammonia was considerably weakened
by the heat, which diminished its affinity and its quantity.
 In proportion as the latter was reduced, the precipitate was
 re-diffolved there however still remained ammonia after
                    :                                                                           a
 long evaporation, and              it   was only        by   the help   of the action
 of the air that        it    was entirely diffipated,               The separation of
                                                                                               the

the lime would, no doubt, become much more sensible if the
ammoniacal gas were received in a strong solution of the
muriat of lime.
     If the    ammonia produces               a precipitate with salts having a
base      of alumine, it         is because       this earth       has less solubility
than lime, even when it is combined with the portion of the
acid which it retains while it is precipitated.

XLIII.         Experiments and Remarks on Galvanism.                        A   Letter
                     from      a Correspondent       to the   Editor.
           SIR,
H         LAVING          read, with much pleasure,
able monthly publication, the several opinions and experi
                                                               in your     very valu
ments respecting the influence excited in the pile of Volta,
I take the liberty of submitting to you some observations on
the fame subject.
     It   has been           said by some very ingenious experimentalists
that the oxydation of one side of the plates, or the difference
of oxydation in the two metals, or between one metal and
different fluids, is the cause of the production of the galvanic
influence.           I   find that the acids increase              the power of my
pile, and I also find, when the papers or cards are moistened
with the pure alkalies, and particularly with a solution of pure
ammonia, that the effect is much greater than by any other
substance.  This fact             is, I     believe, sufficient to prove that the
oxydation of the metals       not the cause of the phænomenon.
                                       is
     It   is
          very convenient  to use the alkalies in this manner, as
It   does not require     much trouble to clean the metals, or
                                 so
to keep the pile in order.
I    took ten saucers, and placed in each     plate of silver and
                                                               a
a plate of zinc    connected
                         I
                         ;    these metals in the several saucers
together,       by
            means of slips of tin-foil, and completed the cir
cuit      by
        means of wires in water.        first filled these saucers
                                                     I
with      salt and      water, and found that the wires in the water
produced       a     trifling effect: some few air-bubbles escaped,
which proved that                the influence        was excited.      I    then re
                                                                                moved

              Experiments and Remaris on Galvanism.                          353
moved      the salt and water, and substituted             in its    stead    an
aqueous          of pure potash in water : a much greater
             solution
effect was produced in the liquid through which the circuit
was made. On the addition of water of pure ammonia, the
effect was very strong.
     You will     observe that    in                       I
                                                employed the
                                       these experiments
decomposition of water (as it is called), by means of platina
wires, as a galvanometer.
   As I found that the water of pure ammonia succeeded so
well in the saucers,         I
                       built up my pile, interposing pieces of
blotting-paper moistened with this alkali : I was astonished
at the increase of power; with fifty or sixty pieces of silver it
was much too strong to be agreeable.        A person above six
feet high, and very strong, started several paces on receiving
the {hock, although he knew he was to receive one ; and this
after the pile had been constructed five hours.     I mention
these facts thus particularly, because I wish to show that the
fluid excited in the pile does not arise from the action of acids,
or from any combination of oxygen with the metals.
   The next subject to which I wi(h to draw your attention
is, the effect which this new agent will have on the prevailing
theory of chemistry.     The advocates for the Lavoisierian hy
pothesis fay   that it decomposes water.   The facts which are
already before the public, completely, in my opinion, unsettle
that doctrine.    In your last Number, Dr. Moyes mentions
that the influence will not continue to decompose the water
aster it has been acted on to a certain point.   I have kept
my two platina wires in the fame small quantity of water for
months, and I find that, when connected with my pile, the
gases are produced as rapidly as when they were first used.
     Indeed, now that        I   use   the water   of pure ammonia, they
pour forth very large quantities. If a syphon be made to
connect two glasses of water, and in each be placed a wire,
one connected with the zinc and the other with the silver,
the gases are produced. If a particle of water is composed
of   a particle   of   oxygen and a particle     of hydrogen, what rapid
currents must there be of those              two substances ! Where the
oxygen is produced, the hydrogen must first descend to the
bottom of the leg" of the svphon, pass through

 of its former concomitant in the particle of water.
    ¦The visionary hypothesis* of oxygen and hydrogen being
 the bases     of certain  gases, the one a principle        of acidity and
 the other the generator of water, in their combinations also
 with another substance, azot, forming atmospheric air, ni
 trous acid, gaseous oxyd, &c. ; with carbon also forming all
 the substances of the animal           and vegetable kingdoms,          must
 now,    in concurrence with the hitherto invariable opinions of
 some   of our most learned philosophers, be entirely abandoned.
     From the experiments with the pile, it appears that the
 difference between vital and         inflammable      air does not arise
 from any difference between their ponderable parts, those
 being in both instances water. A question arises respecting
 the minus side of the pile.              How is it that, by abstracting
 electricity (which must be the cafe if the negative side be
 only deficient in quantity) from the water, that water is
 changed into an highly clastic aeriform fluid, into oxygen
 air, which bf all airs, according to M. Lavoisier, has the
 greatest capacity for containing caloric?            Surely the abstrac
 tion of fire, though it should be in the form of electricity,
 could not change water into           so  highly an elastic substance      as.
 oxygen air.
     The following conclusions       appear to me to result from what
 I  have read and seen respecting the pile          of Volta   :
    The oxydation or rusting of              the metals in the pile does
 not appear to be the cause, but the consequence, of the in
fluence.       As the rusting of the metals diminishes and de
stroys the power of the pile, I conceive the pure alkalies to
 act by reaching the pure metals.

Oxygen and hydrogen, as solid bases, are, consequently, non

    As   these two electricities change water into two airs, and
as those airs can from water be obtained                      in any proportion,
and     as   those       airs can be united, and again form water and
fire;    I   consider      those electricities as the principles of sire.
    I
    consider, therefore, that the influence is excited by the
decomposition of heat, caloric, or sire ; as the tourmalin de
composes   it by merely heating it.
  The elastic state of aeriform bodies does not depend so
much on the quantity of what is termed latent beat, as on
the nature of one of the principles of heat which it contains.
The solid oxygen, according to the Lavoisierian hypothesis,
in nitre, contains as much latent heat as in the state of gas.

35S                   Ok. the  ManujaQute and
                    On the Invention     of Gunpowder.
    Gunpowder      has for ages been known       in the east, particu
larly in China, and, it is said, has been in use there ever since
the year 85.
    The first introduction of gunpowder into Europe has gene
rally been ascribed to Roger Bacon, who wrote a treatise in
1380, in which we find the first hints for the application of
it to the purposes    of war.     In 1320, Bartholomew Schwartz,
a monk,     is said to have re-invented it in Germany,        by acci
dentally pounding jn       a mortar the ingredients of which gun
powder is made, and into which a spark of fire falling, blew
the mortar to pieces.        This opinion has lately been contra
dicted in France by Citizen Langles, who contends, in 4
memoir read in the French National Institute, that the know
ledge of gunpowder was conveyed to us from the Arabs on
the return of the crusades into Europe, and that the Arabs
made use of it at the siege of Mecca in 690 ; that they de
rived it from the Indians, who, in their sacred books forbid
ding the use of it in war, may reasonably be concluded to
have known it for ages.
    However this may be, it seems probable that gunpowder
was early known in Jndia ; for, in whatever country nitre
 abounds, there its deflagrating quality is likely to be observed.
Sir George Staunton observes : " The knowledge of gun
powder in China and India seems coeval with the most di
 stant historic events.     Among     the Chinese it has at all times
 been applied    to useful purposes,    as blasting rocks, &c. and in
making of fire-works         ; although it has not been directed
 through strong      metallic tubes, as the Europeans did soon
 after that they had discovered      it."
    The honourable George Napier procured some gunpowder
made in China, and on the average analysis of two ounces
 of it (960 grains),      he found it to consist of saltpetre 720
 grains,  charcoal    141 grains, and sulphur 89 grains.          Here
 is a deficiency of 10 grains in the process.         Now, admitting
 ^he deficiency to be in equal proportions to each ingredient,
 and bringing the fame to the proportion of 100 parts of gun
 powder, there will be,
                                                              Saltpetre

   If this is the cafe, it will be seen that their proportion dif
fers very little from the English proportion.
   Having thus given a brief account of the invention, I (hall
now proceed concisely to give the
                   Process       of manufacturing Gunpowder.
  Gunpowder is made of three ingredients, saltpetre, char
coal, and brimstone. They are combined in the following
proportions: to each 100 parts of gunpowder,                                       saltpetre        73,
charcoal 15, and sulphur 10.
     The       first thing to be attended                to, it is evident, is the purity
of   these articles ; for,           if they    are defective, the gunpowder can
never be good, though ever so well manufactured.
  The saltpetre is either that which has been                                            imported,
principally, from the East Indies, or that which                                         has    been
extracted   from damaged gunpowder.     It is refined by solu-.
tion, filtration, evaporation, and crystallisation ; after which
it   is fused, taking care not to use                        too much           heat, that there
may not be any danger of decomposing the nitre ; by this
means it is not only rendered more pure, but the water of
crystallisation more certainly got rid of. The principal object
in refining        the nitre         is,   to get   it   free from. the earths and salts
it   combined with in its grougb * state, and which
     is                                                de                                      by
liquescing would render the gunpowder liable to injury                                               by
attracting moisture, and, thereby decomposing the accurate
mixture of the composition, rendering   unfit for use.              it
   The sulphur used      that which   imported from Sicily,
                                      is                       is
and       is   refined     bymelting           and skimming               :    the most impure
is   refined      by   sublimation.
     The charcoal formerly                   used    in this manufacture was made
by charring wood                in   the usual manner.         This mode     called       is
charring in pits.           It   consists in the wood being cut into lengths
of about         three feet,sand then piled on the ground                           in   a   circular
                 *   This   is   the term used for the nitre as imported.
                                                                          8                     form

form (three, four, or five cords of wood making what is called
a pit), and covered with straw, fern, &c. kept on by earth or
sand to keep in the fire, giving it air by vent-holes as may
be found necessary.    This mode of charring is uncertain in
its operation,              and       defective        in   every respect   for the purpose
of making   good charcoal j and therefore no dependance could
ever be placed on the charcoal so made.
   The method now adopted for making charcoal for gun
powder, consists in distilling       may   call         (if
                                                   in iron cy

linders and collecting the pyro-ligneous acid, the carbon re
maining in the cylinder or retort. The wood to be charred
is first cut into lengths of about nine inches, and then put
into the iron cylinder, which      placed horizontally. The is
front opening of the cylinder     then closely stopped  at the
                                                       is                             :
further end are pipes leading into casks. The sire being made
under the cylinder, the pyro-ligneous acid, attended with                                   a
large portion of carbonated hydrogen gas, comes over. The
gas escapes, and the acid liquor  collected  the casks. The is             in
fire  kept up till no more gas or liquor comes over, and the
       is
carbon remains in the cylinder.
   This,        evident,
                  it   is         more eligible method than the
                                             is   a
former; and, indeed, the only proper one. The difference
in the strength of the powder made from the two sorts of
charcoal will be more particularly mentioned hereafter.                                    I
shall here only remark, that the proportion of powder used
for the several pieces of ordnance         the navy, &c. has beenby
reduced one-third in consequence of the increased strength of
the composition into which this cylinder charcoal enters.
   The wood, before charring, has the bark taken off; for
which purpose          felled in the summer season, when the sap
                            it   is
is up,  and     will  slow
                       it    clean.   One reason for taking off the
bark        is,
           that      would render the powder therefrom full of
                            it
sparks   which
            ;    would     be of course injurious, and dangerous
in the use*.

state, but) with as small a quantity of water as will, toge

runners have made the proper number of revolutions over                                  it,

j$d                          On the ManufaBure and
    6th, The gunpowder, thus corned, dusted, and reeled,
 (which is called glazing, as it puts a small degree of gloss on
it,) is sent to the stove and dried ; taking care not to raise the
heat so as to decompose the sulphur.                        The heat is regulated
by a thermometer placed in the door of the stoves, if dried
in a gloom-stove*.
    A   gunpowder-stove either dries the powder by steam or by
the heat from an iron gloom, the powder being spread on
cases, placed on proper supports, round the room.
    If gunpowder          is injured by damp in a small degree, it may
be recovered by re-storing it ; but if the ingredients are de
composed, the nitre must be extracted and the gunpowder
re-manufactured.
    There are several methods of proving and trying the good
ness and strength of gunpowder.                       This it is not the object of
this paper to describe;                but     I    shall  just mention one, by
which a good idea may be formed of the purity of the gun
powder, and also some conclusion as to its strength.
    Lay two or three small heaps (a dram or two) on separate
pieces    of clean writing-paper             ;    fire one of them by a red-hot
iron wire     ;   if the    flame ascends quickly, with a good report,
leaving the paper free from white specks, and does not burn
it into holes ; and if sparks fly off, setting fire to the adjoining
heaps, the goodness of the ingredients and proper manufac
ture of the powder may be safely inferred; but if otherwise,
it is either badly made or the ingredients impure.
    Having thus completed the process of manufacturing, I
shall now relate the result of some experiments I have repeat
edly made, and which have been made from large quantities
in   the manufactory.
   * This    species   of  stove consists of   a large cast-iron    vessel projecting into
one side of a room,        and heated from         the outside till it absolutely glows.
From the construction           it is hardly     possible that fire can be thrown from
the gloom,      as  it is called ; but stoves       heated  by   steam   pasting through
steam-tight    tubes, or otherwise, ought surely to be preferred ; for the most
 cautious   man may stumble,          and  if    he   have a cafe' of the powder in his
hand,    some   of it may    be  thrown upon the gloom, and it is surely possible
that in this     way some     of the accidental blowing up of powder-mills may
have been occasioned.—        Edit.
                                                                                  Exftr.

   JE#per.     I. — 100    parts of composition gain from three to
 four or five parts in weight, by the water used at the mills. ,
    Exper. a. —This water appears to be totally got rkl of by
the succeeding       processes  of manufacturing     and stove-drying;
 and therefore     it follows that the only aqueous matter in gun
 powder is what may be at first contained in the ingredients.
    Exper. 3. — The ingredients, only          pulverised   and  mixed,
 have a very small explosive        force.
.   Exper. 4. — Gunpowder granulated after having been but
 a short time on the mill has only acquired a portion of its
 strength.
    Exper. 5. — It is not till it has been the proper time on the
 mill, and been properly made there, that it has obtained its
 full powers.
     Exper. 6. —The strength of gunpowder does not depend;
on the granulation, the dust of gunpowder aster manufacture
 having nearly the fame force as when granulated.
    Exper.    7.
                 — Powder     made in every respect the same, but      of
 two sorts of charcoal, viz. pit and cylinder,         is very different,
 in strength — the cylinder charcoal rendering the gunpowder.
 made therewith much superior to that made with pit charcoal.
    Exper. 8. — Powder undried, in every stage of manufactory,,
 is weaker than when dried.
                                Observation,
    If  the composition        on a mill explodes by any accidental
cause, fliortly after it has been put on the stones, it goes off
with a very slight explosive force, principally in flame ; but
if it  has been on an hour or two under the runners, and then
explodes, it more or less destroys the mill, throwing the
boards of the covering and sides to a considerable distance.
    I shall here state a circumstance that happened, which, al
though      not immediately connected with the subject, may
serve as   a strong illustration of one branch of philosophy.        On
the explosion of the powder in a mill which had been on.
about two hours', the mill was wholly unroofed and the sides
blown out. The doors and windows of the mills on the op
posite side   of  the stream     were  forced of en outwards^   and the-
nails,   Sec. drawn.

$6z                           On the MinufaBure             and
     In   respect to the specific gravity            of gunpowder, count Rum-
ford states, that         "   a cubic foot        of water, holding iooo ounces,
will hold 1077 ounces of fine grain powder, well beaten and
shaken together; and that the real specific gravity of the solid
grains of gunpowder is as 1868 to 1000."
   I have, by repeated trials, found that the density of powder
varies considerably from various causes in manufacturing, for
which       reason    no exact           table    of   the specific gravity can 'be
given ; but I must observe, that the above, as given by count
Rumford, is the greatest it will ever attain, in my opinion.                             I
have never seen any so much, and I have frequently seen it
less than that       of water.
   In the foregoing account I have confined myself to a simple
relation of facts, from a consideration of which the following
observations are clearly deduced :
  J    That the explosive force of gunpowder depends very
      ft,
materially on the purity of the carbon employed. (Exper. 7.)
   ad, That the mixture only of the ingredients does not make
that thorough incorporation necessary for the proper combus
tion and explosive effects of gunpowder. (Exper. 3, 4, 5, 6.)
   3d, That the less moisture there       in gunpowder, the is
stronger    its effect.
             is         This clear, from gunpowder which
                                             is
has attracted any degree of humidity being weaker than
when first made.
 I    (hall now beg to submit some ideas that occur to me from
a   consideration of the whole of the circumstances    have re               I
lated, and from what may be deduced from an examination
of   the component parts                of gunpowder.        It   appears to me that
i)o part    of the   explosive force consists in elastic vapour, formed,
by the combustion,                 from water contained           in   it.   So small    %
portion of water              is   in   the ingredients, and       I    have observed
that, not any        is
                gained                  in the manufacturing,           that I  cannot
conceive any water   carried off undecomposed,
                                   is                                        but that   it
isconverted into hydrogen and oxygen gases.                              Mr. Cruick-
fhank observes,           "   after the explosion       of gunpowder         over mer
cury, no water        is      seen."     I   am    of opinion that the           explosive
force of gunpowder consists wholly                     in
                                       the several gases formed
by  the combustion   and that, the quicker that
                              ;                      takes fire,        it

                     is         given time, and its force con-

                     8                                                         sequently

                   constituent    Parts of Gunpowder.                          363
sequently     greater.    Lavoisier observes,        its effect is increased
by the quantity of caloric disengaged at the moment of de
flagration.
   It seems, therefore, that the combustion is carried on by
the oxygen supplied from the nitre ; that this gas is instantly
taken up by the sulphur and carbon; and, converting those
substances into carbonic and sulphureous acid gases, azotic
gas  being at the fame time liberated from the nitre, the
water which may be in the nitre, and also that which is in
the charcoal, is decomposed ; and the oxygen taken up by the
carbon    and sulphur, and the hydrogen set free.      The force
arising from  these gases, with the increased elasticity they re
ceive from the increase of temperature caused by the combus
tion, is surely sufficient to account for the effects we observe
in gunpowder.
   It may probably serve to elucidate the subject, if we con
sider a little minutely what the component parts of gunpowder
are from chemical analysis.
   Nitre.     100 parts   of nitre, according       to   Kirwan,    consists   of
            Potash         -         -     51-8-4
            Acid       -      -   44/b r dried in a heat of 700.
            Water of composition   4-3-'
  By several experiments, I have found that nitre which had
been dried at 700 loses 3 per cent, in melting.
  Lavoisier fays, 160 parts nitre consist of
        Potasti 49, dry acid 51,0 ; and that this dry acid               is,
                     Oxygen 49,6
                     Azot   10,4
   Charcoal, according to Lavoisier, absorbs %'$*] 14 of oxygeh
in combustion.    From several experiments which           have       I
made,    have reason to conclude, that charcoal, when used,
          I
contains about       i-8th part of water, which           it   has absorbed.
  Sulphur,       according       to Berthollet,     requires for every 100
parts  36-8 of oxygen to form sulphuric acid      of course,    ;                a
smaller quantity of oxygen would be necessary for their con
version into sulphureous acid gas   stiall take this at 30 per

                is

that know of, has been made to ascertain this point.

    Admitting the foregoing observations to be tolerably cor

constituent principles which enter into the composition ot
gunpowder       :

    And     these again contain, viz.
 Potjih.       Oxygen.       Azot.   Hydrogen      Carbon.
 3675 + 30-34 + 7.80 + 011                                    Nitre     75

    100 Parts of gunpowder, therefore,            appear to consist  of
                         Potash                 3°75

    We know         that the whole of the charcoal is not consumed
 in the act     of combustion : Mr. Cruirkstiank says 3 parts re
 main of 100 parts of gunpowder, therefore only io-i3 parts
 arc destroyed.         Now,
         10" 13 parts of carbon absorb         - 26'oij of oxygen
         And 10 parts of sulphur absorb - 3-00 of oxygen

     It is clear the smallest error in the quantity of charcoal
  used, will easily account for this difference of oxygen.              On
  the above calculation it feeing the quantity of each ingredient
  is pretty well regulated, and that the gases formed will be
                                                                  expended

induced to form the fame opinion, as to the qualities of this
residuum, as Mr. Cruickfhank : the quantity I have not had
an opportunity of ascertaining.   Mr. Cruickfhank says:
.**   This   residuum     is   very deliquescent,        and when exposed to
the air absorbs           moisture sufficient to dissolve         part of the
                                                                  a
alkali   ;   in   consequence,      the charcoal becomes              exposed,     and
the whole assumes          a   dark or black colour       :   that this residuum
is    potasli united with       a   small quantity of sulphuret of potash
ind unconsumed charcoal                :   and that 100 grains of gun
powder yield 53 grains, of which three are charcoal."

 nomy is not the object of my travels             ;  yet with zeal and ap
 plication, and by daily handling the fame instruments,                        I
 have been able to do something, and to do it better.                      As t
 traversed a country never visited by Europeans till about thirty
 years ago,       in which all the Christian missions do not amount
 to 1800 fouls, and consequently where no one has ever yet
 been able to make observations, I conceived that I ought not
to neglect      so   favourable an opportunity of enlarging our geo
graphical knowledge. You would have laughed had you seen
me amidst the Ydapamianeres Indians in the forest of Casqui-
ara,    with, my instruments mounted on boxes or trunks, while
the    (hells of tortoises served us as stools. Eight or nine apes,
which we carried with us, had               a strong desire to handle my
hygrometers, barometers, and electrometers also : around all
these ten or twelve Indians stretched out in their hammocks,
together with fires to secure us from the tigers, which are no
less ferocious here          than in Africa.        The want of nourish

    It is believed     (fee the map of father Caulin, the best ex
tant, though all the names are wrong,) that the Spanish pos
sessions   of Guyana      extend to the equator.         But  I have found,
by very good observations of the stars called the Cross and
Canopus, which I made among the rocks of Culimacari,
that San Carlos del Rio Negro, the most southern establish
ment, is in      1"  53' of north latitude; and that the line passes
through the government of Great Para, near St. Gabriel-de-
las- Cachuellas, where there is a cataract, but not so consi
derable    as the   two famous ones of Atures and Maypura.
    At Cumana,        before the earthquake, which we experienced
on the 4th of November 1799, the magnetic inclination,
measured      with Borda's compass, was found to be 440 20' of
the new division:           after the earthquake it was 430 33'; the
needle     made     229    oscillations    in the course of ten minutes.
Experiments have proved that the magnetic charge has
 changed in this part of the world, and not in the needle.
    At Calabozo, in        the centre     of Uana, lat. 8° 56' 56", long,
 from Paris 44° 40' 18", the inclination             was 39° 30': number
ef oscillations 222.
    At Atures, one of           the  cataracts   of the Orenoquo,     in lat.
 50 39', long. 440 42 19",          the inclination    was 320 85':    num
 ber of oscillations 221.

 Guaviara,     lat.  40  9*50",     the inclination was 30"      30': num..
 ber of oscillations 219.
    At St. Carlos de Rio Negro, lat. i" 53', the inclination
 was 230 20 : number of oscillations 216.
     According      to   the   rules given by Messrs. Cavendish and
 Dalrymple, care was always taken, while observing, to turn
 the compass to the east and west to find the mean inclina
 tions, and to correct the error which               takes  place when the
 axis of the needle does not         pass  exactly through its two points.

 368                  Letter from     M.A.-Humboldt
    During this journey, which lasted a year, I determined
 54 points of South America, in which I observed the lati
 tudes and longitudes: the former deduced, for the most part,
 from the meridian altitude of two stars at least ; and the lats
 ter, either from the distances of the moon from the fun and
stars, or from the time-keeper and horary angles. I am now
 employed in constructing a map of the country through which
 I have travelled ; and as my observations fill up the vacuum
 found in. the maps between Quito and Cayenne, to the north
 of   the river    of the Amazons,         I flatter myself that they will
beinteresting to geographers.
    My time- keepers have not given me with exactness, but
the differences of meridian between the places of my departure
and the Caraccas, Cumana, and St. Thomas de Nueva-Guay-
anna, lat. 8° 8 34", long, 31 of time, east from Cumana.
I am very anxious, therefore, on account of my map, to six
the position of these three places in regard to Paris, and by
observations      purely astronomical.          Besides, it is very neces.,
sary that navigators sliould be able, at the time of their ar,
rival on this coast, to find the longitude of the ports well de
termined,       that they may know the slate of their chronome
ters; for, except Martinico, Guadaloupe, Portorico, where
M. De Churucca observed ; Cayenne, and Quito, there arq
very few places the longitude of which can be depended on ;
especially     in Spanish America.             Carthagena, according to
the Connoiffance        des   Temps,    is   at  5 h. 13' 13''.   But the
three emersions of the satellites, observed by Herrera, all give
69° 24' 10' west of Cadi/, or 5 h. 13' 11" to the west of Paris,
    I  observed,    with a telescope of Dollond, which magnifies
95 times, at

    I am therefore mistrustful of the longitude of Cumana, as
given me by my time-keeper. When I arrived from the Cana
ries at the Continent,      I  found the longitude to be 4 h. 26' 4" ;
and the observations        of M. Fidalgo, who           observed emersions
at Trinidad, but not at Cumana,                  give still more; viz, 4b.
36 16".         Fidalgo found Trinidad 55' 16' 32" to the west of
Cadiz, and Cumana 2'' 41 ' 25" to the west of Puerta EfpaiJa.
But   the map       of Trinidad, publislied at London, from the
excellent observations of M. De Charucca, makes Puerta
Espain 6i° 22' west from London.                   I am of opinion, there
fore, that, in constructing the map, the authors had before
them the calculations by Lalande of the occupation of Alde-
baran, observed at Porto Rico on the 21st of October 1793 ;
for the capital of Porto Rico is by the time-keepers 4" 34 to
the west of Puerta Espaha, calculating the longitude by that
of Porto Rico 630 48' 15"; and for Cumana 66° 29' 40" to
the west of Paris.        The five eclipses of the satellites which I
fend you, must throw light on this subject                ; and, in my opi
nion,     the longitude of Cumana will not be much beyond
4 h. 25' 20". Unfortunately, the eclipse of the sun, which
I  completely observed on the 28th of September at Cumana,
making the horns pass along the horizontal and vertical wires,
was not visible in Europe. I observed the end at 8 h. 14' 22"

XI  PRIL 30. The reading of Dr. Herschcl's observations
on the nature qf the fun was concluded.   The Doctor re
marks that, if the luminous matter of the fun was a fluid,
or even of   nature similar to an atmosphere, every opening
                         a
must, by the laws of hydrostatics, be instantly filled up. His
supposition              is,
               that the fun   surrounded      an atmosphere as
                                                 is                      by
considerable                 density      on   which      the luminous             matter floats,
and       which              he    conjectures      to be      of similar nature to our
clouds.          consulted all the astronomical accounts of
                    Having
observationson the telescopic appearance of the sunvand com
pared them with the registers of the price of corn for those
years in which they were made; he infers, from          careful                           a
examination of the whole, that       those years in which few

Jan.      5,   states,    that      M. Humboldt       had set out for the Havannah,               after

    On the 14th, additional observations on the emission of
light and heat from the sun ; being a continuation of the
observations       on the nature of the fun, read April 16, 33,
and 30 : by Dr. Herschel.            These additional remarks are the
result of observations made from the ad of March to the 3d of
May,     and during the late mild weather ; and tend to confirm
the Doctor's former conjecture, as on some of the days there
were no     less  than sixty openings.         The Doctor supposes that
one   side  of  the fun has the power        offending forth more heat
than the other.         As great inconvenience         resulted   from the
heat transmitted through coloured glasses, he viewed the fun
through fluids.        Alcohol, Port wine, ink diluted with water,
 which gave an image of the fun as white as snow 5 and even
common water, answered the purpose of stopping the heat
remarkably well.

    Lalande read      a   memoir on the longitude of Alexandria in
 Egypt, which         he determined by an emersion of the star
 Antares, compared          with a complete observation        of the same
 eclipse made at Marseilles by         Thulis,    associate  of the Insti
 tute.    It  results    from this calculation that the       difference of
 the meridians is       i° 50' a6 ", which varies a little from that
 established     by  Nouet      and Quenot.      The position, therefore,

    Galvanic Experiments. — C. Cuvier             stated1  the different
opinions     that have been advanced          respecting the galvanic
fluid, and    how   far its effects  were  supposed to affect the re
ceived doctrines respecting the composition of water; but
from the length of his notice on this head, and the period
at which it came to hand, we are obliged to defer             it  ttH next
month.
    The other notices,      read by Cuvier, were the following :
                                                    — While Fourcroy
    Discussions   on the Compofithn      of IVater.
and Vauquelin        were defending the French chemistry against
the   objections which galvanism         gave rife to,    C. Van Mons,
associate    resident   at Brussels,    was combating       an adversary
who employed arms of another kind.
    Ivf. Wiegleb, a German chemist, having made water in a
 state of vapour to pass through different kinds of tubes con
 taining different masters, obtained gases different from those
which compose that liquid, according to the pneumatic
 theory. He thence concluded that water can be changed ac
 cording to circumstances into various kinds of gases.                Some
 cf the Dutch chemists, having repeated and varied these ex
 periments, sound that the gases obtained had' penetrated
 through the pore* of the ttibes, the matter of which was not
 sufficiently compact; that they were always produced by the
 substances with which these tribes were surrounded, and that
 by employing impermeable tubes nothing of the like kind
 was- manifested.       M. Wiegleb wrote a reply to the Dutch
 chemists, and Van Moris has now refuted                his answer in a
 Latin memoir.         As we cannot here enter into a minute dis
 cussion of this subject, it will be sufficient to observe that
 the "result of Van Moits is entirely favourable to the French
 theory.
     Means    of purijjir/g   the Air. — Three months      ago   I  gave an
  account of Giiyton's labour on the means of purifying the
  air, preventing contagion, and checking its progress.                 He

pher can expect for his researches : it was, in a great mea
sure,   by the processes he has pointed out, viz. fumigations
with the muriatic acid, that the epidemical disease which
ravaged Andalusia was destroyed.            This fact appears from
the report made to the Spanish government by Dr. Queralto,
sent from Seville for that purpose,      and the report communi
cated   to   Guy ton by M. Gimbernat, one of the pensioned
travellers  of the king of Spain.
   Extradion of Soda from Marine Salt. — Berthollet has been
employed on a subject of great importance to the arts, the
decomposition of marine salt.          Leblanc having published a
process    for extracting the soda, Berthollet has made some
changes in it which render it more advantageous, easier, and
applicable with more economy to the different arts in which
the oxygenated     muriated acid is used.
   On the supposed Returns      of  the principal    Variations   »f the
Atmosphere.    — To  be able to foretel the variations      of  the  at
mosphere     would  be a thing  of   so much general utility, that
it needs excite little astonishment that      it sliould, at all times,
have been an object     of research to philosophers; and it ought
to excite    less, that the obscurity in which this as well as
every other part of futurity is involved, has made those who
pretend to foresee the variations of the air to be ranked in
the fame class as those who pretend to foretel moral and
political changes. It may, however, be easily seen that these
events are not of the fame order ; that the causes of the
former are much less varied, and consequently are susceptible
of combinations less numerous; that these causes have not
the mobility of the affections of the mind ; and that, if some
of them still escape us, it is not necessary they sliould do so
always.
   These reflections induced Lamarck to examine the follow
                   "
ing question : — Among the different variations of the state
of the   atmosphere,   and   especially   those observed    in our la
titudes from 40 degrees to the poles, are there any, the perio
dical return of which can be determined?" Lamarck has been
 able to convince himself that the solution      of this question can
                                                                     not

 374                 French National Institute
not be obtained unless three means, which he points osl,
are employed in conjunction : of these means we shall men
tion that only which consists in the establishment of a regu-1
lar correspondence of observations made every day in differ
ent parts of an extensive country, in order to ascertain
whether the great atmospheric variations observed in any
one place are really the result of any cause which has a
determinable periodical return.         This means, fays Lamarck,
is so essential that it is astonishing it should have been hither
to neglected.
   After laying down       these bases,  Lamarck    gives an account
of the    results he has been able to obtain : he distinguishes
them into the knowledge of facts which cannot be doubted,
and simple observations. The alternate elevation or depres
sion  of  the moon, above or below the equator,         in the  course
of each lunar month,       produces in the atmosphere, according
to this author, very apparent effects.          During the austral
declination of the moon, and particularly on the approach of
the austral Iunistice, the winds which then prevail blow
from the regions of the north, north-west, or north-east, or
east, or from some of the points comprehended between these
points.     The constitution of the atmosphere thence resulting
tends   to give dry or cold weather, according         to the  season,
and to restore a bright atmosphere and fine weather. During
the boreal declination of the moon, and particularly the ap
proach of the boreal Iunistice, the prevailing winds blow
from some of the points opposite to those mentioned above
as predominant       during the austral declination.         The at
mospheric constitution thence resalting tends to give cloudy
weather, more or less damp and rainy.             It is favourable to
the formation of storms, which never take place            but during
this declination of the moon.
   Among      the signs which Lamarck       considers   as simple ob
servations   I (hall mention only the following, and shall em
ploy the same expressions as the author.
   " As the position of the lunar points changes very slowly,
which makes them fall for several months successively, some
times on the lunisiicial days and sometimes on the mean days,
this position gives rise to that stationary state of the atmosphere
                                                                which

 which renders these     seasons  and these years singularly re
 markable."

                          ELECTRICITY.
 x\ Correspondent,      Mr. Richard Hunt, of Howden,      observes
 that it is commonly held " that for the purpose of exciting
 electricity by a machine, communication with the earth is
 necessary, either from the cushion or the conductor; and,
 above   all, that in charging jars the jar must communicate
 with the earth ; but that this is not quite correct, all that is
 gained by such a communication being neither more nor less
 than an indirect connexion being established between the
 cushion and the outside of the jar. Accordingly he finds
 that  if the machine, the jar, and the operator be all insu
 lated, still the jar may be charged     if a communication has
 been established between the outer coating and tbi cushion by
 means    of a wire or any conducting    body interposed  between
 them."
    Our correspondent probably knows that by means of Mr-
 Nairn's electrical machine two jars are charged without
 having any connection with the ground, and that in this
 cafe,  as well as the one     he has stated,  the effect may be
 satisfactorily explained by the present   or by the Franklinian
  theory.
                          ANTIQUITIES.
    The East India Company has received from its agent, at
 Bagdad, twelve bricks of those which are still remaining near
 Hilla, on     the  Euphrates,   on the spot where the antient
 Babylon, according to major Renncl and other geographers,
 is supposed to have stood.      On these bricks characters are
 engraved perfectly similar to those which are found in Persia
 on the ruins of Chehilminar, about a day's journey from
  Sbiraz, and commonly called Persepolitan. These charac
 ters, which have already been noticed by Le Bruyn, Kamp.
fer, Niebuhr,     and others, have hitherto beeq reckoned pecu

liar  to these ruins, being only found on blocks   of marble or
on    gems dug up there.      By the discovery, however, of the
present bricks it has been proved that they were used also in
other parts, having been found amongst the ruins of the an-
tient capital of Chaldæa.      Besides, having received by this
means more copious specimens of that species of writing, it
will become easier lo decide whether these characters are of
the alphabetic, or syllabic, or hieroglyphic kind, whether
they ought to be read from the right or from the left, hori
zontally or perpendicularly, from the top or from the bot
tom.      Perhaps each word may be expressed by a particular
group, like those antient characters of the Chinese published
lately in London by the learned Dr. Hagar, where, instead
of nails, like those now made use of, leaves, flowers, brace
lets, snakes,   and   other representations, are employed,   ar
ranged in different positions to express different words.
                      NATURAL HISTORY.
    A  correspondent sends us the following curious notice : —
"   In the year 1794, a hen, belonging to captain Nicholson,
Duke-street, Whitehaven, swelled to an enormous size, which
continued near five weeks, when she died. One of his sons
 cut her open for a favourite dog, when he discovered an egg
of a prodigious bulk, which was found to contain two
chickens.      These chickens were carried to Dr. Wylie of the
 fame place, where the egg and its contents may be seen.    The
 flesh  of the hen was turned entirely  black."

    IN compliance with a wish expressed by some friends respecting
uniformity of embellishment, we recommend, in binding regular
sets of the Philosophical Magazine, that the Heads of Philosophers
deceased may be transferred from the Numbers with which they are
published, one to the beginning of each of the former Volumes, till
the first seven have each got one as a frontispiece.       Say, Lavoisier's
head to front Vol. I. Kastner's to Vol. II. Bergman's to Vol. III.
Heads for Vol. IV. V. VI.       VII.   will be given in future Numbers.
    Place Count Rumford's head at the beginning, and the illustrative
Plates at the end, of the present Volume.
    Printed   by  Davis, Wilks,       and   Taylor,    Chancery-Lane.

      HE    capture   of the island of Curacao, by the English
and the Americans, having obliged the agent of the republic,
C. Bressot, and general Jeannet to re-embark their troops, in
order to return to Guadaloupe, they have put into this port
for want of provisions j and though they intend to remain
only twenty-four hours, I have endeavoured to collect for
you some objects worthy of your attention, and which I
 hope will reach you in safety.        You are well enough ac
quainted with the nature of my travels, and the difficulty and
expense attending conveyance in the centre of a vast conti
nent, to know that my object is rather to collect ideas than
things.    A society of naturalists sent out by government, ac
companied with painters, collectors, packers, &c, might be
able to embrace all the detail of the descriptive part of na
tural history, and, no doubt, would do so ; but a private per
son, of a verv moderate fortune, who undertakes a voyage
round the world, ought to confine himself to objects more in
teresting.    To study the formation of the globe, and the
strata which compose it ; to analyse the atmosphere ; to mea
sure, with the most accurate instruments, its elasticity, its
temperature, its humidity, its electric and magnetic charge ;
to observe the influence of climate on the animal and vege
table œconomy ; to compare, on a grand scale, the chemistry
and physiology of organized beings; — such is the labour which
 I have proposed. But, without losing fight of this principal
object of my voyage, you may readily conceive that, with
much zeal and a little activity, two men, who traverse an un
known continent, may at the same time collect a great many
things, and make a great many observations.

4                      Letter from C. Humboldt
     During the sixteen months we have been traversing the
 vast territory situated between the coast, the Orenoqno, Rio-
 Nigro, and the river of the Amazons, C. Bonpland has
dried, with duplicates, more than fix thousand plants.                   I
 have   described     with him on the spot twelve hundred spe
 cies, great .part of which appeared to us to belong lo genera
 not described by Aublet, Jacquin, Mutis, or Dombey.                  We
 have collected insects, shells, and different kinds of wood
proper for dyeing ; we have dissected crocodiles, lamantins,
apes, and the gymnotus electricus, the fluid of which is ab
solutely galvanic and not electric; and have described a great
many serpents, lizards, and fish.
    I have made drawings of a great number of objects ; in a
word, I flatter myself that if I nave erred it is rather through
ignorance than want of activity.               What enjoyment to live
in the midst of these riches of nature, so~majestic and grand !
Behold, then, the dearest and most ardent of my wissies gra
tified ! Amidst the thick forests of the Rio-Nigro ; surrounded
by ferocious tygers and crocodiles ; my body tormented with
the stings of the formidable moskitos and ants; having had
for three months no other aliment than water, bananas, and
manioc, among the Otomaqua Indians, who eat earth ; or
on the banks of the Cafquiara, under the equator, where, in
the course of a hundred and thirty leagues, no human being
is seen ; — in all these embarrassing situations I never repented
of my undertakings : my sufferings have been great, but they
were only momentary.
    When I left Spain I intended to proceed directly to
Mexico, thence to Peru and the Philippines; but a ma
lignant fever, which broke out in our frigate, induced me to
remain on this coast of South America; and,thinking it possi
ble to penetrate thence into the interior, I undertook two jour
neys, one to the missions of the Chayma Indians of Paria, and
the other to that vast country situated to the north of the river
of the Amazons, between Popayan and the mountains of the
French part of Guyana.              We twice passed the grand cata
racts of the Orenoquo, and those of Atures and Maypura, in
lat. 50" 12' and long. 5= 30', W. dep. from Paris 40 43' and
40 41' 40".       From the mouth of the Guaviara and the rivers
Atabapo,     Temi,     and Tuamini, I caused my pirogua to be
carried by land as far as the Rio-Nigro, while we followed
on foot through forests of Hevea, Cinchona, and Canella
Wintertona.         I descended the Rio-Nigro as far as Saint
Carlos * that I might determine its longitude by Berthoud's
    * The error  in the latitude (d'Anville's chart) is more than two de
grees, as it had never been determined by astronomical instruments^
                                                                    time-

                         to C.  Fourcroy.                      5
 time-keeper, with which I am still well satisfied.   I ascended
 the Cafquiara inhabited by the Ydapaminares, who eat nothing
 but ants dried in the smoke. I penetrated to the sources of the
 Orenoquo, even beyond the volcano of Duida, or as far as the
ferocity of the Guaica and Guaharribo Indians would permit
me to venture, and I descended the whole of the Orenoquo,
by the force of its current, as far as the capital of Guyana;
performing a journey of 500 leagues in twenty-fix days,
without counting those on which we stopped.
    My health has withstood all the fatigues of a journey of
more than 1300 leagues; but my poor companion, C. Bon-
pland, had nearly fallen a victim to his zeal and devotion
for the sciences.    After our return, he was attacked by a
violent fever, accompanied with a dangerous vomiting j
which, however, was speedily cured.
    The river of the Amazons has been inhabited for 200
years by Europeans ; but on the Orenoquo and the Rio-
Nigro, it was only about thirty years ago that the Europeans
ventured to form a few settlements beyond the cataracts.
Those which exist do not comprehend above 1800 Indians,
from the eighth degree to the equator ; and there are no other
whites than fix or seven missionary monks, who did every
thing they could to facilitate our journey.
    From St. Thomas, the capital of Guyana, lat 8° ft1 24.",
long. 40 25' 2", we crossed once more the great desert called
Elanos, inhabited by wild cattle and horses.      I am now em
ployed in constructing a map of the country through which
I have travelled. I have been so fortunate as to make astro
nomical observations in fifty-four places.    I observed at Ca-
raccas, Cumana, and Tuy, twelve eclipses of the satellites of
Jupiter; an eclipse of the sun on the 28th of October 1799.
By these means, and the chronometer, I flatter myself I shall
be able to give a. very exact map.     We sliall embark here at
length for the Havannah, from which we shall proceed to
Mexico. — Such is the summary of my travels. I know that
you, Chaptal, Vauquelin, Guyton, are all interested in my
fate ; and for that reason I am not afraid of tiring you.
   We have scarcely any communication here with Europe.
I have often attempted to write to you, as well as to our
friends Vauquelin and Chaptal.       I have sent you some ex
periments on air, and the cause of miasmata. I have sent
to Delambre and Lalande, extracts from my small astrono
mical observations.     Have any of these reached the place of
their destination? By the consul of the republic at Saint
Thomas I transmitted to you the milk of a tree which the
Indians call the cow, because they drink this milky juice,
                               A3                         which

6                         Lei ter from C. Humboldt
which is not at all prejudicial, but exceedingly nourishing.
By the help of the nitric acid I have made caoutchouc*
and I mixed soda with that destined tor you, according to
the principles which you yourself fixed.
    In the month of January last we sent, by the corvette Phi-
lippina, a collection of seeds for the J..rdins des Plantes at
Paris.    We know they have arrived, and must have been
delivered to citizen; Justicu and Thouin by the ambassador of
the republic at Madrid.         By the flag of truce, which we ex
pect   here  from  Guadaloupe,      the musœum will receive other
articles; for at present we must be satisfied with presenting
you a sew objects for your chemical analysis.
    I have procured for you the curare, or celebrated poison of
the Indians on the Rio-Nigro.             I undertook a journey to
Enneralda on purpose to see trre liane, which produces this
juice, but unfortunately we found it without flowers; and
to fee the method practised by the Catarapeni and Maquiri-
tares Indians for making this poison. I sliall give you, some
other time, a more ample description of it.          I shall only add,
 that I send you the curare in a box of tin plate *, and the
branches of the plant maracury, which produces the poison.
This liane grows, but not in great abundance, among the
granitic mountains of Guandia and Yumariquin, under the
made of the theobromacacao and the caryocar.             The Indians
 take off the epidermis and make an infusion of it cold, having
first expressed the juice; they then leave the water over the
 epidermis half expressed, and afterwards filter the infusion. The
filtered liquor is yellowish : it is then baked, and concentrated
 by evaporation and inspissation to the consistence of molasses.
 This matter contains already the poison, but not being suffi
 ciently thick to daub over the points of their arrows, they
 mix it with the glutinous juice of another tree, which they
 call kiracaguero. This mixture is again baked till the whole
 is reduced to a brownifli mass.         You know that the curare
 is taken internally as a stomachic : it is not noxious but
 when it comes into contact with the blood, which it deoxydates.
 It is only a few days ago that I began to make experiments
 upon      it,
            and    have found that
                     I                      decomposes atmospheric
                                               it
 air.    I beg  you will   try  to  de-oxydate   with    the metallic
                                                               it
 oxyds,   ana  that you   will  examine   whether    the experiments
 of Fontana were properly made.
    I add to the curare and the maracury, the dapitebe, the
 leebe de pindare, and the earth of the Otomaquas.            The da
pitebe     isstate
                a  of  the  elastic gum,   which,      no   is,
                                                           doubt,  un-
     *   This    box, and the other articles announced here, have not yet reached
C.   Fourcroy.
                                                                        known

                                      to    C. Fourctoy.                                              7
known to you. We discovered it in a place where there is
no hevea, in the marshes of the mountain of Ja vita, lat. a° 5',
which are famous on account of the terrible serpents, of the
boa kind, found in them.
   Among the Pormisano and Paragini Indians we saw mu
sical instruments made of the caoutchouc, and the inha
bitants tolc! us they found it in the earth. The dapitcbe or
%apir is really a spongy white mass found under the roots of
two trees, which appeared to us of a new genus, the jacio and
the curvana, and of which we shall one day give a description.
The juice of these trees is a very aqueous milk, but it appears
that it is a malady in these trees to lose the juice by the roots.
This  discharge causes the tree to perish, and the milk coagu
lates in the moist earth, where it is preserved from the con
tact of the air.   I send you the dapitcbe itself, and a mass of
caoutchouc made from          merely       it,
                                          exposing              by
                                                        to heat or                 it
dissolving    over  the
                    it  sire. This production,    and the  milk of
the coiv, in your hands, will serve to throw new light on this
substance, so curious in  physiological point of view.

                             Fermentation.
  VV HEN          the grapes have acquired the proper degree of
maturity, if the atmosphere        be not too cold, and if the vintage
be of the proper volume, fermentation has no need of aid or
assistance.     But these conditions, without which it is impos
sible to have a good result, are not always united, and it be
longs to art, in order to obtain a good fermentation, to com
bine all these favourable circumstances, and to remove every
thing prejudicial.
   The faults of fermentation arise naturally from the quality
of the grapes, which is the subject of it ; and from the tem
perature of the air, which may be considered as a very pow
erful auxiliary.
    Grapes may not contain a sufficiency of sugar to produce a
sufficient formation of alcohol : and this vice may be owing
to the grapes not having attained to maturity, or to the sugar
being diluted in too considerable a quantity of water; or be
cause sugar, by the nature of the climate, cannot suffi
ciently develop itself.       In all cases there are two ways of
 correcting the vice which exists in the nature of the grapes ;
 the first consists in conveying into the must that principle
 which it wants : a proper addition of sugar presents to fer
mentation the materials necessary for the formation of al
 cohol, and the deficiency of nature is supplied by art. The
 antients, it appears, were acquainted with this process, since
 they mixed honey with the must which they caused to fer
 ment.     At present, direct experiments have been made on
 this subject ; but I shall confine myself to transcribe here the
 results of those made by Macquer.
    " In the month of October 1776 I. procured from a garden
 at Paris a quantity of the white grapes called pineau and
 metier sufficient to make from twenty-five to thirty quarts of
 wine.     They were waste grapes, and taken, purposely, in a
 bad state of maturity, that there might be no hopes of
 making potable wine from them : in nearly about a half of
 them, single grapes and even whole clusters were so green
 that their acidity was insupportable.            Without taking any
 other precaution than to separate what were putrid, I caused
 the rest to be bruised with the stalks, and the juice to be
                                                              expressed

 expressed with       the hand : the must which issued from them
  was exceedingly turbid, of a dirty-green colour and of a
   sweetish four taste, in which the acid predominated so much
  that it caused those who tasted it to make wry faces.            I dis
  solved in this must a sufficient quantity of brown sugar lo
             the taste of pretty good sweet wine; and, without
     five

     " On the 6th of November 1777 caused to be collected,
                                             I
                                                           I
from the top of an arbour in               garden at Paris,
                                                      a         kind of      a
large grapes which never ripen properly in this climate, and
which we know only under the name of verjvs, because they
are used for no other purpose than to express the juice before
it  becomes spoiled, that        may be employed as
                                        it                 kind of four  a
seasoning in cookery.         Those here alluded to had scarcely
begun to rot though the season was far advanced, and they
had been abandoned on the arbour as leaving no hope of
their acquiring sufficient maturity to be sit for the table. They
were still      hard that resolved to make them burst over the
                   so               I
                                                                     fire

                  and  the Method of making Wines.              1 i
fife in order to extract the juice : the quantity they furnished
was about eight or nine quarts. This juice had a very acid
taste, in which there could scarcely be distinguished a very
flight saccharine savour.       I dissolved some of the commonest
cassonade until it appeared to me to be very saccharine.           I
required a great deal more than for the wine of the preceding
experiment, because the acidity of the latter must was much
stronger.      After the sugar was dissolved, the taste of the
 liquor, though very saccharine, had nothing agreeable, be
cause the sweet and the sour were perceived pretty strongly
 and separately in a disagreeable manner.
      " I put this kind of must into a jar so as not to be entirely
 full, and covered it only with a cloth : as the season was al
 ready very cold, I placed it in an apartment where the heat
 was always maintained at 13 or 13 degrees (59 to 61 F.) by
 means     of a stove.
      "  Four days after   the fermentation was not yet very sensi
  ble, the liquor appeared to me to be as saccharine and as
  acid ; but these two tastes beginning to be better combined,
  the result was a whole more agreeable to the taste.
      " On the 14th of November the fermentation was in full
  force : a lighted taper introduced into the empty part of the
 jar, was speedily extinguished.
      " On the 30th the sensible fermentation had entirely
  ceased, and the taper was no longer extinguished in the in
  terior of the jar. The wine which resulted from it was, how
  ever, very turbid and whitish ; its taste had scarcely any thing
  saccharine; it was strong, pungent, and pretty agreeable, like
  that of generous warm wine, but a little gaseous and green.
      " I closed the jar and put it into a cool place, mat the
  wine might bring itself to perfection by insensible fermenta
   tion during the whole winter.
      " Having examined this wine on the 17th of March 1778,
   I found that it was almost entirely clear, the remains of its
   saccharine    as well as its acid taste had disappeared.     The
   latter was that of pretty strong wine made from pure gTapes :
   it was not unpleasant, but had no perfume or bouquet, because
   the grapes, which we call verjus, contain no odorous principle
   or aroma : these excepted, this wine, which was quite new,
   and which still had to gain by that fermentation which I call
   insensible, promised to become racy and agreeable."
       These experiments seem to me to prove, beyond all doubt,
    that the best method of remedying the want of maturity in
    grapes is to follow the process indicated by nature ; that is
   to fay, to introduce into the must that quantity of saccharine
    principle necessary which it could not give them.      This me
                                                                thod

Ia                       On the Cultivation            of the Vine,
thod is the more practicable, as not only sugar, but also
honey, molafl'es, and every other saccharine matter of an
inferior price can produce the same effect, provided they have
no disagreeable accessary taste which cannot be destroyed by
good fermentation.
  "Bullion caused the juice of grapes, taken from his park at
Bellegames, to ferment by adding from 15 to 20 pounds of
sugar per muid*.       The wine they produced was of a good
quality.
   Rozier, long ago, proposed to facilitate the fermentation of
must, and ameliorate wines by the addition of honey, in the
proportion of a pound to two hundred of must. All these
processes depend on the fame principle, viz. that no alcohol
is produced where there is no sugar ; and that the formation
of alcohol, and consequently the generous nature of wine, is
constantly proportioned to the quantity of sugar existing in
the must : it is thence evident that wine may be carried to
any degree of ipirituosity required, whatever may be the                               pri
mitive quality of the must,         adding toby   more or less sugar.
                                                               it
   Rozier has proved, and the fame result may be obtained
 by calculating the experiments of Bullion, that the value of
the produce of the feementation              very far superior to the
                                                       so is
        of the matters employed             that these processes may
                                                   ;
    presented as objects of œconomy and matter of specula
Erice
 e
tion.
     It    possible also to correct the quality of the grapes by
          is
other means, which are daily practised.            A portion of the
must      boiled in
          is           kettle         concentrated to one-half, and
                                         it   is
                          a a
                                     ;
then poured into       vat      :    by
                                  this method the aqueous portion
is in part dissipated, and the portion of sugar being then less
diluted, the fermentation proceeds with more regularity, and
the produce        more generous. This process, almost always
                    is
useful in the north, cannot be employed               the south, butin
when the season has been rainy or when the grapes have not
been sufficiently ripe.
   The same end may be attained                        by
                                            drying the grapes      the            in
fun, or exposing them for the fame purpose               stoves, as      in             is
practised      some wine countries.

it  becomes clear, loses its disagreeable thickness, and only
exhibits good qualities. The greater part of the white Spanish
wines are in this situation. This quality of wine has how
ever its partisans, and there are some countries where the
must is concentrated for that purpose, in others the grapes are
dried in the fun or in stoves till they are reduced almost to
the consistence of an extract.
     It would be easy in all cases to excite fermentation, either
by diluting the must, when too thick, with water, or by agi
tating the vintage in proportion as it ferments : but all this
must be subordinate to the end proposed to be obtained, and
the intelligent agriculturist will vary his processes according
to the effect which he intends to produce.
     It must never be forgotten, that the fermentation ought to
be managed according to the nature of the grapes and agreeably
to the quality of the wine that may be required.       Burgundy
grapes cannot be treated like those of Languedoc. The merit
 of the one consists in a peculiar flavour, which would be dissi
 pated by a strong and lengthened fermentation : that of the
 other in the great quantity of alcohol which may be developed
 in them ; and here the fermentation in the vat must be long
 and complete.      In Champagne, the grapes destined for the
 white brisk wines are collected in the morning before the
 fun has caused all the moisture to evaporate ; and in the same
 country the grapes destined for making red wine are not cut
 until they have been well dried by the rays of the fun. In
 one place artificial heat is necessary to excite fermentation,
 in another the nature of the must is such that the fermenta
 tion would require to be moderated. Weak wines must be
 fermented in casks, strong wines ought to be suffered to work
 in the vat.     Every country has processes prescribed to it by
 the nature of its grapes, and it is highly ridiculous to attempt
 submitting every thing to a general rule. It is of importance
 to be wellacquainted with the nature of the grapes employed
 and with the principles of fermentation : by the help of this
 kuowledge a system of conduct may be formed which cannot
 fail of being highly advantageous, because it is founded not
 on hypothesis but on the nature of things.
     In cold countries, where the grapes are very aqueous and
 little saccharine, they ferment with difficulty : fermentation
 in that case may be excited by two or three principal means:
      1st, By the help of a funnel of tin plate with a very wide
 tube, which descends to within four inches of the bottom of
 the vat, and through which boiling must is introduced into
 it. Two pailfuls may be used for 300 bottles of must. This
 process, proposed by Maupin, has produced good effects.
             9                                             ad, By

     14              On the Cultivation of the Vine,
        2d, By shaking the vintage from time to time : this motion
    is attended with this advantage, that it renews the fermenta
    tion when it has ceased or become weak, and causes it to be
    uniform throughout the mass.
       3d, By laying a covering not only over the vintage, but
    round about the vat.
       4th, By heating the atmosphere of the place in which the
   vat stands.
       It often happens that the working of the vintage slackens,
   or that the heat is unequal through the mass : it is to obviate
   these inconveniences, especially in cold countries, where they
   are more frequent, that the vintage is from time to time trod
   upon.      Gentil made two vatfuls, of eighteen butts each,
   and with grapes from the fame vines, and collected at the
   fame time : the grapes were freed from the skins, stalks, &c.
   and bruised ; the juice of both was perfectly equal in quality,
   and the vintage was put into vats ot equal size : the weather,
   but particularly in the morning and at night, was exceed
  ingly cold.
      At the end of some days the fermentation began : it was
  observed that the centre of the vats was exceedingly warm
  and the edges very cold ; the vats were so close as to touch
  each other, and both experienced the fame temperature.
  They were pressed down with a long pole. The cold vintage
  was pushed from the edges towards the centre where the heat
  was strongest : it was pressed down several times, and by
  these means an equal heat was maintained throughout the
 whole mass.       The fermentation in the vat where this process
  had been followed was finished twelve or fifteen hours sooner
 than in the other.      The wine was far better, it was mor$
 delicate, had a superior taste, and was more highly coloured
 and more generous.        No one would have said that it was
 produced from the fame grapes.
      The antients mixed aromatic substances wi:h the vintage
 in a state of fermentation, in order to give their wines pecu
 liar qualities. We are told by Pliny that it was usual in
 Italy to sprinkle pitch and resin over the vintage ut odor vino
 contingeret et saporis acumen.    In all the works of that period
 we find numerous recipes for perfuming wines; but these
different processes are no longer used.        I am, however, in
clined to think that they were of great benefit. This very
important part of oinology deserves the particular attention
of the agriculturist. When we consider the custom followed
in some countries of perfuming the wines with raspberries,
the dried flowers of the vine, &c. we may even presage the
happiest effects from it.

     Darcet has communicated to me the following facts, which
I    take the earliest opportunity of publishing here, as they
may give rife to experiments proper for improving the art of
vinification.
     " I   took,"  fays he,
                            "  a calk called half a muid, which
I   filled with the juice of untrod grapes, and such as had run
of itself from the grapes as carried from the vineyard to the
press : it therefore had very little colour.
      " This calk contained about 150 quarts. I took about
thirty quarts, which I evaporated and concentrated to nearly
about one-eighth of the volume of the liquor ; four pounds
of common sugar were added, and a pound of grapes dt
careme, after care had been taken to bruise therm : the whole,
somewhat warm, was then put into the cask, which was filled
up with the fame must that had been kept apart. A bunch,
of about half an ounce, of absinthium, dried and well pre
served, was then put into the cask, and the cask was slightly
covered, with its lid inverted : fermentation soon took place,
and proceeded in a brisk and free manner.
      "  Besides this piece of must,    I  caused to ferment also a
jar of the same containing about twenty-five or thirty quarts,
with half an ounce of sugar per quart: this wine fermented
very well in this jar, and it served me for filling up during
 the fermentation and after the first drawing off, which was
 performed at the usual time, and repeated a year after : it
was afterwards put into bottles at the expiration of a year, or
 in the following winter.
      "  This wine was made in September 1788, during fine
weather, and in a very good year.
      " It kept very well even in the bottle, it neither became
 four nor turbid at the end of several days ; I have still two or
 three bottles of it : it begins to fade."
                    IV. Etbiology  of Fermentation.
      The phænomena and results of fermentation are so highly
 interesting in the eyes of the chemist and the agriculturist,
 that, after having considered them merely under a practical
 point of view, we must now consider them under the relation
 of science.
      The two phænomena which        seem most worthy of attention
  from    the  chemist, are the disappearance of the saccharine
 principle and the formation of alcohol.
      As in fermentation there is no absorption of air, nor addi
 tion of any foreign matter, it is evident that all changes
                 8                                           which

   16                 On the Cultivation os the Vine,
   which take place in the operation can be referred only to tha
   departure of those substances which are volatilised or precipi
   tated.
      Thus, by studying    the nature of these substances, and as
  certaining    their  constituent principles, it will be easy for ua
   to judge of the changes which must have been produced in
   the nature of the first materials of fermentation.
      The materials of fermentation are the sweet and saccharine
  principle diluted in water. This principle is formed of sugar
  and extractive matter.
      The substance volatilised is the carbonic acid gas, and that
  precipitated is a matter analogous to the ligneous fibre mixed
  with potash.
      The principal product of fermentation is alcohol.
      It is evident that the transition of the saccharine principle
  to alcohol cannot be conceived but by calculating the differ
  ence which must be produced in the saccharine principle by
  the departure of the principles that form carbonic acid gas
  which is volatilised, and the deposit which is precipitated.
     These principles are, in particular, the carbon and the
 oxygen : here, then, we find carbon and oxygen taken from
 the saccharine principle by the progress of fermentation ;
 but in proportion as the saccharine principle loses its oxygen
 and its carbon, the hydrogen, which forms the third con
 stituent principle, remaining the fame, the characters of the
 latter element must predominate, and the fermenting mass
 must attain to that point at which it will only present an
 inflammable fluid.
     In proportion as the alcohol is developed, the liquid changes
 its nature ; it no longer has the fame affinities, nor, conse
 quently, the same dissolving power.        The small quantity of
extractive principle which remains after having escaped de
 composition is precipitated with the carbonat of potash : the
liquor becomes clear, and the wine is made.
     Vinous fermentation, then, is nothing but the continued
departure of carbon and oxygen, which produces on one
                                                                      -
hand the carbonic acid, and on the other alcohol.           The ce
lebrated Lavoisier subjected to calculation all the phænomena
and results of vinous fermentation, comparing the products
of the decomposition with its elements. He assumed as the
basis of his calculations the data furnished to him by analysis
both in regard to the nature and the proportions of the con
stituent principles before and after the operation.        We fliall
here transcribe the results obtained by this great man.

   By reflecting on the results exhibited by these tables, we
may clearly fee what takes place in the vinous fermentation :
it is first observed that, of the 100 pounds of sugar employed,
4 lib. 1 oz. 4 dr. 3 gr. remained in the state of undecomposed
sugar; so that the quantity of sugar really subjected to opera
tion was only 95 lib. 140Z. 3 dr. 69 gr.; that is to fay, 61 lib.
6 oz. 45 gr. of oxygen, 7 lib. 10 oz. 6 dr. 6gr. of hydrogen,
and 36 lib. 13 oz. 5 dr. 19 gr. of carbon.         But by comparing
the quantities it will be found that they are sufficient to form
all the spirit of wine, all the carbonic acid, and all the acet
ous acid, produced by the fermentation.
   The effects of vinous fermentation are reduced, then, to
the separating into two portions the sugar, which is an oxyd ;
oxygenating the one al the expense ofthe other to form car
bonic acid ; deoxygenating the other in favour of the former
to produce a combustible substance, which is alcohol; so
that, if it were possible to .combine these two substances, the
alcohol and carbonic acid, sugar would he re-formed.. It
is to be observed also, that the hydrogen and carbon are not
in the state of oil in the alcohol ; they are combined with a
portion of oxygen, which renders them miscible with water:
the three principles, oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon, are here,
then, still in a kind of state of equilibrium ; and, indeed, by
making them pals through an ignited glass or porcelain tube,
they may be re-combined two and two, and water. and hy
drogen, carbonic acid and carbon, are again found.

III.   Luminous Appearance of Ocean- Water caused by Ani
    mals: in a Letter from Profejfor          Mitchill,       of New-
    York, to Professor Barton, of Philadelphia * .
OO     obvious an appearance as the phosphorescence of ocean-
water was ascribed to animals as long ago as the time of Pliny.
Some of these adhering to the rigging of vessels in windy and
stormy weather, and shining in the dark, seem to have caused
the appearances known formerly by the names of Castor and
Pollux. Much has been offered on this subject, both phy
sically and historically, you know, by Charles Frederic Adler,
in his Differtatio de Nocliluca Marina, which is well worthy
of perusal. He has given a magnified figure of a microscopic
worm, which, in the sea of China, makes the salt water lu
minous.      It is called by some French writers scolopendre
marine luifante, and bv Linne nereis nocliluca.           Some of the
sea-jellies and   sea-blubbers    have  also  been  long  known    to be
occasionally    luminous.    The    principal part    of these  are  me-
d usas, which, at a very early day, obtruded themselves on
the attention of naturalists. But, notwithstanding all this,
the philosophical world seems still to be a good deal undecided
as to the real cause of the phosphorescence of the ocean.               I
have therefore recorded the following facts, which fell under
my own eye, hoping they may not be without their use in
explaining the phænomenon.             Pennant, in his British Zoo
logy,   vol iv.  exprestes very  just ideas  on the subject.
    On the evening of Saturday, the 13th of September 1800,
about high water, as we were preparing, between seven and
eight o'clock, to bathe in the bay, my attention was called
to a remarkable luminous appearance at the water's edge on
the beach. The wind was from the southward, and the day
had been so warm, that about two P. M. the quicksilver in a
thermometer hanging in a shaded piazza, on the south fide
of the house, had risen to 89 degrees. At this moment it
stood as high as 76.        The distance from the chamber win
dows to high water mark is 210 feet.             It seemed as if the
beach was covered with coals of fire, and that bright sparkles
were constantly emitted among them.                The small undula
tion whish moved to land looked like a wave of flame rolling
 alcwig the shore; and the water beyond, to the distance of a
few rods, exhibited frequent corrnscations of extraordinary
brightness. On going down to the water, 1 found the sand
covered with mofiusca animals, the greater part of which
were the meduja simplex. Thousands of them had just been

 left bv the receding tide, and were yet alive. Being inca; a-
 ble of living long out of the water, and unable to survive until
 the next flood, they seemed to be under the influence of
 their last vital movements.      They lay so thick under foot, that
 at every tread many of them were crushed to pieces. Besides
 their spontaneous power to become luminous, whenever they
 were moved they emitted light; and this happened indiffer
 ently, whether their gelatinous bodies were agitated through
 the medium of air, water, or the direct contact of the feet or
 fingers.     On walking among them, and thereby exciting
 their luminous action, the beach resembled melted metal in '
 a red-hot state; or the phænomenon might be compared to
 a radiant glory surrounding the feet, to the distance of a foot
 and a hair, or more, at every tread.      In several instances, the
light    emitted  by  a single   one, when  taken, in its fresh and
vivid state, into my hand, was sufficient to enable me to de
 termine the time of night by my watch, the minute and hour
 hands being plainly to be seen : but this brightness was but
transient.     Frequently the creature emitted not a particle of
 light ;  and   then, on a sudden, the luminous appearance
would be conspicuous, and as quickly disappear.              The suc
cession of these lucid emanations, from the creatures lying in
such numbers upon the wet sand, resembled, if small things
may be compared with great, the unsteady light of the fixed
 stars; and, indeed, the twinkling of these phosphorescent ani
 mals below, and of the celestial bodies above, afforded a spec
tacle so singular and so splendid, that I spent good part of the
evening in admiring it.        I remarked, also, that the .sand on
which these animals were left by the tide was luminous ; and
found, on crushing them to pieces in my hand, that a faint
phosphorescence      was imparted both to the sand and to my
skin : but in neither case did it last long.
    But what was as singular as any part of the phænomenon,
was the effect produced by them upon our bodies and clothes
while we were bathing.         Whenever the water near one of
them was agitated, a large fire-ball seemed to burst upon the
view beneath the water; and whenever this happened in con
tact with one of the limbs, caused some of us instantaneously
almost to start, for fear of being burned.       Where any of the
slimy matter was left, somewhat of a luminous appearance
was perceptible on our clothes, giving them and our skins
sometimes the appearance of phosphoric spots, and sometimes
the more extraordinary semblance of being painted over with
liquid sire. There were more than one species of animal;
for besides those which, by their magnitude, were very plain
subjects for examination, there were some luminous (pots as

small as points, and as minute as the eye could discern.
These adhered to our clothes and skins, and, when taken up
with the water in vessels of glass, were too small or too pel
lucid to be distinguished          by the naked eye, though they con
tributed eminently towards the effect of this submarine illu
mination.        This,      presume, was the nereit notliluca, an
intestinal animal.     I I   succeeded in discovering another spe
cies, which was      a   slender worm of about                 quarter of an
                                                                      a
inch long, and emitted, at times, bright light of greenish
                                                     a                      a
hue. This was probably             a  larger species of nereis.
    Not being well acquainted with the nature of those mol-
lusca-beings,   I    apprehended some inconvenience from such                           a
mass of animal matter left on the shore to putrefy                          so

house.     But my cause of alarm vanished before the next riling
sun: for, during the recess of the tide, they all perished;
though, instead of remaining                great mass of dead gelatinous

 alive near midnight, had               so
                                         totally disappeared before four
 o'clock, that no other trace of their having been there could
 be discerned,      than some phosphorescence                         in
                                                                the sand, on

 had lost their organisation, and,                   in
                                                    short so  time, dissolved
                                                                     a
 into   a kind of slime, which penetrated the sand, and was
 mingled with the water of the next flood. On examining
 the spots at fix o'clock next morning, before the beach was
 covered bv the tide, not          a vest ice of one of this numerous
shoal of   animals     was  discoverable              by
                                                   day-light.     A spectator
 of the morning scene could not have known,                                by
                                                                    any thing
 discernible, that such        a brilliant exhibition had been made
there the preceding evening, or that (ingle animal had been
                                                          a
 cast ashore on the Ipot.
    I  put several of the larger species of these creatures into
 glasses of their native salt water, and carried them into my
 chamber.       During the night             Imade repeated observations
 upon   them,   and   found   that   the   light  they afforded was neither
 perpetual    nor  extended     to their     whole   bodies.       was inter
                                                                           It
 mitting,    and   confined    to   certain    lines  palling   from  one ex
 tremity   of  the  creature   to  another.      The  light  was  of   blueish  a
 Colour, and the streams of             itwere highly beautiful.        These
 animals lived all night in the water, and were as lively as ever
 in the morning.         They were almost transparent, and nearly
 of the colour of the fluid in which they were suspended yet,                       ;
•on placing them in        a good light, they were found sufncientlT
 0,ianuc  to  be  distinctly   examined. Their figure was globose,
 or rather elliptical, shaped like            walnut,

          Animalcular  Phosphorescence of Ocean Water,        IX
about an inch and a half in length, and the least as small as
the eye could discern.     Their structure was too delicate to
allow them to be examined in any other manner than in their
floating state. They were about of the fame weight with sea
water. At their option they could readily ascend and descend
in it. And a* they have no air-vessels like sillies, they ac
complished their rife and fall by a mere change of their spe
cific gravity; contracting themselves into a smaller volume if
they wished to sink, and expanding themselves to a wider bulk
if they intended to swim. Before ten o'clock next morning
several of them were evidently dying, and before forty-eight
hours had elapsed all of them were dead, and so entirely dis
organised    that not a film or membrane was left; but the
water, which was a little turbid, had a small mud-like sedi
ment, and smelled strong of phosphorated hydrogenous gas.
    The nearness of their approach to pellucidity displayed their
internal structure to the eye without the trouble of anato
mising.     They might be looked through without the aid of
 a diflecting instrument ; and their blood, though not red,
 but nearly of the pale colour of their bodies, reflected light
 enough in the day-time to enable it to be seen in motion,
 briskly circulating through the arterious and venous tubes*
 This view of the circulation of the blood through the whole
 ceconomy of a healthy animal, was one of the most interesting
 appearances    in animated physiology that I ever had beheld.
 This creature, like the echinus, and many more, had no
 heart, but the vessels were endowed with muscular power
 enough to propel their fluids without the aid of such an organ.
 The pulsations of the arteries could be easily counted, and
 the little waves of the circulating fluid distinguished as they
 passed from the larger extremity, where the motion was most
 evident, to the smaller, where it was more evanescent, and
 terminated in corresponding veins. In these animals the cir
 culation not only proceeds, as in other creatures, one while
 (wiflly, and at another slowly, but, at times, is totally inter
 mitted or suspended, and this, seemingly, ad arbilrium.
 Eight large arteries received the pale blood from a common
 trunk, and conveyed it from one extremity toward the other.
 They were about equi-distant, and gave the animal a some
 what striped appearance, such as a slight intermixture of ar
 senic imparts to glass.   The termination of these arteries in
 continuous    veins  was  very plain to be seen, until theii
 ramifications upon the parts which appeared to be nutritive
 viscera became too minute for fight, after which the invisible
 tubes seemed to connect their branches into a common canal,

or vena cava, whence the eight arteries before mentioned
derived their supply.
     Such being the manner in which their juices circulated,
it could now be understood in what part the luminous exhi
bition was made.           I was soon satisfied it was in the arteries,
and not in the veins; and the diaphanous consistence of the
animal permitted this light to be seen through its substance
as plain as through crystal.            The blood, after entering the
arteries, and during its subjection to their action, became
luminous, and pasted through like streams of ignited metal or
electric emanations.          And this vascular illumination, vari
ously refracted in pasting through the pellucid substance of
 the creature, through the water in which it floated, and
 through the atmosphere to the eve, made the whole body,
 when seen at a distance, appear luminous.            These streams of
 light, however, were not constant. They not only intermitted
 when the circulation of the blood was intermitted, and the
 action of the vessels stopped ; but very commonly, while the
 fluids were pasting through their tubes with the utmost ra
 pidity, there would be no phosphorescence               at all : then,
 again, one or more, and sometimes all the arteries, would
 suddenly exhibit the lucid phænomenon, and the creature
 and the surrounding water flash with light.            This luminous
 evolution was not confined to the nocturnal existence of the
 animal ; for, on attentively examining their functions by
 day, when the light was too faint to be seen, it could be
 easily distinguished, by the colour of the fluid in the vessels,
 that the fame action was going on. It appeared of a blueish,
  or somewhat iridescent hue, along the course of the arteries,
 though its feebler light, like that of a taper, was lost amid
 the splendour of the solar ravs.         The same process, however,
 is going on during the dav-time, in these creatures, though
 unobserved, that we hehofd in the dark.
     One of these medusas may be compared to a glass lanthora,
  freelv permitting the light produced within it to diffuse itself
  <U+2666>o the surrounding
                             spaces, while an external observer can
 thereby discern what is going on in the inside.           I am so en
  tirely  satisfied  of   the  connection   between this   evolution  of
  light  and    the   circulation  of arterious blood,  that I  want no
  clearer evidence to that point. It is probable that in an ani
  mal which is entirely destitute of lungs as well as of heart,
  the pulmonary function may be performed bv the vital vessels
  themselves.       In these creatures I believe this to be the fact.
     The light, then, which these marine animals exhibit, may
  be concluded to be produced by a function in them analogous
                                                                      to

lo the respiration of animals which are of larger size and
more complicated structure.    The only reason why it is visi
ble from their bodies      is,
                         that the gelatinous matter of which
they consist   is  transparent.         It   not improbable the fame
                                             is

terials of which we consist did not hinder the light within us
from shining    so as to be seen.
    The remarks hitherto made chiefly refer to the larger spe
cies of light-emitting creatures.          The fame apply, as far as
I  can judge, to all the smaller species.         A veflTel of the water,
containing no visible animalcula, was carried, the fame
evening, to my chamber.           When agitated from without,                   it
sparkled ;   and if  stirred      the finger within, the number of
                                 by
mining spots increased.         When left to rest, lucid points were,
frequently to be seen arranging themselves at the surface of
the water, where      it touched the inside of the glass.        Some of
this water, that was poured upon the table, appeared full of
shining points, like sparks of fire.        There was not        doubt in
                                                                      a
my mind, that these phænomena, like the others, were ani-
malcular; yet, on viewing the water in the morning,                   was  it
as transparent as sea water usually               is,
                                                and not      single crea
                                                                  a
ture was to be discerned in it.          The presumption, therefore,
is,  that this form of marine light         also owing to animalcules,
                                             is
though too small to be discerned                by

tical glasses. I   am somewhat doubtful whether the transpa
rency of these minute light-emitting creatures would allow
them to be distinguished     if   I had had       microscope with me.

luminous appearance of ocean water in other cafes, wherein
no flash or sparkle was distinctly to be seen, or traced to an
individual point, but an indistinct glow alone appeared, as
around the blades of ores, or near the bows and rudders of
vessels in  motion, that the phænomenon was, in like man
ner, referable to animalcular action.            And     terminated my

speculation   by  concluding, that the light emitted from mil
lions of these viewless aquatic animals concurred to produce
the general luminous appearance of the ocean in which they
float, by  the fame rule that innumerable clusters of fixed stars,
as modern astronomers teach us, produce the luminous spots
or milky hue of those portions of the heavens where Omni
potence has placed them.
vI     have said nothing about the manner in which the light
is  evolved in these animals.        If     it     the decomposition of
                                                  is    by

farmer than     the fluid in which they swim.   Still it is not
to be denied, that in the decomposition of that triple fluid
there may be au evolution of caloric sufficient for the ceco-
nomy of creatures lo (mall, and of a structure so nice and
exquisite as these, and yet not be measurable by our ther
mometers ; and that oxygen may mingle with their fluids io
due quantity.    And it may be easily conceived, that during
the process light may be evolved, sufficient, in rapidity and
quantity Within them, to occasion, by transmission through
their pellucid forms, the phænomena of these and all other
luminous oceanic meteors.
    The animalcular origin of this phænomena is corroborated
by this additional consideration.       At the time when the salt
water is remarkably luminous in some places, there is very
little of it to be seen in others, though but a few rods distant.
At such times, I found that by taking up parcels of the water,
and viewing     it,there were abundance of lucid points in those
which were most luminous, and but few            those which were
                                                  in
feebly so.     The light proceeding from these invisible inte/ii-
nas, when nearly and narrowly examined, radiutes from num
berless shining particles or centres; and, when viewed from             a
distance too remote to permit these lucid centres to be seen,

by   reason of something chemically dissolved in it.
    The same creatures are not capable of emitting light for            a
song continuance of time.        If Aiaken, touched, or agitated,
their luminous faculty soon becomes exhausted, and the water
in which they float immediately returns to its ordinary co
lour.    This   is     much the cale, that

     An opinion has been entertained, that, during the mining
 of the fun, its rays are absorbed by the ocean, and that the
extrication of them again makes its water luminous.                 It has
 been conjedtured, too, that the water of the ocean becomes
 occasionally so highly electrical, that the brightness it mani
 fests is but the evidence of a high charge of electricity. Ther$
 has been published, too, an idea that the phosphoric matter
 extricated    from putrefying fish in the ocean, was the cause
 of this marine resplendence.              And others have even been in

 saline particles against each other, or some unknown combi

      On the Combination      of Alumine with   the Carbonic   Acid.
  I-  v/NE       cannot help being astonished that, though most
 os the combinations of alumine with the acids are known,
 we have still but imperfect notions respecting the union of
 this earth with a substance so widely diffuses] as the carbonic
 acid.      When desirous of repeating the experiments of
 M. Humboldt on the absorption of oxygen gas by simple
 earths, I was induced to consider alumine in its different
 states, and particularly in that in which most chemists con
 sider it as a carbonat.         On this subject I have made some
 observations, which may serve to throw new light on this
 combination.
 Opinions    ofsome    Chemists refpetling the Carlonats   of Alumine.
     II. Bergman, in a dissertation on the aerian acid, fays*:
 "   Fixed air attacks pure argil with difficulty, that is to fay,
 the earth of alum dried and hardened ; the precipitation of
 a'um, however, by aerated alkali, proves that it may take up
 a small quantity when it is attenuated ; for though the liquor,
 when well filtered, appears limpid, it is remarked that, when
 left a few days to the open air, and a heat capable of pro
 moting the extrication of the fixed air, it becomes turbid, and
insensibly deposits a little earth, which was held in solution
 by the volatile fluid.       The argil of Cologne itself gives, in a
 strong   heat,  a quantity of fixed air which exceeds its volume
several times.        It is mixed with a little inflammable air,
which rises at the commencement of the operation."
     Bergman then gives the proportions of the carbonic acid
in artificial carbonat of alumine, and finds, that too parts of
aerian acid may unite with 30 of pure alumine.
     III. Fourcroy, in his Elements of Chemistry, and his
work entitled Syflime des Connoifsances Chimiques t, admits
also the combination of alumine with carbonic acid gas under
the denomination of carbonat: 1st, According to the expe
riments of Bergman ; 2d, According to his own.                 He ob
served that, if the precipitation of the sulphat of alumine by
an alkaline carbonat be made cold, little or no effervescence
is produced, because, in his opinion, a part of the carbonic

acid gas which is separated from the alkali joins the precipi
tated alumine and the other part the liquor, which then
holds in solution real carbonat of alumine, which may be
obtained by volatilising the acid gas.                  He then fays, that
natural aluminous earths are very frequently found combined
with carbonic acid, which may be separated by a stronger
acid.
    Gren announces *, that alumine has no affinity for car
bonic acid. This author enters into no detail on this subject,
and he seems to support his opinion on the effervescence pro
duced during the decomposition of the sulphat of alumine by
the alkaline carbonats.
    C. Hassenfratz has since that time given the specific gra
vities of alumine and the carbonat of alumine. Several other
authors have admitted, and still admit, aluminous carbonats,
both artificial and natural.
     IV. I shall now give the result of my researches on this
combination.         I dissolved sulphat of alumine, known under
the name of Roman alums, in water, and precipitated it from
the liquor cold by a saturated solution of the carbonat of pot
ash. Little or no effervescence was produced, as was observed
by Fourcroy (III). This effect, however, does not take place
but when the solution is diluted with a certain quantity of
water. The alumine obtained by this operation, after having
been washed several times while still moist, and dried at the
temperature of the atmosphere, was equal in weight to the
twenty-nine hundredths of the sulphat ot alumine employed :
it dissolved in nitric acid with a strong effervescence, and lost
about seven hundredths of its weight of carbonic acid gas.
The precipitation of the sulphat of alumine by the carbonat
of soda exhibited results nearly similar.                  I mall here add,
    * Manuel dc Chimie,
                            § 449 and 516.
    f  For these experiments 1 made choice of a sulphat of alumine which
contained but a very small quantity of the oxyd of iron, and I ascertained,
by comparative experiments on alumine, as pure as it possibly could be,
that this small dose of oxyd had no sensible influence on the results which
 I am about to give. The iron in the common sulphat os alumine is at its
minimum of oxydation.       None of it was precipitated by the alkaline prul-
siats till after the mixture had been exposed to the free air and the heat ;
and it may be easily proved that, if alumine extracted from alum was em
ployed in the repetition of Humboldt's experiments, it was by the presence
of the oxyd of iron that several chemists have been led into an error re
specting the absorption of the oxygen gas of the atmosphere by an earth
 supposed to be pure, and which was not so.            For alumine, purified by
repeated solutions in potash, never, when moistened, exercised any other
 action on the oxygen gas of the atmosphere in the experiments I made on
 this subject    Common alum, sufficiently pure for the alumine extracted
 from it to give the same results in its purifications, may be often found.
                                                                           that

 30                     Researches     on Alumine.
 that the quantity of the carbonic acid gas disengaged was
 not constant in the different operations, and that it appeared
 to me to vary in the ratio of the concentration of the alkaline
 carbonats, and in particular of the superabundant quantity
which I added of these carbonats to decompose the sulphats.
 The precipitates in all these cases were washed in such a
 manner as to avoid every error in this ratio.
    V. A hundred parts of the fame fulphat of alumine, pre
 cipitated by carbonat of ammonia in excess, furnished only
 23 parts of alumine dried at the temperature of the atmo
 sphere.     The earth dissolved in acids with a disengagement
 of carbonic acid gas, but it lost in aerian acid only one aud
 a half per cent, during the operation.
    Berthollet, in his ingenious researches on affinities, found
 that alumine precipitated by ammonia from potashed fulphat
 of alumine still retained potash and acid. To purify this
 earth, I dissolved it in muriatic acid, and precipitated it again
 by carbonat of ammonia.            The 23 parts of alumine were, by
 this purification, reduced to ai parts.              They lost then one
 and a half per cent, of carbonic acid gas by their solution in
 the acids.    They could not form octaedral crystals with sul
phuric acid; and the imponderable quantity of muriatic acid
 which they retained could not produce any sensible error. In
the following experiments I shall give the name of pure alu
mine to the earth obtained from alum subjected to this double
precipitation.
    I divided the pure alumine into two parts, one of which
was pulverised, and the other left in its natural state of aggre
gation. They were exposed to the open air for eighteen months
on a tablet in my laboratory, after which period the pulver
                                                  '
ised alumine produced no effervescence . The alumine which
had not been pulverised, aud which was placeJ in the fame
circumstances, produced a very sensible one. This pheno
menon inclined me to think that the effervescence of the alu
mine, which I believed to be in the state of carbonat, arose
from the carbonat of ammonia retained in the unpulverised
aliimine, and which had been volatilised in the other, all the
parts of which prevented free access to the external air.                 I,
indeed, found that potafli triturated with the effervescent alu
mine, disengaged it from ammonia, and did not produce the
fcme effect on the same earth when pulverised.
   * This fact is contrary to that announced by Fourcroy. (Svstcme des
Cor.m'rjpmris Cbimiques, tom.ii. p. 145.)  He fays alumine gradually takes
Up the carbonic acid gas of the atmosphere.     It would be of importance to
know the details of this observation, which, in my opinion, was never made
kut by the author here quoted.
                                                                      VI. I

     VI. I precipitated by liquid ammonia a solution of pure
 alumine, and obtained, after the precipitate had been dried,
 a quantity of spongy alumine, equal in weight to that which
 I had obtained from the same quantity of a solution of alu
 mine when, I decomposed it by carbonat of ammonia, and
 when I did not add an excess of precipitant.             A hundred
 parts of potastied sulphat of alumine, entirely decomposed, by
 ammonia or the carbonat of ammonia, furnished 21 parts of
 spongy alumine dried in a temperature of between 72 and 85
 degrees of Fahrenheit's thermometer.             These 21 parts were
 reduced to 9, by desiccation, in a violent fusing heat. A hun
 dred parts of the alum which I employed, contained, then,
 no more than about nine parts of pure dried alumine : a pro
 portion very different from that which some authors have
 ascribed to the composition of this salt.
     VII. I dissolved alumine to saturation in nitric acid diluted
 with water, and placed in this solution a rhomboidal crystal
 of carbonat of lime. A flow effervescence was produced,
  which even continued for several weeks.          The alumine depo
  sited by this operation produced no effervescence with acids.
  On this occasion it appeared to be doubtful whether calcareous
  earth alone be a medium proper for uniting alumine with
  carbonic acid ; and, if I thought there was reason to ascribe
.to this cause the great quantity of carbonic acid which I
  found in the dolomies, it was because I was deceived by the
  extraordinary quantity of alumine contained in some speci
  mens which I analysed.          Mr. Tennant had more reason to
  ascribe the properties of the dolomies to the triple combina
  tion of the carbonic acid with the calcareous earth and the
  magnesia, which the dolomies always contain in a large
  quantity, while the purest contain only an infinitely small
  quantity of alumine.         It appears that the dolomie is to the
   bitter-Jpatb   of the  Germans   what marble is to calcareous spar.
      I subjected to distillation alumine precipitated from its sul
  phat by carbonat of ammonia, and dried at the temperature
   of the atmosphere.        1 obtained from this operation, after a
  long    and   strong   incandescence,  only water, but no carbonic
   acid gas.
      VIII. I thought I should be able to explain the experiment
   of Fourcroy, which proves the pure and simple combination
   of alumine with carbonic acid, because it is not disengaged
   with effervescence during the decomposition of aluminous so
   lutions by alkaline carbonats, by ascribing its result, in part,
   to the triple and concrete formation ot an aluminous com
   bination of carbonic acid and alkali ; but I abandoned that
   opinion by observing that, when a solution osalumine is de
                                                             composed

  33                   Researches  en Alum'tnei
 composed     only in part by carbonat of soda and potash, an
 alumine is obtained, which makes no sensible effervescence
 with acids, though there was no effervescence during its pre
 cipitation.    I then thought that the water of the solution,
 which must be a little diluted to produce no effervescence,
 knight be alone sufficient to retain the carbonic acid.      But
 this quantity of water, compared with the volume of the car
 bonic acid which ought to result from the decomposition of
 the alkaline carbonat, could retain by its own affinity for the
 carbonic acid only a very small part of that which remained
 in the solution. May we not here suppose, agreeably to the
ideas of Berthollet respecting affinities, that the alumine pre
cipitated contributes by its mass, conjointly with the acidi-
 ferous solution and the alkali, to retain the carbonic acid ?
We (hall find hereafter that the carbonated water dissolves
alumine. But this solution, when filtered, seems also to aban
don its carbonic acid in the open air as easily as pure carbon
ated water.
    IX. I have already mentioned (II.) what Bergman states,
that when a solution of alumine is precipitated by alkaline
carbonats, there is formed in the liquor, when it has been
exposed several days to the free air and heat, an earthy de-
        arising from the expulsion of the carbonic acid which
Eofit,
   eld it in solution.   I repeated this experiment with all the
alkalies saturated with carbonic acid, but I never could ob
serve any precipitation posterior to that of the alumine by the
alkaline carbonat; and I think it probable that the result
Bergman obtained was because his alumine was not pure, or
because his alkalies, being imperfectly* saturated with car
bonic acid, had dissolved a small quantity of earth. Besides,
the precipitate I ought to have obtained would have been
a combination of alumine and alkaline carbonat.
    Being desirous to ascertain, by a more direct experiment
than the preceding, if carbonated water was capable of dis
solving alumine, I put into two-necked bottles pure alumine
recently precipitated by carbonat of ammonia, and still moist.
I diluted it with a great quantity of distilled water: I caused
to circulate for eight hours, into this mixture, a current of
carbonic acid gas.      This water, when filtered, was subjected
to ebullition : it immediately became turbid and deposited
alumine, which potash was able to dissolve.      The carbonated
water of alumine became turbid also on being mixed with
some drops of ammonia; and, at last, by the mere agitation
of the corked bottle, in which it was, when only half full.
    I collected two or three grains of the alumine, precipitated
from the carbonated water by means of its exposure to the air:
                                                               it

                     Researches    on Alumine.                      33
It produced no effervescence by dissolving in acids, even when
I  made the proof, before it was completely dried at the tem
perature of the atmosphere.        The case is the fame with the
alumine deposited at the bottom of bottles in which the car
bonic acid gas had circulated.
   X. Bergman, then, had reason to announce that alumine,
carbonic acid, and water, can enter into combination, though
the experiments     on which he founded his assertion do not
appear to me proper for proving it ; but he ought not to have
admitted, that alumine with carbonic acid formed a concrete
carbonate.
   On the other hand, Gren had some reason for saying that
alumine, precipitated from its solutions by alkaline carbonates,
did not present itself in the form of carbonate of alumine. But
he ought not to have inferred that alumine has no affinity
for carbonic acid, strice we have seen that carbonated water
dissolves that earth.    Under these two points of view, both
these chemists seem to have been deceived, though with op-i
posite sentiments,    as too ofteri happens      when a particular
truth is given out as a general truth.

   XI. Hitherto have examined only those aluminous car
bonates considered as the production of art.         It how remains'
for me to speak of those which are considered as natural:
I shall not examine whether the carbonic acid forms com
pound or ternary combinations with alumine and another
earth of a metallic oxide.      There is no need to fay, that be
cause these combinations exist3 we ought to conclude that the
carbonic acid forms with alumine a concrete carbonate.
Bergman infers that the latter compound exists in nature*
because the argil of Cologne, exposed to a strong heat, gave
him several times its volume of carbonic acid gas.           If we put
out of consideration the ternary or quaternary combinations
in which the argil of Cologne may be found, since it con
tains the half or the fourth of its weight of substances foreign
to alumine, the conclusion of Bergman would be just, if it
were certain that its earth contained no vegetable or animal
matter. But as the greater part of the argils found at the
surface of the earth contain some, and as they detonate (lightly
with nitre, little credit can be given to the observation of
Bergman ; especially as he adds, that the carbonic acid gas
he obtained was mixed with hvdrogen gas, which seems to
announce here the decomposition of some vegetable or ani

  There is another earth of the fame kind, but much freer from
   foreign principles.      It is denoted in moll authors under the
  name of the pure argil of Hales (re'ine thonesle de Werner),
   the place where it was found, in the garden of the college of
  Hales, and in the neighbourhood of an apothecary's shop ;
  its exterior form, its small quantity, and its purity, have made
  some authors suppose that it was a production of art.                 This
  may    be, but  it merits  no   less the attention   of  naturalists, since
  it has characters which alumine prepared artificially has not.
  M. Lenz fays, the pure argil is found in other places than at
  the college of Hales ; but he does not fay whether it be cry
  stallized like that which is here alluded to.
      M. Schreber, who analysed this substance, considers it as
  a combination of alumine with carbonic acid, water, and a
  little lime, silex, iron, inflammable matter, and, sometimes,
               I have not been able to procure the details of the

     By   a microscope of a magnifying      power equal to 200 or
 30,    it appeared, as Schreber has remarked, that it is com
 posed of small transparent prismatic crystals, compressed and
 terminated by blunted pyramids.         I was not able to discover
 this crystallization in alumine prepared artificially.
     At the first degrees of incandescence it loses about two-
 thirds of its weight. Alumine loses only fifty-eight hundredths.
     A decoction of it in water did not change test paper, but
 it became turbjd by the oxalate of potash and solution of ba-
 rytes.     This solution, evaporated to dryness in a gentle heat,
 left a residuum which was only the 0-022 part of the alumine
 employed. It was composed of sulphate of lime, and a yellow
 matter, susceptible of being carbonated by combination, and,
 similar to vegetable extract.
     A gramme (i5'44 grains) of the argil of Hales, dissolved
 cold, a hundredth part excepted, in nitric acid, without pro
 ducing any effervescence. None was produced when the solu
 tion was made at a heat equal to 6o°ofReautnur (i67°Fahr.).
 The sulphuric acid dissolved it also cold, almost entirely, and
 without effervescence.
     A solution of this earth by the nitric acid was hot rendered
 turbid by muriate of platina.
    The (ame solution was precipitated, cold, by carbonate of
 ammonia in excess. The liquor, when filtered, was exposed
 to ebullition, to try whether it contained glucina.         By this
 operation it became pretty turbid; the new substance was
 carefully collected, and weighed, when dried at the tempe
 rature of the atmosphere,      about seven-hundredths of the na
 tive argil : but I doubt whether it was glucina; for it pro
 duced no effervescence when dissolving in nitric acid, as glu
 cina would have done in the like cafe, according to the expe
 riments of Vauquelin.        A solution of it in nitric acid in ex
 cess was not precipitated by pruffiate of potash, oxalate of pot-
,ash, and sulphuric acid ; but it was by ammonia.         This pre
 cipitate was soluble in potasti; it was therefore not gadolinite.
 Was it a new substance, or alumine united to a base, which
         it the property of dissolving in carbonate of ammonia ?
   'hose who possess argil of Hales in sufficient quantity may be
 save
 ftble to determine this question.
     Potash was able to dissolve, an imponderable quantity of
 the oxide of iron excepted, the alumine precipi'ated from the
 nitric acid by the carbonate of ammonia in the preceding ope
 ration.     This alumine, separated from potash, crystallized itx
•octaedra with the alkaline addition requisite in such a case.
     The argil of Hales, projected into nitre in fusion, produced
 no detonation; it showed only in obscurity a very faint blue

trace, which undulated at the surface of the salt.                 But thisf
effect is doubtful : when projected on ignited iron, it retained
a   light   scarcely sensible.
     In   the last place,  I subjected to distillation, at a red heat,
in    a luted glass retort, one gramme and a half (23"i6 grains)
of    this substance.     I obtained some drops of a liquid trans
parent as water, and a quantity of air which did not exceed
the capacity of the vessels used sot distilling.             This air con
tained one or two hundredths of carbonic acid gas ; a quan
 tity inferior to what I expected to obtain by the decomposi
 tion of water and the inflammable matter contained in the
 clay.      The carbonic acid gas, naturally belonging to the air
 of the vessels anterior to the distillation, must be deducted
 from the estimation I have given.
      XIL I stiall recapitulate, in a few words, the principal
 results    of these observations   :
      ist, Alumine does not form with carbonic acid a concrete
 carbonate of alumine; or, at least, no one has been able to
 form that combination.
      2d, The substance, hitherto considered as artificial concrete
  carbonate of alumine, is the result of the union of alumine with
 alkali and carbonic acid. This acid docs not, probably, enter
 into this combination but by its affinity for the alkali.
      3d, Alumine does not seem to unite with carbonic acid
 but in the case when the latter is dissolved in water ; when
 this earth precipitates itself from this solution by the volati
 lization of the carbonic acid, it does not appear in the state
 of carbonate.
      4th, Native clays, considered by some authors as carbonates
  of alumine, did not appear to me to be in that state.
      5th, The native argil of Hales, precipitated from its solu
  tions in nitric acid by carbonate of ammonia in excess, leaves
  in solution in the latter salt, a substance or combination which
  deserves further examination.

 of those ridiculous  tales and absurd suppositions to be found
in antient authors, and which have been transmitted, from
age to age, till the period when mankind began to examine
with more accuracy, and to make better observations.
   By multiplying researches they have been rendered more
exact: at present there is no necessity for believing a fact
merely because it contains something of the marvellous, or
is mentioned by such or such an author.
    Is the horse without hair, which forms the subject of this
article, to be considered as a new variety in the species, or
are the characters by which this seems to be indicated a mere
accident, produced by disease, or the effect of art ? The proofs
I  have obtained, and the observations I have made on this
animal, incline me to believe that it is an individual of a
peculiar variety.    "Instead of contracting the limits of its
power," fays Buffon, speaking of nature, " we must enlarge
and extend them even to immensity; we must see nothing
impossible, we must suppose every thing, and believe that
every thing which can be really exists !" Though the num
ber, indeed, of the travellers who give themselves the trouble
to make observations is very inconsiderable, we however are
daily made acquainted with new facts, and we fee nature
extended in proportion as we give extension to our researches.
Ey comparing the countries, the productions of which are
known with those which have not yet been examined by na
turalists, it may be easily perceived that the field which re
mains for us to be passed over is of greater extent than that
passed over by our predecessors.    If the number of the sub
stances contained in the bowels of the earth, and that of the
beings which elude our researches at its surface, is prodigious,
may we not also believe that there exist substances and stings
more easily to be discovered, of which, however, we have as
yet no accounts ?
   I shall now relate the history of the horse without hair and
mane, such as I received it. — He was purchased, about ten
years ago, at Vienna, by a Frenchman named Alpi, formerly
employed in the menagerie of Versailles, by whom he was
exhibited in several towns of Germany with other animals,
and afterwards fold, for fifty louis, to the Veterinary School
at Berlin. This horse had been taken from the Turks during
the last war, and carried by an Austrian officer to Vienna.
Alpi exhibited him under the name of the Horse of the Nile,
and said he came from Africa.        Hq yoked him to a cart on
which he carried about his animals.       Four years ;^o he was
in the Veterinary College of Berlin.
   This horse appears to me to be about twenty years of age ;

he eats the fame food, and               in   the fame quantity, as common
horses  :    he   is
               meagre,              as he   always had been from the time
he was brought to the Veterinary School.    He    strong and            is
vigorous, trots somewhat hard on account os his age, and
because he has been employed in the draught.      Hu     ver)'
                                                                                 is
sensible to cold, and therefore during winter   always kept            is
exceedingly warm.      His head    small and well made, the
                                                  is
neck prelty,and     the chest open; his legs, on which he stands
¦well, are slender    but the rest of his body
                       ;                         not   beautiful, is        so
on account    ot his age and meagre state.
  He differs from other horses only in the want of hair, the
depression     of his forehead, and the noise he makes when
breathing.        I have carefully observed all the parts of his
body,    even   the  interior of the ears, and      have found only a
                                                              I
black   bristle,  about   three-tenths of an inch in length, on the
lower eye-lid of the left eye.        His skin       of    black colour
                                                                 is    a
inclining    to   gray,   with   some white   spots on the flanks and
groin.       It   plaited on the upper part of the chest,
                  is                                                 very        is
soft to  the  touch   on the whole body, and has            sliining and
                                                                       a
unctuous appearance.          What gives reason to believe that the
want of hair in this animal          neither the effect of art nor the
                                            is
result of disease          is,
                         that the (kin on the nose, around the nos
trils, and on the upper and lower lips, differs from that of
other horses, and has all the characters above indicated                              :   it
has almost all the appearances of that of the Turkisli dog.
A very distinguishing character the depreflion the middle
                                                  is                    in
of the forehead, measuring from the anterior angle of the
eyes and the angle of the mouth.              This depression, which
 contracts    the   aperture   formed      the     by
                                                nasal bone, occasions
 some embarrassment to the animal                       in
                                               breathing, and at each
 inspiration and expiration           makes it    noise which may be
                                                             a

                                       person a when    the nostrils are
 obstructed,      This noise increases when the animal has been
 runninc, or employed in hard labour. He has, however,
 strong lungs and good wind.

         Description   of a newly invented Galvanometer.          30,
had frequently occasion to make use of the gold-leas electro
meter invented by Mr. Bennet.
    I had often been wishing that some instrument could be
devised to measure the galvanic action of a plate of silver and
one of zinc, when connected with the tongue and upper lip;
and as some philosophers had all along maintained that the gal
vanic and electric fluid were the fame, the delicate sensibility
of the gold-leaf electrometer suggested the idea of accommo
dating it to the object I had in view, for which purpose I
adopted the following construction :
    Fig. 1. (Plate I.) represents the galvanometer complete,
the top or lid, to facilitate the description, being shown above
the glass cylinder instead of being inserted in its mouth, as it
is when the instrument is in use. The top consists of two
circular plates of brass fastened to each other, and attached
to a cork which fits into the cylinder.        The undermost plate
has an oblong hole cut though it (as has also the cork), and
from this hole a groove passes to the outer edge of the plate
to admit a thin slip of silver AA, and allow it to slide back
wards or forwards between the plates, for the purpose of
moving the gold leaves a, attached to the silver, nearer to or
further from the upright pieces B and C.            This part of the
construction is also mown in fig. 2. which represents the me
tallic part of the cover inverted, A A being the slip of silver.
One end of the silver, viz. that which descends into the cylin
der (fig. 1.), is slit, for the purpose of receiving the gold leaves.
   B B, CC, are two pieces of zinc, the uprignts of which can
be made to approach to or recede from each other by means
of a slide in the transverse pieces at the bottom of the jar, and
which is represented in fig. 3. The two pieces of zinc are
kept at the distance desired by means of the screw D, fig. I
and 3.
  The zinc BB, properly speaking, is of two pieces, attached
by a joint at E to facilitate the arrangement when the instru
ment is intended to be put in action.
   The bottom part m, which receives the glass cylinder, is
of box-wood, and is furnished with glass feet, FFF, for the
purpose of occasional insulation.
   The instrument being fitted up to my liking, I tried its
effect by introducing the exterior end of the slip of silver be
tween my upper     lipand gum, and laying the mwveable piece
of zinc upon my tongue. The distance of the two pieces of
zinc was i-4th of an inch.     I  could not perceive the smallest
effect to take place.    tried
                         I      it with the zinc pieces r-8th of
an inch asunder, and also    at the distance of i-i6th3 but still
                              C  4                       without

40      Description   of a newly invented Galvanometer,
without observing any divergence of the gold leaves or any
peculiar taste.
    When the gold came into absolute contact with the zinc
the taste was instantly perceptible, in the same manner as
when an immediate connection is established between zinc
and silver, by bringing them into contact between the teeth
aster they have been properly disposed in the mouth ; but
I  could never perceive, when they were sensibly asunder, the
smallest effect, and therefore, after repeated fruitless attempts
to increase the action by enlarging the surfaces of the metals,
in* contact with the mouth, laid the instrument aside, as use
less, except as a more delicate electrometer.
    As I attributed my want of success not so much to any
error either in the principle or construction of my instrument,
as to the smallness of the galvanic charge, M. Volta had no
sooner made his pile known, than it occurred to me, that, as
a stronger charge might now be obtained, the instrument I
had constructed would certainly be affected by       it,   the elec
                                                           if
tric and galvanic fluid possessed identity.
    My friend, Mr. Henry Lawson, having constructed            pile,
                                                                a
 consisting of 80 pieces of zinc, and as many of silver, we
 made the experiment together.       The silver of the galvano
meter was connected with the upper piece of the pile, which
 was zinc, while the silver end of the pile was in contact with
the zinc of the galvanometer. The sliding pieces BC were
 then adjusted, and, at the distance of 1-30 of an inch from
 each other, the gold leaves diverged   : upon presenting excited
 glass they opened still further, proving    to be that state called
                                                it
plus, or positive.
    We then reversed the connection, making the lower or
 zinc end of the galvanometer join the upper or zinc end of
 the pile, and the silver flip join the lower or silver end of the
 pile.   In this cafe, excited glass made the leaves, to close,
 while excited sealing-wax opened them further.
    When we made this trial of the galvanometer, the pile was
 giving shocks, that were taken with    a  sensation equal to what
 would have been experienced from charge of as much coated
                                        a
 surface of electricity as would, if discharged through the gal
 vanometer, have torn and destroyed the gold leaves, wnile
 by galvanism they were only diverged equal to about i-4th
 of an inch: even sealing-wax slightly excited, presented to
 the instrument, kept the leaves   in  constant motion.
    Since that time have performed number of experiment?

 periments  with it  which   have  yet been made public, besides

           Description   of a newly invented Galvanometer.        41
mat    in or several a little different from any I have yet heard of,
and in all of them I have found the galvanometer so useful
an instrument, that I can recommend it with some confi
dence to those who are fond of such experiments.
    I shall not encroach upon the pages of the Philosophical
Magazine by detailing the results or experiments in which
others have anticipated me ; but sliall, as briefly as possible,
state a few experiments respecting the action of the galvanic
pile on several of the gases, which present some new facts on
this interesting subject.
    In these experiments an exhausted transfer was screwed
upon the top of a graduated glass cylinder, open at the bot
tom. The cylinder being filled with water and placed over
a pneumatic tub, was then charged with gas to any particular
division, and the division noted, hy which means the quantity
allowed to ascend into the transfer, upon opening a cock in
terposed between it and the cylinder, was known ; and con
sequently, whether any or what quantity of the gas under
 experiment was absorbed by the process.
     I. The pile being placed, with a small tube containing
 distilled water, and connecting wires of fine silver, in the
 exhausted transfer, the quantity of atmospheric air admitted
 from the adjoining graduated cylinder was registered.           After
 standing in this way for 36 hours, out of 200 cubic inches of
 atmospheric air, 40 were sound to have been absorbed. During
 the whole time of the absorption, gas was formed in the small
 tube of water, and a floculent oxyd was precipitated.
     II. When oxygen gas, obtained from the oxymuriat of
 potash, was used, the power of the pile was considerably in
 creased; the one wire gave out gas more rapidly, while a
 much more copious floculent precipitate was formed by the
 other. Leaving this experiment during the night, aoo cubic
 inches of oxygen were found to have been absorbed by the
 morning. Water had ascended from the pneumatic tub, and
 not only filled the graduated cylinder, but risen so high into
 the transfer, that the pile was half immersed in it. The ex
 haustion, thus produced, maintained a column of water of
  about 16 inches in height.
     III. Azotic gas, procured by the decomposition of atmo
 spheric air by the sulphuret of potash, totally stopped the
  action of the pile, neither gas nor precipitate appearing in
  the small tube of water.
      IV. With hydrogen gas the effect was the fame. I could
                                                                  f
  not perceive that the pise had the smallest action.
      It is proper that I should observe here, that the cloths in
  terposed between each pair of metals in these experiments

 43               Means of 'increasing the Quantities               of Heat
 were moistened with a solution of common salt.            If the
 cloths be soaked in acids, the result, as every one knows,
 will be, very different ; the pile will then act as powerfully
 even in vacua as in atmospheric air.
    An anonymous correspondent, in the last number of the
 Philosophical Magazine, notices the increased action of the
 pile by acids; but because he finds that the alkalies, particu
 larly pure ammonia, also increase its action most powerfully,
 infers, that the fluid excited in the pile does not arise from
 the action of acids, or from any combination of oxygen with
 the metals.   Before making such an inference, he ought to
have tried his pile in such circumstances as would have pre»-
eluded the possibility of oxygen having access to it. In vacuo
his pile would have speedily ceased to act, even with solutions
of alkali interposed between the pairs of plates. He ought
also to have examined the state of the residual water in the
two glasses, connected by means of a syphon, before he pro
ceeded to overturn the Lavoisierian system from the circum
stance of oxygen gas being produced in the one glass and
hydrogen gas in the other.
    The last paragraph in his paper is equally inconclusive,
where he would infer, because an electrometer gives signs of
negative electricity when a drop of water is let fall upon a
piece of red-hot iron placed upon                      it,
                                           that therefore positive
electricity and water form hydrogen air. The presence of
hvdrogcn       not necessary to the electrometer indicating ne
                  is
gative electricity      ;the water be converted into vapour, the
                            if
effect  isproduced     indeed, the vapour of any kind of liquid
                         :
produces the negative state.

IT     is
       a   fact which has been long known, that clays, and
several other incombustible substances,         when mixed with
sea-coal, in certain proportions,    cause    the coal to give out
more heat in its combustion     than     can   be made
                                                  it    to produce
when   it   burnt pure
             is         or unmixed      but  the ;cause of this in
crease of heat  does not appear   to have   been   yet investigated
with that attention which        extraordinary and important
                                          so                                          a
circumstance seems to demand.
   Daily experience teaches us, that all bodies — those which

ft                                                                                   are

                 obtained in the Combujfion  of Fuel.          43
are incombustible, as well as those which are combustible,
and actually burning, — throw off, in all directions, heat, or
rather calorific (heat-making) rays, which generate heat
wherever they are stopped or absorbed : but common observ
ation was hardly sufficient to show any perceptible difference
between the quantities of calorific rays thrown oft* by different
bodies, when heated to1 the fame temperature, or exposed in
the same fire ; although the quantities so thrown off might
be, and probably are, very different.
     It has lately been ascertained, that when the fides and
back of an open chimney fire-place, in which coals are
burned, are composed of fire-bricks, and heated red-hot,
they throw off into the room incomparably more heat than
all the coals that could possibly be put into the grate, even
supposing them to burn with the greatest possible degree of
brightness.       Hence it appears that a red-hot burning coal
does not fend off near so many calorific rays as a piece of red-
 hot brick or stone, of the same form and dimensions ; and
 this interesting discovery will enable us to make very import
 ant improvements in the construction of our fire-places, and
 also in the management of our fires.
      The fuel, instead of being employed to heat the room di
 rectly, or by the direct rays from the fire, should be so dis
 posed or placed as to heat the back and sides of the grate ;
 which must always be constructed of fire-brick or fire-stone,
 and never of iron or of any other metal. Few coals, there
  fore, when properly placed, make a much better sire than a
 larger quantity; aud shallow grates, when they are constructed
  of proper materials, throw more heat into a room, and with
  a much less consumption of fuel, than deep grates ; for a large
   mass of coals in the grate arrests the rays which proceed from
   the back and fides of the grate, and prevents their coming
   into the room ; or, as fires are generally managed, it prevents
   the back and sides of the grate from ever being sufficiently
   heated to assist much in heating the room, even though they
   be constructed of good materials, and large quantities of coals
   be consumed in them.
       It is possible, however, by a simple contrivance, to make
   a good and an ceconomical fire in almost any grate, though
   it would always be advisable to construct fire-places on good
   principles, or to improve them by judicious alterations, rather
    than to depend on the use of additional inventions for correct
    ing their defects.
       To make a good sire in a bad grate, the bottom of the
    grate must be first covered with a single layer of balls, made
    Of good fire-bricks or artificial fire-itone, well burnt, each
 .                                                              ball

 44          Means  of increasing the Quantities of Heal
 ball being perfectly globular, and about      i\ or as inches in
 diameter.     On this layer of balls the fire is to be kindled,
 and, in silling the grate, more balls are to be added with the
 coals that are laid on; care must, however, be taken in this
 operation to mix the coals and the balls well together, other
 wise, isa number of the balls should g€t together in a heap,
 they will cool, not being kept red-hot by the combustion of
 the surrounding fuel, and the fire will appear dull in that
 part; but if no more than a due proportion of the balls are
used, and if they are properly mixed with the coals, they will
 all, except it be those perhaps at the bottom of the grate,
become red-hot, and the sire will not only be very beautiful,
but it will fend off a vast quantity of radiant heat into the
room, and will continue to give out heat for a great length
of time. It is the opinion of several persons who have for a
considerable time practised this method of making their sires,
that more than one-third of the fuel usually consumed may
be saved by this simple contrivance.    It is very probable that,
with careful and judicious management, the saving would
amount to one-half, or fifty per cent.
    As these balls, made in moulds, and burnt in a kiln, would
cost very little, and as a set of them would last a long time,
probably several years, the saving of expense in heating rooms
by chimney fires with bad grates, in this way, is obvious ;
but still it should be remembered, that a saving quite as great
may be made by altering the grate, and making it a good
fire-place.
    In using these balls, care must be taken to prevent their
accumulating at the bottom of the grate. As the coals go on
to consume, the balls mixed with them will naturally settle
down towards the bottom of the grate, and the tongs must
be used occasionally to lift them up ; and, as the fire grows
low, it will be proper to remove a part of them, and not to
replace them in the grate till more coals are introduced.
A little experience will show how a fire made in this manner
can be managed to the greatest advantage, and with the least
trouble.
    Balls made of pieces of any kind of well-burnt hard brick,
though not equally durable with fire-brick, will answer very
well, provided they be made perfectly round ; but if they are
not quite globular their flat fides will get together, and hy
obstructing the free passage of the air amongst them, and
amongst the coals, will prevent the fire from burning clear
and bright.
    The oest composition for making these balls, when they
are formed in moulds, and afterwards dried and burnt in a
                                                            kiln,

               obtained in the Combustion    of Fuel.             45
kiln, is   pounded crucibles mixed up with moistened Stur-
bridge clay ; but good balls may be made with any very hard
burnt common bricks, reduced to a coarse powder, and mixed
with Sturbridge clay, or even with common clay. The balls
fliould always oe made so large as not to pass through between
the front bars of a grate.
    These balls have one advantage, which is peculiar to them,
and which might perhaps recommend the use of them to the
curious, even in fire-places constructed on the best principles ;
they cause the cinders to be consumed almost entirely ; and
even the very ashes may be burnt, or made to disappear, if
care be taken to throw them repeatedly upon the fire when
it burns with an intense heat.        It is not difficult to account
for this effect in a satisfactory manner, and in accounting for it
we shall explain a circumstance on which it is probable that the
great increase of the heat of an open sire, where these balls are
used, may, in some measure, depend.           The small particles of
coal and of cinder which, in a common fire, fall through the
bottom of the grate and escape combustion, when these balls
are used can hardly fail to fall and lodge on some of them j
and, as they are intensely hot, these small bodies which alight
Upon them in their fall, are soon heated red-hot, and dis
posed to take fire and burn; and, as fresti air from below the
grate is continually making its way upwards amongst the
 balls, every circumstance is highly favourable to the rapid
 and complete combustion of these small inflammable bodies.
 But if these small pieces of coal and cinder sliould, in their
 fall, happen to alight upon the metallic bars which form the
 bottom of the grate ; as these bars are conductors of heat,
 and, on account of that circumstance, as well as of their situ
 ation, behiv the sire, never can be made very hot, any small
 particle of fuel that happens to come into contact with them,
not only cannot take fire, but would cease to burn should it
 arrive in a state of actual combustion.                               ,
    These facts are very important, and well deserving of the
 attention of those who may derive advantage from the im
 provement of fire-places, and the œconomy of fuel.
    There are some circumstances which strongly indicate that
 an admixture of incombustible bodies with fuel, and espe
 cially with coal, cause an increase of the heat even when the
 fuel is burnt in a closed sire-place. No fire-place can well be
 contrived more completely closed than those of the iron stoves
 in common use in the Netherlands ; but in these stoves, which
 are heated by coal fires, a large proportion of wet clay is al
 ways coarsely mixed with the coals before they are introduced
 into the fire-place.     If this practice had not been found to be-
                                                               usefui,

  46                       On the Use     of   Steam
  useful, it would certainly never have obtained generally; not
 would it have been continued, as it has been, For more than
  two hundred years.
     The combination of different substances, combustible and
  incombustible, to form, 'artificially, various kinds of cheap
  and pleasant fuel, particularly adapted for the different pro
  cesses in which the fuel is employed, is a subject well worthy
  of the attention of enterprizing and ingenious men. How
  much excellent fuel, for instance, might oe made, with proper
  additions and proper management, of the mountains of refuse
  coal-dust that lie useless at the mouths of coal-pits ? and how
 much would it contribute to cleanliness and elegance if the
 use of improved coke, or of hard and light fire-balls, could be
  generally introduced in our houses and kitchens, instead of
 crude, black, powdery, dirty sea-coal ! Of the great ceco-
 nomy that would result from such a change, there cannot be
 the smallest doubt.
     It is a melancholy truth, but, at the fame time, a most
 indisputable fact, that, while the industry and ingenuity of
 millions are employed, with unceasing activity, in inventing,
improving, and varying, those superfluities which wealth and
 luxury introduce into society, no attention whatever i3 paid
 to the improvement of those common necessaries of life on
which the subsistence of all, and the comforts and enjoyments
 of the great majority of mankind, absolutely depend.
     Much will be done for the benefit of society, if means can
be devised to call the attention of the active and benevolent
to this long neglected, but most interesting, subject.
     The Royal Institution seems to be well calculated to faci
litate and expedite the accomplishment of this important
object.     Indeed, it is more than probable that this precisely
is the object which was principally bad in view in the foun
dation aud arrangement of that establishment.
VIII.     On the Use   of   Steam as a Vehicle for conveying Heat
      from   one  Place  to another.     By Count      Rumford*.
M«LORE           than fifty years ago, colonel William Cook, in
a   paper presented     by him to the Royal Society, and pub
lished in their Transactions, made a proposal for warming
rooms by means of metallic tubes filled with steam, ana
communicating with a boiler situated out of the room 5
which     proposal   was    accompanied by an engraving,              which
    * From  the Journals of the Royal Institution of Great Britain,  vol. i.
                                                                    showed^

/bowed, in a manner perfectly clear and distinct, how this
might be effected.           Since that time this scheme has fre
quently been put in practice, with success, both in this coun
try and on the continent*.              Many attempts have likewise
been made, at different periods, to heat liquids by means of
steam introduced into them ; but most of these have failed :
and, indeed, until it was known that fluids are nonconductors
of heat, and, consequently, that heat cannot be made to
descend in them (which is a recent discovery), these attempts
could hardly succeed ; for, in order to their being successful,
it is absolutely necessary that the tube which conveys the hot

contains the liquid to be heated, or on a level with its bot
tom ; — but as long as the erroneous opinion obtained, that
heat could pass in fluids in all directions, there did not ap
pear to be any reason for placing the opening of the fleam-
tube at the bottom of the vessel, while many were at hand
which pointed out other places as being more convenient
for it.
    But to succeed in heating liquids by steam, it is necessary,
not only that the fleam should enter the liquid at the Ijottom
of the vessel which contains          it,but also that    should enter
                                                                  it                   it

forced back       by  this opening into the steam-boiler          for the    ;
hot steam, being suddenly condensed on coming into contact
with the cold liquid,     a     vacuum will necessarily be formed in.
the end of the tube      ;     into which vacuum the liquid in the
vessel, pressed    by   the whole weight of the incumbent atmo
sphere,    will  rush  with   great force and with      loud noise
                                                              a       but         ;

thus forced into its lower end will not have time to rife to
that height before      it     will be met          by

48                      On the Use     of   Steam
liquids,  and for keeping them hot, in a variety of cafes, in
which fire, applied immediately to the bottoms of the con
taining vessels, is now used.
    In dyeing, for instance, and in brewing, and in the pro
cesses of many other arts and manufactures, the adoption
of this method of applying heat would be attended, not only
with a great saving of labour and of fuel, but also of a consi
derable laving of expense in the purchase and repairs of boil
ers, and of other expensive machinery : for, when steam               is"
used instead of fire for heating their contents, boilers may be
made extremely thin and light          ; and, as they may easily be
supported and strengthened        byhoops and braces of iron, and
other cheap materials, they will cost but little, and seldom
stand in need of repairs.        To these advantages we may add
others of still greater importance          :boilers intended to be"
heated in this manner may, without the smallest difficulty, be
placed in any part of     a room at any distance from the fire,
and in situations in  which     they maybe approached freely on
every fide.   They may, moreover, easily be              so surrounded
with wood, or with other cheap substances which form warm
covering, as most completely to confine the heat within them,
and prevent its escape. The uibes,              which the steam
                                                by                   is
brought from the principal boiler, (which tubes may conve
niently be suspended just below the ceiling of the room,)
may, in like manner, be covered            so
                                           as almost entirely to pre
vent all loss of heat       by the surfaces of them      ; and this to
whatever distances they may be made to extend.
   In suspending these steam-tubes, care must, however, be
taken to lay them in situation not ftrfeElly horizontal under*'
                        a
the ceiling, but to incline them at            small angle, making
                                                a
them rise gradually     from    their  junction with the top of      a
large vertical steam-tube, connecting them with the steam-
boiler, quite to their farthest extremities          for, when these
                                                     :
tubes are   soplaced,  it    evident that all the water formed in
                            is
them, in consequence of the condensation of the steam in its
passage through them, will run backwards and fall into the
boiler, instead of accumulating in them, and obstructing the
passage of the steam, which       itwould not fail to do were there
any considerable bends     or  wavings, upwards and downwards,
in  these tubes, or  of  running forward and descending with
the steam into the vessels containing the liquids to be heated,
which would happen        if  these tubes inclined downwards in^-
stead of inclining upwards as they recede from the boiler.
   In order that clear and distinct ideas may be formed of thft
various parts of this apparatus, even without figures,        I    shall
distinguish each part    by   aspecific name< The      vessel m  which

  water is boiled in order to generate steam, and which, in its
  construction, may be made to resemble the boiler of a steam-
  engine, I shall call thefleam-boiler: the vertical tube, which^
  rising up from the top of the boiler, conveys the steam intd
  the tubes (nearly horizontal), which are suspended from the
  ceiling of the room, I stiall call the prime conductor: to the
  horizontal tubes I shall give the name of horizontal conduc
  tors, or simply, conductors offleam: and to the (smaller) tubes^
 which, descending perpendicularly from these horizontal con
 ductors, convey the steam to the liquids which are to be
 heated, I stiall, exclusively, appropriate the appellation of
Jleam-tubes.
     The vessels in which the liquids are put that are to be
 heated, I shall call the containing vejjcls.      These vessels may
 be made of any form ; and, in many cafes, they may, with
 out any inconvenience, be constructed of wood, or of other
 cheap materials, instead of being made of costly metals, by
 which means a very heavy expense may be avoided.
     Each steam-tube must descend perpendicularly from the
 horizontal conductor, with which it is connected, to the level
 of the bottom of the containing vessel to which it belongs j
 and, moreover, must be furnished with a good brass cock,
 perfectly steam-tight j which may best be placed at the height
 of about fix feet above the level of the floor of the room.
     This steam-tube may either descend within the vessel to
 which it belongs, or on the outside of                       it,
                                                    as shall be found

 bend; and its junction with the bottom of the vessel must
 be well secured, to prevent leakage.        If comes down into

it,   otherwise the liquid iti the vessel will not be uniformly
 and equally heated.
     When the steam-tube         brought down on the inside of the
                                      is

 and without touching the sides of            or       it,
                                                   may come down

 on one fide of the vessel, and in contact with it.
     When several steam-tubes, belonging to different con
 taining vessels, are connected with one and the fame hori
 zontal steam conductor, the upper end of each of these tubes,
instead of being simply attached,                      by
                                             soldering, to the under
side of the conductor, must enter, at least one inch, within
the cavity of it; otherwise the water resulting from a. con
densation of part of the steam in the conductor, by the cold

50                    On   the Use   of   Steam
the steam-boiler, will descend through the steam-tubes and
mix with the liquids in the vessels below ; but when the open
ends of these tubes project upwards within the steam con
ductor, though it be but to a small height above the level of
its under fide, it is evident that this accident cannot happen.
     It is not necessary to observe here, that, in order that the
ends of the steam-tubes         may project within the horizontal
conductor, the diameters of the former must be considerably
 less than the diameter of the latter.
     To prevent the loss of heat arising from the cooling of the
 different tubes through which the steam must pass in coming
 from the boiler, all those tubes should be well defended from
 the cold air of the atmosphere by means of warm covering ;
 but this may easily be done, and at a very trifling expense.
 The horizontal conductors may be inclosed within square
 wooden tubes, and surrounded on every side by charcoal-dust,
 fine sawdust, or even by wool ; and the steam-tubes and prime
 conductor may be surrounded, first by three or four coatings
 of strong paper, firmly attached to them by paste or glue, and
 covered with a coating of varnish, and then by a covering of
 thick coarse cloth.     It will likewise be advisable to cover the
 horizontal conductors with several coatings or paper ; for, if
 the paper be put on to them while it is wet with the paste or
 glue, and if care be taken to put it on in long slips or bands,
 wound regularly round the tube in a spiral line, from one
 end of it to the other, this covering will be useful, not only
 by confining more effectually the heat, but also by adding
  very much to the strength of the tube, and rendering it un
 necessary to employ thick and strong slieets of metal in the
  construction of it.
      However extraordinary and incredible it may appear, I can
  assert it as a fact, which I have proved by repeated experi
  ments, that isa hollow tube, constructed of sheet copper -f*5
  of an inch in thickness, be covered by a coating only twice
  as thick, or -r'e of an inch in thickness, formedof layers of
  strong paper, firmly attached to it by good glue, the strength
  of the tube will be more than doubled by this covering. T
  found by experiments the most unexceptionable and de
  cisive, (of which I intend, at some future period, to give to
  the public a full and detailed account,) that the strength of
  paper is such, when several sheets of it are firmly attached
  together with glue, that a solid cylinder of this substance,
  the transverse section of which should amount to only one
  superficial inch, would sustain a weight of 30,000 lbs. avoir
  dupois, or above 13 tons, suspended to          it,without being      ,
  pulled asunder or broken.         The strength of hemp     is still
                                                              much

                  as a Vehicle  fur  conveying Heat.             51
much greater, when it is pulled equally, in the direction of
the length of its fibres.      I found, from the results of my ex
periments with this substance, that a cylinder of the size
above mentioned, composed os the straight fibres of hemp,
glued together, would sustain 92,000 lbs. without being pulled
asunder.
    A cylinder, of equal dimensions, composed of the strongest
iron I could ever meet with, would not sustain more than
66,000 lbs. weight ; and the iron must be very good not to
be pulled asunder with a weight equal to 55,000 lbs. avoir
dupois.
    I (hall not, in this place, enlarge on the many advantages
that may be derived from a knowledge of .these curious facts.
I have mentioned them now in order that they may be
known to the public ; and that ingenious men, who have
leisure for these researches, may be induced to turn their at
tention to a subject, not only very interesting on marly ac
counts, but which promises to lead to most important im
provements in mechanics.
    I cannot return from this digression without just mention
ing one or two results of my experimental investigations re
lative to the force of cohesion, or strength of bodies, which,
certainly, are well calculated to excite the curiosity of men
of science.
    The strength of bodies of different sizes, similar in form,
and composed of the same substance, or the forces by which
they resist being pulled asunder by weights suspended to them,
and acting in the direction of their lengths; are not in the
simple    ratio of the areas of their transverse sections, or of
their fractures, but in a higher ratio, and this ratio is differ
ent in different substances.
    The form of a body has a considerable influence on its
 strength, even when it is pulled in the direction of its length.
    All bodies, even the most brittle, appear to be torn asunder,
or their particles separated, or fibres broken, one after the
other; and hence it is evident, that that form must be most
favourable     to the strength of any given body, pulled in the
 direction of its length, which enables the greatest number
of its particles, or longitudinal fibres, to be separated to the
greatest possible distance (short of that at which the force of
cohesion is overcome), before any of them have been forced
beyond that limit.
    It i« more than probable, that the apparent strength of dif
ferent substances depends much more on the number of their
particles that come into action before any of them are forced
beyond the limits of the attraction of cohesion, than, on any
                                  D %                       specific

5*                        On the Use  of  Steam
specific difference in the intensity of that force in those sub
stances.
    But to return to the subject more immediately under con
sideration. As it is essential that the steam employed in heat
ing liquids, in   the manner before described, mould enter the
containing     vessel   at, or very near, its bottom, it is evi
dent that this steam must be sufficiently strong, or elastic, to
overcome, not only the pressure of the atmosphere, but also
the additional pressure of the superincumbent liquid in the
vessel ; the steam-boiler must therefore be made strong enough
to confine the steam, when its elasticity is so much increased
by means of additional heat, as to enable it to overcome that
 resistance.   This   increase of the elastic force of the steam need
 not, however, in any case, exceed a pressure of five or six
 pounds upon a square inch of the boiler, or one-third part,
or one-half, of an atmosphere.
     It is not necessary for me to observe here, that in this, and
 also in all other cases where steam is used as a vehicle for
 conveying heat from one place to another, it is indispensably
 necessary to provide safety-valves of two kinds ; the one for
 letting a part of the steam escape, when, on the fire being
 suddenly increased, the steam becomes so strong as to expose
 the boiler to the danger of being burst by it ; the other for
 admitting air into the boiler, when, in consequence of the
 diminution of the heat, the steam in the boiler is condensed,
 and a vacuum is formed in it; and when, without this valve,
 there would be danger, either of having the sides of the boiler
 crushed, and forced inwards by the pressure of the atmosphere
 from without ; or of having the liquid in the containing ves
 sels forced upwards into the horizontal steam conductors, and
 from thence into the steam-boiler.          This last-mentioned ac
 cident, however, cannot happen, unless the cocks in some of
 the steam-tubes happen to be open. The two valves effec
 tually prevent all accidents.
     The reader will, no doubt, be more disposed to pay atten
  tion to what has here been advanced, on this interesting sub
ject, when he is informed that the proposed scheme has al
  ready been executed on a very large scale, and with complete
 success, and that the above details are little more than exact
 descriptions of what actually exists.
     A great mercantile and manufacturing house at Leeds, that
 of Messrs. Gotl and Co., had the courage, notwithstanding
  ihe mortifying prediction of all their neighbours, and the
  ridicule with which the scheme was attempted to be treated.*
  to erect a dyeing-house, on a very large scale indeed, on the
  principles here described and recommended.

    On my visit to Leeds the last summer, I waited on Mr.
 Gott, who was then mayor of the town, and who received
 me with great politeness, and showed me the cloth halls, and
 other curiosities of the place ; but nothing he showed me
 interested me half so much as his own truly noble manufac
 tory of superfine woollen cloths.         I had seen few manufac
 tories so extensive, and none so complete in all its parts.             It
 was burnt to the ground the year before I saw                 it,

just been rebuilt, 011    a  larger scale,, and with great improve
 ments in almost every one of its details. The reader may
 easily conceive that   I  felt no small degree of satisfaction on
going into the dyeing-house to find            fitted up on principles
                                                 it

the information he had acquired in the perusal of my seventh
Essay. He assured me that the experiment had answered,
even far beyond his most sanguine expectations; and, as                   a
 strong proof of the utility of the plan, he told me that his
next door neighbour, who            is

 lately adopted them, and          now convinced that they are real

but that they would be adopted              by

of 1800 gallons; and they are all heated                by
                                                         steam from one
steam-boiler, which          is
                              situated      in corner of one of the
                                                 a
rooms.
    The horizontal tubes, wliich serve to conduct the steam
from the boiler to the coppers, are suspended just below the
ceiling of the rooms they are made, some of lead, and some
                         ;
of cast iron, and are from four to five inches in diameter                j
but when  I    saw them they were naked, or without any cover
ing to confine the heat.        On my observing to Mr. Gott, that
coverings for them would be useful, he told me that                   was
                                                                     it

54                          On (be Use   of  Steam
intended that they should be covered, and that covering*
would be provided for them.
     The vertical (team-tubes, bv which the steam passes down-
from the horizontal steam conductors into the coppers, are
all constructed of lead, and are from £ of an inch to sc
inches in diameter; being made larger or smaller according
to the sizes of the coppers to which they belong.                These
steam-tubes all pass down on the outsides of their coppers,
and enter them horizontally at the level of their bottoms.
Each copper is furnished with a brass cock for letting off its
contents; and it is silled with water from a cistern at a di
stance, which is brought to it by a leaden pipe. The coppers
are all surrounded by thin circular brick walls, which serve
not only to support the coppers, but also to confine the heat.
     The rapidity with which these coppers may be heated, by
means of steam, is trulv astonishing.              Mr. Gott assured me
 that one of the largest of them, containing upwards of 1800
 gallons, when silled with cold water from the cistern, requires
 ho more than half an hour to heat it till it actually boils !
 By the greatest sire that could be made under such a copper,
 with coals, it would hardly be possible to make it boil in less
 than an hour.
     It is easy to perceive that the saving of time which will
 result from the adoption of this new mode of applying heat
 will be very great; and it is likewise evident that ft may be
 increased, almost without limitation, merely by augmenting
 the diameter of the steam-tube : care must, however, be taken
 that the boiler be sufficiently large to furnish the quantities of
 steam required.          The saving of fuel will also be very consi
 derable     :  Mr.   Gott   informed me that, from the best calcula
 tion   he    had  been   able   to make, it wonld amount to near two-
  thirds  of    the  quantity formerly expended, when each copper
 was   heated     by a separate fire.
     But   these    savings are far from being the only advantages
  that  will   be  derived    from the introduction of these improve
  ments     in   the   management of heat : there is one, of great
  importance        indeed,    not vet mentioned, which alone would
  be sufficient to recommend the very general adoption of them,
  As the heat communicated by (team can never exceed the
  mean temperature of boiling water by more than a very few
  degrees, the substances exposed to it can never be injured by
  it. In many arts and manufactures this circumstance will
  be productive of great advantages, but in none will its utility
  be more apparent than in cookery, and especially in public
  kitchens, where great quantities ot food are prepared in large
  boilers; for, when the heat is conveyed in this manner, all
               4                                                    the

the  labour now      employed    in stirring about the contents of
those boilers, to   prevent   the    victuals from being spoiled by
burning to the     bottoms of them, will be unnecessary, and
the loss of heat    occasioned by this stirring prevented ; and,
instead of expensive coppers, or metallic boilers, which are
difficult to be kept clean, and often stand in need of repairs,
common .wooden tubs may, with great advantage, be used
as culinary vessels; and their contents may be heated by
portable fire-places, by means of steam-boilers attached to
them.
   As these portable fire-places and their steam-boilers may,
without the smallest inconvenience, be made of such weight,
form, and dimensions, as to be easily transported from one
place to another by two men, and be carried through a door
way of the common width, (with this machinery, and the
steam- tubes belonging to       it,

this culinary apparatus, and made ready to be used for any
other purpose.

the heat was    soregulated,   that,  although   the liquid never ac

making good glue. Had any other lower temperature been

IX. An        Account    of a new Eudiometer.             By Mr.   Davy*.
 J.   HE dependance of the health and existence of animal*
upon a peculiar state of the atmosphere, and the relations of
this state to processes connected with the most essential wants
of life, have given interest and importance to inquiries con
cerning the composition and properties of atmospheric air.
   This elastic fluid has been long known to consist chiefly
of oxygen and nitrogen mingled together, or in a state of loose
combination, and holding in solution water.
    A variety of processes have been instituted with the view
of determining the relative proportions of the two gases, but
most of them have involved sources of inaccuracy; and lately
all, except two (the flow combustion of phosphorus, and the
action of liquid sulphurets,) have been generally abandoned.
    Both phosphorus and solution of sulphuret of potash absorb
the whole of the oxygen of atmospheric air at common tem
peratures, and they do not materially alter the volume, or the
properties of the residual nitrogen; but their operation is ex
tremely flow, and in many cafes it is difficult to ascertain the
period at which the experiment is completed.
    I have lately employed as an eudiometrical substance the
 solution of green muriate, or sulphate, of iron, impregnated
with nitrous gas ; and I have found that it is in some respects
 superior to many of the bodies heretofore used, as it rapidly
 condenses oxygen without acting upon nitrogen, and requires
 for its application only a very simple and a very portable ap
 paratus.
    This fluid is made by transmitting nitrous gas through
 green muriate, or sulphate, of iron, dissolved to saturation in
 waters. As the gas is absorbed, the solution becomes of a
 deep olive-brown, and when the impregnation is completed it
 appears ppaque and almost black.      The process is apparently
 owing to a simple elective attraction ; in no cafe is the gas
 decomposed; and under the exhausted receiver it assumes its

                     Account  of a new Eudiometer.                     57
elastic form,      leaving the fluid, with which it was combined,
unaltered in its properties.
    The instruments necessary for ascertaining the composition
of the atmosphere, by means of impregnated solutions, consist
simply of a small graduated tube, having its capacity divided
into one hundred parts, and greatest at the open end ; and
of a vessel for containing the fluid.
    The tube, after being filled with the air to be examined,
is introduced into the solution ; and, that the action may be
more rapid, gently moved from a perpendicular towards a
 horizontal position.       Under these circumstances the air is
 rapidly diminished; and, in consequence of the dark colour
or the fluid, it is easy to discover the quantity of absorption.
 In a few minutes the experiment is completed, and the whole
 of the oxygen condensed by the nitrous gas in the solution ia
 the form of nitrous acid.
    In all eudiometrical processes with impregnated solutions,
 the period at which the diminution is at a stand must be ac
 curately observed ; for, shortly after this period, the volume
 of the residual gas begins to be a little increased, and, after
 some hours, it will often fill a space greater by several of the
 hundred parts on the scale of the tube, than that which it
 occupied at the maximum of absorption.
    This circumstance depends upon the flow decomposition
 of the nitrous acid (formed during the experiment) by the
 green oxide of iron, and the consequent production of a small
 quantity of aeriform fluid (chiefly nitrous gas)*; which,
 having no affinity for the red muriate, or sulphate, of iron
 produced, is gradually evolved, and mingled with the residual
 nitrogen.
    The impregnated solution with green muriate is more rapid
 in its operation than the solution with green sulphate.                 In
 cases when these salts cannot be obtained in a state of abso
 lute purity, the common or mixed sulphate of iron may be
 employed.        One cubic inch of moderately strong impreg
 nated solution is capable of absorbing five or fix cubic inches
 of oxygen, in common processes ; but the fame quantity must
 never be employed for more than one experiment.
     A number of comparative experiments, made on the con
 stitution of the atmosphere at the Hotwells, Bristol, in July,
    * The decomposition of nitrous acid,
                                           by solutions containing oxyde of
 iron, at its minimum of oxydation, is a very complex process,    she green
 oxyde, during its conversion into red oxyde, not only decomposes the acid,
 but likewise acts upon the water of the solution ; and ammoniac is some
 times formed, and small portions of nitrous oxyde and nitrogene evolved
 with the nitrous gas.
                                                                   August,

 ^8                Account of a new Eudiometer.
 August,   and September, 1800, with phosphorus, sulphurets
 of alkalies, and impregnated solution, demonstrated the ac
 curacy of the processes in which the last substance was pro
 perly employed. The diminutions given by the sulphurets
 were indeed always greater, by a minute quantity, than those
 produced by phosphorus and impregnated solutions : but the
 reason of this will be obvious to those who have studied the
 subject of Eudiometry.      In no instance was it found that
 100 parts in volume of air contained more than 21 of oxy
gen : and the variations connected with different winds,
 and different states of temperature, moisture, &c. were too
small, and too often related to accidental circumstances, to
be accurately noticed.
    In analysing the atmosphere in different places, by means
of impregnated solutions, I have never been able to ascertain
any notable difference in the proportions of its constituent
parts. Air, collected on the sea at the mouth of the Severn,
 on October the 3d, 1800, which must have passed over much
of the Atlantic, as the wind was blowing strong from the west,
was found to contain at percent, of oxygen in volume; and
this was nearly the proportion in air lent from the coast of
 Guinea, to Dr. Beddoes, by two surgeons of Liverpool.
    If we compare these results with the results gained more
 than twenty years ago, by Mr. Cavendish, from experiments
on the composition of atmospherical air, made at London
and Kensington ; considering, at the same time, the re
searches of Berthollet in Egypt and at Paris, and those of
Marti in Spain, we shall find strong reasons for concluding
that the atmosphere, in all places exposed to the influence
of the winds, contains very nearly the fame proportions of
oxygen and nitrogen: a circumstance of great importance;
for, by teaching us that the different degrees of salubrity of
air do not depend upon differences in the quantities of its
principal constituent parts, it ought to induce us to institute
researches concerning the different substances capable of
being dissolved or suspended in the air, which are noxious
to the human constitution ; particularly as an accurate know
ledge of their nature and properties would probably enable
us, in a great measure, to guard against, or destroy, theif
baneful effects.    .

  N«       O  THING      tends so much to promote the improve
  ments of a state, as the establishing of an easy and uninter
  rupted communication through all its districts. It has there
  fore been a leading object with every well-wistier of his
  country, to render the general intercourse as perfect and con
  venient as possible.      Public roads and bridges have been the
  means chiefly employed to establish this intercourse : bridges,
  as requiring scientific and mechanical knowledge, and, in
  many cases, the utmost exertions of talents ana skill, have
  frequently engaged the attention of persons of eminence and
  learning.
       It would be an amusing task to trace the progress of this
. useful art, from the rude efforts of the savage, in his unassisted
   state, to the magnificent works of civilized nations, when.
   science, wealth, and increased population, have united to
   overcome difficulties considered before as unsurmountable. •
       When a work is to be performed, mankind,at first, make use
   of the materials which are nearest at hand, and which require
   the least skill in the preparation; timber and stone were there
   fore the materials with which bridges were first constructed,
   and those edifices have been rendered more or less perfect, in
   proportion to the quality of the materials, the state of the
   arts, and the degree of wealth and power, in the countries
   in which they were erected.
        In our oldest bridges, it is evident, there has been much
   timidity, and only a small portion of skill : in deep water, the
   lower parts of the piers have been constructed with timber,
   and the masonry begins to take place at the line of low water;
   the arches are of narrow span, and the masonry employed in
   them is frequently composed, partly of rubble, and partly of
   squared stone. In time, means were devised (by using coffer
   dams and caissoons) to place the masonry as low, commonly
   lower than the natural oed of the river ; the arches were also
    formed of a bolder span, and the masonry was made much
    more perfect, being all of squared stone.       In this manner,
    bridges have been constructed in Italy.France, and the British
    Isles, which have justly been considered, not only as works
    of general utility, but of great magnificence.
         In like manner, timber bridges have been gradually im
    proved, from the rough trunk of a tree thrown across a small

 6"o            Improvements     of the Port of London,
 stream,    to the bold and ingenious labours          of  the Swiss car
 penter at Schaffhausen.
     Bridges continued to be chiefly composed of timber or of
 stone, till of late years : on account of ceconomy, in some
 cafes, they have been built with bricks.
     Metals not being generally found in a pure state, require
 much labour and expense to make them subservient to the
 purposes of man, and therefore, in the uncultivated periods
of society, were not applied to works of great magnitude;
 but the important improvements in chemical and mechanical
knowledge, have, in a great degree, removed those difficulties,
and rendered them not only the most powerful, but the most
useful means of man.
     Iron being the most abundant, cheap, and generally useful,
 of all the metals, has of late years been applied in all works
where great strength was required in proportion to the weight
of the material : hence cylinders, beams and pumps for steam-
engines, boats * and barges for canals and navigable rivers,
beams t and pillars for large buildings and bridges, have been
constructed of iron.
    The first iron bridge we know of, is over the river Severn,
near Coalbrookdale, in Shropshire ; it consists of one arch ioo
feet and 6 inches in the span, and rises 45 feet : there are five
ribs, each cast in two pieces, secured where they join at the
crown of the arch by a cast-iron key plate, and connected toge
ther, horizontally and vertically, by cast-iron braces, formed
with dovetails and forelocks; the ribs are covered with cast-
iron plates, and the railing to the fides is of iron : the total
weight of iron is 378^ tons. The project's being carried into
execution was chiefly owing to the genius and exertions of
Mr. John Wilkinson and Mr. Abraham Darley, iron masters,
whose scientific knowledge and extensive practice, in all that
regards the manufacture of iron, have long been known to
the public.       The bridge was built by Mr. Abraham Darley,
and the iron work was cast at Coalbrookdale in the year 1779.,
It was a bold effort; for, in the first instance of adopting a new
material, they exceeded the span of the centre arch of Black-
friars bridge, which had been considered as a great exertion
with    stone.
    •  Mr. John Wilkinson    has constructed boats and barges of iron, some
of which   are used on the river Severn,  and the others upon the canals in
Staffordshire and Worcestershire.
    t  A large manufactory for spinning flax into thread by machinery
worked by a steam-engine, has been erected at Shrewsbury by Messrs. Ben,
yon,' Marshall, and Bage, where there are four heights of floors, and a roof
composed of brick archtS, which arc supported by call-iron beams and pillars.
                                                                       The

                ,  And of the intended Bridge.                   61
    The iron work of this bridge has fully justified the idea of
making use of that metal ; for it is at this time as perfect as
when it was first put up, except the cracking of some of the
small pieces, owing to the giving way of the abutments of
stone, which, it is to be regretted, were not made sufficiently
strong to oppose the great mass of alluvial earth, of which the
very high and steep adjoining banks are composed ; for, if
those abutments had been fortunately built on the coal mea
sures, no such flip could have taken place.
    The second iron bridge was built over the fame river, about
two miles above the former one, at a place called Buiidwas ;
it was erected at the expense of the county of Salop, agreeably
to a plan,   and  under the direction, of Mr. Telford, who is
employed    as surveyor  of the public works of that county : it
was also cast at Coalbrookdale in 1795 and 1796.         It consists
of one arch 130 feet in the span, and rises, from the springing
to the soffit of the arch, 27 feet.     In this bridge, as it was
necessary  to keep  the roadway  as low  as possible, the principle
of the Schaffhausen bridge is in some degree adopted ; for
the outside ribs are made to go up as high as the tops of the
railing; they are connected with the ribs that bear the co
vering plates by means of pieces of iron, dovetailed in the
form of king-posts.      The plates which form the covering
over the lower ribs are cast with deep flanches, are laid close
to each other, and form an arch of themselves, so that, al
together, the bridge is compact and firm.            The weight of
iron is 173 tons, 18^ cwt.       Some smaller bridges, and an
aqueduct at Longdon, (the first made of iron over a navigable
canal,) have also been made under Mr. Telford's directions,
 in Shropshire.
    The next bridge, on a large scale, which was made of iron,
was that over the river Wear, at Monk-wearmouth,              in the
 county of Durham. This bridge is 236 feet in the span, and
 the arch rises only 34 feet : it is composed of very short cast-
 iron frames, which are connected together by bars of wrought
 iron, and hollow tubes with flanches and screws ; the ribs are
covered with timber planking.        The weight of cast iron used
in this bridge is 205 tons, hammered iron 55 tons. This
bridge was Built under the direction, and chiefly at the
 expense, of Rowland Burdon, esq. ; it was cast at the ma
 nufactory of Messrs. Walkers, ot Rotherham, in Yorkshire,
 and does much honour to the projector and to the iron mas
 ters. It was a considerable step in the practice of bridge
 building, being nearly double the span of the arch of Build-
 was, and considerably more than double that of the centre
 arch of Blackfriars bridge. This will, perhaps, appear rash
                                                                   to

6z            Improvements   of the Port of London,
to those who have not had an oportnnity of considering the
qualities of iron, or who have not earefully compared its
strength with the strength of the materials formerly used in
constructing bridges.    In great works it is proper we should
proceed with caution ; but the very principle of improvement
must be wholly abandoned, if the demonstrations of science
and the evidence of practical knowledge are to be disregarded.
To those who will take the trouble ofcomparing the specific
gravity and the strength of cast iron with thole of stone, it
will not appear extraordinary, that by using that metal, the
practice of bridge- building may be changed, and the open
ings of archways made to extend far beyond what has hitherto
been attempted. The advantages to be derived from this prac
tice are obvious, and become of great national importance in
every country where the free navigation of rivers is intimately
connected with its prosperity.
    We have been led into the consideration of this subject by
the information we have received respecting the plans for re
building London bridge.       Understanding that there was a
plan for constructing a bridge over the Thames of a single
arch of cast iron, we have made particular inquiries, and
have authority to fay that the following is a correct state
ment of the history, principles, and plan of this design :
   The manufactures, trade, and commerce of Great Britain
having increased to an extent unparalleled in the history of
nations, a great proportion of which is carried on through
the metropolis by means of the fine river upon which it is
situated, and the important centre it forms for the commerce
of great part of the world ; although this river forms an ex
cellent channel to admit the intercourse of ships of the largest
burthen within a few miles of the city, yet, from the increase
of the number and size of the vessels frequenting the port of
London, great inconveniences and losses have been experienced
in transacting the business connected with the shipping. The
distance at wTiich the large ships are obliged to he, the con
fusion of shipping in the river, the loss of time in loading and
discharging goods, the expense of lighterage, the frequency
of thefts, the delays and vexation experienced by the mer
chant and manufacturer, have at last given rife to proposi
tions and plans to remedy those evils. On this great national
subject, which embraces such a variety of objects, opinions
have, of course, been various, and some of them contradic
tory : this produced much discussion while the business re
mained with an open committee ofttie house of commons ; and,
although much useful information was obtained, yet no project
appeared to be finally agreed on, and brought to maturity.
                                                            This

                 end   of   the intended      Bridge.           63
     This led to the judicious measure of appointing a select com
mittee, consisting of members who were. not concerned in any
of the projects brought forward. This committee has made
three most valuable reports to the house of commons, wherein
every thing relative to the port of London, and the general
commerce of the kingdom, as far as it is connected with
this port, has been arranged with an accuracy and precision,
which will enable the legislature and the public to compre
hend, at one view, a subject which requires information
beyond the power of any individual to bring together.
     In this great plan, they have judiciously divided the port
of London into three parts. The first is the docks in the
Isle of Dogs, which are calculated to accommodate the West
 India trade, which, usually arriving in large fleets, contri
 buted in a peculiar degree to the crowded and embarrassed
 state of the river, and which, from the valuable nature of
 their cargoes, were very much exposed to depredation. There
 is also, in this part, a canal, by means of which those strips
 that with to come up the river, may avoid the circuituous
 route by Greenwich and Deptford.
      The second part is the docks in Wapping, which are in
 tended for the accommodation of several great branches of
 bur trade which are subject to heavy duties. And
      The third is, the improvement of the river from the
 Tower, upwards, to Blackfriars bridge ; and this third part
 includes the rebuilding of London bridge.           By this means,
 colliers and coasting vessels, and all vessels of light burthen,
 are to be admitted to pass the new London hridge, and (hip
  and discharge goods immediately at wharfs and warehouses,
  to be constructed along the banks of the river, and opposite
  to the centre of the city.
      The two first parts of the plan have been sandtioned by ,
  parliament, and have been undertaken by incorporated com
  panies, excepting the canal, which is now executing under
  the direction of the city of London.
      The committee have, in their third report, also recom
  mended a general plan for improving the third or upper part
  of the port of London; that      is,   by
                                         removing the present Lon
  don bridge, and replacing   it  with one of cast iron,63  feet high
  in the clear above high water, with inclined planes connect
   ingit  with the present streets, and such other improvements
   as may grow out of this alteration.      Also, deepening the bed
   of the river, to admit of ships of two hundred tons lying
   afloat at low water
                     ;      and contracting the width of the river,
 in    order to preserve its present velocity, and to acquire space
   for wharfs and warehouses, and for the inclined planes,
                                                              without

64           Improvements   of the Port of London,
without encroaching upon the property which is now con
nected with the shores.
    The portion of this plan which has been more immediately
under the consideration of the committee during the present
sessions of parliament, has been a design by Messrs. Telford
and Douglass, in which it is proposed to construct the bridge
of a single arch composed wholly of cast iron : the span of
the arch is 600 feet, being the width to which, by Mr. Jes-
sop's report, the river ought to be contracted, if it is ex
cavated to have 13 feet at low water: the height in the clear
above high water is 65 feet, being the elevation determined
by the resolution of the committee last sessions.
    The boldness and simplicity of this design render it an
object of attention, not only to the committee, who are en
gaged in considering the further improvement of the port of
London, but to men of science and practical engineers, and
to all who feel an interest in the improvement and credit of
their country.
    It is now generally admitted that the present London
bridge ought to be removed, being expensive and dangerous
in itself, and forming an obstruction in the most valuable
part of the river.    If the present bridge is to be removed, the
new bridge should be rebuilt upon that plan which should
leave the river clear of obstacles, and, at the fame time, reflect
most credit on the British artists.
     Ifa single arch can be constructed without endangering
the solidity and duration of the structure, most undoubtedly
there can be only one opinion as to the propriety of adopting
it. It would be a great national work, combining the greatest
degree of utility and magnificence, and superior in its kind
to any thing the world has yet seen.
    In a work of this nature it would have been imprudent to
have been guided by the judgment or opinion of any indi
vidual ; it therefore became necessary to collect the sentiments
of all the persons most eminent for scientific knowledge and
practical skill : this has been done by the committee in the
most effectual and impartial manner that could be devised,
by transmitting copies of the plans, explanatory drawing?,
and the queries relating thereto, to persons who are well qua
lified to investigate the subject : those gentlemen have taken
it up with an impartiality, candour, and patriotism, which
does them much hon6ur, and have furnished able and satis
factory demonstrations and opinions.        The result   is,
                                                          that an
arch, of the plan and dimensions referred to their consider
ation, may be constructed    so   as to be rendered  a substantial
and durable edifice.

                    and of  the intended Bridge.                 65
    The particulars of these   masterly disquisitions are contained
 in  the Appendix to the fourth Report of the Select Committee
 for the further improvement of the port of London : they
 will be the means of throwing much new light on this im
 portant subject, and will, moil probably) change the princi
 ples and practice of this species of architecture.
    It would require many drawings and much detail to convey
 an adequate idea of the form and construction of this magni
 ficent arch ; it cannot properly be shown as whole in a draw
ing upon any scale that would suit a publication of this na
 ture. We understand the public curiosity will be speedily
 gratified with a perspective view, taken from the Surrey side
of the   present London bridge, on a plate four feet long and
 two feet wide, and which, besides the new bridge, compre
 hends the principal objects in the cities of London and West
minster, from Bow church to Whitehall ; and the proposed
¦wharfs,   warehouses, and terraces, between the bridges.       The
bridge part is engraved by that eminent artist Mr. Lowry,
whose scientific knowledge is only exceeded by his dexterity
as an engraver; and all the rest by Mr. Malton, whose views
of London have done him honour, and qualify him to give
the back ground with a precision which no other artist could
be expected to equal.
    According to this plan, the bridge is to be composed wholly
of cast iron, which is much less liable to decay or alteration
than hammered iron. The ribs are to be cast in poitions of as
large a size as to be conveniently moulded, and cast correctly,
and such as can be readily managed in the removing and put-
ling up* they are to be connected together by cross and di
agonal tyes and braces, placed in such a manner that any
of the pieces of the ribs or tyes, or braces, may be taken out
separately, and be replaced without injury or interruption to
the bridge.     The ribs will receive the weight and pressure in
a direction that the stress will operate upon the pieces of iron
endways ; therefore, before the bridge can give wav, the iron
must be crushed to pieces.       All the frames or ribs are to be
connected vertically and horizontally from the soffit of the
arch to the roadway, so that the whole bridge will act as one
frame, and by that means lessen the lateral pressure against
the abutments, and guard against any error in the equilibra
tion of the arch.      The ribs are to be so disposed that they
spread from the middle of the bridge to the abutments, with
the view of causing the abutments to embrace a greater space
on the shore, to increase the width of the bridge, to accom
modate the roadway in turning towards the inclined planes,
and to prevent any tendency the bridge might have to side

vibrations : the side vibrations will be further
                                                 opposed by the
cross and diagonal tyes and braces, and by the plate or grating
which is to be laid across the ribs to receive the roadway.
The roadway is to be composed, first of a light, dry, and
durable substance, laid next to the iron plates; secondly, of
a compact substance, which will not admit of water pasting
through it j and, thirdly, of the side-paths and pavements for
the driving-way.
     The whole   external form of the bridge is to be composed
of Gothic tracery ;      the railing is also to be of Gothic work,
with Gothic       pinnacles to receive the lamps; so that the
bridge will, at a distance, have the appearance of a frame of
light Gothic tracery, finislied on the top with that wildness
of outline of which the Gothic style is so capable.
   The abutments, by the spreading form of the bridge, their
connection with the entrances at each end, and with the
wharfs at each side of       will occupy
                               it,         space on the shore
                                                    a
sufficient to form an ample foundation for an edifice capable
of resisting any pressure whatever. The form and connection
of the masonry will also be calculated to distribute the resist
ance through the whole mass, in the fame manner as                  if it
was   a  solid rock of equal magnitude: additional strength will
also be gained    by   the land arches, or warehouses, which are
under the inclined planes.
   By making three entrances or avenues with the additional
width of the bridge at each end, advantages nearly equal to
those arising from three bridges will be afforded to the public.
In all respects, therefore, the bridge will be an original de
sign, as its important situation and distinguished name justly
demand.
   The scaffolding upon which the iron arch will be turned,
is to be formed       by driving rows of piles into the river, the
top   of  which     will  be above low-water mark       ;   these piles to
be properly braced together; upon them will be raised                    a
proper framing to support the part of the iron work which
-will rest upon them       :   at    aconvenient distance, to admit
barges    to  pass,  another    set of  piles and frames will be fixed,
and these frames will also be braced together, at              a    proper
height,    over  the  barge openings,       which   will admit   of gang
ways being       made    quite   across   the  river, so that  the  whole
will become one general frame from shore to shore. The
top being made to suit the curve of the soffit of the arch, the
iron work will then be fixed upon              it with facility and ease.
The weight of the whole iron work, when distributed over                so
great  a  space, is  very small, when compared with works con
structed   with  stone.     The scaffolding will not, therefore, re-
           g                                                         quire

quire to be of the large dimensions which may at first be
imagined : the truth of the principles was fully proved by the
very ingenious, though apparently flight, scaffolding,              over
which the arch of Wearmouth was turned ; and they may
be illustrated by stating, that the greatest stone arches are
turned upon centres formed of timber. When the courses of
stone have been brought up to near the crown of the arch,
on each side, the whole rests upon the timber centres, and
in large arches this weight is very great : the centre must,
however, be equal to support the weight; otherwise it would
give way, and the stone-work would fall down.
   The iron a"rch   is,   in fact, no more than    a    framing similar
to that for the centring for   a    stone arch, with this difference,
that the iron framing has little more to carry than its own
Weight. The iron work having much more strength than
timber, may be made proportionally smaller.                  In making
and putting up timber centres, there must be props and sup
ports, and the scaffolding for supporting the iron framing
may be compared to these props and supports.
   By deepening and embanking the river, much useful soace
will be gained, and the properties along each bank of the
river, as well as the streets adjoining, andleading from thence
into the city, will,      by
                           a   judicious arrangement, be rendered
very valuable. Deposits, and public markets for coals, may
also be formed under the wharfs,         by    which means the light
erage   of coals   brought   from   the  pool up as far as Blackfriars
bridge   would    be  completely   saved.    This plan is   proposed    by
Mr. Douglass, who has given          a     full description of
                                                             it   in the
Appendix     to  the  third  Report  of the   Select Committee    of the
House of Commons. From his estimates on the general con
sumption of coal in London,         it    appears, that the savings in
two years will be adequate to the expense of erecting the new
iron bridge. This plan merits mature consideration. The
coals being regularly supplied, would tend to prevent sudden
injurious competition, which of late years has been such                 a
burthen on the public.
    If this part or the plan for improving the port of London
be successfully executed, we shall no longer be reproached              by
foreigners, that we have one of the finest rivers in the world
running through our principal city, yet that we suffer its
usefulness to be in   a    great measure destroyed     by  maintaining
a  stone embankment across the most valuable part of              it, by
suffering its shores to exhibit an extent of mud, instead of con
verting them into useful wharfs and its banks to be covered
                                    ;
with mean and shapeless buildings, instead of edifices suited
to  so noble a    situation, and worthy the commercial metro
polis of Europe.

  A O purify oil of rapeseed, mix ioo parts of the oil with
from I 'r to 2 parts of sulphuric acid, and stir the mixture.
The oil will immediately change its colour ; it will become
turbid and assume a blackish-green tint, and at the end of
three quarters of an hour it will be full of flakes.             You must
then give over stirring                it,
                                and add gradually double its weight
of water to remove the sulphuric acid, which, allowed to                           if
remain too long with the oil, would not fail to exercise too
strong an action on                   it,
                               and to char it.         The mixture must
thenoe beat for at least half an hour, to brjng the moleculæ
of the oil, the acid, and water, into contact with each other;
after which          to be left at rest.

                   it

    When the oil has been treated with two hundredth parts
of sulphuric acid, if it be suffered to digest for twenty-four
hours with the fourth of its weight of chalk or carbonate of
lime, or of argil, you will obtain it almost as clear as water.
Lime, however, cannot be employed with advantage, as it
would occasion too much waste; but, in my opinion, argil
would give very advantageous results : it retains, indeed, a
          large quantity of oil, but, by means of a press, the
 art portions of the oil may be extracted from the argil almost
firetty
entirely.

                    XII. Of     Complex   Affinities.
  ist,UiNDER           the more general name of complex affinity
I shall  examine that which has been considered as arising from
the concourse of four affinities, and which is generally di
stinguished by the name of double affinity.
    To give an idea of the action of four affinities, Bergman
examines what takes place when a solution of sulphate of pot
ash and muriate of lime are mixed together.               This, fays he,
is as if one should put into the quantity of water employed
the proportions of sulphuric acid, muriatic acid, lime, and
potash, which enter into the composition of these salts: the
two bases act by their affinities on these two acids ; but
though the affinity of the potash for the sulphuric acid be
stronger than that which it has for the muriatic acid, the
affinity of the muriatic acid for the potash, however, added
to the affinity of the sulphuric acid for the lime, gives a sum
of forces greater than the affinity of the sulphuric acid for the
potash, and that of the muriatic acid for the lime, which de
termines an exchange of bases ; so that, instead of sulphate of
potash and muriate of lime, there are produced sulphate of lime
and muriate of potash.       This explanation is always founded
on the supposition, that the affinities are constant forces in
dependently of the quantities and the state of saturation.
    2d, When the two bases act conjointly on one acid, the latter
divides itself, or rather divides its action, in the ratio of their
masses. Instead of one acid there are here two; and if no separa
tion is effected, either bvpreqlpitatioaorcrystallisation, the a,cids
                                 E3                                 will

70                      Researches respecl'ing
will both    act upon the two bases equally in the ratio of their
masses:     if each of  the acids were first combined with a base,
after the mixture of the solution of the two salts, the sum of
 the reciprocal forces of the acids and the alkalies would be
 the fame as before; no muriate of potash or sulphate of lime
will be formed, but there will be a combination of potash,
 lime, sulphuric acid, and muriatic acid, which will give the
 same degree of saturation as before the mixture.          Hence it
 happens, that when two salts, which, by an exchange, ought
 to produce combinations which would have very different
 proportions, are mixed, neither acidity nor alkalicity, which
 would necessarily show themselves if an exchange took place,
 are observed, as has been very well remarked by Guyton.
     3d, It has been concluded, merely from the result of the
 precipitation and the crystallisation that has been observed,
 that an exchange of bases has taken place; but this effect has
 not been ascribed to its real cause.
      We have seen (Art. V.) that the force of cohesion deter
 mines the separation which in elective affinities takes place
  by precipitation or crystallisation! it is the fame force also
  which produces the fame effect in complex affinities. When
  I mix a solution of the sulphate of potash with that of the
  muriate of lime, and when the quantity of water is not great,
  the lime, in the contact in which it finds itself with the sul
  phuric acid (No. 1.) experiences the effect of the force of
  cohesion in a higher degree than the potash.       It is therefore
  a new force which is added to those which before existed ; it
  must decide the combination of the sulphuric acid with the
  lime at the time of its precipitation.
      4th, If we take a view of all the known decompositions
  which arise from complex affinities, we shall find that the
  excess of affinity*in opposing affinities is always ascribed to
  those substances which have the property of forming a preci
   pitate or a salt that may be separated by crystallization ; so
  that, from the degree of the solubility of the salts which can
  be formed in a liquid, may be predicted the order of the affi-*
   nities of the substances by which Bergman and other emi-r
   nent chemists would represent the forces in the symbolical
   tables ; for they always ascribe a superiority of affinities to
   the two substances which ought to form a combination in
   soluble in regard to the quantity of the solvent.
      Lime, magnesia, barytes, and strontian, form with car-r
   bonic acid an insoluble salt ; all the soluble combinations of
   these earths, mixed with alkaline carbonates, produce an ex
   change, the result of which is the formation and precipitation
   of carbonates with an earthy base,
                                                             Barytes

                       the Laws of Affinity.                     71
    Barytes forms with the sulphuric acid an insoluble salt :
when the solution of a sulphate is mixed with that of a salt
having a base of barytes, there is always formed and preci
pitated a salt with a base of barytes.
    As lime forms a sulphate very little soluble, and which is in
a great measure precipitated       if there be not a great deal of
water, it equally changes its base with all the soluble sul-
   hates till the period when precipitation ceases to take place
E y the solubility of the sulphate of lime. The sulphate of lime
having still much more solubility than sulphate of barytes,
salts with a base of barytes, which are more soluble, decom
pose the sulphate of lime.
    Oxide of silver forms an insoluble salt with muriatic acid :
all salts of silver which are soluble being mixed with soluble
muriates, there is precipitated muriate of silver.      Mercury, if
not too much oxidated, has a similar action.
    As muriate of lead is little soluble, the salts which the oxide
of lead forms with other acids, and which possess solubility,
  traduce a precipitate with soluble muriates; but, as an inso-
fuble salt is made with sulphuric acid, the solution of muriate
of lead produces a solution os sulphate of lead when mixed with
soluble sulphates.
    5 th, When water, then, in which different salts have been
put in solution is made to evaporate, these salts separate ac
cording to the order of their solubility, and it is by it that one
can judge of the changes of base which may take place.
    But the solubility ossalts varies according to temperatures:
it is therefore the relative solubility, according to the different
temperatures, that must be considered.        The nitrate of potasli
mixed with the muriate of soda will crystallize at a low tem
perature, but the muriate of soda will separate itself even during
the time of the evaporation : no exchange of bases will take
place, because the nitrate of soda is a little more soluble cold
than the nitrate of potash ; and because, on the contrary, the
muriate of potasli is a little more soluble warm than muriate
of  soda.
    6th,  I  consider here only the principal result, arising from
a force   of  cohesion, of such a nature, that it makes the effect
of the forces opposed to it to disappear; but when there does
not exist a considerable cohesion in the combinations which
can be formed, the mutual action of the substances which
remain in the liquid state of the solvent, and of the propor
tions which vary by the crystallization of the newly-sepa
rated combination, must produce different effects.          The ex-
              I have begun,  will soon throw further   lighten this

of this combination, we may still foresee the composition
which must take place. The same consideration may be
applied to those affinities called eleclive.
    8th, A precipitate      sometimes effected
                                   is                the mixture of   by
two saline substances which have the fame acid for instance,               ;
by    amixture of the muriate of magnesia and the muriate of
lime.      It  probable that two combinations are then formed,
                is
one with an excess of acid and         small part of the two bases,
                                                       a
the other with the greatest part of the two bases and           small                a
portion of acid.
   This effect               is
                     analogous    to what we have observed in
Art. IX. No.         but here

    9th, We have seen in Art. VII. that heat,              increasing          by
the volatility of substance, weakens its combination.
                             a                                   This

pen,      by
          exposing two salts to the action of heat,              only               it   is
necessary to examine whether one of the two bases and one
of the two acids possess      greater degree of volatility than the
                                        a
remaining base and acid         and we may be assured- that, on
                                            ;
applying     sufficient degree of heat, the combination of the
               a
most volatile base and acid will be formed and sublimed,
while the more fixed base and acid will also remain com
bined.     Among the bases, ammonia and the oxide of mer
cury, and among the acids, the carbonic and muriatic, afford
several illustrations of this truth.
    10th, Efflorescence ought also to be considered as           force               a

.lion of this substance. I have promised to explain the forma
 tion of the carbonate of soda by means of these circumstances,
 which I (hall now endeavour to perform.
     Calcareous sand, constantly impregnated with moisture,
 may be considered as a solution of the muriate of soda, which
 acts upon the carbonate of lime.              Now it follows, from what
 has been explained in Art. IV. that insolubility causes a great
 diminution in the mutual action of a solid and a liquid sub
 stance, but that it does not destroy it.                  This action is op
 posed to the insolubility of the carbonate of lime, which is
 not absolute.         A solution must therefore be formed of a small
 quantity       of   carbonate of lime, and, consequently, (No. 1
 and 2,) the constituent parts of this carbonate and of the
 muriate of soda, which are in solution, exert a reciprocal
 action ; otherwise the presence of the carbonate ot lime
 would not be a condition necessary to the formation of the
 carbonate of soda *.
     We must, therefore, consider the humidity of the calca
 reous sand, in which the carbonate ot" soda is formed, as 4
 solution of muriate of soda and a small quantity of carbonate
 of lime : hence soda and carbonic acid are both present,
  and the efflorescence,           which is a property of the car
  bonate of soda, ought to be considered as a new force that
 tends to remove it from this combination.                    In short, when,
  in a soil impregnated with muriate of soda, we meet with
 the stalks of reeds which favour the efflorescence, the car
 bonate of soda not only accumulates round these stalks, but
 sometimes         it is not formed without such assistance, when
 certain circumstances, such as a too argillaceous nature of
  the soil, &c. are little favourable to its production; so that
 at a fliort depth muriate of soda only is discoverable.
     * The solution of the carbonute of lime
                                                by the muriate of potash and by
  the sulphate of potalh, which indubitably act like the muriate of soda, hw
 teen proved by a direct experiment, for which we are indebted to Guyton.
                                                         '¦ The
  (Mem. de Scbeele, part ii. note de la page 18.)                solution or sul
 phate of potash, muriate of potalh, &c. poured in lime-water which has
  been ren dered niiiky by water impregnated with cirbonic acid gas, imme
 diately caused the precipitate to disappear.     There was likewise no earthy
 precipitate when water, charged with carbonic acid gis, was poured in a
  mixture of lime-water and a solution of thete neutral salts ; the liquor al
  ways contained a portion of uncombined alkali."            Guyton combats the
  opinion of Schetle, who did not observe any decomposition with the mu-
 rutc and sulphate with base of potalh, but only with the salts with base
 of  soda.
     The   difference of opinion between those celebrated chemists arose     from
 the circumstance, that one ascertained the decomposition only by the       efflo
 rescence, which is peculiar to salts with base of soda (Art. VIII.),       while
  the other observed it in a liquid , but in the latter instance it is much  more
 limited. — B.
                                                                        I wished

     I wished
            to ascertain the truth of this explanation in a
trough placed in one of the gardens belonging to the Insti
tute. For this purpose, some carbonate of lime and siliceous
earth, both well washed, were mixed together, to which was
added a certain proportion of muriate of soda : a hole was
made in this mixture, for the purpose of pouring in water
occasionally, and keeping up the necessary degree ot moisture.
An incrustation of muriate of soda is formed at the surface,
which already strongly changes the colour of paper tinged
with brazil wood, like the alkalis ; but we cannot expect to
obtain an efflorescence so considerable as to be perceptible to
the sight, till after a much greater length of time.
   nth, The preceding observations snow that the only dif
ference which distinguishes the complex affinities from those
called ehaive, is, that in the former, substances are brought
into action which are nearly in an uniform degree of satura
tion ; and that, in the latter, there is a substance present which
is not yet saturated (or several such substances may be present) ;
so that, in the former, a new degree of saturation is established
only in proportion to the combinations which are capable of
being separated ; whereas, in the latter, the action of the un-
saturated substances becomes in equilibrio with that of the
substances which were already so ; whence it happens that
the force of cohesion and that of elasticity produce, their effect
more completely in the complex than in the elective affinities.

 Gazette   lieFrance    for  1775,  that  his  mother      lived to the
great age of     one   hundred   and  two.    His   sister, also, is  said
to   have  attained   to  a  great age,  and   to   have     been  much
esteemed for her iicms, written in the Italian language.
Boscovich entered into the order of the Jesuits on the 1st of
October 1725; in November 1740 he was appointed pro
fessor of mathematics in the Roman college, and distinguished
himself    by  several excellent mathematical and astronomical
dissertations on the rotation of the fun, on the inequalities in
the motion of Jupiter and Saturn, on light, on dioptrics, on
the tides, on the atmosphere of the moon, and the method
of calculating the orbits of comets.             In the year 1750
he was employed           by cardinal Valenti,   minister      of state to
                                                                    pope

                celebrated Mathematician Boscovicb.             75
pope Benedict      XIV. to measure a degree of the meridian in
the territories of the church ; an undertaking which he ac
complished in a satisfactory manner, in conjunction with
father Maire of the fame order, and of which he gave an
account in a work published at Rome in 1755 under the title
of De Literaria Expeditione per Pontificiam Ditionem, &c.
This work was afterwards translated into French, and pub
lished at Paris, with the title of Voyage Ajlronomique et Geo-
graphique dans I'Etat de I' Eglife, &c.
     The measuring of a degree of the meridian in Austria and
 Hungary by F. Liesganig, in Piedmont by F. Beccaria, and
 in America by Mason and Dixon, were undertaken on the
 suggestion of Boscovich, and by means of the influence which,
 he had in different courts on account of the great reputation
 he had acquired in the mathematics : on the fame account
  he was chosen by the Royal Society of London to observe the
  second transit of Venus in California; but the dissolution of
  his order, which happened about that time, prevented his
  acceptance of this appointment.
      In the year 1759 he published at Vienna his Pbilofopbiat
  naturalib-Tbeoria, and in 1763 he was invited to be professor
  of the mathematics at Pavia, where he taught for six years.
  He afterwards removed to Milan, on an invitation from the
  imperial minister count Firmian, to be professor of astronomy
  and optics ; and while in this situation he founded the ob
  servatory of the Jesuits- in that city, which gave rife to the
  imperial observatory, and that now called the Cisalpine ob
  servatory of Brera.
       In the year 1773, on the destruction of the order of the
  Jesuits, Boscovich was invited to France by his friends in
   that country, among whom were De la Borde, Durfort, the
   ministers Boynes and Vergennes, and madame de Sivrac.
   On this occasion he was naturalised, and obtained the ap-

       Boscovich was a poet of no inconsiderable merit ; for the
   dry and abstruse study of the mathematics damped neither
   the fire of his genius nor destroyed those powers of the ima
   gination by which those born poets are peculiarly distin
    guished.    His Latin poem on eclipses is highly worthy of
                                                                     x

    of the ability and clearness with which the author gives pre
    cepts for the most difficult calculations, and explains the most
    complex parts of the theory of astronomy. It has been trans
    lated into French by Barruel.      The esteem in which Bosco
    vich was held, occasioned his being involved also in political

defence    of
           its interests in regard to its waters and boundaries,
then under discussion with the deputies of Tuscany; and he
was sent to Vienna to defend this cause before the emperor.
This business he brought to happy conclusion, and thereby
                                      a
rendered  an essential service to the republic.    He travelled             a
great deal, and visited most  parts of Europe,  and even Turkey.
His Tour to Constantinople went through two editions, one
in Italian in 1762, and      German translation in 1773.
                                 a
    So much merit did not remain free from those animosities
which     are generally excited      great talents.
                                       by             Some circum
 stances which took place at Pans on the part of some of the
literati of that capital, gave him considerable uneasiness and,         ;
as he possessed great sensibility, they made      greater impression
                                                     a
on his mind than they perhaps ought to have done. On this
 account he resolved, in 1783, to leave Paris, and to proceed
to Italy, in order to collect and publish his whole works,
which appeared at Bcssano in 1786, though said to be printed
at Strasburgh, in five quarto volumes, under the title or Opera
ad Opticam et AJironomiam perlinentia.          The part relating to
nautical astronomy was translated into German, and published
separately at Leipfic, in 1787,             by
                                          Eschenbach.      He wrote
also the principles of the mathematics and philosophy, toge
ther with   a  treatise on telescopes, which F. Charles Scherfer
translated into German and published at Vienna, in 1765.
    In the year 1786 he went to Milan, and was employed                     by
the emperor Joseph to superintend the measuring of            degreea
of the meridian and the construction of map of Lombardy;

versation was animated and agreeable, and his facility for
poetical composition was such, that he could readily dictate
verses in the course of conversation with his friends.        To the
variety, the strength, and the cultivation of his talents, he
added the most respectable moral principles, and             deport

         Mine.         By    the Rev.    Malacht Hitchins *.
XlERLAND                   Mine   is situated     in the parish of Gwinear,
about     seven     miles north-eail      of St. Michael's Mount, on
                                                         the
southern coast of Cornwall ; and two miles and a half from
the mouth of the river Hayle, on the northern coast of the
fame county ; it is contiguous to Prince George mine.
   It commences in a valley on the west, and passes through
a hill, which         is first of   steep,    and then          of moderate,    ascent,
for upwards           of   hah* a mile     when the principal

copper lodes,  which follow this direction, meet with a large
cross lode, bywhich, and by other cross courses and flookans,
which intersect them in their farther progress, they are re
peatedly heaved, and so disordered by thele heaves, in their
form and position, and so changed by them, in respect to
their composition, as hardly to be recognized.
   The strata of the district in which this takes place, consist
of the common metalliferous sort of argillaceous slate called
killas.
   The copper lodes of this district are remarkable for the
shortness of their continuity ; for, whereas other lodes may
be traced to an indefinite extent in the fame line of direction,
these, on the contrary, are observed to taper away gradually,
and terminate, to all appearance, at a sliort distance, com
pletely and irrecoverably.
   This mine was worked about twenty years ago, when it
was funk to the depth of one hundred fathoms from the sur
face. It was again set to work about eight years since; has
now four fire-engines and two steam-whims on it; and is
funk to a depth of one hundred and fifty- five fathoms below
the surface, or, as the miners call       from grafs. it,
    It  in this latter period of its history, that discovery has

ticular part of the mine, the singularity of which discovery,
in this country, has much excited the curiosity of the public.
   For, although the numerous veins of lead in Cornwall are
richly impregnated with silver, and occasionally yield small
quantities of silver ores, and even specimens of native silver,
yet, hitherto, no instance had been known of their yielding
this precipus metal in such abundance nor had any circum    ;
stances, in the natural history of the mineral veins of this

  78              Acciount  of the Discovery of Silver
 country,   borne any analogy to those which accompanied the
 present discovery.
    These circumstances, therefore, having been examined with
 more attention than usual, shall be stated with as much pre
 cision as it is possible to obtain, from the report of those prac
 tical miners only who have hitherto inspected them.
    The facts which deserve to be first noticed are, the confined
 and insulated position of the mass of silver ore; its great depth
 from the surface of the mine ; and its contiguity to a copper
 lode.
    The lode in which it occurs is one of those cross courses,
 as they are here called, which intersect and derange the cop
 per lodes, and consequently are of a more recent formation.
    Lodes in this direction are usually filled with quartz, but
 frequently produce galena; and sometimes, instead of galena,
 sulphurated antimony.        They appear here lo conform to the
 same laws, except in the particular instance now to be de
scribed, which forms, indeed, a very remarkable exception.
    No ores of silver were observable in this lode until at the
depth of one hundred and ten fathoms from the surface, or
eighty below the adit or level ; and, at the farther depth of
thirty-two fathoms, they disappeared.
    They have been discovered only in the neighbourhood of
one of the intersected copper lodes, extending no where above
twelve feet from this lode, on the north, or above thirty-two
feet from.it on the south, and acquiring this their greatest
extent at the deepest level ; for the usual dimensions of the
silver ore are not more than six feet in the former situation,
and twelve feet in the latter.
    It is remarkable that, at the point of contact or intersection,
the contents of the silver lode are so poor as to be scarcely
worth saving ; and those of the copper lode are much less pro
ductive of copper than at a little distance from this point.
Moreover, that the copper lode, in the vicinity of the inter
section, seems to have been influenced by the fame causes of
improvement and declension as the cross lode ; being richer
or poorer in copper, as the latter was, at a correspondent
level, in silver.
    The richest mass of silver ore was found at the depth of
two fathoms above the level at which it disappears.
    After this brief account of the most striking facts, it may
be proper to enter into a more particular delcription of the
two lodes which appear, by their intersection, to have gene
rated this body of extraneous matter.
    The copper lode bears nearly east and west by the com
                                                              pass j

                     in Herland Copper Mine.                    79
pass ; the cross lode  nearly north and south, or at right angles
to it.
   The former is about two feet broad, on an average ; and
it dips or underlies, south, one foot in a fathom.           The
breadth of the latter is about two feet and a half, on an ave
rage ; and its underlie is east, about eight inches in a fathom.
   The heave of the copper lode is about eighteen or twenty
inches to the right, in the language of the Cornisti miner ;
the expression being so far appropriate and convenient, as it
refers to the usual situation of the observer in the heaved lode.
   The copper lode is filled with layers of ore and stony mat
ter, the latter of which is here called caple; but the ore is
usually found contiguous to the walls of the lode.
   The contents of the cross lode are more singular, in respect
to their local position, and more various.      Only the eastern
fide of it produces silver ore, the breadth of which is in ge
neral about six or eight inches, although in some places it is
greater. The other part of the lode is chiefly composed of
quartz, intermixed with iron, manganese, and wolfram, to
gether with a small portion of cobalt and antimony.
   The silver ore, strictly speaking, is a mixture of galena,
native bismuth, gray cobalt ore, vitreous silver ore, and na
tive silver; which, in respect to their proportions, follow the
order in which they are here enumerated, the galena being
the most prevalent. The native silver, of which specimens of
the greatest beauty have been reserved for the cabinets of the
curious, is found chiefly in a capillary form, in the natural
cavities of the lode.
   About one hundred and eight tons of this ore have been
raised.   The miners continue to sink near the fame point of
intersection ; and seem confident that both lodes will soon
become richer, because similar instances of declension and
recovery have frequently occurred in the copper lodes of this
mine, and because the two lodes appear to have a reciprocal
influence on each other.
   Unfortunately, however, the extent of their speculation is
limited by the great depth of the present workings; for,
forty-five fathoms have been funk since the first discovery of
the silver; and twenty, or twenty-five fathoms more, are as
much as can be funk in this mine, with its present mecha
nical powers of drawing the water; at which level, viz. one
 hundred and eighty fathoms from the surface, it would be
 somewhat deeper than any mine in Cornwall, and about one
 hundred and thirty fathoms below the level of the sea at low
 water mark.
   The other cross lodes in this mine produce no silver; most
                                                                of

of them being flookaris, or lodes which are essentially different
from the argentiferous cross lode, in the nature of their con*
llituent mass. There is one, however, in the eallern part
of the mine, which, from its resemblance to that, is thought
likely to produce silver, whenever it shall be explored to the
same depth, at its point of intersection ; although these hopes
may probably be fallacious, for the argentiferous lode inter
sects five other copper lodes, viz. two on the north, and three
on the south side, without producing any silver.

    Though we       have already laid before our readers a pretty
ample extract from this useful little volume, we believe they
will not be displeased by a further one. Among the rules
for ascertaining the purity of chemical preparations are the
following    :

    "   The  specific gravity  of sulphuric acid       should be 1 850.
It fliould remain perfectly        transparent,    when     diluted with
distilled water. If a sediment should occur, on dilution, it
is a proof of the presence of sulphate of lead or lime.
     " Iron will be detected in sulphuric acid by saturating a
diluted portion of it with pure carbonate of soda, and adding
prussiatc of potash, which will manifest the presence of iron
by a prussian blue precipitate.          Copper may be discovered
by pouring,     into   a  similar saturated    solution, pure solution
of ammonia ; and lead may be detected by the sulphuret of
ammonia.        The latter metal, however, is generally precipi
 tated, on dilution, in combination with sulphuric acid.
     " Sulphate of potafli or of soda may be found by saturating
the diluted acid with ammonia, evaporating to dryness, and
applying a pretty strong heat. The sulphate of ammonia will
escape, and that of potafli or of soda will remain, and may
be distinguished by its solubility and other characters.

Chemical Examination of the Elastic Quarz*, [Sand-Shits ert

   The singular elastic flexibility, so seldom occurring in the
mineral kingdom, in which this foflil, in its form and ap
pearance, resembles novaculite (Turkey hone), has attracted
the attention of naturalists, but at the fame time has led
many persons to doubt its existence as a natural substance,1
and to suspect that this may probably be a product of art.
It comes from Brazil, near Villa-rica, the principal town
of the province of Miaas Geraes, which fact was, for a
while, kept a secret.     There it occurs in not very thick
strata, whose hanging and shading fides are cased over by a
gray crust os^ inch thick; and from thence it was brought
to Portugal the first time, in the year 1780, by the marquis
de Lavradio, viceroy at Rio de Janeiro.       Among the speci

all those longifh lamellæ are interwoven in one single direct
tion, and implicated in such a manner, that each junction"
resembles a vertebra, or hinge.         With this idea, also, corre
sponds the particular kind of the flexibility of the stone, which
is not tough or coriaceous. For, if the stone be held upright
 and shaken, it vibrates with some noise to and fro ; out as
soon as its agitation is discontinued, its parts conjoin again
 firmly by a Force like a spring.
    I now proceed to its chemical analysis.
    As, on triturating, I found the particles of the stone ex
 tremely hard, which was indeed previously ascertained bv its
 faculty of cutting glass with ease, and of striking fire with flee},
 I endeavoured to facilitate its decomposition by previous me
 chanical comminution.
    To effect this, I subjected one hundred grains to red heat,
 and quenched them in cold water; but I observed, that by
 this, neither their weight nor their hardness had decreased.
 They were then reduced to an impalpable powder in an agate
 mortar, mixed with four parts of dried carbonated soda, and
 ignited under the muffle in a porcelain saucer, during fix
 hours, in a moderate degree of heat; by which the mixture
 only conglutinated, without actual fusion. The ignited mass
 was pulverized with water, supersaturated with muriatic acid,
 digested and filtered.   A quantity of very loose siliceous earth,
 to the weight of 96 j grains, remained on the filter.
    The separated muriatic fluid was treated with Pmsfian
 alkali ; and the blue precipitate, thence arising, ignited.        It
 weighed one grain; of which, however, only •' grain can
 he reckoned as oxide of iron, entering into the 100 grains of
 the decomposed so sill.
    At last, by saturating the solution with carbonated potash,
 a tender earth was thrown down ; which, after washing, dry
 ing, and ignition, weighed 2 [ grains; and, examined by
 means of sulphuric acid, was found to be aluminous earth.
    Consequently, hundred parts of elastic quartz from Brazil
 have yielded ,

    There are sometimes very small blackish grains, like point?,
 mingled with this stone.          As these probably are garnets, or
 crystals of horne-blende,    it  seems  that the portion of iron and
alumine discovered     in the  fossil chieflv proceeds from them.

 vanism, by Mr. Davy, containing an account of some gal
 vanic combinations formed by the arrangement of single me,
 tallic plates with different strata of fluids analogous to the pile
 of signor Volta. All these combinations are formed by the
 arrangement of different chemical agents with single me
 tallic plates.   The most powerful class may be formed by
 arranging plates of copper or silver, and cloths moistened,
 some in nitrous acid, some in solution of sulphuret of potash,
 and some in solution of sulphatp of potash, in the following
order: metallic plate, acid, solution of sulphate of potash,
 solution of sulphuret of potash ; — then, if the specific gravities
of the fluids are in the order of their arrangement, i. e. that
of the acid greatest, and that of the solution of sulphuret least,
 but little mixture or chemical action between them will take
pjace. Twelve plates of copper arranged in this way give
 sensible shocks, and rapidly produce the common appearances
 in water. In all the galvanic combinations with single plates,
the metallic surface which oxidates is the surface which in,
 the circuit with wires produces hydrogen from water.

   Since our last notice, a short course of lectures on pneu
matic chemistry have been delivered by Mr. Davy.                  They
were extremely ingenious, and excited a considerable degree
of interest. The concluding lecture was on the 30th of June,
on respiration ; and after the lecture an opportunity was given
to such as wished    it, to breathe some of the nitrous oxide, the
gas of which we gave         sofull an account in our sixth volume
under the name of gaseous oxide            azote.

much pleasure from breathing           it,
                                        that he lost all sense to every
thing else, and the breathing-bag could only be taken from
him at last    by  force. The irresistible tendency to muscular
action produced     by  this gas was such as cannot be described            ;
it must be witnessed to be conceived.

other scientific gentlemen were present.             Several of them

             FRENCH     NATIONAL INSTITUTE.
  A    commission appointed     by  this body has lately been oc
cupied   with experiments    in galvanism, on which subject the
following notice was read     by  C. Cuvier     :
   Accident, the parent of almost all discoveries, has lately
favoured the philosophical world in            manner which will
                                               a
render thie epoch very remarkable        in  the  history of the sci
ences.    Some   bits of   metal brought    into  contact have ma
nifested phænomena which no sagacity             could  foresee, and
have opened to us   a  field as vast as it     fertile in important
                                               is
applications.
   The influence of these phænomena becomes more and
more extended.      Being at first confined, according to every
appearance, to the animal ceconomy,            ieems now to act an

above         all, that
                    we are indebted for this new discovery.           Hii
opinion,    that  galvanism      was  only  an application  of electricity
to the animal œconomy, having been confirmed by several
men of science, he endeavourea to find out the means of
increasing its effects so far as to render the real nature of
them evident to every body ; and he found that, by multi
plying the pairs of metals, disposing them always alternately,
and keeping them moist—attractions, repulsions, and com
motions, perfectly similar to those occasioned by the Leyden
flask, are produced ; and that, in general, a pile, formed of
lilver, zinc, and moistened pasteboard alternately, immediately
manifests all the appearances of vitreous electricity at the
extremity where the silver               is,
                                          and of the resinous at that
where the zinc          placed.

                                               however, this difference,
that     Leyden
          a        flask, once    discharged, exhibits no more effects
unless       has been again charged
              it                             whereas Volta's pile conT

Jlantly charges itself To that its effects are incessantly renewed;
and   it it only by discharging            with very large conductors
                                          it
that     is
         can be diminished for           moment.

    Besides, the Leyden jar will always discharge itself               the     by
means of water. If there be the least moisture in continuity
between its two surfaces, its effects are annihilated           but with
                                                                     ;
however much water the pasteboard pieces of Volta's pile may
be impregnated, its effects lose none of their intensity             they  :
do not cease till the pile         entirely immersed
                                    is                          in
                                                           water.
    These differences ought to excite some doubts respecting the
perfect identity of galvanism with electricity and other phas- j
nomena, still more extraordinary, increase these doubts.                            If
she ends of two metallic wires be immersed in water, ope of
which communicates with the resinous or negative extremity
of the pile, and the other with the vitreous or positive; and
if  they be kept at        little distance from each other, there are
                               a
disengaged     from   the   extremity of the former bubbles of                      hy
drogen gas, and from that of the other oxygen gas, which
becomes fixed in the metal when the latter               oxidable, or,
                                                               is                   if
it  be not so, rises in bubbles; and this action cpntjnues as
long as the apparatus remains              this state. But
                                             in                    not in

this that the great singularity of the phænomena consists, an$
it    here that galvanism begins to enter the prpvince of che

from the same molecule of water, should appear at points fo
far distant? And why does each of them appear exclusively
at the wire connected with one of the extremities of the pile,
and never at the other ?
      Such was the state of our knowledge respecting galvanism
at the time of the notice given to the class three months ago.
All the experiments made in France and other countries,
arranged and confirmed by a commission, have conducted to
the three following results :r-an augmentation of intensity,
according to the number and extent of the metallic surfaces
brought into contact ; a continued renewal of the action ;
and a production of the two gases by the communication of
the two extremities of the pile with water.
      But for three months past philosophers have redoubled their
 efforts ; their curiosity has been excited, above all, by the last
 phænomcnon ; some have imagined they could distinguish in.
 it the bases of a new system of chemistry ; others, more pru
 dent, have suspended their judgment, or have endeavoured to
 refer the facts to the theories already known.      But, whatever
 might be their individual system, they ought all to have begun
 by a similar research — by trying to produce the two gases in
 separate quantities of water.
      If the two quantities of water are perfectly insulated, the
 gas does not appear : if they are made to communicate by a
  metallic wire, there is only a double production of gas ; that
  is to fay, each extremity of the intermediate wire acts in the
  portion of water in which it is immersed, as if the wire came
  immediately from the extremity of the pile opposed to that
  which communicates with that portion, so that each portion
  gives at the fame time two gases.
      But if sulphuric acid be interposed between the two quan
  tities of water, the gases manifest themselves each on its own
  side. The cafe is the fame if a communication be established
  between the water by the means of a living body, such as the
   hand. Thus, the production of each gas in the separate quan
   tities of water is completely proved.
       It is evident that there are only three possible ways of ex
   plaining these facts : either the galvanic action tends in each
   quantity of water to take away one of its constituent parts,
   leaving the other in excess ; or it decomposes the water, and,
   suffering one of the gases to be disengaged at the end of one
   of   the wires, conducts the other, in an; invisible manner, to
   the extremity of the other, to suffer it to be there disengaged ;
   or, in the last place, the water is not decomposed, but its com
    bination    wjth some principle pr other, emanating from the
                                                             positive

 positive side   of the pile,
                         produces oxygen gas, and with that
 emanating from the negative fide, hydrogen.
   The two first opinions have been advanced in the class by
 Monge, and the other in a memoir by Fourcroy ; the third
        to some foreigners, and particularly professor Richter
a belongs
of Jena.   It appears to be so much in contradiction with the
whole of the other chemical phænomena, that it would have_
been impossible to admit    even     it,
                                   the experiment in question

could not have been satisfactorily explained in another manner.

a  very ingenious explanation of the principal fact, multitude        a
of circumstances before unknown.              These authors admit the
existence of      a peculiar fluid which they call the galvanic,
and which circulates from the positive fide of the pile towards
the negative.      According to them, this fluid, on issuing from
the positive side, decomposes the water, and suffers the oxygen
to escape in bubbles          but
                                ;     combines with the hydrogen to
                                         it
form   a  liquid which traverses the water, or the sulphuric acid,
or the human body, in order to reach the extremity of the
negative wire, where the galvanism abandons its hydrogen,
and, in its turn, suffers        to escape in the form of gas, while
                                    it
it itself penetrates the wire.
    The following           the experiment
                           is                            by
                                                    which the authors
prove   that  such  is  the  secret progress  of  the phænomenon —         :
If well washed oxide of silver be interposed between the two
waters, the negative wire, near which the hydrogen gas ought
to manifest itself, produces no effervescence, and the oxide                   is
in   part reduced on the positive side           the reason of this, fay

takes  it  up to re-form water.
    C. Cuvier lately read in the Institute an interesting paper
pn fossil bones, from which the following                 an extract —

                                         is                 and there

scarcely    adistrict  in  Germany, Italy, France, England, Ire-'
land, and Spain, in which some or them have not been dug
up.     The fossil bones found on the banks of the Ohio have
been long known.           Some of them were found             Dombey by
in Peru, and the Spaniards brought                whole skeleton from

Such bones are discovered not only in the most modern strata,
but even in the middle of rocks. The fossil bones of some of
the mammalia are found in the neighbourhood of Paris in
prodigious banks of gypsum, which are covered with banks of
petrified sea-shells, 8pc.    It is an important observation, that
the older the mountainous strata in which such remains of
mammalia are found, the more different are the animals from
those of the present world.        I think 1 may almost with cer
tainty  affirm, that  all the  real  fossil bones which I have had
an opportunity of examining with accuracy, belonged to none
of those kinds of animals now existing on the globe. It                is.
only in regard to the teeth of ruminating animals that this,
assertion cannot be made with certainty.          By attentive exa
mination, and the assistance of my friends and predecessors,

 what may be hoped from the united researches of all natu
 ralists, when it is considered that these species of animals, now
 lost, were collected or determined    in the course of two years
 by   one  man,   who   employed  no other means for that purpose
 than his own zeal and the assistance of his friends. The
 most celebrated foreign naturalists, my colleagues in France,
 those in France as well as in foreign countries who possess
 cabinets, and the keepers of public collections, have all been
 so good as to assist me with their advice, and to communicate
 to me the facts which were known to them, By the degree
 of perfection to which my work has been brought, I flatter
 myself that I am entitled to the support of all the learned in
 Europe.      I am now in possession of mqre than 300 draw
 ings : 50 copper-plates are finissied, several others are begun,
 and I expect, before the work is publistied, to enrich it with
 important matter, which this notice may procure.

    In the sitting of April 20th, the following prize question,
 proposed by the Philosophical Class for j8oi, was again pro
 posed for 1803, as no satisfactory answer had been received :
    Are the azotic gases produced by so many means totally
unlike, and in so many different ways, perfectly the fame
in all their chemical properties and fundamental principle
 (simple azote) as that of the atmosphere ? And, Has the
nitrous acid the fame azote for its acidifying principle as the
azote    of the atmosphere ?
    The following have 'also    been  proposed   for the year 1803
by the same Ciass     :
    To determine, by chemical analysis as well as synthesis,
whether manganese be an essential component part of every
kind of steel ; and particularly of cast steel, prepared accord
ing to Clouet's method ?
    The Historical Class, at the fame time, proposed the fol
lowing question for 1802 :
    In what writings is any mention to be found of the Bava
rian history, from the origin of the Bavarian nation to the
15th century? who were the authors of them, and what are
their historical authority and importance ?
    Answers to the two questions of the Philosophical Class
must be transmitted, before the 1st of November 1801, to the
 secretary of the academy J. Kennedy.       The prize is the usual
 gold medal of the value of fifty ducats.

        .R. BOLTON, of Birmingham,
           such   a spark by   the
                                                 has succeeded in pro
                                    galvanic pile as to be able to ex
plode oy      its means   a  mixture   of oxygen and hydrogen gases*
His pile consisted of 1500 pairs of plates.
    Mr. Cruickfhank has also succeeded in exploding the same
ingredients by means of the galvanic spark.                He employs a
galvanic battery      of  his own    invention.    It consists of troughs
made of baked wood, with notches at short distances, sawri
in the sides opposite to each other, to receive pairs of square
metallic plates, zinc, and silver, soldered together, and intro
duced with cement composed of resin and wax.                  Three pairs
of    plates,    with the intervening cells, occupy about an inch
and    a  tenth of the trough, and the cells are so well secured
with cement that no water can pass from one to another.
One trough is about 26 inches in length,              vj inch deep, and
 1*5   inch    wide,  and   contains   60 pairs of  plates.    A galvanic
battery may be composed by connecting several of these
troughs together.         When the machine is employed, the in
terstices or cells between the plates are silled with water, with
 solutions of salts or alkalies, or with dilute acid : it gives
 strong shocks and sparks, visible in the day-time; and is
 found to be easily kept in order, and in constant action,
 when that is wished.
     C. Fourcroy has just published the following notice: —
 " Among the new facts with which the science of nature is
 daily enriched, none is so remarkable, or deserves mare the
 attention of philosophers, than that relating to the inflam
 mation of iron by galvanism. The apparatus for the expe
 riment, made at the French National Institute in the fittine
 of the first Class on the 10th of June, before the Count of
 Leghorn, consists of eight plates of zinc and eight plates of
 copper from 10 inches to y{ inches in diameter, and from a
 line and a half to two lines in thickness, placed upon each
  other, and separated two and two by pieces of cloth of the
  fame size, well moistened with a saturated solution of mu
  riate of ammonia.          The two pieces of metal at the extremi
  ties of this apparatus, the zinc and the copper, were made
  to communicate by means of two silver wires, at the extre
  mity of one of which was a bit of very fine iron wire rolled
  in a spiral form, the free point of which projected beyond the
  silver wire.      At the moment of contact, the iron becomes
  red, and emits very bright sparks.            Sometimes it inflames
                                                                      with

£4                         Galvanism-
with    a real deflagration in the atmospheric air.  This last
 effect always takes place in oxygen gas, and has a perfect re
semblance to the inflammation which iron experiences wheti
immersed in that gas after a piece of lighted tinder has beeri
attached   to it.
     "   In
          the air the wire often becomes red, fuses into glo
bules, is vaporized at the fame time that it emits bright
sparks, and the portion of the wire next to that which has
been fused becomes brittle like the oxide of that metal.   In
stead of forming the communication with wires, if the branches
of  a pair of scissars (pair de ciseaux) be employed, as is fre
quently done for trying the piles, there is excited at the ex
tremity of the one which touches the zincj a bright spark,
accompanied with a decrepitation.
   " The communicating wire when immersed in hydrogen
gas, and in carbonic gas, is also luminous; but it is only
redness or incandescence,    as the wire does not change colours
and still retains its ductility.    This incandescence is mani
fested when the exppriment is made under mercury with gas
and conductors very dry ; the effect therefore is not owing to
the water decomposed on the conducting wires, but to two
causes united.
   " The motion of the galvanic fluid reddens the iron ; and
the air, particularly the oxygen gas in which it is immersed,
inflames      and burns with decrepitation or deflagration. .
               it,
    " Small parcels of zinc placed on the last plate, and touched
by   a  brass wire communicating with the lower plate, are
 sometimes reduced to powder or into smoke at the moment
of contact, and very sensible decrepitation
                     a                           is then produced,
 but without inflammation. This phaenomenon           isnotso con
stant as the inflammation of the iron wire.
     "This inflammation does not take place, unless the plates
of copper and zinc be from 10 to      7 ^  inches, at the least, in
diameter.
    "    It most remarkable, that piles composed of these large
              is
plates give only feeble shocks, and effect only very slowly
 the decomposition of water; while      if  each of the plates be
 divided into four, and   if   these small plates be placed one
above the other, with pieces of cloth moistened with an am-
moniacal solution interposed between each pair, they produce
a  commotion four times as strong, and       a  much speedier de
 composition   of water,  without   exciting  an  inflammation of
 the air. Thus, the galvanic power which ignites metals rises
 in ratio different from that which decomposes water, and
     a
 excites muscular movements.
     " The first of these powers follows the size of the metallic
                                                            plates

             Singular Phenomenon—      Count Rumfofd.           55
plates piled on each other, and the second, the number ot
the plates, and their superposition : the first increases with
the size of the plates without increasing by their number;
the second increases with the number without sensibly in
creasing by the diameter of each of them, at least, so far as
has been tried.
    "  It is not proved that the galvanic effects are the fame as
those of electricity, notwithstanding the identity hitherto ad
mitted by very eminent philosophers between these two fluids.
It even appears that the more experiments and discoveries
are multiplied,    the more this pretended identity disappears,
or, at least, is weakened. The piles of large plates which in

sible electrometers, when the upper plate of zinc is taken
from the .lower plates by means of silk strings, as is done
with the electrophorus. We obtained nothing by applying
the electrometer of Sauffure.        We tried to produce, by a
strong electrical apparatus, the chemical effects produced by
galvanism ; viz. the solution of metallic oxides ; the preci
pitation of their solutions ; and the decomposition of acids j

                 A  SINGULAR PHÆNOMENON.
    A  very curious phænomenon was observed on the 24th of
May, after a storm, in the neighbourhood of Rastadt.             A
tub, which had been left in the open air during the rain*
having become filled with rain water, there were observed on
the surface of it a great many moleculæ, similar to sulphur in
a state of fusion, which made it be presumed that the water
must be strongly impregnated with sulphureous matter, and,
 consequently, be very inflammable.       On trial this was actu
 ally found to be the cafe : a stick immersed in it readily in
flamed when brought near a very weak fire.
    During this sulphureous rain, a heavy storm of hail ravaged
 a part of the fame country situated beyond the small rivers
 Kunsig and Schutter. The hail-stones were of the size of an egg.

                Chaptal      ; and on its Application    to the Arts.
   By R. O'Reilly, of the Academy of Bologna, Member
   of the Lycæum of the Arts, &c.
  A HE       art of bleaching is one of those connected with,
the   first ideas of civilization.     The theory on which it is
founded was entirely unknown to the antients ; but the
Egyptians were acquainted with the detersive quality of some
kinds of clay, and the effect produced by the atmosphere,
moisture, and light, on the stuffs exposed to their action.
   Health and cleanliness rendered it necessary to devise
quicker means than these ; and the property of soap and leys
of allies were therefore soon discovered.
   In the present age, the arts, following science with close
steps, have taken advantage of processes and detersive men
strua, the existence of which was before unknown : these
discoveries have succeeded each other with such rapidity, that
the last six years have effected a complete revolution in the
art of bleaching.
   This art divides itself very naturally into two quite distinct
branches, which we shall avoid confounding.             One of them
comprehends the bleaching of animal substances; the other,
that of vegetable matters.       We shall treat of these subject*
separately, as well as of the different menstrua aud detersive
substances generally employed.
                 Bleaching    of Animal   Subflances.
   The substances produced by the animal kingdom, which
are more particularly employed as vestments, differ essentially
from those of the vegetable kingdom.           It is on a knowledge
of the most striking traits, which form the line of demarca
tion between the two kingdoms, that the art of bleaching it
founded.
   Vegetables serve as nourishment to the animals and insect*
the spoils of which we employ. Animalized by their organs
they acquire other properties. Azote, in particular, seems
to be their most distinguishing character: it is scarcely found
in vegetable substances.       To this principle we may add the
existence    of sulphur and phosphorus, which form so many

  sources   for those pestilential exhalations with which the de
  composition of animal matters, by putrid fermentation, is
  always accompanied.
      The affinity of aggregation of these substances, or that law
  of adhesion which keeps their moleculæ together, is weaker
  than in the vegetable kingdom ; for this reason they are so
  easily dissolved and destroyed by acids and alkalies, and hence
  the readiness with which aeriform fluids are produced.
      The bleaching of animal substances requires the concur
  rence of alkalies, soap, ammonia, and sulphurous acid. We
  shall here confine ourselves to an examination of wool and
  silk, as the animal substances most generally employed, and
  which it is of importance that manufacturers should be ac
  quainted with the method of bleaching in the most cecono-
  mical and most expeditious manner.
                                  Of  Wool.
      Wool   is a kind of hair with which the bodies of several
  animals   are  covered.     It is composed of filaments or tubes
  filled with an oily or medullary substance. The fides of these
 tubes are perforated with a multitude of small pores, which
  communicate with the longitudinal tube. By chemical ana
 lysis wool gives, a great deal of oil and carbonate of ammonia:
  caustic alkaline leys destroy it entirely; and it is to the facility
 with which it dissolves in alkalies that we are indebted for the
  noble discovery, made by C. Chaptal, of the soap of wool.
 Wool experiences no change in boiling water : this observa
 tion is of great importance, in -regard to the art of which we
  are now treating; it alters very little when preserved in a
 place well aired; acids have very little a6tiononit; when
 exposed to a strong heat it enters into fusion.       All these facts
 united prove that wool is a semi-oleaginous substance.           The
 grease   with  which   it is  covered when  on the body  of the  ani
 mal, and from which it is freed by scouring, serves to con
  firm this assertion.
      An examination of these chemical facts is necessary for
 understanding the principles which ought to direct the artist
  in the bleaching of this substance.        The little action which
  acids have upon wool, and its unalterability in water, even
  when aided by caloric, render it necessary to have recourse
  to alkaline or saponaceous leys ; but its solubility in these
  salts shows that great prudence and caution must be em
  ployed.     In regard to acids, none have been hitherto used
  but tbe sulphurous acid obtained in the gaseous state by com-
•

                                                                     Of

                      Of   the Bleaching   of Wool.
     In     the preliminary operations to which wool is subjected,
it is     customary to leave a little of its grease to secure it from
 insects.     Wool is often freed from the grease by the farmers
 when they wish to sell it at a high price ; but in the subse
 quent manipulations it is greased or oiled before it is combed,
 spun, &c; and as this fat matter attracts dust, it dirties and
 thickens the stuffs.     The first kind of bleaching to which
 wool is subjected, is to free it from these impurities.       This
 operation is called scouring.      In manufactories it is gene
 rally performed by means of an ammoniacal ley, formed of
 five measures of river water and one of stale urine ; the wool
 is immersed for about twenty minutes in a bath of this mix
 ture heated to fifty-six degrees ; it is then taken out, suffered
 to drain, and then rinsed in running water: this manipula
 tion softens the wool, and gives it the first degree of white
 ness; it is repeated a second, and even a third time, after
 which the wool is fit to be employed.        In some places scour
ing is performed With water slightly impregnated with soap;
 and, indeed, for valuable articles this process is preferable,
 but it is too expensive for articles of less value.
     Fulling the'cloth adds still to the whiteness, and if a new
 degree be necessary it must be procured by the action of the
sulphurous acid ; that is to fay, of the fumes of sulphur in a
state of combustion, or that acid vapour condensed and com
bined with water.
     Sulphuring is generally performed in an arched or very
close chamber, constructed in such a manner that the arti
cles to be exposed to the action of the sulphur can be sus
pended on poles.      The chamber being filled, a certain quan
tity   of  sulphur is put in a state of combustion on flat dimes
having a large surface with very little depth : the entrance is
speedily shut, and all the interstices around the door are care
fully stopped to prevent the access of the atmospheric air.
The acid generated by the combultion of the sulphur pene
trates the stuffs, attacks the colouring matter, destroys     it,
                                                                and
effects the bleaching.     The stuffs are left in the sto\e some
time after the deflagration has ceased. This time varies from
fix to twenty-four hours. They are then taken out, and
made to pass through        slight washing with soap, to remove
                            a
the roughness they have acquired bv the action of the acid,
and to give them the necessary softness.
  £     simple description of this process shows how imperfect
it  is. At first the acid of the sulphur acts only on the fur-
faces, aud does not penetrate them.          This aerial immersion
                                 G   %                              is

ioo                 An EJsay   on   Bleaching.
is not sufficient ; the gas cannot introduce itself to a sufficient
depth into the stuffs, and the superficies only is whitened.
By taking advantage of the intimate knowledge which we
have of the nature of this acid, we have discovered a process
oiuch simpler, more ceconomical, and more agreeable to the
principles of science.
    The sulphurous acid, or that acid generated by the im
perfect combustion of sulphur, differs from the sulphuric acid
 (oil of vitriol) by its containing less of the acidifying prin
ciple, and by being, as we may fay, the mean term between
sulphur and the sulphuric acid. As we are desirous that our
work should be understood in manufactories, we shall speak
only very briefly of the chemical properties of the sulphurous
acid, and shall proceed to the method of preparing it.
    Sulphurous acid gas unites very easily with water, and in
this combination it may be employed for bleaching wool and
silk. The sulphurous acid in this state of liquidity may be
prepared by making it traverse water in an apparatus nearly
similar to that used for preparing oxygenated muriatic acid.
The most ceconomical method of obtaining it            is,
                                                        to decom-\
pose sulphuric acid (oil of vitriol)      by the mixture of any
combustible matter capable of taking from         it   part of its
                                                       a
oxygen. In exact experiments of the laboratory, where the
chemist        desirous of having great purity,
              is                                 it   obtained by
                                                      is
means of metallic substances, and particularly             by
                                                         mercury;
but for the purpose of. which we are treating, where great
oeconomy       isrequired, we would recommend the most com
mon substances.         We (hall therefore give the following
process   :
    Take chopped straw, or sawdust, and introduce           intoit   a   ,
matrass; pour over    it   sulphuric acid, applying at the same
time heat, and there will be disengaged sulphurous acid ga»
 (vapour of sulphur), which may be combined with water in
the following apparatus, and    by   the following method        :
    Place long necked matrasses on    a  furnace, and make them
communicate with    a    tubulated flask into which   little water
                                                       a
has been put to absorb the small portion of sulphuric acid
 (oil of vitriol) that may pass without being decomposed
through this first reservoir.      Care must be taken to apply
a  small safety-tube, one of the extremities of which must be
immersed some lines      in  the water, to guard against absorp
tion.    A tube with double bending conducts the acid into
                     a
flasks or other vessels, where it   must at length combine with
the water.
    We would propose using, instead of the tubulated flask,
a  cylinder of lead, or of sir, or any white wood, hooped with

varnished iron (to prevent rusting) of a pretty considerable
height, terminating at top with a Wolf's bottle, the bottom
of which must be taken out, and which is to be placed in a
collar formed in the leaden cylinder; care being taken to
cement it with a luting of wax to render it impermeable to
fluids.    This capital of glass will enable the operator to fee
the quantity of air bubbles disengaged from the surface of the
water, and thus to appreciate the progress of the saturation,
while the weight of this narrow and high column of water
prefling on the bubbles of sulphurous acid gas, in proportion
as it is disengaged from the extremity of the tube at the bot
tom of the cylinder, will facilitate its combination with the
water, and accelerate its solution in that fluid. That nothing
may be lost, two or three of these cylinders can be united in
the fame way as is done with a series of Wolf's bottles.                 A
cock adapted to the bottom of each cylinder will facilitate
the discharge into the immersing tubs.
   The apparatus which we would employ for the immersion
of woollen and silk stuffs in leys of sulphurous acid are per
fectly similar to that which we shall describe hereafter for
immersion in oxygenated muriatic acid, and which we have
constructed     according to the principles of Rupp *.              It was
by reasoning upon his apparatus with C. Widmer, of Jouy,
that we conceived the design of the present one, which ia
now making at the manufactory of Essone.                  Let us suppose
an oblong box, divided in the middle by a partition, and on
each side of it a large reel, on one of which the stuff is rolled
up : in each angle are placed rollers, over which the stuff is
conveyed before it passes the partition, and traverses a like
number of rollers, which conduct it to the other reel.                 The
object of this disposition is to cause the stuffs to pass through
the bleaching ley, and to expose to its action the greatest
surface possible.
   To turn these reels, an axis or column of glass passing
through a collar of leather is employed.               One of the extre
mities of this axis, which is square, is inserted into the axis
of the reel, while the other is adapted to a handle, which
gives it a rotary motion.       By this disposition there is no need
for employing any metallic substance internally. To prevent
the dispersion of the gas, the covering of this apparatus is fur
nished with a border which fits exactly into the box, and of
which an inch, at least, ought to be immersed into the de
tersive liquor.

pounds     of  wool ; the ley must be heated to the temperature
of 30 degrees: the old process, by me.ms of stale urine, al
ready mentioned, may he also employed. Urine is preferred,
because it holds in solution only a small quantity of salt in
capable of hurting the wool.              When the grease is dissolved,
and    the  wool    has Dcen perfectly rinsed, it is to be washed in
warm soapy water: this part of the scouring process is per
formed sometimes in the fulling-mill, sometimes with beat
ers, and sometimes by treacling in the tub. In all these cases
the stuffs must be freed from grease by repeated washings be
fore they are sulphured.         If a very bright whiteness be re
quired,     it will  be proper to expose them to heat a second,
 and even a third time, always in water a little soapy, made
with two ounces of that substance for each pound of wool.
 It will be better to repeat this operation, turning the stuff for
half an hour at each immersion with a stick, than to run the
risk, by too strong a ley, of injuring the quality of the wool.
 After the stuff has been carefully rinsed it is carried to the
 tubs to be immersed in liquid sulphurous acid, or sulphur
 water, as the workmen term it : the piece-> are rol'ed upon
 the reels, and are drawn through the sulphurous acid by turn
 ing them untii it is observed that the whiteness is sufficiently
 bright. They are then la,ken out, and left to drain on a bench
 covered with cloth, lest they mould be Rained in consequence
 of the decomposition of the wood by the sulphurous acid: they
 are next wastied in river water, and Spanish white is employed
 if it should be judged necessary. This operation is performed
 by pasting the pieces through a tub of clear water in which
 about eight pounds of Spanisti white have been diluted.             To
 obtain a fine whiteness, the stuffs, in general, are twice sul
  phured.      According to our process, one immersion and reel
 ing   for two   or three hours is sufficient.       Azuring or blueing
 is performed by throwing into the Spanish-white liquor a
  solu.ion of one part os Prussian blue to four hundred parts of
  water, shaking the cloth in the liquid and reeling it rapidly.
     The operation is terminated by a slight washing w'iih soap,
  to give softness and pliability to the stuffs.       The final opera
  tions of drving, stretching, pressing, &c. are foreign to the
  processes which are the object of this essay.
     Before venturing thus to recommend the use of the liquid
  sulphurous acid, we made a great many experiments on spun
  wool and woollen stuffs, and always with the most complete
  success.

   Silk is a diaphanous matter spun by a caterpillar, and
formed of a substance contained in its body, which becomes
hard in the air. This insect inhabits warm climates, being
indigenous in Asia : it was naturalized in Europe about the
time of the downfal of the Roman empire.

    To obtainthe complete bleaching of silk it is subjected to
several operations. The first tends to deprive it of the gum
and colouring matter which externally cover its filaments;
the second, to give it a juR degree of whiteness: sometimes
the scouring is several times repeated ; it is then baked,
blued, and lulphured.
     It is freed from the gum by a ley of soap and soft water, in
the proportion of from twenty-five to. thirty pounds of the
finest kind of soap for a hundred pounds of silk.                 The boiler
is then exposed to the action of the fire, and the heat is so
far kept down by a little cold ley, as to maintain, as uni
formly as possible, the temperature of about 90 degrees of
Fahrenheit.        The silk is turned, to expose all the parts of the
{kains to the action of the bath.              The stcains are then twisted
on the wringer to free them from the ley. They are put into
bags of coane cloth in packets of about twenty-five pounds.

when the silk is dry, it is then sulphured, and the bleaching
is complete.
     All these processes are exceedingly destructive : those which
I   am about to propose will make a total change in the me
 thod of bleaching silk. I have already mentioned the prize
granted by the Academy to Rigaud for scouring by means
of a slightly alkaline ley, and the success obtained by the
abbe Colomb in having succeeded to diflblve the varnish of
 silk by the action of boiling water at a very high tempera
 ture : these incontestable facts furnish more than the neces
 sary proofs of ihe goodness of our method.
     Take a solution of caustic soda, so weak as to mark only a
 fourth of a degree at most of the areometer for salts, and fill
 with it the boiler of the apparatus for bleaching with steam.
 Charge the frames with fkains of raw silk, and place them in
 the apparatus until it is full ; then close the door, and make
 the solution boil. Having continued the ebullition for twelve
 hours, slacken the sire, and open the door of the apparatus.
 The heat of the steam, which is always above 250 degrees,
 will have been sufficient to free the silk from the gum and to
 scour it.     Wash the fkains in warm water, and, having
 wrung them, place them again on the frames in the appa
 ratus, to undergo a lecond boiling.       Then wasti them several
 times in water, and immerse them in water somewhat soapy
  to give them a little softness.
     The last degree of bleaching is effected by making the
  fkains to pass through sulphurous acid, making use of the
  process and apparatus before recommended for bleaching
 wool, and which supplies here the place of sulphuring.         The
  incalculable advantage of this process in comparison of any
  other, consists chiefly in the possibility of following its opera
  tions progressively, and without running the risk of injuring
  the quality of the silk by too violent leys.
               Of the  Bleaching of Vegetable Matters.
      The characters and properties of vegetable substances are
  widely different from those we have described.         As organic
   matters, they contain oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon; but
   azote, which acts so important a part in the animal king
   dom, is rarely found in them, and much less phosphorus and
   sulphur.
      The substances found in the interior of plants are, like those
   observed in the interior of organized bodies, the result of ve
   getable secretion.    The nourishment of vegetables is derived
   Jrom the bosom of the earth; and this combination of prin
                                                               ciples

  lo6                 An EJst/y  on Bleaching.
 ciples, absorbed by the roots, with the juices assimilated in
 their vascular vessels, produces new compounds.
    The destruction of plants exhibits phænomena which have
 yery little resemblance to those exhibited by the dissolution
 of animal bodies; but the last result is always the natural
 destruction of the combination of their constituent principles,
 the union of hydrogen and oxygen forms water, ana the com
 bination of oxygen and carbon forms carbonic acid.           It is
 on these principles and modifications, applied to the treat
ment of vegetable matters, that the art of destroying colour
is founded; it is a decomposition begun and checked in
proper time, or the destruction of some principles in order to
preserve others.
    To bleach vegetable substances requires the concurrence of
 several menstrua or detersive substances ; such as soda, oxy
genated muriates, calcareous       sulphuret, and soap.     There
are several processes for depriving hemp, flax, and cotton, of
 their colour, which may be classed in the following order:
    ist, Bleaching in the open air, with the assistance of alkali
and soap.
    ad, Bleaching by water alone.
    3d, Bleaching by the oxygenated muriatic acid, substituted
for the action of the atmospheric air ; and this method is
divided into four distinct processes : the first consists in em
ploying the oxygenated muriatic acid alone; in the second,
potash is mixed with this acid to condense the gaseous vapour
and destroy its suffocating odour ; for the third, oxygenated
muriates dissolved in water are employed ; and in the fourth,
sulphuret of lime is united with this acid.
    4th, Bleaching by the steam of alkalino-caustic water,
where the air and solutions of oxygenated muriates coincide
alternately with the action of the steam.
                        Of Hemp   and Flax.
    If  hemp and flax be examined immediately after they are
pulled, we observe an union of fibres cemented together, which
form filaments ; these fibres are moistened by the sap, and
the stalks, formed of bundles of filaments, are enveloped in a
semi- ligneous substance, and covered with a very thin bark.
The sap of textile plants differs from those of ligneous plants;
it approaches near to extractive .matter ; it is neither sapona
ceous, nor resinous, nor aqueous, but it possesses something
of all these properties: it is soluble in water like the sap of
wood, it precipitates itself in flakes by the action of oxvgen.
ated muriatic acid, but these two kinds of sap are distinguished
                                                                by

by one very striking character: that of trees almost always
contains tanning principle, or gallic acid; that of textile
plants never possesses any. The sap, therefore, is nothing
else than real vegetable chyle; a nutritive juice, composed of
water, mucilage, and sugar, with some portions of carbon,
phosphorus, and lime.
    These preliminary observations are indispensably necessary
for comprehending the theory of the operations to which
hemp and flax are subjected.        Deprive these plants of their
sap  as soon as they  are pulled, decompose the extracto-muci-
laginous   matter,   which  occasions the aggregation of their
filaments, and you will have performed the first operation,
which is called watering.       The hemp or flax, tied up in
bundles, is immersed in stagnant or spring water, in which
the bundles are pressed down by means of stones.            Well
water and brackish water must be carefully avoided, as well
as that which flows over gypseous foil.       Such water accele
rates putrefaction, and hurts the quality of the hemp and
flax.   This is perfectly agreeable to the principles of che
mistry; it is thus that a little salt accelerates animal putre
faction, while a great deal tends to prevent it. The portion
of saline substances taken up by the water hastens corruption
by extending the putrid fermentation, which ought to ope
rate only on the juices, even to the filaments, which it
blackens and spoils.
    The fibres of flax are separated by letting them remain
in stagnant water until the mucilaginous membranes which
connect them are destroyed by putrefaction.       During its im
mersion their sap is decomposed and dissolved, theljark se
parates from the ligneous body, and the fibres are insulated.
Some days are sufficient for the process of watering.
    To ascertain the period of watering, which always varies
according to the kind of plants, the degree of their maturity,
and the nature of the sap, a handful of the flax is taken from
the pond, and broken and rubbed between the fingers: if
the stalks are siill green, but brittle, and break with the least
effort, the bundles must be taken out: a longer immersion
might extend the decomposition even to the fibrous texture.
The putrescence decomposes the water ; there is formed car
bonated hydrogen pestilentially foetid ; the fisties die, and the
air becomes infected.      In countries where a great deal of
hemp and flax are cultivated, there are laws which forbid
these substances from being watered in rivers and other
streams.
    The hemp and flax, when taken from the water, are spread
out on the grass to dry. During the fermentation and de

 composition which thence result, there is a speedy combina
 tion of oxygen and carbon.     Exposure on the grass facilitates
 the escape of the carbonic acid into the atmospheie.        The
 plants become of a whitish gray colour, which is called a

     It is known that a ley very slightly alkaline may be sub
 stituted with advantage for this long and noxious operation :
it is therefore certain that a chamber of from 20 to 30 feet
in length, into which the steam of alkalmo-caustic water of
the strength of one-fourth of a degree only is introduced, will
be sufficient to produce the fame effect as watering, on an
immense quantity of hemp and flax suspended on basket
work, in less time and with less expense than are required
for the different manipulations of watering.      The losses oc
casioned by the negligence of workmen, who, by suffering
the hemp and flax to macerate too long, give time to the
decomposition to reach the filaments, which renders them
brittle and occasions a considerable      waste,   will also be
avoided. In our process the artist can follow every moment
the progress of his operation, and stop it at the favourable
period.
     Hemp and flax, after being watered, must be dried in a
kiln or stove. A fibrous skeleton which exhibits a number
of small tubes, the inferior of which is composed of a fibrous
tissue, and the exterior of a ligneous, will then be obtained :
one of these must be preserved, and the other rejected.     This
is the object of the subsequent operations of beating, hec
kling, &c.
   The ligneous   tissne, or this bark, as the workmen call                           it,
is thrown away as useless, and        certain portion of the fibres

notwithstanding the care of the workmen during these dif
ferent manipulations.
   In the neighbourhood of mills, where the operations of
beating, heckling, &c. are performed,           have seen heaps of

object of this essay. The price of rags is already high enough,
besides their scarcity ; and Belgium, the ci-devant Britanny^
Auvergne, Alsace, &c. are every year covered with heaps of
this substance, which the paper-makers might procure at a
very low price, and which would afford a rich mine to be
worked by the industrious artist.
     Hempen and linen cloth, when they come from the hands
of the weaver, are charged with flour paste called dressing,
employed by the manufacturers to aid the tension of the
threads during the weaving:        some manufacturers immerse
their cloth in tubs, or expose them in running water, or boil
them, to free them from this substance.        These are bad me
thods, which betray absolute ignorance of the proper princi
 ples.   The best is to immerse the cloth from forty-eight to
 fifty hours in a tub filled with soft water, at the temperature
of from 60° to 750 : the kind of fermentation which ensues is
 sufficient to decompose the paste, and is never strong enough
 to attack the filaments of the thread : the cloth is then to be
 rinsed in running water, by the help of a fluted cylinder,
 which entirely frees it from that amylaceous substance.
     This operation gives to cloth a first degree of bleaching,
 which arises merely from the destruction of a part of the
 colouring matter during the fermentation, which opens the
 threads of the cloth, slackens and softens their tissue, and
 swells their fibres: it may be seen that it has reached its
 proper term by observing all these phænomena, and when
 the colour of the cloth is uniform throughout.
     After the cloth has been completely rinsed in running water
 with the cylinder, it remains of a grayish white colour : the
 tint which opposes its perfect whiteness arises from extracto-
 resinous matter which remains combined with the filaments,
 and from which they must be freed.          This is the operation
 properly called bleaching, whatever may be the operation
 employed for accomplishing it. These different processes will
 be described in the course of this work.
            Os the colouring Matter os Hemp and Flax.
     Before we proceed to   a description of the different processes
 for bleaching, it is of importance that we should lay a few
 words respecting the colouring matter of flax. This subject
  has been fully treated of by the celebrated Kirwan, from
  whose experiments it is abundantly proved that the colouring
  matter extracted by the action of alkalies is a peculiar resin,
  which differs from pure resin by being insoluble in essential
  oils, and in having some resemblance to lacks.            Having
  procured some of this substance, by separating it from what
                                                                 the

the workmen call dead ley, by saturating the alkali with
acids, and in that manner obtaining it in the form of a
greenisli precipitate, which he carefully washed, he made
the following experiments to determine the action of alkalies
upon it :
   Eight grains of it were digested in a solution of crystallized
                                          °
soda saturated at the temperature of 60 of Fahrenheit : the
solution instantly assumed a dark brown colour.       Two mea
sures of this solution, weighing each 375 grains, were not
entirely dissolved by this substance ; but two measures of a
solution of potash dissolved the whole of it.
   One measure of caustic soda, the specific gravity of which
was 1*053, dissolved almost the whole of             it,
                                                  leaving only a
white residuum.
   One measure of caustic potasli, the specific gravity of which
was 1*030, dissolved the whole of it.
   One measure of an alkaline sulphuret, the specific gravity
of which was 1*170, dissolved the whole matter.
   One measure of ammonia dissolved also          portion of this
                                                     a
substance.                                                     1
    Though these experiments were sufficient to satisfy Kir-
wan's doubts, he thought       itnecessary to repeat them with
the saline substances usually employed in bleaching as well
as with soap.
    He dissolved, therefore, an ounce of common soda, and as
much Dantzic potasli, each in fix ounces of distilled water    :
eight grains of the green matter were put into        measure of
                                                           a
an ounce of each solution, and then digested for three hours
and   a half in    heat equal to 1800 of Fahr.
                    a                             The dissolving
power of the Dantzic potasli was superior to that of the soda;
for, an ounce of the solution of soda was still required, and
half an ounce only of the solution of potash, to dissolve the
whole of the substance.
    An ounce of white soap was dissolved in 18 ounces of di
stilled water.   The solution was turbid, and       could not be
                                                         it

                                            it
ebullition, and then the operation was difficult; for when
the liquor,    bychance, began to boil,     was thrown to the
                                             it
distance of more than three feet from the matrass.        Three
ounces of this solution were required to dissolve eight grains
of the colouring matter.
    In order to compare the respective strength of these solu
tions,    must be observed, that an ounce of the soda of the
          it
shops contains only 114 grains of pure soda: suppose the
solution to have been made in fix ounces of water, each
ounce of water will contain 19 grains of pure alkali, while

   1 he detersive force of lime was tried without success ; three
ounces of water, saturated with lime, produced scarcely any
effect on the colouring matter: these three ounces contain
at most three grains of pure lime.

tion of the furnace, which is a sand bath, and contains three
flasks (as may be seen in the horizontal section fig. 2). Each
flask is furnished with a bent tube a, for pouring in the sul
phuric acid ; and from it the liberated gas passes by the tube b
into the receiver B, which is made of lead.                     This receiver
has five necks (vide fig. 2.) : three of them receive the tubes
connected with the three flasks, one receives a safety-tube c,
intended to prevent absorption, and the 5th the bent tube d,
which connects it with the series of tall Wolfs C, D, 8cc.
    Fig. 3. shows the way in which it is proposed to alter Mr.
Rupp's apparatus. The stuff is made to pass over rollers in the
corners, 8cc. of the box in going from one reel to another,
and the axes come through leather collars in the fide instead of
the top of the box. The engraving represents a vertical section.

the action of the vapour. At the corner a, the uncondensed
vapour can pass into the worm-tub D to be condensed, and
returned to the boiler by the tube be. Or it may be received
into the tub E by shutting the cock at c, and opening the
Cock «.      The opening into the chamber, i.e. the door, is
on the top, and (huts air-tight. With this apparatus, vapour
or steam of any kind may be employed for the purpose of
bleaching.

   *  For this method of applying ammonia to the purposes of bleaching,
the world is indebted to Mr. Crooks, of Edinburgh, who, a considerable
time   ago, took out a patent for it for England.          The same gentleman
having, along with Mr. Turnbull, improved the process, and extended the
principle Co the use of fixed alkalies ailo, assisted by the action of the lleara
of boiling water, patents have since been t.iken out in their joint names for
England, Scotland, and Ireland.         Of this invention we gave an account
in our ninth volume. — Edit.

  V>/NE of       my friends, Don Antonio Hernandez del Valle,
 secretary to the consulship    of the Havannah, wrote to me in
  the year 1795, during his residence at Cadiz, before he em
  barked, to request some information respecting the best me
  thod of preserving lemon juice during long voyages; a pro
  cess in which no one had ever yet properly succeeded.          As
  his acquaintance with chemistry inspired him with a design
  to make experiments on this subject, he desired me to make
 some researches, that he might compare them with those he
  proposed to undertake in regard to this acid as soon as he
  should reach the place of his destination.
'
     What I am going to fay on the subject will make no ad
 dition to our knowledge on the nature of the acid of lemon-
juice, since the indefatigable Scheele has left nothing to be
  wished for on this subject ; I only intend to reduce to fixed
 data his formula for the extraction of this 3cid, and to ascer
  tain whether the substances which oppose its preservation are
 of such a nature as to be capable of being separated by meana
 that depend less on the art of our laboratories.
     The lemon juice I employed had been clarified by filtra
 tion ; and it had been kept for a year in a cellar, covered with
a little oil, according to the usual method of the shops.
     I. Spirit of wine mixed with this juice in a pretty large
quantity, did not render it turbid even after being kept 24
hours.
     Having evaporated about three pounds of             in gentle

heat, to the consistence of syrup,         observed, as Scheele had
                                                I
done, that the citric acid announced no disposition to crys
tallize even when carried           evaporation nearly to the con
                                       by
sistence of extract.     The reason or this, no doubt, was, that
this acid, which     isvery crystallizable, requires, however, but
little water for its crystallization.
    Lemon juice,      byevaporation, assumes the colour and dis
agreeable odour of the extract of plants; when redissolved in
water,    it reproduces    ajuice of taste which still participates
                                            a
of that of extracts. In word, evaporation, which gives no
                               a
hope of the possibility of separating the principles which alter
is, it,
     adds to    the inconvenience common to all extracts, which
               it
     that their solution in water never brings back the juice to
that taste which       before had in the plants.

served. I observed nothing of this kind ; nor was I surprised
on that account, as mucilage and extractive matter are not of
a nature to be separated by such means. The latter, in parti
cular, is not among the number of those which, forming a
pellicle, abandon their solvent in consequence of the insolu
bility they acquire by becoming saturated with oxygen.
Lemon juice thus prepared will Keep well, no doubt; but
where ? In our cellars, and not in the hold of a ship proceed
ing towards the equinoctial.
    It is Customary, as I have been informed by Don Her
nandez, to boil the lemon juice pretty strongly before it is
       on board; but, besides the burnt smell          contracts,     it             it
     f>ut

         Dr. Brugnatelli announces that lemon juice diluted
in spirit of wine frees itself in the course of few days from        a
part of its mucilaginous matter; and he adds, that, after the
alcohol   has been separated                     by
                                  distillation, the acid     ob             is

     follows from this review, that, except the formula of
Scheele, no method has yet been found of separating the
mucilage and extractive substance of lemons, and that we

an effervescence was produced. When this point was ob

certain that the earth was completely saturated.          For this
process 94 ounces were required.

employed in the washing was evaporated to -certain point,   a

were obtained altogether 60 drams and      half of this citric salt.

    VI. As the citric acid,    by
                                uniting with the chalk, expelled
the carbonic acid, the question now        to know the amount
                                                is
of the latter, in order to ascertain the quantity of the citric
acid which replaced it.

    A  hundred parts, converted into lime         calcination,  by

solved     nitric acid, lost only from 40 to 41 of carbonic

acid.   Consequently, there    about three per cent, of water
                                  is
in this earth.   The nitric acid separated also about three of
argil slightly ferruginous.  The quintal of chalk may then
furnish the following result   :

    It is now evident that the earthy base furnished to 60I of
citrate by 3a drams of chalk, was 17^ drams of lime, or x8y
including the argil.
    It is also evident that the citric acid, which assumed the
place of the 12J drams of carbonic acid, amounted to 41^.
drams.        If
               to these 58^ drams of pure citrate, 2 drams of
water and argil be added, we shall have for the whole product
6o|- drams.
   From these proportions it will be found by calculation
that it must contain about 30^ of lime, mixed with a little
argil, in a quintal of citrate; but, having calcined a hundred
parts of this citrate, it left 31 \ of lime, a proportion very near
to the former; and if we deduct from this lime about i± of
argil, we shall have in the quintal of citrate,
                Lime        -     -      30 1
                 Citric acid      -      70              J
But the real quantity of acid will be less by all the water with
which it may he united in the citrate. This, however, I did
not examine.
    The citrate of chalk, as Scheele has remarked^ is very
little soluble in water, and the solution has no striking favour.
It is not rendered turbid by spirit of wine, and it produces
no change either on turnsole paper or on the solution of sul
phate or potash.    The fluoric, phosphoric, and boracic acids
make no impression upon it ; but the oxalate of potash and
the oxalic acid precipitate from it the lime.
    The extractive ley contains, besides mucilage and extract,
malate of lime, which spirit of wine immediately precipitates
from  it,
        if     has been concentrated
              it                                 by

of this ley has the colour, smell, and savour, common to the
extracts of plants.   If has been concentrated only to the
                                  it

 Il6                  Researches respecting the
 bat weak, makes its appearance, which shows that the astrin
 gent principle is only in small quantity.
    The citrate of lime kept under water, exposed to the sun
 during the heat of summer, becomes putrid, and the water
 is covered with a stony crust, which is carbonate of lime.
 The citric acid, like the other vegetable acids, is destroyed
 by putrefaction.     Its carbonaceous part united to the oxygen
 of the vvater, which is decomposed, and thus transformed
 into acid, reproduces chalk: this putrefaction is always ac
 companied with an escape of bubbles, which are only car
 bonaceous hydrogen.
VII.    Decomposition   of (be Citrate of Lime  by Sulphuric Acid,
    To  expel the carbonic acid completely from 4 ounces of
 chalk, it  was necessary to employ 20 ounces of diluted sul
phuric acid (of 19 degrees of Bautne's areometer). This
 acid is made by mixing three parts of water with one of com
mon oil of vitriol : if the latter is not well concentrated, the
water must be diminished, and, by some trials, the diluted
acid may be brought to the required point.
    To separate the citric acid united to a base of four ounces
of chalk, it is evident that the above quantity of sulphuric
acid must be sufficient. This quantity, therefore, amounts
to five limes the weight of the citrate, or 500 per cent, of
this earthy salt.
    I heated to ebullition six ounces of citrate with two pounds
of water, and added 30 ounces of my sulphuric acid of iq°i
aster being exposed to ebullition about seven minutes, taking
care to stir the mixture with a spatula, the whole citrate wa*
found changed into a calcareous sulphate.            The mixture
being then strained through filtering paper, and left to evapo
rate, deposited sulphate ; and four succelfivc evaporations and
filiations were necctlary to free it entirely from its eartby
deposits.
    The separation of this sulphate may be abridged by mixing
the liquor, evaporated to the consistence of bright syrup, with
a certain quantity of spirit of wine ; and this is even the pro
cess which ought to be followed on all occasions when it is
required, without having a very large quantity of citric acid,
to obtain it as pure as possible.
    The consistence of bright syrup is not, however, the point
at which the citric acid can crystallize, it must be carried to
that of baked syrup, because this acid takes up very little
water in its crystals.    By two crystallizations I obtained 3J-
ounces, or 28 drains, of pretty large crystals. The two drams-
                                                          wanting

 wanting to complete the thirty, which, according to the pro
portion uefore established, ought to be produced by six ounces
 of citrate, remained in the mother water. But, as it ap
peared to me that there could not be more than half a dram
in this residuum, it is evident that the citric acid will be, as
I have before indicated, from two to three below 70 per cent.
    VIII. Though the citrate of lime be white and well washed,
it always retains fixed in it a little extractive matter, the co-
louf of which is found again, after its decomposition, in the
liquors.    It thence happens that it is difficult to obtain the
crystals  white  without two new crystallizations at least. The
citrate of lime, in this respect, exhibits the fame phænomena
as the other earths and earthy salts, which readily adhere and
fix themselves to the colouring parts.            The citrate, which,
may    be separated  from  the    juice  of verjuice by chalk,      in                is,

      follows, from these researches, that mucilage and ex
     It
tractive matter, as Schcele discovered, are the corruptible or
fermentable principles of the lemon juice and as none of            ;
the recipes proposed for its concentration are capable of de
priving   itof these principles,        necessary to have recourse
                                               it   is
to the method of that author.           This method will be very
practicable on      large scale, but
                    a                  will require basons of silver

the laboratory earthen vessels varnished with lead, but not
stone ware, because the lead which enters into their coating
is    far vitrified as to be proof against any attack.
     so                                                   One can
hardly believe that the syrup of lemons commonly fold in the
shops does not contain oxide of lead.         Hepatic water gives
to these syrups        dark
                        a    brown   colour.   This    sufficient to    is

   Let us now consider separatelyeach of the principles of
our lemon juice in regard to fermentation.
   Strictly speaking, none of them           capable separately of

mixed with saccharine juices, such as that of grapes, apples,
cherries, elder berries, &c. they pass very well to a new

 already seen, form an obstacle to its crystallization, it might
 not be possible to complete its purification either by concen
 tration alone, or by the aid of a little spirit of wine ? Experi
 ments of this kind ought to be undertaken in a warm coun
 try, and on a somewhat large scale, if it be required to obtain
 more certain results than those which I was able to obtain in
 Castille.
     As the citric acid, when crystallized, possesses a very active
 acidity, it appeared to me of importance to compare lemonade
 made with these crystals with that made by using the fresh
juice. I therefore first took the juice of a lemon, and- endea
 voured, by repeated trial, to dilcover what quantity of it in
 weight it would require to make a large glass of lemonade
 well seasoned with sugar.        The quantity requisite was about
 fight or nine drams.
     We have already se$n that an ounce of juice employed for
 experiments contained about 34 grains of citric acid, with a
 small portion of malic acid.        I therefore made a glass of le
 monade, of the like size, with the fame dose of sugar and
  54 grains of citric acid.     The lemonade was of such a nature
 that those called in to compare them could find no differ
 ence, except that there was something more agreeable in the
 latter than in the former.        At first they could not. tell in
 what this difference confided ; but each of those present
 having tasted them several times, it was at length agreed that
 the first lemonade has a flight harshness not observed in the
 Jemonade made from the citric acid.
     This   difference   was ascribed, and very properly, to the
  small   quantity of astringent principle in the lemon juice.
 The addition, indeed, ot some drops of iron in fresh lemon
juice, saturated afterwards by potalh, made it assume that
 vinous colour which is observed in old lemon juice.
     It is to the astringent part of the lemons, without doubt,
 that we must ascribe that contraction of the abdomen which
 people very often experience after drinking lemonade. Hence
 it follows, that in diseases where this contraction is to be
 apprehended, lemonade made with citric acid ought to be
 preferred.
     I shall conclude this memoir with the means of preventing
 an accident which may take place in the process followed
 in regard to the citric acid.
     If  more sulphuric acid than is necessary to saturate the
  base of the citrate has been employed, when this acid has
  concentrated itself by evaporation, it will react on the citric
  acid, and proceed so far as to separate some carbonaceous
  principles   ; the mixture, becoming blacker and blacker, will
                                  H4                          refuse

refuse    to give crystals.         This excess may be remedied by
throwing      a  little  chalk    into  the mixture, after being heated,
and then filtrating it to separate the sulphate of lime which
has been formed.            With a little practice it will be easy to
 six the point at which the sulphuric acid is nearly saturated,
in order that the citric acid may not be neutralized also.
     XX.     Conjectures     re/peeling   the Origin of     the American
                                    Nations *.
 WHETHER                      America, called also the West Indies
 and the New World, was known* to the antients, is a ques
tion which, after long being an object of research, has never
yet been decided.            The Egyptian priests, as we are told by
 Plato, gave an account to Solon, the Athenian legislator, of
 a certain island called Atlantis, which was situated at the
 distance of a few days fail from Spain beyond the strait of
 Gibraltar. This island, according to the information given
by these priests, was greater than Libya and all Asia, pro-
         so called, taken together;            and so powerful, that it
 Eerly
    ad reduced under its dominion all Libya as far as the
 Tuscan sea, till it was at length swallowed up by a flood and
 violent earthquake, which continued twenty-four hours.
 Diodorus Siculus also speaks of a large island to which the
 Phœnicians were driven while cruizing along the, eastern
 coast of the Atlantic.            He fays also that the Tuscans, who
 at that time were powerful at sea, were desirous of sending
 thither a colony, but were prevented by the Carthaginians,
 who wished to preserve this island to themselves as a place of
 refuge in cafe of necessity, and for that reason endeavoured
 to conceal it from the whole world.
      Had the large Atlantic island been mentioned by no other
 ¦writer besides l'lato, the whole account might have been con
 sidered as a fabrication or an allegory ; but the testimony of
 Solon, or at least of the Egyptian priests, gives it a certain
 air of authenticity.          In regard to Diodorus Siculus, his in-

 specting the author professor Pallas adds the following note : — I have
 thought it necessary to publiih this almost forgotten and not unimportant
 essay of the late professor H. Fischer, of the Petcrstrargh Academy, which
 was first made known in the St. Petetsburgh Historical Calendar, because
 it has been misapplied by a writer, who bas been guilty of other plagia
 risms from his works, without mentioning the real author, to whom lie has
 b"cen indebted for many of the observations he has given out as his own.
 It is hardly necessary to fay, that this paper of professor Fischer, which was
 first published in 1771, forms the foundation of Scheercr's work on the
 1 copiing of America, published in the French language.
                                                                   forma tionx

               Origin of the American Nations.                   iai
formation, as mentioned in his work, was taken merely from
tradition or fabulous relations, which will not bear critical
examination.       But even though this account were true, the
island of Diodorus might be considered as one of the Canary
islands, or perhaps Ireland or Britain, as the ship is laid to
have been driven thither by a storm.
     It is not, however, our intention to dwell on this subject,
as our object is to examine at what time and from what place
the Americans were conveyed to that country which they
now inhabit.       In the first place, then, one of the three fol
lowing positions must be admitted as true: The Americans
are aborigines, that  is,  original inhabitants who have always
been in possession of the country; or they have emigrated
thither from some other part of the globe; or they have
served to people our old world with their colonies.          Were
we not assured of the contrary by the Scripture, the first and
last of these positions might be defended as well as the second.
 Among the Pagan philosophers, the dispute respecting the
 creation or eternity of the world was never decided         ; and
 many of the nations of antiquity, such, for example, as the
 Athenians, boasted of being descended from no other people.
  In regard to the third position, the Mexicans actually be
 lieved that the Spanish kings were descended from their first
 sovereign Quezalkoal, and consequently they had made them
 selves masters of Spain several hundred years before the dis
 covery of America.        This, however, does not agree with
 what  is    recorded in history; and the Mexicans,     in this re
 spect, were dupes to the fame vanity as many other nations,
 who pretend that all the sciences, knowledge, inventions,
  and political institutionsin    the world were transmitted by
  them to the rest of mankind.         To give only one instance,
  many of the learned in Europe have imagined that Pytha
  goras communicated his idea of the transmigration of the
  loul, and the Egyptians their political constitution, to the
  Indians; though Pythagoras and all the other Greek philo
  sophers derived their wisdom from the Indians, and          by no
  means communicated theirs to them. Whether the Indians
  had their learning and political knowledge from the Egyp
  tians, or the latter from the former,     is
                                            a     question which
  many of the moderns think scarcely worthy of an answer               ;
   because they have read accounts given       inGreek works, or
   the accounts of the Roman authors collected from the Greek
   writers, who pretend that the Egyptians were in every thing
   the predecessors and instructors of the Indians.
  I     have mentioned the first and third position, not because
I    consider them as true, but only to show that, however false
                                           '                      an

 123                  ConjeElures   rcfpeBing the
   an opinion may be, it will still find defenders : the second
  position, therefore, alone remains to be examined, viz. that
  the Americans were transplanted to their present country
  from some other part of the world.
     Not only the divine revelation, by which we are expressly
  taught that the first men originated in Asia, but the natural
  indolence, dulness, and want of all the arts and sciences
 among the Indians — compared with the genius, liveliness,
  and industry, of the nations in other parts of the world,
 leave no doubt that the Americans never went out of their
  own country to a foreign one ; and, on the contrary, that
 foreign nations visited them.    But what nations, and how ?
 Was it on purpose, or by accident ? These are difficult
 questions, the solution of which would require more than
 common knowledge of the languages in every part of the
 world; of the features of the natives, and their religion,
 manners, customs, and usages.       It is not requisite, however,
 that one should be acquainted with all the languages in the
 four quarters of the globe ; it would be sufficient, at first, that
 one mould be able to compare the languages on the western
 coast of Africa with those of the different countries of
 America, such as Brazil, &c.          But, though this would
 require great labour, it is not impossible that a vocabulary
 containing some hundred words in all the known languages
 of the world might be collected.          Condamme coincides
 with my opinion when he fays, that this, perhaps, is the
only method of discovering the real origin of the Americans.
 Such a vocabulary would be much fitter for the purpose than
 the Lord's prayer, which has been translated into the lan
guages of so many savage nations ; for, as the savages have
sew or no words expressive of moral or metaphysical things,
how can this prayer be properly translated into their lan
guages ? Besides, in learning any thing, people ought always
to begin with the easiest part, and to conclude with the most
difficult ; but here the order prescribed by nature is reversed.
    In regard to such a vocabulary,       if,
                                            among some hundred
words,  a   few should be found similar both in found and             sig
nification to one of some other language, one ought not
thence to conclude that these two languages were the fame.
Who, for example, will fay that the Latin and Greenlandic
lancs'.iages have an affinifv, because the Greenlandic word
ignacb has the fame meaning as the Latin word ignis, fire*              ?
                                                                      On
  *   The fame thing might be said of the Shanscrit, which contains     a
great miny words that both in sound and in meaning have       a simila
rity to the Latin. For example, dtndbv, dens, tooth juga, jugunVa
                                                a    ;
yoke; junfla, junctus, juncta, junctum, joined nan, navis,

                  Origin of         the    American Nations.                 123
On the other hand,     there are people who, though they find
manv words in the languages of two nations which have
considerable similarity and the fame signification, will not
acknowledge the similitude.       These, however, are in the
wrong, because they do not take into consideration the way
in which different nations pronounce their words, either by
shortening or contracting them ; and do not reflect that every
nation has in its alphabet peculiar characters which others
have not, and which they cannot pronounce; from which
there must naturally follow a perceptible variation in the sound
of two words of the fame meaning.
    Such a general collection of words might require, perhaps,
one or more centuries ; and if no other way can be found for
discovering the origin of the Americans, our researches by this
method will, in all probability, prove fruitless; for history, or
rather tradition, affords us no light in this respect, and, in my
opinion, historians have never given themselves much trouble
 respecting it.   There is however another method of attaining
 to the proposed end; that                  is,    by
                                         comparing the manners,
 customs, and mode of life among the Americans, with the
 manners and customs of other nations.                 indeed true,
                                                               It   is
that two nations very remote from each other may have a.
 great similarity in their manners, customs, Sec. without being
 sprung from the same stock          but when singular praeiiees,
                                             ;
 which appear to be contrary to nature, are found among dif
 ferent nations, they must either have been invented there, or
 been borrowed from others.          The first cafe seems not very
 probable,    for it can  hardly  be comprehended how such sin
 gular  ideas  could  have  arisen  among individuals, and much
 more among different nations;              therefore probable that
                                                   it   is
 these people have communicated their singular manners and
 customs to each other by their common intercourse.
    We shall therefore examine the origin of the Americans
 on these principles, and consider, as briefly as possible, their
 Angular mode of life, together with the most remarkable of
 their manners and customs,         far as they coincide with those
                                            so
 of the old world.
                 1   .   Singular Form             of   Government.
  In the East Indies, the Samorin, that   the sovereign of    is,
the kingdom of Calicut, was succeeded not    his own son            by
but    by
        the son of his sister. This manner of succession                           is
common also in all the states of Malabar.  The princes do

  not marry princesses, but the daughters of nairs; and there,
  fore their children are not princes, but nairs. The princesses
  are generally given in marriage to bramins : all the children
 produced by such marriages are princes, and capable of sue-,
 ceeding to the throne.       This princely race forms the royal
 family, which takes the precedency of all the- rest. After the
 king's death, the oldest prince always succeeds him in the
 government.       By this method, no disputes arise in regard to
 the succession, and young sovereigns are never seen.        In all
 the countries inhabited by negroes, from Senegal to the Rio
 Volta, the king is always chosen from the royal family ; but
 his children are uniformly excluded fropi the succession, which
 in all cases goes to the female branch.                          »
     In America, and the island of Hayti, now called St. Do
 mingo, the principalities were hereditary; but when the
 cacic died without heirs, his possessions devolved to his sisters'
 children, to the exclusion of the brothers' children.
     On the death of the chief of the Iroquese, his dignities al
 ways fall to the children of his mother's sister.
     These customs are followed also by the Hurons, the Natches^
and the Indians on the Mississippi.        They say that one can
depend with more certainty on the sister's son being of the
royal blood, than on the king's son, or the son of his brother.
                      2.  Interring the Dead,
    We find instances both in antient and modern history of
wives and slaves being interred along with the body of a
deceased prince or great man.         Herodotus, speaking of the
Scythians on the Borysthenes (Dnieper), fays, that on the
death of their king, one of his concubines, his cup-bearer,
cook, purveyor, valet, &c. together with horses and golden
cups, were interred along with him. We are told the fame
thing by Lucian.       The Romans, at the funerals of great
men, sacrificed a number of prisoners, who were obliged to
fight in single combat till none of them remained.         Cæsar
relates, that among the Gauls, the Soldurii (hared with their
patrons in all the conveniences of life and the bitterness of
death. In another place he fays, that the custom of burning
the servants and dearest clients of great men at their funerals,
together with other things, had ceased not long before that
period.    The antient Danes, to show their respect for the
dead, caused wives to be buried alive with their husbands.
We are assured by Dalin the historian, that the fame practice
prevailed also in old Sweden.          We are informed by De
Guignes that it was customary among the Honi-Re, aTurkish
nation, to inter with their husbands those wives who had
                                                         brought

                 Origin of the American Nations.               1 25
brought them no children ; and even at present, the women
in   the East Indies sometimes bum themselves along with
their deceased husbands. Marco Polo relates, that, when
the chan of the great Moguls was conveyed to the plare of
interment, all thole who met the procession on the road were
put to death, in order that they might serve the great chan in
the other world.      In the barrows, which were the burying-
places of the old Moguls, there are found sometimes around
the body, lying in the middle of them, other bodies, which
probably were put to death at the funeral. It was customary
 among the Jakuts, whose ancestors served in the armies of the
Mogul chans before they were subjected to the Russian go
vernment, that one of the favourite domestics of the deceased
 should burn himself, with every mark of joy, in a particular
 fire made for the purpose, that he might serve his master in
 the other world.     This practice must have been customary,
 also, among the Mantchew Tartars ; for Duhalde fays, that
 Schnu-tehi, the founder of the family now on the throne of
 China, after he had lost his son and princess, required that
 thirty persons should expose themselves to voluntary death in
 order to appease the souls of the deceased; and that Cham-hi,
 his successor, had taken a great deal of pains to abolish this
 custom. Among the Afgans, a piratical people on the bor
 ders of Persia, and the inhabitants of the Philippine islands,
 a similar custom prevailed.      At the interment of the kings of
 Whidah and Benin, a great many persons of both sexes are
 thrown into the grave alive. These kingdoms lie on the
 western coast of Africa, which of all countries in the old
 world are nearest to the eastern coast of America.
     In the island of Hayti, at the interment of the cacic, many
  persons of both sexes, but in particular some of his wives,
  were buried alive with him ; and they often contended among
  themselves for having this honour.
     The Caribs still put to death their slaves on the decease of
  their masters.    This detestable custom was conveyed from
  these islanders lo the Mexicans and Peruvians, and even to
  the Natches on the Mississippi.
      3. Cutting off the Hair as a Mark of deep Mourning.
     This was a very old custom among the heathens, which
  God, through Moses, forbade the children of Israel to imi
  tate.    At first, the hair of dying persons was cut off,
  for it was supposed that their souls would otherwise not be
  received into the kingdom of Pluto.          Of this we have two
  celebrated examples in Alcestes and Dido.        In the course of
  time the  relations  also cut off their hair as mark of sorrow.
                                                 a
                                                                The

 Ii6                  Conjefiures respecting      the
 The Scythians on the Borysthenes, according             to the testimony
 of Herodotus,   cropped    their  hair    on   the   interment    of their
kings.    This  offering to  the  dead  is  often   mentioned      both by
 the Greek and Latin poets ; for such is the name given by
 Ovid to this ceremony, when he fays that Hecuba left her
 tears, together with her gray hairs, on the grave of her son
Hector, as an offering to the dead. Petronius, speaking of
the well-known matron of Ephesus, fays that she placed the
hair torn from her head on the breast of her deceased hus
band.     Busbek, ambassador from Ferdinand king of Hun
gary to Soliman the Turkish sultan, says, that tufts of
human hair are found on the graves of most of the Servians,'
as a mark of the sorrow of the relations for the loss of the
deceased.    Though the Servians are not now heathens, but
Christians^   and, consequently, these tufts of hair can nd
longer be considered as an offering to the dead ; yet constant
experience shows, that in all the changes of religion which
take place among nations, some remains of the old religion
are always retained.
    Instances of this practice may be found even in modern
times.    In the year 1716, one of the Chinese embassy, hav
ing died at Samarow-jam, a small town at the mouth of the
river Irtish, his oldest domestic cut off a lock of hair from
his head, and threw it into the funeral pile as an offering to
the deceased.    The mataram, supreme prince of the island
of Java, when he caused his rebellious brother to be interred
with great funeral pomp, as a token of his grief cut off his
hair.    The Caribs in the Antilles crop their hair when in
mourning, and the women cut it off entirely.                  The women
in Virginia strew their hair around the burying-ground, or
throw it upon the grave.       The Brazilian women (have their
heads, and their mourning is not at air end till their hair has
grown again.      When the Apalachites, a people of Florida,
are desirous of expressing their sorrow for the death of a rela
tion, they cut off a part of their hair : at the death of their
prince they shave their heads entirely, and do not suffer their
hair to grow again till the body has been deposited in the earth,
which is never done till the expiration of two years.
   The Iroquese of both sexes testified their grief also by cut
ting off their hair. The women, on this occasion, durst not go
out of their huts till iheir hair had grown again ; but as thse
required a long time, they at present, with the permission of
their relations, cut off only a small portion, which they strew
over the graves of their deceased husbands.               It is here to be
observed, that the women in Canada consider it as the greatest
indignity that can be offered to them if any one cuts off their
                                                                     hair ;

    4. Destroying   the Habitations and Huts     of the deceased.
   The antient Moguls      were accustomed to tear to pieces and
destroy the tents or their deceased officers.    The present Mo
guls, also, when their chan or his principal consort dies, if they
are private persons, abandon their habitations ; and the chief
of the tribe leaves his camp, and never suffers himself to be
seen during the whole period of mourning.          Among the Te-
lengutians,   the  huts 01  the deceased are  destroyed.    The Ja-
kutians formerly removed from the huts in which any one
died, and entirely abandoned them. The Telengutians are a
race of the Urals or Oelots, "who together are called Cal-
mucks ; and the Jakutians, as far as can be concluded from
their language, are of Tartar extraction.       Both of them may
have inherited this custom from the Moguls.            The Persians
 have an aversion to the habitations in which their fathers
have died, and never approach them.         No one, also, will re
side in the houses or palaces of the great officers put to death
by order of the sovereign, or fchah; for this would be con
sidered as an unfortunate omen of a similar fate ; and there
fore such houses generally stand empty, and soon fall into
 ruins. No sooner has a Laplander breathed his last, than his
neighbours drag out the body and destroy the hut, which
they afterwards abandon. On the death of the king of Whi-
dah, on the western coast of Africa, his palace is destroyed,
and another, according to the taste and pleasure of the new
sovereign, is erected.
    Among the Caribs it is customary also to destroy the hut
 in which the father of a family has died, and to build another
in some other place : nor does any one ever think of rebuild
ing the former one. In Peru, the apartment inhabited by a
deceased inca was closed up by means of a wall.
   This aversion to the habitations of persons deceased arises
from a superstitious notion, prevalent among the pagans, that
the deceased in the other world follow the same occupations
which they exercised during life, and that therefore they have
occasion for every thing they before possessed.        For this rea
son, their furniture, utensils, and tools, are thrown into the
grave along with them. Should any of these articles be with
drawn or withheld, the spirit of the deceased, according to
the idea of these people, would have no rest, but torment and
frighten the living by its appearance.         They consequently
                                                              choose

 choose rather to remove to a distance,  and to leave to the  rest
 less spirit the whole hut, in which they imagine it resides, or
 else they destroy it.    The very thought, therefore, of a de
 ceased person is disagreeable    to these people; his name is
 never uttered ; and if any person of the tribe has the fame
 name, he is obliged to lay it aside, and to assume another. In
 this manner, a deceased person among them is like one who
 never was in the world ; his history and genealogy cannot,
 therefore, be far extended.

5. Husband assuming
                            of a Child.
    We are told by Strabo, that the men in the northern part
of Spain, after the delivery of their wives, went to bed, and
suffered themselves to be nursed by them.        This custom still
exists  in some of the provinces of France bordering on Spain*
where it is called making a couvade.       The fame thing is re
lated by Diodorus Siculus of the Corficaus, and by Apollo-
nius Rhodius of the Tibarenes, a people inhabiting the coast
of the Pontus Euxinus, in Asia Minor. Marco Polo, speak
ing of a province which in the French tranflation is called
Arcladam or Ardandam, fays that the women left their bed
us soon after delivery as possible, and that the men then took
their place, where they remained for forty days, and nursed
the new-born child.      This custom is said to be usual, also,
among the Japanese.
    When the Carib women in Guiana are delivered, the men
bind up their head and place themselves in bed, as if seized
with the pains of labour. They are then visited by their
neighbours, who console them by all those means usual
among these people.      This custom must always be strictly
observed ; for, even when engaged in war, as soon as they
hear of the delivery of their wives they must return home.
We are told by Labat, that the father of the child, on this
occasion, must observe a strict fast for thirty or forty days;
but he adds, that this ceremony is practised only in regard to
the first-born, otherwise, says he, the poor husbands, who
have five or six wives, would be obliged to keep more fasts
than the Capuchins.      This account is confirmed by Fermin
in his description of Surinam, but he says nothing of the strict
fasting which must be observed by the father of the child.
Piso, a Dutch physician, says, that the women among the
Brazilian savages, when they find the pains of labour ap
proaching, go out into the woods to cut the umbilical cord of
the child with a shell, which they boil and eat ; and that the
husbands, in the mean time, go to bed and use the best food

 they can       procure, under a pretence of repairing their loll
  strength.      We are told the same thing by captain Woods
  Rogers,     who   fays that the Brazilian women, at the time of
 their delivery, go out alone into the woods, and when deli
 vered wash the child ; while the men place themselves in
 bed for tw,enty-four hours, where they are attended in the
 fame manner as if really suffering from the pains of labour.
     Lafitau denies that the men indulge themselves on this
 occasion, and is of opinion that this practice is a religious
 ceremony, which must be performed for six months with the
 strictest fasting, and other acts of mortification almost insup
 portable ; and that it ought to be considered as a kind of pe-
_nance for the sin of our first parents.               If this be true, the
 notion of original sin must be di flu fed throughout the whole
 world, and have been conveyed from the old to the new con
 tinent : but this I stiall not here examine.               He, however,
 agrees with Labat in saying that this strict fasting is observed
 only in regard to the first-born child ; but, instead of six
 months, as above mentioned, Labat makes the duration of
 it to be only thirty or forty days.

 XIII.     On  the Precipitation  ofMetallic    Solutions by other Metals.
 I- VV        HEN       metals are precipitated by substances which
 do not seize upon their oxygen, the precipitates retain a por
 tion of the acid, and often some of the precipitant.               Of this
 we have a striking instance in the precipitate of the oxygen
 ated muriate of mercury by the alkalis and, lime.                      On
 exposing the precipitate to a sufficient heat, one portion of
 mercury, more or less considerable,            according to the nature
 of the precipitate, is reduced, another is sublimed, and forms
 a muriate, not merely because the muriatic acid is combined
 with    a portion of the oxide of mercury, as I supposed, (Me
 moirs    of the Academy,) but because the expansive force of the
 heat, and the tendency to the combination of the muriatic
 acid, acting upon the oxide of mercury, cause, as we may
 fay, a new partition of it to be made : the precipitate by am
 monia retains a portion of the ammonia j the precipitate of
     Vol. X.                           I                                the

130                  Researches   respecting
the muriate of iron by potash, retains part of the potash.
Facts of this kind may be collected in great number. There
is no doubt, therefore, but that the observations which have
been made upon the precipitations of substances which lose
their solubility, cannot be applied to the metallic precipitates,
which vary according to all the circumstances which are ca
pable of modifying the powers brought into action, at the
moment of their successive precipitation, and which will deserve
a particular examination in another memoir.       But when the
metals are" mutually precipitated from their solutions, their
 reciprocal affinity for oxygen has a great effect in the action
 that takes place ; and sometimes the precipitate is found in
 the metallic state. If another force were not joined to the
 affinity of the precipitating metal for oxygen, it would natu
 rally follow, from the principles established in this memoir,
 that the oxygen would divide itself between the two metals
 which are in competition, according to the action they exert
 upon it.    It is therefore necessary to examine what may be
 the force which determines the precipitation in the metallic
state.
   2.  The affinity of mercury, gold, and silver, for oxygen, is
very  weak  : the mutual affinity which   still remains between
the parts of these metals when they are in fusion, as mercury
is at the temperature of the atmosphere, is sufficient to pre
vent their combination with oxygen in the state of gas; but
heat, by dilating the particles of the mercury, diminishes the
force of their mutual affinity sufficiently to enable them to
combine with oxvgen ; while a superior degree of heat, by
the difference of dilatation which it produces in the mercury
and in the oxygen, will separate them : heat, then, contri
butes to this combination by diminishing the mutual affinity
of the parts, but at length, bv augmenting this difference, it
renders their combination impomblc.         As the force of co
hesion in mercury is sufficient to prevent oxidation, this very
force will tend to effect its dcoxvgenation, with the assistance
of a metal which will act directly upon the oxygen. It is a
force analogous to that which produces crystallization and
precipitations. (Art. V.)
   3. The particles of a metal have not onlv a mutual affi
nity, but likewise an affinity for those of other metals : hence
proceed the amalgams and mixtures.        It is onlv necessary to
     copper   incontact with mercury to efse6t      combination
  (jut
                                                   a
 jetween these two metals.     Thus, when      ametal opposes its
action to a  metallic solution, part of the metal may act upon
the oxygen and upon the acid, while the other tends to com
bine with the metal of the oxide. Let us fee whether we can
                                                        discover,

                        the Laws of Affinity,                  131
discover,   in the precipitation of the mercury, silver, gold, and
copper, in the metallic (late, the influence of these two forces,
that is to soy, the mutual affinity of the particles of one and
the sonic metal, and the affinity of one metal for another.
    4. When a piece of copper is put in a solution of mercury"
in nitric or in muriatic acid, the copper becomes instantly
white, and the mercury is revived, but combined with the
copper. If, inilead of copper, a plate of clean iron be plunged
in the some solution, aster several hours the liquid appears
disturbed, and at length a precipitate is formed ; but with the
muriatic solution in particular, this precipitate is partly in the
state of an oxide, and very probably retains a portion of acid.
     If the affinity of one metal for oxvgen were the sole cause
that produced the precipitation of another metal, the iron
ought to act with greater efficacy than the copper; for it is
known to have a stronger affinity for oxvgen: but its action
is slow, difficult, and incomplete, while that of copper is in
stantaneous.       It is seen by the manner in which the inde-
composoble acids are retained by the oxide of copper and the
oxide of iron, when these combinations are exposed to the
action os heat, that there can only be a very small difference
between the affinities of these metals for the acids. There is
consequently no doubt that the affinity of the copper for the
mercury, with which it has actually combined, must have
greatly contributed to its precipitation in the metallic state ;
 but in the experiment with iron, the mutual affinity of the
particles of mercury must alone have decided, though with
difficulty, the reduction of the mercury; a portion was also
precipitated in oxide, and probablv retained a portion of acid,
as the whole would have done, if the affinity of the iron for
oxygen had been the sole agent ; and the portion precipitated
in the metallic state did not combine with the iron.
     5. Isa solution of silver be precipitated by copper, the pre
cipitate, which is in the metallic state, is not pure silver, but
a combination of silver with a small portion of copper: it
could not take the copper from the plate itself, which was
plunged in the solution ; it must therefore have precipitated
 with if out of the solution: the mutual affinity of these two
 metals decides their deoxygenation.        By means of this force,
two combinations are effected, as often happens: one, that
 of the acid with the oxide of copper ; the other, that of the
 silver with a portion of the copper.      The action of the acid
 upon the oxide of copper, and that of silver upon copper, are
thus put in equilibrio.
     6. In like manner, if a plate of copper be plunged into a
 solution of gold, the gold which is precipitated, sliows, by its
                                 I %                         deeper

  lution retains but a small part of the copper Jolt bv the plate
  If  a plate of' iron be put in this solution, the gold which is
  precipitated leizes, perhaps as strongly as in the former cafe,
  a part of the iron, or at lead its precipitation is determined
  by the affinity of the iron for the gold, at the surface of which
  this last combines.     For the gilding is a combination of the
  two metals at the surface of contact : when the first stratum
  is formed, the precipitation is afterwards capable of continuing
  by the mere force of. the mutual affinity which the particles
  of gold have for each other, and which makes them to cohere.
     7. What I have just stated is proved in the precipitation
  of copper by iron. When a solution of copper is decomposed
  by a plate of iron, and the copper attached to the plate is
  separated, it is perceived, by the brown colour of the interior
  surface, that the copper is not there pure, but contains some
 iron. After this first stratum the copper continued to preci
 pitate by contracting an adherence with itself, and afterwards
 with those coats which are fucccstivelv formed : the affinity,
 then, for the iron began the effect, which was continued by
 that of the copper for itself.
     8. Phosphorus precipitates several metallic solutions, as has
 been explained by Sage and Bouillon {Journal de Physique
 1781).     Though it has a strong affinity with oxygen, vet
 what has just been explained relative to precipitation by the
 metals, ought to be applied to its action. Pelletier has proved
 that phosphorus has the property of combining with metals,
 so that a part of that which is put in action is capable of com
 bining with oxygen, while the other acts equally upon the
 metal.     There are some metallic solutions which are not af
 fected by phosphorus ; in others the metal is precipitated in
 oxide, which doubtless retains part of the acid of the solu
 tion, or of the phosphoric acid which is formed ; in others
 the metal is at length reduced.         Gold, silver, copper, and
 mercury, are among those which relume the metallic state.
 On considering the observations which have been made on
this precipitation, it appears that copper and silver are preci
pitated by combining with a small portion of phosphorus 1
 thus, in precipitating twelve grains of silver, three grains of
phosphorus are consumed; but only about time grains of phos
phoric acid, in a gelatinous state, are obtained : now, only
one grain of phosphorus is necessary to produce this quantity
of acid ; consequently, more than two grains must have
combined with the silver.       A part only of the mercury, thus
treated, resumes the metallic state ; the rest preserves the state
of an oxide, and combines with the phosphoric acid. Here
                                                                the

  the force of cohesion is weak, and no combination is made
  with the phosphorus ; hence the effect is but partial, as when
  iron is used. (No. 4.)
      Though the affinity of gold for oxygen is much-inferior to
  that of copper, its precipitation is no.t so quickly effected, and
  a portion is precipitated in the state of oxide; probably be
  cause it has little disposition to combine with phosphorus;
 and it is the combination of copper with phosphorus that
 determines the precipitation of the latter metal. Some of the
 observations      which I have here presented, require the accu
 racy of experiment for their entire explanation: but all ap
 pear to me indubitably to prove that it is the force of cohe
 sion which tends lo recombine the particles of one individual
 metal, and the mutual affinity of some metals which decides
  their precipitation in the metallic state ; so that this state is
 more or less sudden and complete, according to the force with
 which these causes are capable of acting *.
                      XIV.    On    the  resulting Affinity.
      \. The  result    of the action of several affinities in the fame
 substance,    I   denominate the resulting affmity : for instance,
 the nitric acid is composed of oxvgen and azote; this acid
 combines with potash ; it acts upon potash by an affinity re
 sulting from that of the oxygen and of the azote.                    The re
 ciprocal   mutual     action   of   the  potasti is likewise  a force  result
 ing   from  that    exerted by    it upon   each   of the substances    which
 compose    the    nitric  acid.
     if All bodies
                 '
                        existing upon the earth have an affinity for
 each other.        If there be exceptions, the number can be but
 very small.       I may therefore reason from this, and apply to
 all substances that which observation has made known rela
 tive to affinities and their modifications.             If this application
 be not forced, if it accounts for properties which cannot be
directly established upon experiment, the considerations which
 I present in this article may throw some light upon several
 phænomena, which are owing to a chemical action still un
 determined.
     3. In the definition of resulting affinity, I have supposed
that the affinity of a compound substance is derived from
those of the substances which compose it.                  It is necessary to
examine what circumstances mav modify the elementary affi
nities, and to ascertain the changes which must arise in the
affinity resulting from them.

tual action of metals.     {Journal tie Pbjfique, Bruraaire, an. 8 .)

    4. The chemical action of substances is weakened in pro
portion to their saturation. (Art. II. No. 10.)       It must be
concluded, therefore, that the resulting affinity must be a lets-
quantity than the elementary affinities when alone: for the
latter have experienced a commencement of saturation ; but
other circumstances     may increase the action os the resulting
affinity, or may augment the weakness it derives from satura
tion.
    5. If one of the substances that combine chancre from a
solid to a liquid ltate, it acquires the advantages possessed by
solvents; and its affinity, belore disguised by the solid state,
becomes active ; so that the resulting affinity maV, on this
account, be much more considerable than the elementary
affinities appeared to be. Thus, when sulphur is dissolved by
potash, the sulphuret which proceeds from it exerts a strong
action upon oxvgen gas, as soon as it has been rendered li
quid bv the addition of water, or has attracted sufficient hu
 midity from the air: because it has by that means lost its
 force of cohesion, as it would bv igneous fusion ; and because
the potasti likewise exerts an action upon the oxygen, though
much weaker than that of the sulphur, since it cannot alone
overcome the elasticity of the gas. The action of the sulphur
 is diminished by the sum of that attraction which it exerts
 upon the potasti, and upon the water which serves as a solvent
 to the sulphuret ; but it gains much more by the liquidity
 which it acquires, than it loses by this saturation.     Strictly
 speaking, all those substances the solidity of which is over
 come by a solvent, do act by virtue of a resulting force or
affinity.
   6. Circumstances contrary to the preceding produce an
opposite effect; and when substances, by combining, become
solid, or more disposed to crystallize, this circumstance must
be added to the loss of force arising from the saturation.  Pot
asti, for example, and nitric acid, have both the property of
dissolving in alcohol, and yet alcohol does not dissolve nitrate
of potasti; that     the force of cohesion which belongs to
                       is,
that combination, and which, with water, produces its crys
tallization, has modified the elementary affinities into the
resulting affinity.  What confirms this explanation           is,
                                                            that
salts which are not crystallizable                  in
                                       water, because they op
pose   only   a   feeble cohesion,        general, the property of
                                            have,    in
dissolving    in   alcohol   ;   but    manner, that they are ca
                                       in   sucha
pable   of crystallizing in that fluid, because the weaker action
of the alcohol cannot overcome, except to certain point,  a
the force of cohesion, of which they are not entirely destitute.

The limited solubility  of nitrate of potash in water arises from
the solubility of the potash, as well as of the nitric acid, by
water,    being greater than by alcohol.
    7.   Bodies act in proportion to the quantity of them which
 exists within the sphere of action. (Art. IV.)        Hence we de
 duce, that an action much stronger than that of the compo
 nent parts may result from a combination, when the compo
 nents, or one of the two, pass from the elastic to the liquid
 state; for they then carry into the sphere of activity a more
 considerable quantity, the attion of which may considerably
 exceed the force lost by the saturation.       Thus potash cannot
overcome the resistance which proceeds from the elasticity of
 the oxygen and azotic gases ; but if these two be com
 bined, in order to form nitric acid in the liquid state, they
 act upon the potash in a quantity much greater than they
could have applied when in the elastic state; and the result
of their action, though weakened by a commencement of
saturation, is found to be much more considerable than if the
azote and oxvgcn had continued in the elastic state.
    8. The affinity of a substance which enters into combina
 tion with a compound substance, concurs with the elementary
 affinities of the latter, to maintain its composition against the
action of foreign substances, in proportion to the degree of
 saturation which it produces.        Thus iron easily carries off
oxygen from azote, or rather, it sliares               it,
                                                 or takes   portion;     a
 but as soon as the nitric acid       combined with potash, iron
                                       is
can no longer separate its oxygen at an ordinary temperature;
but at    a higher temperature the difference of dilatation suffi
ciently destroys the relulting affinity of the potash to cause
the iron to combine with the oxygen.             In the oxygenated
muriatic acid, the sur-oxvgen, which             feebly retained
                                                       is                             by
the muriatic acid, passes easily into other combinations         but         ;
though    it   is present in   a much greater proportion in the
oxygenated      muriate os potash,         carried off with much
                                            it   is

which affords phosphorus, when, in order to obtain this sub
stance, we use phosphate of lime reduced to an acidulous
phosphate      bythe sulphuric acid.
    9.  The   contrary takes place when, instead of saturating       a
substance, which serves to strengthen the resulting affinity,

one is added that tends to form a combination into which,
one of the constituent parts must enter.         For example, when
sulphuric    acid is added   to a mixture   of water  and iron, this
acid favours the decomposition, of the water, because it tends
to combine with the metal, and with a portion of oxygen ; a
tendency concurring, with that of the metal, against the affi
nity which forms the combination of oxvgen with hydrogen.
     10. From the preceding remarks we conclude, that the
properties of the resulting affinity of compound substances
may be reduced, l. To the advantages of liquidity, and under
 this point of view it is necessary to apply to it the theory of
 solvents (Art. IX.): a. To the disposition        to solidity, which
 produces contrary     effects,  which   must   be  explained bv the
 force of, cohesion (Art. V7.): 3. Lastly, to the concentration
 of elastic substances. The observations presented in No. 7.
 and 8. prove that, in those compounds in which elastic sub
 stances are concentrated, there are established, by a change
 of constitution, affinities which maybe considered as new ;
 an additional force has accrued, to which we may apply the
 inverse of what has been stated relative to the, effects of ela
  sticity (Art. VI.) The distinctive character of the complex
  affinities treated of, (Art. XII.) compared with those which
  result from the composition of the substances of which I now
  speak,  is,  thatin  the first but very little change obtains in
  the constitution of the component parts;           sothat, when the
  force of cohesion or of elasticity does not intervene, we may
  consider them in the fame manner as they have been consi
  dered  in  Art. XII. No. 1., whereas anew force         is established
  in compounds      in   which clastic substances are condensed       ; a
  power which may be considered as analogous to that of the
   cohesion which obtains on the mixture of different substances
   that determine the combinations that are formed, or which
   require to be overcome        by
                                  the forces opposed to it.
      11. Caloric,   by  augmenting elasticity, destroys the affinity
   of substances, ot which the constituent parts have an un
   equal dilatation, conformably to what has been stated in
  Art. VII.
     13. Observation further shows us, that when the resulting
  affinityisnot sufficient to prevent the decomposition,   some  it
  times renders    it very slow and tedious.  To this slowness of
  action, to these progressive changes of constitution, to the
  different degrees of saturation which take place, must be
  ascribed  most of the phænomena observable          in vegeta
  tion, fermentation, the animal ceconomy, and, in gene
  ral, among all bodies which contain condensed elastic
                                                               substances.

substances        *.   This  subject    will  require still further explana
tion.
      13. The resulting affinity ought always to be considered as
a single force, while the substances from which it is derived
remain in combination : but when a separation takes place,
it is necessary to consider the elements of which it is com
posed ; for the result will then be conformable to what has
been explained in the division of substances, in proportion to
 the opposite powers which act upon them.
       14. It often happens that a substance acts partly by a re
 sulting affinity and partly by its elementary affinities. When,
 a metal is dissolved by the nitric acid, one part of the acid
 exerts a resulting affinity, and another acts by its elementary
 affinities; so that the oxygen of the latter part is divided be
 tween the metal and the azote, and the oxide which is formed
 is dissolved in the undecomposed acid.
       15. It is obvious, from what has just been explained rela
  tive to resulting affinity, that a false idea may be adopted of
  the properties         of a body, when we confine ourselves, as
  is too often done, to the determination of its constituent
  parts, without paying attention to the other conditions of its
  constitution, if among those constituent parts there chance to
  be some whose state has undergone a considerable                  alteration.
  A quantity of oxygen gas does not possess-the fame chemical
   power when it is in the elastic state, as when it exerts a re
   sulting force in its combination with azote, hydrogen, car
   bon, sulphur, or a metal. For example, the oxygen does
   not exert the fame action, and has not the fame resulting
   affinity, in the sulphuric and the sulphurous acid : though in
   the sulphuric acid a smaller proportion of sulphur is com
   bined, yet it adheres much more strongly than in the sul
   phurous acid, and, being more condenied, it exerts a much
                                                                                 '
   more powerful chemical actions.                  We ought not to con-
   found the oxygen gas which is held in solution by water,
   with the oxygen which, by its combination with hydrogen,
    forms this liquid : the difference caused between them by the
    state of condensation, produces two substances very different
    in their chemical action.            It is therefore necessary, either to.
    consider the whole constitution of a body, in order to ex
    plain its chemical properties, or (p content ourselves with
        • I ha"'c often resorted to this change of constitution in the chemical
    explanations which I have had occasion to give, and particularly in the
     lectures of the National School, where I defined the resulting affinity by
    the name of eolleftive ttffinitj, and distinguilhed it from elementary affi
     nities.

                               X,V. Recapitulation.
   1. We have frequently remarked that the action of a sub
stance is diministied in proportion as it approaches a state of
saturation ; and this diminution of force was applied to ex
plain several chemical phænomena.        It was affirmed that a
metal could only take a definite portion of oxygen from the
nitric acid, because, when the oxygen in the acid is dimi
nished, the remaining portion is too strongly combined with
 the azote.    The property of carrying off only a portion of
oxygen from certain metallic oxides was attributed to hydro-
           was admitted that when
           it                            substance attracts huini-
                                                a
  fen
       ;
   itv from the air, its dissolving force comes to an equili
brium      ;  that, according to the degrees of desiccation of
                so
the air, the substance may either carry off or give out water
to it.      was shown that the resistance experienced
           It                                               expell  in
ing the last portions of        substance from
                                    a               combination,
                                                           a
either      the action of an affinity or
            by                              that of heat,
                                                     by      much      is
greater than at the commencement of the decomposition, and
sometimes such, that its entire decomposition cannot be ef
fected.    Thus      was ascertained that oxygen could be but
                          it
partially disengaged from the oxide of manganese                the        by
action of heat.     The combinations which are formed when
forces are opposed, do not therefore depend upon the affini
ties alone, but upon the proportions of the substances which
act.    I have therefore only applied to all the phænomena of
                                                        several of
chemistry, what has been unavoidably admitted                  in
them from observation.         have only deduced the immediate
                                  I
consequences.
    2. These are, that substances act in proportion to their
affinity, and to the quantity of them existing within the
sphere of activity; that the latter may counterbalance the
former affinity   and that the chemical action of each power
                      ;
is  proportionate to the saturations     produces.  it   have de  I
fined      by
           the word mass, or chemical mass, the quantities de--
termined         by
                 like degree of saturation, and consequently,
                      a
relative to the capacity of saturation     when two substances
                                                     :
are in competition in order to combine with        third, each of
                                                          a
them obtains     degree
                      a of saturation proportionate   to its mass.
The subject of the combination also divides its action in pro
portion to the masses, and              by   varying the latter   the results
will    also be varied.
                                                                      3.
                                                                       I    have

                      the  Laws of Affinity.                    139
    3.  I have considered all the forces which, by their concur
rence    or opposition to the mutual affinity 'of the substance?
brought into action according to the preceding principle,
may have an influence upon chemical combinations and
phænomena.        They may be reduced to the following heads:
the action of solvents, or the affinity which they exert ac
cording to their proportion ; the force of cohesion, which is
the effect of the mutual affinity of the parts of a substance or
combination ; the elasticity, whether natural or produced by
heat, which ought to be considered as an affinity of caloric;
the efflorescence, the cause of which may be attributed to an
affinity which is not yet determined, and which acts only
under very rare circumstances ; gravity likewise exerts its in
fluence, particularly when it produces the compression of
elastic fluids ; but it may always, without inconvenience, be
confounded with the force of cohesion.
    4. I have attempted to ascertain whether it were possible
to determine the relative affinity of two substances for a third;
I have observed that for this purpose it would be necessary to
discover in what proportions this third would be divided with
a given quantity of each of the two first, or rather, would di
vide its action ; I have pointed out the insurmountable ob
stacles that would be met with in the means that must neces
sarily be employed to prove this division of action, and the
 changes of constitution which would attend it.
    5. As all the tables of affinity have been constructed upon
the supposition that substances possess different degrees of
affinity, which produce the decompositions and combinations
resulting from their mixture, independently of the propor
tions and other conditions which contribute to the results,
these tables can only give a false idea of the degrees of che
mical action of the substances arranged in them.
    6. Elective affinity is in itself an erroneous expression, since
 it supposes the union of one entire substance with another,
in preference to a third, while there is only a division of
 action, subjected to other chemical conditions.
     7. The action of two, three, or a greater number of sub
 stances is subject to the same laws; and the result depends
 on their affinity, on their proportion, or on the degree of
 their saturation, and the concurrence or opposition of the
 forces they exert.
     In all cafes of perfect liquidity, mutual saturation takes
 place, and the result is a single combination, in which all
 the forces are counterbalanced, while there is neither preci
 pitation nor disengagement of elastic matter ; but as the action
 is divided when there is an opposition of forces and a differ
                                                               ence

  I40                   Researches    rcffctling
 encc   of saturation, some substances are retained in the new
 combination Iris strongly than before the mixture; they may
 consequently vieid to the powers of cohesion, elasticity, or other
 affinities which they might otherwise have resisted.
     8. The force os cohesion, hitherto considered merelv as an
 obstacle to solution, not only limits the quantities of sub
 stances which mav be brought into action in a liquid, and
 consequently modifies the conditions of the saturation which
 follows, but is the power which causes the precipitations and,
 crystallizations, that take place, and determines the pro
 portions of such combinations as quit the liquid : it is this
 force which sometimes even produces the separation of one,
 without its forming any combination with another substance,
 as we have remarked in some metallic precipitations.         I di
 stinguish insolubility from the force of cohesion, because the
 one is relative only to the action of the solvent, and the other
 is the effect of the mutual affinity of the parts of a substance
 or combination, considered absolutely.
    Elasticity acts by producing effects opposite to those of co
 hesion, which consist in either withdrawing some substances
 from the action of others ina liquid, or in diministiirigthepro-
portion which exists within the sphere of activity ; but when
all the substances are in the elastic state, their action is sub.
je6led to the same conditions.
    If tables were formed which would represent the disposition
to insolubility or volatility in the different combinations,
they would serve to explain a great number of combinations
which take their origin from the mixture of different sub-,
stances, and from the influence of heat.
    9. Caloric acts upon bodies like the other solvents, when
it is not in a state of radiant caloric, because in this cafe it
is not in combination.        It should exceed the greatest part of
the force of cohesion, in order to render a body liquid ; other
affinities also may concur with it to produce this effect, in
the fame manner as itself concurs with the action of other
solvents.     It is not distributed among bodies in proportion
to their weight, or to their bulk, when it produces the de"-,
grees of temperature indicated by the thermometer, in the
lame manner as an acid does not take up an equal quantity
of the different alkalis, to attain the fame degree of satura
tion ; and were tables of specific caloric constructed, they
would be similar to those of specific acidity or alkalinity. The
latter, however, would represent the whole saturation to a
certain assumed point, because pure acids and alkalis might
be employed j but the specific calorics could only be deter
                                                            mined

                         Laws of Affinity.
                       the                                                1^\
ttii ned from an   unknown point of saturation        to another point,
the  bodies submitted to experiment being already combined
with a quantity of caloric.    The results, which may be ob
tained between two points of the scale of the thermometer,
have no known connection with the total quantities.         To
attempt   to form a  conclusion of one   from  the other, would
be the fame as to pretend to determine the comparative solu
bility of the muriate of soda, and the nitrate of potash in
water, by experiment-! made only at or towards the point of
ebullition or of congelation.    In the former cafe we should
say that three parts of water would be required for the solu
tion of one part of muriate of soda, and only half a part
would be necessary to dissolve one part of the nitrate of pot
ash ; in the latter, that much less water would be required to
dissolve the muriate os soda than to dissolve the nitrate of
potash      *.
   The  force as cohesion in a body on its taking the solid state
obliges a part of the caloric to separate; in the same manner
as when a salt crystallizes, it abandons part of the solvent, or
even a part of the acid, or of the alkali, with which it might
be combined.
   10. It mav be said that the affinities may feally be repre
sented by the tables of capacity ; since they may afford the
measure of the action of one substance upon another, when
a common term os saturation is found, such as neutralization
for the acids and the alkalis, and thermometric temperature
for caloric ; but nothing could possibly be concluded for che
mical action at another term of saturation, and more parti
cularly for another constitution, and for all the circumstances
in which the forces of elasticity and cohesion might not be
introduced.
      ii.
        Having considered all the affinities which may jointly
produce chemical action, I next examined how, iivt'he com*-
pounds, they may result from their constituent parts, in order
to acquire a conception how the varied powers, which pro
duce all the chemical phænomena, can be derived from one
single property of simple bodies.    The observations presented
on this subject have shown, that what principally disun£uisties
compound substances, whose action is considered as simple,
is, the condensation ot the constituent parts, on which      new      a
affinity depends   ;an affinity very different from that which
the fame parts possess in the elastic state       the elementary
                                                      :
    • This consideration nlone, that
                                      specific caloric his no known relation
to the quantity of caloric combined in a   body, (hows, that the experiments
bv which Rum Ford has lately pretended to prove that caloric   is  uot acon
stituent part of bodies, cannut lead to such
                                           a    conclusion.
                                                                    affinities

 144               On the Cultivation     of the Vine,
affinities are modified by the state     of saturation, by   the force
of cohesion, or by the variations of elasticity: the resulting
affinity may undergo, by combination, a new degree of satu
ration which tends to support the composition, or may be
weakened by other tendencies to combination with one of
the constituent substances.
    12. The considerations which I have presented respecting
the modifications of chemical action, do not, however, pre
vent us from using the term affinity to denote the whole che
mical power of a body exerted in a given situation, either by
its present constitution, its proportion, or even by the con
currence of other affinities ; only we must avoid considering
this power as a constant force; for it would be erroneous to
infer from its present effects, in any instance, what they
would be under other conditions.

 V. The Method of taking         the  Wine from     the Vats, and the
                  proper   Period  for   that Purpose.
 XvT      all times agriculturists have considered it as a matter
of   great importance, to be able, by unerring signs, to dis
cover the most favourable period for taking the wine from
the vats ; but here, as in other things, they have fallen into
the very great inconvenience of general methods. This pe
riod ought to vary according to the climate, the season, and
the nature of the wine proposed to be obtained, and of other
circumstances, which mult always be kept in view.
    It will be proper for us, therefore, to lay down principles
rather than to prescribe methods; for, in our opinion, this is
the only way to make ourselves masters of the operations, and
to bring together the whole of those phænomena, the know
ledge and comparison of which become necessary before any
decision, founded upon certainty, can be given.
    Some agriculturists have ventured to determine a fixed
period for fermentation ; as if it ought not to vary according
 to the temperature of the air, the nature of the grapes, the
 quality of the wine, &c. Others consider as a sign that the
 wine is sit to be removed from the vats, the finking down of
 the vintage, being certainly ignorant that almost the whole of
                                                                    the

                  and   the   Method   of making Wines.                        14.3
the wines of the North would lose their most valuable quali
ties, if their removal of the vats were delayed till that time.
    There are some countries where it is judged that the fer
mentation is completed, when the wine, after being put into a
glass, exhibits no foam at the top, and no air-bubbles at the
fides of the glass.     In other places it is thought sufficient to
shake the wine in a bottle, or to pour it from one glass into
another several limes, to ascertain whether there exists any
foam.      But besides that all new wines give more or less
foam, there are many in which that mark of effervescence
ought to be preserved, in order that they may not lose one of
their principal properties.
    In some countries, a stick is immersed in the vat, and
speedily drawn out; the wine is then suffered to drop from it
into a glass, to fee whether a circle of foam is formed in                         it,
which     is called faire la roue.    Some thrust their hand into
the refuse, and, applying       to their nose, judge,
                                it                               by
                                                           the smell,
of the state of the vat:       the smell
                               if             mild, they allow the
                                              is
wine to ferment some time longer;              if  it   is
                                                   strong,         re   it   is
moved from the vats.
    Some agriculturists, also, consult only the colour in order
to regulate the period of removing the wine from vats. They
suffer   itto ferment till the colour becomes sufficiently dark                    :
but the coloration depends on the nature of the grapes;
and must in the fame climate, and produced from the fame
foil, does not always ffiow the fame disposition to acquire co
lour; which renders this sign exceedingly variable and very
insufficient.
    It thence follows, that all these signs, taken separately, can
not exhibit invariable results; and that,          if
                                                 we wish to rest on
fixed bales, recurrence must be had to principles.
    The object of fermentation        to decompose the saccharine
                                       is
principle     the more abundant, therefore, this principle
              :                                                    the       is,
fermentation must be brisker, or continued for         longer time.
                                                             a
    One of the inseparable effects of fermentation                is,
                                                             the pro
duction of heat and carbonic acid gas.        The first of these re
sults tends to volatilize and to disperse the flavour and smell,
which forms one of the principal characters of certain wines.
The second carries outwards, and causes to be loft in the air
a  fluid, which    if retained in the beverage would render                        it
more agreeable and pungent.          From these principles        fol    it
lows, that weak wines, but of an agreeable flavour, require
little fermentation     ;and that colourless wines, the principal
property of which        to be brisk, ought to remain scarcely at
                        is
all in the vats.

 tion of alcohol, which    results  immediately   from the decom
 position of the sugar.     When the grapes, therefore, are very
 saccharine, such as   those of the south, the fermentation must
 be brisk, and long continued ; because these wines, being
destined for distillation, ought to produce immediately all
the alcohol that can result from the decomposition of the
 whole of the saccharine principle.         If the fermentation be
slow and weak, the wines remain luscious, and do not be
 come warm and agreeable till they have long worked in the
vats.
    In general, grapes abundant in the saccharine principle
must ferment a long time.         In the Bordelois, the fermenta
 tion is suffered to work itself to an end : the wine is never re
moved from the vats till the heat has subsided.
    According to these principles and others, deduced from
the theory before established, we may draw the following
consequences     :
    ist, The must ought to remain in the vats the less time
according as it is less saccharine. Light wines, called in
Burgundy vins de frimeur, cannot bear the vat above from
six to twelve hours.
    2d, The must ought to remain the less time in the vats,
according as it is proposed to retain the acid gas, and to form
brisk wines : in that cafe, it is thought sufficient to tread the
  Tapes, and to put the juice into the casks after it has beta
feft in the vat twenty-four hours, and sometimes without
having been in the vat at all. In this cafe, the fermentation,
on the one hand, is less tumultuous ; and, on the other, the
gas can with lei's cafe be volatilized ; which contributes to
retain that highly volatile substance, and to make it one of
the principles of the liquor.
    3d, Must ought to be left in the vats less time, according
as it is proposed to obtain wine less coloured.        This condi
tion is of great importance in regard to brisk wines, one of
the most valuable qualities of which is their want of colour.
    4th, Musi ought to remain in the vats less time, according
as the temperature      is warmer, and the mass more volumi
nous, &c: in that cafe, the briskness of the fermentation
makes up for its shortness of duration.
    5th, The mult ought to remain in the vats less time, ac
cording as it is proposed to obtain wine of a more agreeable
flavour.
    6th, The fermentation, on the other hand, will be longer,
according as the saccharine principle is more abundant, and
the must thicker.
    7th, It will be longer if the wines are destined for distilla-
            3                                                 tion ;

              and the Method    of making Wines.             145
tion ; in which case, every thing ought to be sacrificed to the
production of alcohol.
    8th, The fermentation will be longer, according as the
temperature has been colder when the grapes were collected.
   9th, The fermentation will be longer, according as the
wine is required to be more coloured.
    From these principles it may be conceived why in one
country the fermentation in the vat terminates in twenty-
four hours, while in others it continues for twelve or fifteen
days ; why one method cannot be generally applied ; and
why particular processes may be attended with errors, &c.
    Gcntil admits as an invariable sign of the necessity of re
moving the wine from the vat, the disappearance in regard
to taste of the sweet and saccharine principle.     This disap
pearance, as he observes, is only apparent, but the savour of
the little that remains is concealed ; the alcohol, the favour
of which predominates, terminates its decomposition in the
calks.    It is also evident that this sign, which is not at all
applicable to white wine, cannot be employed for wines de
stined to remain luscious.
   The signs deduced from the sinking down of the head or
refuse, and the coloration of wines, are attended with the
like inconveniences, and we must return from them to the
principles above established.     This is the only method of
avoiding error.
   A provident agriculturist will always prepare his calks, on
the approach of the vintage, in such a manner that they
may be ready to. receive the wine as it conies from the vat.
The preparation given to them is as follows :
    If the calks are new, the wood of which they are composed
retains an astringency and bitterness, which may be trans
mitted to the wine ; and these faults may be corrected by
pouring warm water and salt water into them several times
in succession. These liquors must be well ssiaken, and suf
fered to remain in them till they penetrate the texture of
the wood, and extract the pernicious principle.      If the calks
are old, and have been frequently employed,    one end   of them
is opened : the stratum of tartar, with which the inside is co
vered, is scraped off, and they are washed with warm water
or with wine.
    In general, the most usual methods of preparing the casks
are confined to the following :
    1st, Wash the calk with cold water, then pour into it a
quart of salt water in a state of ebullition; stop the bung-
bole, and shake it in every direction : empty   it,let the water
drain well off; then take two quarts of fermenting must, and,

drain off.
   2d, Warm wine may be employed instead of the above
preparations.
   3d, An infusion of the flowers of the peach-tree, &o. may
also be used.
   When the     casks have acquired any bad quality, such as
mustincss,  &c. they must be burnt;          possible to conceal it   is
these defects, but there   reason to fear they might reappear.
                                           is
   The antient Romans put gypsum, myrrh, and various aro
matic substances into the casks into which their wines were
removed from the vat.               This      what they called conditura
                                                        is
vinorum. The Greeks sometimes added                    little bruised myrrh
                                                                     a
and argil.       These substances not only perfumed the wine, but
served also to clarify it.
    When the casks are properly prepared, they are deposited
on cask-stands, and thus raised some inches from theground,
both to prevent the action of putrid humidity, and for the
more convenient drawing off the wine which they contain.
They must be arranged in parallel rows in the cellar, with
 sufficient room between for person to examine whether any
                                                a
 of them leaks.

     The liquor      which   floats over the deposit of the vat            called               is
 in Burgundy furtnout.             This surmoftt        carefully drawn off,

  and put into casks capable of containing 30 gallons, or into
  half casks of 15. This furmout forms lighter kind of wine,         a
  more delicate and less coloured.
      When all the wjne which the vat can furnish has been
  drawn off, nothing remains but the head, which has funk
  down almost to the deposit.            This refuse        still impregnated
                                                                           is

    When the deposit in the vat has been pressed, the vine
 that flows from it is put into the casks with the rest ; after
which the press is eased, and the refuse is cut quite round, to
 the thickness of three or four inches, with a (harp shovel:
that which has been cut off is thrown into the middle, and
again subjected to the press : the operation of cutting is a
second time repeated, and the cut matter is pressed as before.
    The wine arising from the first cutting is the strongest ;
that arising from the third is harder, harsher, greener, and
more coloured.
    Sometimes a first cutting is thought sufficient, especially
when the refuse is destined for the acetous fermentation. The
product of these different cuttings is often mixed together in
separate casks, in order to obtain wine coloured and pretty
durable; and in some places it is mixed with common wine
when it is required to give to the latter colour, strength, and
a slight astringency.      In Champagne, the wine of the first
prefhng    is mixed  with   that arising from succeeding cuttings.
    The wine of the press is the less coloured according as it
is pressed more weakly and more speedily.             These wines in
Champagne       are called   gray   wines.   The   wine  arising from
the first and second cutting is called ceil de perdrix; and that
arising from the third and fourth, vindetaille: the last is
the most coloured, but it is still agreeable.
   The refuse, when strongly pressed, acquires sometimes the
hardness of stone.      It is applied to various uses in commerce,
    lit, In some countries it is distilled in order to make a
spirit, which is called eau-de-vie de marc.           In Champagne
it is known under the name of eau-dc d'Aixne; but it has a
bad. taste.    This dillillation is advantageous, especially in
countries where the wine is highly generous, and where the
presses do not press very closely.
    2d, In the neighbourhood of Montpellier, the refuse is put
into casks, where it is carefully trod upon ; and it is then
preserved for making verdigris *.
   3d, In other places it is rendered acid by carefully airing
it,  and the vinegar      then extracted
                               is                            by

is given to the cattle in a tub evening and morning.             Horses
and cows are fond of this food; but it must be given to the
latter in moderation, because it would cause their milk to,
turn sour. The refuse of white grapes is preferred on account
of its not having been fermented.

poultry: oil, also, may be extracted from them.
    6th, The refuse may be burnt to obtain alkali : 4000
pounds of refuse yield 500 pounds of ashes, which give 10
 pounds of dry alkali.
     VI. Of  the Method        of managing   the Wine in the Casks.
    The wine deposited in the casks has not reached its last
 degree of preparation.         It is turbid, and still ferments ; but,
 as the movement of it is less tumultuous, this state of it has
 been called the insensible fermentation.
    Soon after the wine has been put into the cask, a flight
 hissing is heard, which arises from the continued disengage
 ment of the carbonic acid gas that escapes from every point
 of the liquor; foam, which passes over through the bung-
 hole, U formed at the top, and care is taken to keep the calk
 always full, that the foam may escape, and that the wine may
 disgorge itself.     For a short time it will be sufficient to fasten
 a piece  of paper   on    the bung, or to lay a tile over it.
    In proportion       as   the fermentation decreases the mass of
 the liquid  sinks   down     ; and this depression is carefully watch
 ed,  in order  to  pour    in  more wine, that the casks may be al
 ways kept    full.    There    are some countries where this opera
 tion is performed every day for the first month, every four
 days during the second, 3nd every eight till it is drawn off.
 This is the method practised in regard to the delicious wines
 of the Hermitage.
     In Champagne, the gray wines are suffered to ferment in
 the casks ten or twelve days ; and when they cease working
  up, the casks are closed by means of the bung, leaving a
  small vent-hole at one side of it. This vent-hole is closed eight
  or ten days after with a wooden peg, which may be taken out
  at pleasure.     When the casks have been closed, fresh wine
  must   be  poured in through the vent-hole, every week for
  twenty-five days ; then every two months as long as the wine
  remains in the cellar. Wnen the wines have not sufficient
  body, and are too green, which is the cafe when the season has
  been damp and cold; or if they are too luscious, which is the
                                                                    case

                   and the Method        of making Wines.                         149    .
case when the season has been too dry and warm, the casks
are rolled five or six times twenty-five days after the wine has
been made, to mix well the lees ; and this operation is re
peated every eight days during a month : by these means the
wine is improved.
   The fermentation of the wines of Champagne destined
to be brisk is continued very long : it is believed that wine
can constantly be brisk, provided it be put into bottles be
tween the time of the vintage till the month of May; and
that, the nearer to the time of the vintage, the better it foams.
We are assured also that it always foams if put into bottles
between     the 10th and 14th of March.         Wine never be-
      to foam till six weeks after     has been put into bottles,
     fins
                                           it
  lountain wine foams better than Champagne          when wine     :
is put  into  flasks between  June and July    foams   little, and
                                                          it
not at all   ifbottled in October or November,after the vintage.
   In Burgundy, when the fermentation in the cask has
slackened,       the casks are closed,      and      a   small hole    is   made    in
them near the bung, which    closed with
                                     is      peg.  This peg    a
isdrawn out from time to time to suffer the remainder of the
gas to escape.
      In the environs of Bourdeaux           customary to begin
                                                it   is
          in new wine eight or ten days after th« wine has
Eouring
  een put into the casks.     A month after, the bung put in,           is
and new wine      poured in every eight days
                   is                            at first, the bung
                                                           :
is put in very gently, and     it gradually driven in closer with
                                    is
out incurring any danger.
   The white wines are drawn off about the middle of De
cember, and they are then sulphured. The white require
more care than the red, because they contain more dregs,
and are more disposed to become oily.
   Red wines are not drawn off till the end of March or be
ginning of April. The latter easier turn four than the white,
which renders        necessary to keep them in cooler cellars
                     it
during the hot weather.
   Some people, after the second drawing off, turn the bar
rels with the bung on one side, and thus keep the wine her
metically sealed, without having need to pour in new wine,
as there    no loss. The wine then
            is                            not drawn off but every
                                                is

                                           is
it. As the processes every where followed are nearly the fame,
we (hall not multiply details, which would be only repetitions.
   When the fermentation has ceased, and the mass enjoys
perfect repose, the wine       completely made,
                              is                   But acquires        it

served from the danger of turning sour.

     This clarification
                     is effected spontaneously by time and re
pose ; and there is gradually formed a deposit at the bottom
of the cask and on the fides, which frees the wine from every

vapour obtained             by
                        the combustion of sulphured matches.
   The method of composing these matches varies considerably
in different places some mix with the sulphur aromatic sub

melt the mixture in an earthen vessel over            moderate fire.         a
In this melted mixture, rags of cotton cloth are dipped in
order to be burnt in the casks. Others employ sulphur alone,
which they melt over the lire, and dip rags in           in the fame             it
manner.
   In the method of sulphuring casks there                 also consi             is

phured match is then burnt in it ; and when the combustion
is finished, the cafle is stopped, and shaken in every direction.
After being left at rest for an hour or two, it is unstopped,
more wine is added ; it is then again sulphured, and the ope
ration is repeated till the cask oe full. This is the process
usually followed at Bourdeaux.
    At Marseillan, near the commune of Cette, in Languedoc,
a kind of wine is made of white grapes called mute wine,
which is employed to sulphur others. The vintage is trod
and pressed without giving it time to ferment ; it is then put
into castes filled one-fourth ; several matches are burnt over
it; and the casks are strongly stiaken, until no more gas
escapes through the bung-hole when opened.                A new quan
tity of wine is then added, matches are again burnt over                                         it,
and the casks are shaken with the same precautions.                 This
operation      repeated till the cask
               is                               full.  This wine neves

    Theodore de Saussure.
                            [Concluded from p. 3C]
On    the different     Degrees of the Desiccation         of pure Alumine
                           in its different Stales.
 x\LUMINE, precipitated by ammonia and by the carbo
nate of ammonia, exhibits itself under two very different as
pects, according to the quantity of water in which the alu*-
minous salt is dissolved, though the weight of the precipitates
be the fame when they are dried in a temperature or from
65 to 75 of Fahrenheit.
     If the quantity of water does not exceed what is necessary
for the solution of the aluminous salt, a white earth is ob
tained, light, friable, exceedingly spongy, and which ad
heres to the tongue.              I shall distinguish it by the name of
spongy alumine.
     But if the aluminous salt is dissolved in a very large quan
tity of water, there is obtained, after the precipitate has been
dried at the above temperature, a transparent mass*, yellow
and brittle, which when in fragments is somewhat volumi
 nous, breaks or splits in the hand as sulphur does in the like
 cafe ; it has a smooth and conchoid-formed fracture, without
 any earthy aspect, does not adhere in any manner to the
 tongue, and neither swells up nor resolves itself into water :
 it presents a volume of only a tenth or a twelfth of what the
 fame weight of the spongy alumine does, and resembles gum
 arabic or dried jelly.         I (hall give it the name of gelaiirious
 alumine.
     * Opacity is nor, then, essential to alumine, but when, in this or in the
  gelatinous state, it has been exposed to a violent heat.      I do not know
  whether it was in this state that it was considered bv Fourcioy, when he
 fays, in his Syjicmt: tics Omnoi ffiincts Cbimiqnts, that alumine appears
 opaque in its ultimate molecul*; that it reflects the light entirely ; and
  that it communicates that property to stones, into which it enters in a large
  quantity.    But there arc many exceptions which destroy this general ndr.
  1 mail remark, that alumine,      considered cither in its spongv state or in
  that of its complete desiccation, appears opaque only by the division of its
 parts.     With a good microscope, which magnified 200 times, 1 observed
  gelatinous alumine in sine powder, after being exposed to a heat expressed
  by 170 degrees of Wedgewocd's pyrometer.            It was transparent in its
  smallest moleculæ, though the powder of alumine had experienced neither
  agglutination nor fusion.    The sapphire, the topaze, the cymophane, and
the ruby, contain more alumine than is found in any opaque stone or rook
  v the surface of the earth ; and yet these gems are transparent ! By being
  too eager to establish general rules, we fall into confusion.
                                                                              If

     IF ammonia be employed to precipitate gelatinous alumine,
it is not necessary to dilute the solution with so large a quan-     "
 tity of water as when the carbonate is used, because the dis
 engagement of the carbonic acid contributes to give to the
 preeipitate a spongy appearance.      But liquid ammonia highly
 concentrated can itself furnish a spongy alumine, when the
 solution of alumine is much concentrated, because the ele
 ments of the precipitate have not sufficient room to float
 freely in the liquor, and to dispose themselves in such a man
 ner that the light may not be refracted in passing from one
 molrcula to another.
      Spongy aluminc and gelatinous alumine, dried at the tem
 perature of the atmosphere, contain the same quantities of
 water, as I shall soon prove.      But the former, on account of
 its minute division, abandons, at the first degrees of incan
  descence, all the water it can contain ; while the latter, more
  compadt, retains a part at the highest degree of heat that our
  furnaces can produce.
      A hundred parts of spongy alumine lose in weight, at a
  red heat, lower than that which makes silver enter into fusion,
  fifty-eight parts ; and it does not lose a greater quantity at
  130 degrees of Wedgewood's pyrometer, a heat capable of
  fusing iron.
      A hundred parts of gelatinous alumine, at the first degrees
  of incandescence, lose forty-three parts of their weight ; and
  only forty-eight parts and a quarter at 130 degrees ofWedge-
  wood's pyrometer.
      To demonstrate that spongy alumine and gelatinous alu
  mine, when dried at a temperature between 10 and 20 de
  crees of Reaumur, contain the fame quantities of water,          I
  Bissolved in nitric acid 100 parts of gelatinous alumine, dried
  at a temperature between 1 5 and 20 degrees of Wedgewood's
  pyrometer, assisting the solution by mixing it with potash at
  a fusing heat.    The purified alumine was precipitated with
  the precautions already prescribed for obtaining this earth
  under the spongy form,       ft was then dried at a temperature
   between the 15th and 20th of Wedgewood's pyrometer, and
  it weighed then only twenty-five parts.        A hundred parts of
   gelatinous alumine, dried at the first degrees of incandescence, .
   retain, then, about fifteen parts of water; which agrees with
   the results above announced.
       I have entered into these details, which are doubtless mi
   nute, only because great errors may have been committed in
   chemical analyses by estimating, as hitherto appears to have
   been the cafe, the quantity of alumine by the weight of this
   dried earth obtained at that red heat which generally indicates
   the first degrees of incandescence.    This method is exact only

   when the alumine is in the spongy state : it is liable to an
   error of fifteen hundredths when it is in a gelatinous state;
   and in that cafe, nothing can be done but to dry it at a tem
   perature between the 65th and 90th degree of Reaumur, and
   to diminish its weight in the ratio of 58 per cent.; or, what
  is still better, to effect its solution, and precipitate it in the
  spongy state.       If this earth, then, dried at the temperature of
  the atmosphere, does not lose at a red heat about 58 hun
  dredths of its weight, it may be presumed that it is pure.

                                  Pjrometry.
      Gelatinous alumine experiences, at a heat successively aug
  mented, losses of weight which, at equal intervals of heat, fol
  low a decreasing progression ; to know the law of which would
 be very important, because they might serve for estimating, in
 a precise manner, the different degrees of heat. I ascertained,
 by repeated experiments, made with care, that the quantity
 of water it loses is invariable; that is to sav, that when the
 earth has attained its maximum in regard to loss of weight at
 a certain degree of heat, the continuance of the heat atthat
 degree has no influence in producing any further desiccation.
Though the experiments I made in other respects, to obtain
 some information on the possibility of applying gelatinous
 alumine* to pyrometry, were far from affording me satisfac
 tion, I (hall describe them with all their imperfections. They
will be of some use to those who may have perseverance
 enough to pursue these researches.— A hundred parts of gela

     These experiments were each made on 50 grains only, and
with     a balance which I cannot warrant to have been free
from an error less than a quarter of a grain.                They are far,
therefore, from that degree of precision which is necessary to
determine the law of the progression in question.
     These results, in regard to the uniformity of their progress,
do not agree with Wedgewood's pyrometer: but I must ob
serve, that this instrument is too uncertain to be employed
for determining the law of desiccations.
  . C. Necker,        to whom I am indebted for the use of that
which I employed, exposed to the same heat, and for the
same time, eight pyrometric cylinders in a crucible of pla-
tina. He saw with me that they indicated 127 — 126 — 1 11 —
107
       — 98 — 96 —93 — 90 degrees of their scale. Some of them
were vitrified ; others remained in the state of porcelain, or
changed their form more or less ; others experienced none of
these accidents.         These results arise from the inequality of
the mixture of which the paste of the cylinders is formed.
It can hardly be supposed that two artists, though furnished
with the fame formula, can be able to make similar cylin
ders, because of the different degrees of the pulverization of
the silex, which will never be the fame, and will always have
a great influence on the result.               C. Gazeran obtained this
 equality, which he even surpassed, only by laborious and
 multiplied trials, though founded on an analysis of Wedge-
 wood's cylinders*.
      It is here seen, that if the property which, alumine possesses
 at low temperatures, of losing only a determinate quantity of
 water at a constant degree ot heat, continues unimpaired at
 a more elevated heat, it is possible that, by employing for
 a doubt in regard to low temperatures ; but I think It in a great pait er
 roneous, in regard to the shrinking of pyrometric clay at a temperature
 above the z9th degree of that inttrument.       The experiment on which [
 found this idea is as follows : — 1 weighed, with a b.ilancc sensible to the
eighth of a grain, the pyrometric piece of the last experiment.     Before put
into the sire, it weighed 3»| grains. I took it out at the 29th degree, and
 it had then lost i{ grains.    After that term to the 17.0th of the (ame scale
it did not sensibly change its weight, and yet during that interval it had
 lost more than the fourth of its volume.      This shrinking, therefore, does
 not arise merely from the expulsion of the water, but rather, and almost
 exclusively, from the new combinations or modifications which the earthy
 elements of the argil experience at a high temperature.
     At the 170th degree, the platina crucible containing the alumine gave,
 at its exterior surface, proofs of very great emollition, and almost of fusion.
 This surface, in some of its pans, exhibited a confused crystallization simi
  lar to that exhibited bv Carrara marble when polished.       The platina co
 vering, though very thick, sunk down, and was slightly fused in some
 places.

each experiment about 200 grains of alumine, and a balance
sensible to the twentieth- of a grain, as great exactness will
be attained as that given by Wedgewood's pyrometer in its
state of perfection ; but it is seen, also, that these observations
cannot be extended beyond the 130th degree of that pyro
meter, because at a higher the losses in weight of the alumine
are little or not at all lensible in small quantities.

   The method propose would be particularly useful when
it were wished to determine the degrees comprehended be
tween the 257th degree of Fahrenheit and the weakest incan
descence ; degrees not comprehended in Wedgewood's scale,
and which cannot be, on account of the dilatation experienced
by argil before it attains to a red heat.             I
                                                shall here mention
some precautions which ought to be employed in order to
make these observations with exactness.
   1st, The desiccation of gelatinous alumine at the tempe
rature of the atmospheie is uncertain : it may not be equal
in all the parts of the earth ; it is proper then to pulverize                       it,
and to set out from     a  fixed degree of desiccation.      For that
purpose,   a small part must be exposed to      heat of 2570 F.
                                                      a                              by
putting    ittogether with thr.t thermometer into         glass tube,
                                                                  is a a
closed at one of its extremities, and immersed in         sand-bath
heated     byan Argand's lamp, the heat of which           graduated
at pleasure.    The loss of weight sustained                 by
                                                       the alumine,
dried at the temperature of 2570,           to be deducted
                                                 is                all          in
operations performed with earth dried at the temperature of
the atmosphere. The dried earth may be preserved in bottle                 a
with   aground stopper.
I    have indicated the 257th degree of Fahrenheit as the
lowest term, because, at degrees lower than that of boiling
water, the loss of weight in the alumine dried at the tempera
ture of the atmosphere takes place with great flowness.
   To desiccate two drams and     half employed

                Half   an hour               -        482
     The termination of this    process may be readily perceived
when the tube which      contains the alumine ceases to be ob
scured     by
           the vapours that escape.
   2d,  In operations at degrees lower than incandescence,                           it
is proper to weigh the earth at the moment when             comes          it
from   the  fire, because  at the end  of an  hour or  two   takes          it
from the atmosphere     a quantity  of water, which   may produce
an error of one or two hundredths.

XXIV.       Some Account    of  the  Life of  the  late Dr. Joseph
                               Black.      .
  X HIS eminent chemist was born atBourdeaux, in France,
in the year 1728.       His parents were both natives of Great
Britain, and at an early age he was brought over to this
country, and educated for the medical profession at the uni
versity   of Glasgow. Dr. Cullen being at that time lecturer
of chemistry, Black became one of his favourite pupils, was
allowed the free use of his laboratory, and assisted him in his
experiments ; by which means he acquired a decided taste
for this branch of natural philosophy.          In 1754 he took the
degree of doctor of physic in the university of Edinburgh,
where he had studied tor some time ; and the choice, which
he made in regard to the subject of his inaugural dissertation
gave a proof of his attachment to chemical pursuits.            It was
De humore      acido a cibu  orto et magnesia   alba.   The principles
of the doctrine which he brought forward in this thesis
he afterwards fully explained in a paper read the next year
 before a society in Edinburgh, and publiflied in the second
 volume of Ejsaj/s Physical and Literary, 1J56; containing
 experiments on magnesia alba, quick-lime, and alkaline sub
 stances.     In this paper, by an ingenious and philosophical
 series of researches, he evidently proved the existence of an
 aerial fluid, which he called fixed air, the presence of which
 gave mildness, and its absence causticity, to alkalies and cal
 careous earths. This noble discovery certainly paved the way
 to all that important knowledge respecting aerial bodies
 which has done so much honour to the names of a Caven
 dish, a Priestley, and a Lavoisier, and which have made che
 mical philosophy assume an entirely new form.
    In the year 1756, on the removal of Dr. Cullen to Edin
 burgh, Dr. Black became professor of medicine and lecturer
 on chemistry in the university of Glasgow.             Next year he
 enriched the science of chemistry with the curious doctrine
 of latent heat, in which he explained, in what has been hi
 therto reckoned a clear and satisfactory manner, the connec
 tion of heat with fluidity, the phænomena of freezing and
 boiling, and the manner in which they affect the thermo
 meter. These discoveries, the result of great natural sagacity
 and experimental skill, certainly laid the foundation of all
 those important facts relating to this part of chemistry which
 were afterwards brought to light by several of the most emi
 nent philosophers of the present period, and would alone be
  sufficient to give celebrity to the name of Black.           His re

   158           Life of  the late Dr. Joseph Black.
  putation, indeed, was now raised so high, that a vacancy
  having taken place in the chemical chair of Edinburgh, by
  the removal of Dr. Cullen, in 1765, to another department,
  Dr. Black was looked up to as the only man capable of sus
  taining, in this branch of science, the superiority which that
  celebrated school of medicine had acquired in all others. He
 was therefore elected to succeed Cullen, and for many years
 discharged the duties of the office with universal approbation,
  being much admired for the care, perspicuity, and elegance,
 with which he communicated instruction in his lectures, and
 his neatness and accuracy in performing experiments.      Very
 complete manuscript copies of his lectures were taken by
 many of his students, particularly in the early part of his
 teaching, when they contained a great deal of matter then
 little known to the chemical world ; and these copies, read
 with avidity by the lovers of this science, have greatly con
 tributed to secure to him the honour of those discoveries, and
 that original mode of reasoning, which he scarcely ever made
 public in any other form.
     After his election to the chemical chair, he published no
 thing but a paper on the Effect of Boiling upon Water, in
disposing it to freeze more readily, printed in the sixty-fifth
 volume of the Philosophical Transactions for 17745 and An
 Analysis of the Water of some Hot Springs in Iceland, in the
 Philosophical Transactions of Edinburgh for 1791. The latter
 contains some observations, highly interesting to the chemist,
 on the formation of the siliceous stone deposited by these
 wonderful springs ; and has long been considered as a model
 of neatness and accuracy in the analysis of mineral waters.
Two of his letters on chemical subjects have been published
by Crell and Lavoisier.
    Dr. Black was long a strenuous opposer of the new theories
in chemistry; but he at length became an avowed convert to
the principles of the French chemists, and did not hesitate
to make amends by his applause for his former opposition.
He never distinguislied himself as a practical physician. His
manners were simple, his temper cold and reserved, and his
habits of life adapted to his own convenience.          He was
never married ; and died suddenly, in his sixty-second year,
on the 6th of December 1799, his health having been in a
declining state for some time before. He was a member of the
Philosophical Societies of London and Edinburgh, and, by
the solicitation of Lavoisier, had the distinguislied honour of
being chosen one of the eight foreign members of the Aca
demy of Sciences of Paris.

Jl ERMIT       me to call your attention, and that of your
readers,  to the advantages which might result to France by
encouraging the multiplication of fish ; a branch of public
œconomv too much neglected, notwithstanding the experi
ments of our neighbours, and the success they have obtained.
It is an unexplored mine presented to national industry. What
products might we not expect, if our patriotic efforts, directed
towards       should have for their object an increase of the na
             it,

                                              it                               by
means of artificial ponds, fish produced          salt water, giving
the preference to those species which                  by in
                                                   their habits and
manner of living might be fittest for this kind of natural
ization.
    We have already had instances of fish being conveyed from
 one river to another, or from           river to
                                             a          lake, and vice
                                                               a
 versa.     This method has been employed with success in
 Germany in regard to the shad, with which ponds and pieces
 of stagnant but clear water, with bottom of sand and gravel,

 preferred       by
                 the shad to all others, have been peopled.         In
 the year 1779 Dr. Bloch wrote me from Berlin that this ex
 periment had been attended with complete success.                 not

The fresh-water gourami in       the Isle of France, where it has
multiplied prodigiously,     came originally    from Bengal.     It
was M. Poivre, that philosophic administrator, who bad the
honour of enriching the rivers of this island with a fisiY
which in goodness and sliape may be compared to the (had.
That small fish, the brilliant gold and silver colours of which
all admire, the Chinese dorado, was brought to Europe from
the northern part of China.       If so much was done for a use
less fisli, valued merely on account of its shining robe, by
making it traverse the seas to embellish, in compliance with
fashion, our halls and our cabinets, why mould we not do
the fame to obtain fish useful to man, which would recom
pense our troubles and our sacrifices ? The Romans, fated
with victories and triumphs, received from tributary Asia the
rarest species of fisli to make a figure on their tables at their
feasts.     What the Romans did for the luxury of the rich, let
us do for the general good, for the utility of the poor ; and
let us distribute to every river in France the beneficent germs
of a new fecundity, which will double their productions and
 their produce.
    Our rivers do not contain more than about twenty indi
genous species, and some migratory fishes, which at certain
 periods of the year ascend to a certain distance from their
 mouths, or, like the salmon, swim towards their sources as
 far as they can.    The small rivers possess still fewer species ;
 the greatest part even are confined to the tench, the trout,>
 eels, and some smaller fisli of little value.       How advan
 tageous would it be to introduce into these rivers a multitude
 of foreign fifli, which in these waters would find aliment
 more agreeable to their taste, and which would enjoy a tem
 perature as analogous to their wants as favourable to their
 reproduction ?
    The Seine, which I shall take as an example, nourishes
 many species of salmon and cyprini ; but how many other
 fisli of the same kind might be propagated in it ! If the
 Seine possesses the salmon, it wants the thymallusv the
 umber of Auvergne, the lavaret, the murena of Germany,
 the grilse of Scotland, the pala of Swisserland, the ferra of
 the lake of Geneva, &c.       Why sliould not the carpio of the
 lake di Guarda, the scbwar%-rittcr (charr) of the lakes of
 Berchstoldgadcn, an excellent kind of salmon, highly praised
 by baron de Moll, a naturalist of Salzbourg, succeed in
 France, if that bottom, which they are most attached to,
 were procured for them, at the foot of the Ardennes or the
 Vofgues? Why might they not be afterwards gradually in
                                                          troduced

                       for multiplying Fijb.                    l5i
troduced into our small rivers ? Can it be believed that the,
numerous tribe of the trout kind, the white, red, black, yel
low spotted; the whitling, charr, bull, phinnoc, par, spar
ling, &c. which swarm in the rivers in Scotland, would re
fuse to supply our colonies with their species?        No. There
can be no doubt that they would brine thither that fecun
dity, abundance, and riches, which render them so valuable
to their native streams.      The cafe would be the fame with
the boudettes and h'tiglings offered to us by the lakes of Swis-
serland ; the gudgeon, the cyprinus ballarus, and the salmo
umbla, bred in the rivers of lower Germany.           Let us open,
then, with these countries a philosophical and liberal ex
change of the best fish of France for those of which we wish
to be possessed.
    The second method of multiplying the number and quan
tity of the natural productions of rivers, would be, as already
said, to convey into the fresh waters those fish produced in
salt water.
   Nature herself gives us examples, and we have nothing to
fear if we take it as our guide.     Fi(h, originally produced in
salt water, have voluntarily established themselves in fresh,
where they have lost all remembrance of the tumult of the
waves amidst which those of their species play and sport.
Several lakes of Scotland possess salmon, which, abandoning
their erratic taste for a calm and settled life, have there become
gradually naturalized.       The salmon of the rivers Cluden and
Nith, as well as those of the Dee, are evidently indigenous,
as is proved by their external form.       The sturgeon, the ster
let, and different kinds of salmon, which Pallas observed in
the Kama, reside there, according to this naturalist, without
interruption, and never descend to the Caspian sea.            This
celebrated   traveller found the sea-dog in the lake Baikal,
though it is never caught in the Enissei nor in the lower
Angora.      He supposes, indeed, that it has been conveyed
into that lake in consequence of some considerable variation
in the level of the globe, or by some other extraordinary
event.    On one hand, we see the foudre, a salt water fish,
inhabit at present the Seine, and lose itself in the banks of
Tournidos,    twenty-four miles above Rouen : on the other,
Liancourt found      the herring in the Elk, Potowmack, Hud
son's river, and the Delaware, rivers of North America ;
and, according to Twiss, the fame fisli is caught in the fresh
water lakes of Ireland : it is found in prodigious shoals in the
basons of Loch Lomond and Loch-Eck, in Scotland ; it
 ascends also the river Forth along with the salmon, and even
 to a very great distance from the sea.     In Prussia, it has been
    Vol. X.                        L                            seen

1 6z               On the Means   to be employed
 seen  in the Oder, in the environs of Stetten, at the distance
of more than ninety miles from        the mouth of that river;
 and I have been often told by the fishers of Mark and Enck-
 huysen, that the herring is found in the river Vollenhoven
 on the other side of the Zuyder Zee, especially towards the
 end of the fishing season.
    There is no doubt, then, that these different salt water fish
 might be easily naturalized in fresh water; and that the case
 would be the same in regard to many other species, if proper
 care were taken, after their removal, to bestow on them that
 attention necessary to ensure success to the experiment.    We
 have a proof of this in the ponds of East Friesland.  The large
plaice, transported thither from the North Sea, have multi
plied by myriads ; and they now people those pieces of water
 which before were totally unproductive,      While encouraged
 by those examples, is there any reason to doubt of success ?
Has not the industry os man, seconded by perseverance, ob
tained results far more astonishing than those which might be
expected from such experiments ? By care and attention be
has been able to naturalize birds of passage, produced in di
 stant latitudes, and which are now domesticated.      Divesting
themselves of their savage and free state, the stork, the goose,
the duck, and the stieeldrake {anas tadorna), have increased,
in the course of time, the number of our poultry and the in
habitants of our farm-yards.      The rabbit has forgot its pa
ternal burrows, the pigeon and the turtle-dove have deserted
the hospitable hollows of the oak to inhabit among us; and
from this amiable bird, lo that superb animal which shares
in the labours of man, how many living beings have ex
changed their manners for habits and wants which we have
forced them to adopt ? Wan, the sovereign of nature, has
not confined his dominion to that which he exercised over
animals ; and though the domain of the vegetable kingdom
seems placed beyond the limits of his power, trees and vege
tables of every kind have been subjected to trials and experi
ments, the success of which seems almost miraculous. Guided
by the spirit of invention, and enlightened by genius, art has
every where triumphed.        What has been done, therefore,
for the surface of the earth, by collecting in different points
vegetables brought from every part of the globe, and asto
nished at living together, let us do also for the population
of our internal waters.
    In the year 1799 I had the honour of reading, in one of
the sittings of the National Institute, a memoir on the means
and advantages of naturalizing the herring, a fait water fish,
iu the waters of the Seine, near its mouth, &c. The account ,
                                                               of

                     for multiplying Fi/b.                    163
of   the processes for accomplishing this end, which I there
pointed out, are not susceptible of analysis, and therefore
cannot be introduced into this essay; it will be sufficient for
me to say, that the report of Lacepede, Cuvier, and Tessier,
was entirely in their favour.     At present, I am still moie
convinced of the efficacy of the means which I then pro
posed ; and I have no doubt that, if artificial ponds were
formed on the edges of rivers, the experiment would be at
tended with complete success.       Every man who catches a
fish, says Dr. Franklin, draws from the water a piece of
money.      Let not the maxims and example of this philoso
pher be lost to posterity; let them rather produce fruit, like
strong and vigorous feed sown in a fertile soil.     Having ob
served in New England that the herrings ascended from the!
sea into one river of that country, while a single individual
was never seen in another river, separated from the former by
a narrow tongue of land, and which communicated also with
the sea, this philosopher took the leaves of some plants on
which the herrings had deposited their ova, already fecun
dated, and conveyed them to the river which was deprived
of the annual visit of these fish. The success of this experi
ment surpassed his expectation ; the ova were completely
productive, and the following year the river was peopled with
a numerous shoal of herrings, which since that time have
continued to frequent it.
    This fish is not the only one which I wish to sec natural
ized in fresh water; to the herring I should add several spe
cies of the pluronectes, such as the brill, the barbue, and
other flat fish, which, possessing traits of the family of the
flounder, have also similar wants and habits: I should add
also the mullet, the goby, the whiting, the gar-fish, and
perhaps one or two species of the gurnet.        I would pay the
greatest attention possible to the nature of the water proper
for each species.    This happy choice is the principal condi
tion, and that which could ensure success ; but I would select
in particular for this colonization the fish found in lakes,
which, though little known, arc more numerous than is
commonly supposed, and ought to be so.
    At the epoch of the grand revolutions of the globe, when
a part of the primitive earth emerged from the middle of the
ocean, and pieces of water were formed without any current,
the species of sissies were variously dispersed.    Every lake in
Swisserland and Bavaria possesses some species so peculiar to
it as not to be found in any neighbouring lake.         Confined
within their narrow basons, these insulated species lead a
melancholy vegetative sort of life, almost exiled from the.
                              L2                           world.

world.     It is therefore through a very just predilection for
these si(h, prisoners in their lakes, that they should be the
first employed for the execution of my plan.
    This plan, indeed, would be attended with two advantages,
besides the increase of provisions, which would at length be
the result of it.     1st, The increase in individuals, as in spe
cies, would necesfarilv introduce ceconomical ways of pre
paration, to render the" use of these fish more general and
more extensive.        Manv of those consumed fresh, would be
salted, pickled, or dried, with success.        The Scots grilse is
exported to distant countries.         Salmon, smoked after the
manner of the Livonians, is in great request at Hamburgh,
though there are fat salmon in the Elbe.             The gudgeon
would be dried, as is practised in the Isle of Oesel ; the
plaice, the brill, and the sole, according to the Dutch me
thod of Katwyk, imitated on the banks of the Volga in dry
ing the bream, &c. The loudelle would be pickled along
with the sliad.      Pallas fays that the latter is very proper for
being smoked ; and on this occasion he mentions the Mar-
douan-Tschouvasches, who drv in the open air such of these
fish as they are not able immediately to consume.           All fisli
of the salmon kind, the sparling excepted, and many of the
genus of the cyprinus, would be susceptible of different kinds
of preparation, which would give them an additional value
in commerce. — 2d, If society in general, on the one hand,
gained an increase of provision ; science, on the other, would
derive great advantages in regard to the improvement of phy
sical knowledge.       More species being collected, thev would
be less apt to escape the eye of the observer, who would thus
be hotter able to examine every thing interesting in these ani
mals in regard to their organization, nutrition, multiplica
tion, and habits, and to whatever constitutes their harmo
nics and contrasts.       We are little acquainted with the in
dustry  of  fishes ; they  are too far beyond our reach.    We do
not, however, presume, as was said very justly by Bonnet,
that all their employment is confined merely to eating each
oilier.
    Let us procure, then, these sisti : it is well known that in
Germany fish are transported alive to a distance of sixty miles
and more.       Let us place these adoptive species in convenient
ponds,   where     they will forget their lakes ; where they will
find their, accustomed food, tutelary shelter, and those aquatic
herbs the stiade of which they were fond of in the days of
their infancy, and which will invite them to renrodnee in
their turn.     Hot beds are formed for vegetables ; let ns form
a new kind for fislies.      A moderate sum will be sufficient to
                                                             enable

           Natural Produilions of          the   Island os Ceylon.        165
enable us to collect a great many species ; and we shall soon
be paid, with interest, for our expenses and sacrifices. Fishery
is the agriculture of the waters : the fishes themselves will be
at the trouble of sowing the seed, and man will have nothing
to do but to collect the harvest.
XXVI.       Some Account of the natural Productions of the Island
     of Ceylon, particularly in the Environs of Columbo.       By
     a Gentleman now resident on the Island.   1800 *.
T,    H E grain and fruits which are common to the penin
sula are found in Ceylon.
   Of rice there are four kinds, three of which are cultivated
on the mountains, and do not require continual inundation.
That this nutritious aud wholesome article is not super
abundant in the kingdom of Candy, arises from the imper
fections of its government.           If
                                 its growth were properly en
couraged, this country, instead of having recourse to Bengal
for supplies, might be enabled to export large quantities of
 this grain.
    The cocoa-trees are very numerous within the district sub
ject to the British government, and from whence the coasts
 of Malabar and Coromandel are supplied with spirits distilled
 from their fruit.  In Candv this tree cannot be cultivated,
 from the great number of elephants which inhabit the woods,
 and are forbidden to be destroyed by order of the king.
    The areka-tree is seen in every part os the island, and a
clandestine trade is carried on with the Candian country, in
 the nuts which it yields.   These, with such as arc produced
 in the part subordinate to the British government, form a
considerable branch of commerce.
    This tree finds an enemy in the government of Candy,
 which discourages its cultivation ; but the foil is so favourable
 to its growth, that it may be said to flourish, in spite of the
elephant that tramples on        and man who neglects to pre
                                it,
 serve it.
    The coffee which     produced here, approaches in flavour
                        is
to that  of Moca.
     Though the quantity of  sugar-cane planted at Calitura                is
very small, and is only employed to procure spirits,       suf       it
                                                                     is
ficient to prove that, this necessary
                        if            article were encouraged,
it might be produced in sufficient quantities to supply the de
mands of this island, and supersede the necessity of importing
              *   From the Asiatic Annual- Register, 1S00.
                                  L3                                       it

 small portion of saccharine juice from the buds of the tree
 called kitoul (the carriotta of Linnæus), the pith of which is
 but little inferior to the sago of the eastern isles.
      The pepper plant flourishes here, but its fruit is not equal
 to that of the Moluccas : at the fame time it may be consi
  dered as an important article of commerce.
      The cardamum grows only at Matura, and a few other
  parts ; and is inferior to that which is produced on the coast.
  '
       Though the cultivation of the sweet potatoes is very simple,
  the quantity produced is not more than sufficient for home
  consumption.
       The margora or agedorac         (melia of Flora Zeylanica)     is
  considered     as one  of the most valuable plants that Ceylon can
  boast of.      It is esteemed as an admirable fuccedaneum for
  the quinquina ; and its leaves are so obnoxious to moths and
  destructive     insects, that they will preserve woollen cloths,
  linen, and books, from being infested by them.
       Fruit-trees are in great abundance, though their produce
  is not in general admired by Europeans, who are accustomed
   to those of a superior flavour.        The fruit of Ceylon is how
   ever, in general, superior to that of the peninsula, particu
   larly its lemons, oranges, and pompel-mos.
       The goraka is a pulpy fruit, whose flavour is blended with
   an agreeable acid.       It is of a round shape, and deeply in
   dented.      The peal is employed as a culinary article by the
   natives.      The tree that bears it exudes a yellowish resin,
    which produces a tolerable varnish. This tree has been ge
   nerally confounded- with the gockat- tree, that distils the gam
    boge, and from which several hundred weight of this gum
    might be annually drawn.          There is also a great variety of
    trees which grow spontaneously in the woods : they bear dif
    ferent fruits, though generally more or less of an acid taste,
    and much used by the people of the country in the confec
    tionary, which forms such an important article in their en
    tertainments.
        The nux vomica, which must he ranked among the poi
    sonous plants, is a native of this ifland ; but is applied to no
    use whatever.       In the same class may be placed the palma
    chrtsti, from whence the castor oil is extracted ; which forms
    a small article of trade.
        The bane is a kind of pulse, and might be rendered an
    article of very great utility.     The stem of this plant is from
     three feet and a half to four feet in length, and furnishes a
    flax, which is twisted into a long rope. It is particularly
    employed by fishermen for their nets and lines, from the

 extraordinary quality it possesses of never decaying or rotting
 in water.        It appears to be deficient in elasticity; but that
 may      arise  from   its never having been sufficiently steeped.
 From some experiments which have been made, its strength
 appears to be in the proportion of five to four with European
 cordage.
    The district of Matura produces six different kinds of shrub,
 on which insects deposit the laca. The description of this
 insect by Roxburgh, in the second volume of the Asiatic
 Researches, is very correct.        The Ceylon laca is the fame as
 that which is found in Pegu ; but, though it is found in
 great abundance on the shrubs where it is deposited, the in
 habitants collect no more than is necessary for their parti
 cular use.
    The plantations of cinnamon abound with a plant which
delicacy forbids us to describe.        It is called baudura by the
 Cingalese, and has received the scientific denomination of
 nejjtiitbes dijlillatoria by the botanists.         It is inaccurately
 represented by Burman, and in Pennant's View, of Hindu
 stan.     It has been equally considered and examined by the
 antiquarian, the man of letters, and the botanist.              It flou
 rishes beneath the (hade of the cinnamon-tree, whose culture
it interrupts.
    The trees and plants in Ceylon are very numerous.                  In
the district of Columbo alone, there are not less than three
hundred species.          Many of them appear iu the very inade
quate catalogue of Palus Hermanus ; from whence they have
been transferred,        without any distinctive description, to the
Thesaurus Ztylanicus of Burman, and so on, to the Flora
Zeylanica of Linnæus, and other botanical works.                Indeed,
of one hundred Cingalese names given by Hermanus, and
adopted by Burman and Linnæus, there are not ten in use
among the natives; and the rest are almost unintelligibly
rendered in the German orthography.
    Of the timber used in domestic articles, &c. thirty-nine
of the most remarkable species have been collected. Among
them the kaloumidirie is distinguished by very fine black and
yellowish veins; the Europeans call it caleminder.            The kad-
bumbirie has the fame streaks as           the  former,   but not quite
so large.       Very beautiful articles   of   furniture  are  made of
them both.
    There are also the satin wood, called bouroutb ; the tek a, or
teak, employed for masts, and every kind of shipwright's and
carpenter's work ; the jack, one of the bread-fruit trees, the
wood of which, when freffi, is of a beautiful yellow, but
changes in the course of time to a reddish huej and the

   The elephant must take the lead among the quadrupeds in
every part of the world which it inhabits.      In Ceylon there
are two species ; the one called alleia, which has no leeth,
or at least very small ones ; and the other called aeta, which
has teeth of a considerable length.       In the interior parts of
the island they are very numerous ; and there are a sufficient
number of them in the English possessions to do considerable
mischief to every kind of agriculture.
   The royal tiger is not an inhabitant of this ifland ; but the
leopard is very common, and some of them have been taken
tbat measured five feet in length.
   There are two kinds of wild cat, one of which is not ge
nerally known, or, at least, has been very imperfectly de
scribed.
   The wild buffalo is found in the forests, and is as furious
as that of Bengal.
   The wild boar is equally dangerous with the buffalo, and
the woods also abound with them.
   There is the axis, or Ganges deer, and a stag whose colour
is gray, tinged with a ssiadeof red.   It bears a greater resem
blance to the hart of Corsica, than to any other of its class.
   Of monkeys, there are three peculiar kinds, with long tails,
and pouches under the chin. The hair of one is of a reddish
hue, and that of the other two is very long : the one is white,
and the other black ; but all of them have long beards,
which spread over their cheeks.       They are very sagacious,
well-tempered, and tractable, as well as full of trick and
  amusing playfulness.
     The sloth is not very common; it is from seven to eight
'inches in length, and is born with a thick covering of hair.
     The pangolin is very common in Ceylon, and called kabal-
  •vae'ia.  It is accurately described by several naturalists ; but

                         Button,    ill designed.

  quadrupeds; whereas          actually walks on the metatarsus,
                              it
  turning the toes downwards. This animal can never be pre
  served alive, from the impracticability of providing    sufficient

           is is
  ropeans,      called mongoos.     It has been generally believed
  that this animal instinctively applies to the medicinal aid of
a   certain plant, which acts as        counter-poison when
                                        a                        has

It   is,

                                    them, that the mongoos has
been seen to attack the cobra di capello         when, though      ;                           se

   Of squirrels there are two species. One, which             called                is
laena, has    ared nose quite flat, and long black tail, which                                 is
only found in the woods the other, called dandu laena, with
                                        ;
yellow longitudinal streaks, frequents gardens, where            de                      it
stroys every kind of fruit.
   The hares are large, but inferior, as food, to those of          a
Europe.    There are otters, but they are very rare, and seldom
seen.   The porcupine       to be found every where in the
                                       is
woods, and may be readily tamed into all the familiarity of
a  domestic animal.
   There are two species of rats, which infest the house and
the garden    one of them
              :               called the mujk-rat, which
                                            is                                            is    so
well known in the peninsula.
   There     one of four species of bats known here, which
            is                                                                                 is
called the flying fox its French name

known in the peninsula, and feeds only on fruit.
   The birds are among the most beautiful productions of this
island; but their prevailing haunts are in the eastern parts                                    :
the number of them           comparatively small in the vicinity of
                                  is
Columbo.      Not more than thirty species of them have been
ascertained   since the Englifli have become its inhabitants.
Among these are the pelican, the flamand, the great and Imall
Greek pigeon, the rollleu of Mindanao of JBrisson             beautiful     ;   a
cuckoo,    with  variegated plumage,     called  kouroulongjia      the                  ;

blue head and reddish back; and an abundance of wood
peckers, with golden plumage.

not generally,       at all, known,

knowledge of the cramp-fish.
    The number of serpents         very great, and the larger part

   I^O           Some Account    of the natural Productions
   viewed     in front, has the appearance of a pair of spectacles j
  but, being regarded from behind, is like the head of a cat.
  Its back is of a gray colour, and has some dusky spots on the
  belly. No other kind of this serpent has been seen here. The
  natives consider it as an object of veneration, and do not suffer
  it  to be destroyed.    It loves to inhabit dilapidated buildings.
      The largest of all the serpents is the pimpboura. The writer
  of this memoir has seen one preserved in spirits, of eight feet
  and an half in length, and thirteen inches in circumference,
  which was quite young. It is this species that is accused of
  swallowing bullocks and buffaloes.          But, however that may
 be,    the   Cingalese assert,  in  the most   positive manner, that
 there are serpents which are ten inches in diameter, and that
 some have been taken with a hog in their belly.              Nay, it
 was declared, with equal solemnity, that one of them had
 been opened, in which was found the horn of a buffalo.
     The most curious serpent of this island is the potanga,
 which is said to grow to a most enormous size. One of
 them, when only tour feet and a half in length, and half
 an inch in diameter, had seven young ones in it. These two
 species are remarkable for two short thick prickles, conti
 guous to the anus.
     There is also the depatna'ia, a third kind of the anguis of
 Linnæus. Some have described it as possessing two heads.
 It appears to consider its tail as a defence, from the violence
 of its motion whenever it is attacked.
     Thesisticrmen caught an extraordinary serpent, some time
 since, at sea, of the length of fifty-seven inches and a half,
of which there docs not appear to be any description in any
work of natural history; though Pennant's View of Hindustan
contains an account of one that bears some small resemblance
to it.      s
     Of the lizard tribe, the crocodile is the most considerable ;
it is the inhabitant of all (he lakes and rivers in Ceylon, but
is seldom seen in the vicinity of the sea. There are two kinds
of laguna ; one of them is seven feet long, and is supposed to
be the same as that which is so well known on the coast of
Coromandel. There is also a small lizard with a prickly back,
like the camelion : to which may be added a small spotted
lizard, which, from its measured and tuneful erv, has ac
quired the name of the singing lizard; and the real camelion.
     The toads are not of a large size, like those of Bombay.
     The insects are innumerable. The genus of the fcarabæxs
is the most abundant, but that of the mantis of Linnæus is
the most curious.        The shapes it produces are very various
and extraordinary.        One of them, of which Colonel Agnew
                                                               made

                     of  the I/land of  Ceylon.                171
made a drawing, is called the animated leaf, from the re
semblance of its wings to the leaf of a tree.
    There are five species of the golden-coloured coreinelle of
Linnæus.
    A grasshopper, with black, prickly, tuberculous horns,
terminated by two large yellow knobs.
    A spider, whose venom and bite are as potent and dangerous
as those of a serpent : fortunately, this insect is very rare.
    A black hairy scorpion, about four inches in length.
    Of butterflies there are about twenty species, some of
which are well known.
    The tbala-na, a species of which is to be found in a trea
tise published in France on foreign butterflies.
    The termes, or what is called the white ant, infests this
island as well as the peninsula.
    Lastly, There are a great number of ticks found on different
animals, such as the rat liguana, water birds, pangolin, &c.
The tick found on the rat is remarkable for the extraordinary
 manner in which it moves, having its mouth and belly turned
 upwards.
     The shore of Trincomalee abounds in stiells; but they arc
 all mentioned in Rumplici's work on Conchology.
     With respect to pearls, it may be observed, that the shell
 in which they are found is a mytilus, and not an oyster. The
 description of it is very corre&ly given in the Asiatic Re
 searches.       All banks are not equally productive of the
 pearl ; for,   though  the shells in which it is generally found
 are very plentiful on the Chilau banks, there is very seldom
 found a single pearl in them; whilst, further up the gulph,
  a pearl is found in almost every shell of a certain size that is
 opened.
     There are the common crystallizations of sapphires, rubies,
  topazes, kouroundous, tourmalines, and rock crystals.
     Rome de l'lfle has given a description of a precious stone
  that unites two distinct colours ; and such a stone is said, and
  generally believed, to have been found by the adigar, or
  prime minister, of the king of Candy, on hi3 return from
  an embassy to Columbo : it unites the colours of the sapphire,
  the ruby, and the topaz. The account adds, that it was in
  stantly presented to the king.
      The soil around Columbo is a brittle clay, with a mixture
  of ferruginous particles. It is generally covered with a sand,
   whose fertility is equal to that of the richest earth.    On the
  sea shore, and in some distinct parts,     there are hillocks of a
  dark gray earth, which appear to compose a stratum imme
  diately beneath that already mentioned.

   There is every reason to suppose that there are extinguished
yolcanoes in Ceylon, from the specimens of volcanic stores
which have been collected at Trincomalee. This opinion is
supported by the account, that there is a lake near the sum
mit of Adam's Peak, whose height is conjectured to be
1500 fathoms above the level of the sea.                        It received this
name from the Portuguese ; but the Cingalese call it Sana-
male.     According to the tradition of the country, it was
Buddah, the founder of the government, and to whom the
inhabitants pay almost divine honours, who left the mark of
one of his feet on this mountain, while the impression of the
other was found in Siam.

XXVII.      Memorandum respetling the Hunting EJlalli/bment
     of Tippoo Sultaun, at Seringapatam ; with an Account of
     the Cbetas sent to bis Majcjly, and now kept in the Tower,
     London *.
 X    H E principal amusement followed by Tippoo Sultaun,
at Seringapatam, for several years, was to hunt antelopes with
chetas     f.
            His predilection for this diversion was manifested
in the precautions taken to preserve the game, and the at
tention paid to render the sport as perfect as possible,                      A
considerable tract of ground to the south-west of Seringapa
tam, and called the rumna, was exclusively appropriated for
the maintenance of the game, and guarded with the utmost
vigilance.   There were several hunting bungalows        in dif  \
ferent parts of the rumna for the sultaun to retire to after the
fatigues of the day.    To each of these was attached a small
establishment of servants, who were responsible for the care
of     the buildings
                  and gardens §.       The number of chetas in
Tippoo's possessions at the  period  of  the capture of Seringa
patam  amounted   to sixteen  5 the  greater part of them were
well trained. Each cheta had an establishment of four men                     ||,
one cart, and four bullocks      and the whole were under the
                                      ;
superintendence  of   meer   shikar,
                              a       or chief huntsman, with                 *
certain number of assistants.
   Whenever Tippoo determined to take the amusement of
hunting, one day's potice was generally given to the hunts
men, to prepare the chetas and bullocks; and on the even
ing preceding the day appointed for this amusement, six or
eight chetas were carried out to some village near the spot
of the rumna fixed on as the rendezvous for the hunters. At
day-break the following morning, the sultaun, accompanied
by  one or two of his sons, and ten or twelve favourite noble
men, proceeded to the rumna.       On these excursions he was
attended        by
               few horsemen, and some officers called Moota-

  §   Each of these gardens contained four small but neat buildings, regu
larly disposed, and fronting each other; the ground between them being
laid out in walks of cypress trees. The ground adjacent to the building1;
was also laid out in gardens      ;and the whole was surrounded      by
                                                                      thick

 furrikas, (independent offipers, not belonging to any corps,)
 who were constantly attached to the sultaun's person, and
 remained near him on all occasions, both at the palace and
 in the field. Very little state was observed, and no persons
 were present but those who received particular invitations.
 The sultaun generally reached the rumna about six o'clock,
 and then immediately the hunt took place as follows :
    Each cheta was carried on a light cart, drawn by two bul
 locks regularly trained for the purpose.     The huntsman of
 each cheta was seated on his respective cart, and the other
 attendants ran close to it on foot. The carts followed each
 other in regular succession, the meer shikar conducting the
leading cart. The cheta was hood-winked, and all the spec
tators and sportsmen kept close to the carts, and endeavoured
to preserve silence in order not to alarm the game.
    The huntsmen followed any direction across the country
•which they thought proper.      On discovering a herd of deer,
they proceeded with more caution, and endeavoured to take
up such a position as should oblige the antelope, when chased,
to run up hill, or over broken ground; in either of which
cases, the probability of success is much in favour of the
cheta.    When they arrive within four or five hundred yards
of the game, the men on foot turned the cheta's head towards
the antelope, uncovered the cheta's eyes, and then let him
loose.
    The great aim of the cheta is to place himself exactly be
 hind his prey ; and the skill and caution he displays in at
taining his object, constitutes one of the principal beauties of
this diversion.   The cheta continues to be very cautious till
 he is within two hundred yards of the antelope ; he then
gets bolder, begins to run, and follows his prey with the
greatest rapidity for about three or four hundred yards, when
he is either successful, or gives up the chafe.      In the latter
cafe, he generally moves about slowly, and prowling, till his
keeper comes up : the cheta then suffers himself to he hood
winked, and conveyed back to the cart.          If the cheta has
been successful, after seizing the antelope, he holds it by the
neck with his mouth, in such a manner as not to hurt                     it,
and keeps the prey down on the ground in this position until
the keeper arrives he:      then hoodwinked
                             is                 the throat of the

when hoodwinked, is perfectly manageable. The spectators
keep at a proper distance till the huntsman has covered the
eyes of the cheta, but they may always choose their ground
in such a manner as to fee the whole of the hunt.
    A cheta will run two or three times in a day, and often
is successful in every chace. He always selects the largest
buck of the herd, though it should not be in so favourable
a position for his purpose as many other smaller deer.                  In
large   herds,   two  or four chetas  are   let   out, and then the  sport
is highly diversified and interesting.
    After hunting until ten or eleven o'clock, the sultaun re
 tired with the party to the next bungalow, where he pasted
the remainder of the day, and in the evening returned to his
 palace in Seringapatam.
                      A  Description of   the Cheta    *.
    The cheta is the animal mentioned by Tavernier, Eemier,
 and other eastern travellers, under the name of the hunting
 leopard.      It differs, however, from the leopard properly so
 called, in the following particulars :
     First, in sliape. — It is of a long make, narrow deep chest,
 and flender waist. Its legs also are very long in proportion
 to the body ; in which particular, as well as in its general
 form, it bears a greater resemblance to the gre-houhd than
 to its cogeners of the feline tribe.
     2dly, The size of the cheta's head is smaller in proportion
 to its body than that of the leopard, or of most other qua
 drupeds. The colour of the iris is of a deeper yellow than
 in the leopard, and its face is distinguished by a dark line
 reaching from the corner of the eye to that of the mouth on
 each fide.
     3dly, The hair on the throat, breast, belly, and the under
 side  of the tail, is much longer than on the other parts of the
 body; it is of a dusky white colour, with few or no spots.
 The hair on the upper part of the neck, and on the flioulders,
 is also somewhat longer than on the body, though not suffi
 ciently so to entitle the cheta to the specific name of Felis
 Zubata, which Linnæus has given it.
     4thly, The spots on the cheta, instead of being disposed
  in circles like those of the leopard and panther, are each
 distinct.     The body and limbs, excepting where the long
 hair extends, are thickly covered with these spots, varying in
 size, of a dark colour, and a round or oval shape, on a light

 tawny brown ground.         The ears, which are short and rounds
 are each marked behind with a broad dark bar; and the tail,
which is long, slender, and somewhat bushy at the end, is
marked with four such bars from the tip upwards.
    ^thly, The last and principal difference between the cheta
 and leopard is in respect to disposition.          The leopard is inca
pable  of  being  tamed,   and  always    retains    its fierce malevolent
habits.    The   cheta  is easily  broken     in,    and trained for the
chace. I have never seen one, however, that could be said
to be thoroughly tamed.          It still retains some sliare of its
natural ferocity and treachery, which it betrays by its rest
lessness, the obliquity of its movements, and the duplicity of
its looks.    It suffers no one to approach it familiarly but its
keeper,   and  even he caresses it with caution and diffidence.
It must be led to the chace chained and hoodwinked ; and
all that can be expected from                 it,
                                        even when           has been care

               FRENCH      NATIONAL INSTITUTE.
   JL HE Institute, in the public sitting of July 4, proposed
 the following questions as the subject os prizes :
                        PRIZE QUESTIONS.
     Mathematics. — To    determine the means, as far as possible,
 for lessening the lee-way of a ship of war when sailing on an
 oblique course, by combining together the manner most fa
 vourable for that purpose, the form of the keel, the draught
of water, the position of the main beam, and stability. ,
     In the year 1793 the Academy ofSqiences proposed this as
 the subje6t of a prize for 1795 ; it was suppressed before any
 paper was received in answer to it : but the Class of the Ma
 thematical and Physical Sciences, being desirous to fulfil the
 engagement     contracted by the Academy, and considering,
 besides,  that this subject is of great importance for the navy,
 have thought they could not do better than to propose it again.
1    The Class are too sensible of the difficulty attending this
problem to require or to hope for a solution from theory
alone, but, without prescribing rules in that respect, they
invite learned navigators to treat the question principally by
means of observations, deduced either from their own expe
rience or taken from those journals in which the commanders
of vessels give an account, at the conclusion of a campaign
or the end of a voyage, of the circumstances which have oc
curred in regard to the rate of sailing of their respective ships.
    The prize will be a gold medal of the value of a chiho-
gramme, and will be decreed in the public sitting of Meffi-
dor 15, an. 11 (July 4> 1803). The answers will be received
till the 1st of Germinal, an. 11, (March 33, 1803,) and not
beyond that period.
    Pbyjics. — The Class of the Physical and Mathematical Sci
ences of the Institute, charged with proposing, for the year 9,
the subject of a prize, think it their duty to adopt a question
the. solution of which must accelerate the progress of an in
teresting part of natural history.       The science of organized
bodies consists, in a particular manner, in a knowledge of
their organization, which is distinguished into internal and
external. The external signs, called characters, the first stu
died and the first known, are of use to indicate the internal
organization, from which they are derived, and which always
ought to have an influence on their existence.            These two
parts   of the  science  intimately  connected,  tend   mutually  to
    Vol. X.                      M                            throw

 throw light upon each other. Thus anatomy furnishes zoo
  logy with the bases of its grand divisions; it affords it the
  means of characterizing, with precision, the different classes
  and families of animals, and of explaining the causes of their
  manners and habits, and of the mode in which they feed.
       The philosophy of vegetables ought to render the lame
  service to botany.        By the exertions of Grew, Malpighi,
  Liewenhoek, Duhamel, Bonnet, Sennebier, and other re
  spectable philosophers, it has been already enriched with a
  great number of insulated observations,            which may serve as
  guides    in future  researches.   It has    exhibited  to us in those
  of C. Desfontaines, the difference which exisis in the dispo
  sition of the ligneous and utricular parts of the monocoty
  ledon and dicotyledon plants. This labour, which has en
   abled the science to make a great progress, deserves to be
   follov&d in the subdivisions of these two grand classes, and
  in the plants known by the name of acotyledons, composing
  the cryptogamia system of Linnæus.              We must assure our
   selves, ny studying the internal organization, whether the
   latter ought to continue to form a third division, or whether
   they ought to be joined to one of the other two. The science
   has still a great interest to determine the internal structure
   of vegetables composing the grand families acknowledged by
   all botanists/ It ought to verify, whether each of them has
   a peculiar internal organization, common to all the plants of
   its order, and different from that of the other families.           It
   will endeavour to discover their affinity determined ac
   cording to their external characters, and confirmed in the
   fame degree by inspecting their internal organs. It will
   examine what cause determines the union or separation of
   the sexes ; the existence or non-existence of the corolla ; the
   unity or plurality of its parts ; the number and relative situa
   tion of its sexual organs: in a word, the characters of the
   first line, derived from the essential organs, are invariable in
   all the known families.       These grand external differences are
   the consequence only of a concealed composition, which it is
   necessary to unveil.      The first discoveries pave a way to new
   ones, and the secondary differences will fucceflively become
   objects of attention when the first have been confirmed.
       From these considerations, the class, circumscribing their
   views, reduce their question to the following:

double refraction for the accurate measurement of small angles:
by C Rochon. — After an interesting historical notice, the
object of which        is,
                        ist, To claim the invention of achromatic
glasses  for  the learned   Morehall, who, about the year 1743,
found -means lo destroy the aberration of sphericity and re-
friingibility  by   employing substances of different refracting
powers 2d, To call to remembrance what we are indebted
        :
to the learned researches of Euler on this subject,        Rochon    C
announces that he has improved the instrument described in
his Researches on Mechanics and Physics, printed in '783.
    Beccaria has shown that rock crystal may be cut into
prisms   in  such  a manner as not to produce double refraction.
C. Rochon has taken advantage of this discovery to substitute
a  prism of that kind in the room of two variable piisms of
glass which he employed           in
                                  his first construction.
    A  new improvement enabled him to obtain the measure
of angles greater than the diameter of the fun            means of   by
two prisms of rock crystal producing double refraction; when,
on again examining Euler's theory on the aberration of glasses,
he found that       was possible
                   it                        by
                                     these means to measure                    by
his instrument angles of       more considerable extent;
                               a                             that         so
at present     can be conveniently employed for determining
              it

tions of these distances     an advantage obtained but imper

English and Spanish navies.
   Decisive experiments have proved to C. Rochon the ad
vantages of his instrument over those of the celebrated English
artist. He admits the great difficulty that may sometimes"
occur in constructing the instrument, to those who are not
well acquainted with the method of cutting rock crystal. He,
however, hopes that this difficulty will be surmounted       and          ;
C. Narci, attached to the agency of the mines, has already
constructed the instrument with all that degree of precision
which can be desired.

    Memoir on the theory of the moon. — C. Laplace has col
lected in this memoir the most interesting results of his ana
lytical calculations respecting the theory of the moon.         The
equations which he found for the mean longitude, the apo-
geum and the node, and the happy manner in which he
employed the inequalitities, either in longitude or latitude,
to deduce from them the oblate form of the earth, are already
known. He now announces a determination no less curious,
that of the parallax of the fun.       Mayer made a similar cal
culation ; but, besides that the analysis of that great astro
nomer was less profound, he was far from having so great
a number of observations        to enable him to d termine the
 precise value of the inequality which the parallax may give.
 He found it therefore about T'T too small ; whereas C. La
 place has attained precisely to the same quantity as Lexell and
 Lalande deduced from passages of Venus, that is to fay, 8'' 6.
 An astronomer, therefore, without going out of his observa
 tory, by uniting analysis with observation, might have de
 termined what nas cost so many voyages to countries so dif
 ferent in climate.      We must however observe, that this me
 thod would have required much more time, and that much
 fewer persons would have been in a state to appreciate the
justness of the result.    There is no reason, therefore, to regret
 the long voyages undertaken, nor even to prevent people
 from braving such dangers, when an opportunity occurs.
 Too many different means cannot be employed to establish
 truths'which, on the one hand, are sufficiently astonishing to
justify, to a certain point, the incredulity of those who refuse
 to admit them, because they do not comprehend the demon
 strations ; and, on the other hand, are so delicate that one
 can never, be certain of knowing them with the utmost pre
 cision.
     Trigonometric tables. — C. Prony has read to the Class a
 memoir on a work called Opus Palatinum dt Triangulis.
 These tables, the most complete that ever appeared in regard
  to trigonometric lines in natural numbers, were not calcu
 lated m all their parts with the fame exactness.        It was soon
 found that the tangente and secants of the last degrees had
                                 M  3                           need

need of considerable corrections ; it was vaguely known that
these corrections had been ordered, but it was not certain
that they had been executed.
   C. Prony had the good fortune to meet with a copy of the
Opus Palatinum, in which the tangents and secants of the
lall degrees were as exact as ihe reft. The title of the book
was augmented by the following words : weens emendatus h.
Barloloniico Pitifco, Sile/io, &c. The seven last degrees have
been calculated anew, which rendered it necessary to reprint
eighty-fix pages, which may be known by some differences
in the paper and type; the latter being more used, and the
former less beautiful, than in the rest of the volume. C. Pro-
ny's memoir contains the formulae necessary for fixing the
quantity of the errors, and tables of comparison, which prove
the exactness of the corrections of Pitifcus.
    Trigonometrical tables of Borda, published by Delambre. —
These tables are merelv logarithmic.       The decimal division
of the circle for which they have been constructed,      with     is,
out doubt, more convenient than the sexagesimal division.
The celestial signs, each consisting of 30 decrees, which               di
vide the circumference into twelve parts, while each degree              is
subdivided into 60 minutes, and the minute into 60 seconds,
deviate too much from the simple progress of the arithme
tical system, which proceeds invariably            by
                                                  tens, not to give
frequent rife to very s:reat inconveniences in practice.

It may readily be conceived how useful this labour may be
in regard to comets, which in future will not ascend in any
part of the heavens without being surrounded                 by
                                                          stars well
known, and     by    help of which   their  motion    and  positions
may be every moment determined.          It    no less evident that

 be afterwards made at different times        by
                                               different observers,
will, sooner or later, give rise to interesting remarks on the
chances that take place in the heavens on the new stars that
 from time to time appear, and on those w hich lose them

    J\hmcir containing the solution      of a mechanical problem
                                                                  proposed

 proposed by     d'Alcmbert:   by C. F. Nieuport.    The object of
 this problem is to determine the direction of the force which
 would keep in equilibrium and immoveable a body of any
 figure whatever, traversed by a flack and flexible thread
 having its extremities attached to two fixed points.
    The analysis of Nieuport conducts to a result of which
 d'Alembcrt had only a faint idea; that is to say, he con
 cludes that in all cafes the direction of the force divides into
 two equal parts the angle formed by the direction of the two
 parts of the thread which are without the body.
     It results also from this analvsis, that if the groove which
 affords a passage to the thread be of a curvilincal figure, the
 solution will not be more complex, and the equation will al
 ways retain the fame form.         This d'Alembert did not ven
 ture to assert.
    Demonstration      of a geometrical theorem on estimating the
solidity os the hemispherical arch of Vtviani : by C. Tedenat,
professor of mathematics in the Central School of jlveyron. —
 On reading the Integral Calculus of Lacroix, published a few
 years ago, he conceived the idea of determining algebraically,
 by a method of Euler, the solidity of that part of a hemi
 spherical arch of which Viviani determined only the surface.
     In the second volume of the Memoirs of the Institute for
 the year 6, it is seen that C. Bofiut had announced to the
 Class the solution of the fame problem, of which he gave
 merely the result, promising to give the calculation on some
 other occasion.       This he indeed did some time after, at the
 end of the second volume of his Integral Calculus: two solu
 tions of the problem may be seen there; the second of which
 is exceedingly simple.
     C. Tedenat, having read in the above memoir this extension,
 which may be given to Viviani's problem ; a circumstance
 not before mentioned by any geometrician, was desirous of
 proving that he himself had made the same remark, and with
 that view sent to the Institute the solution here announced;
 and which, in regard to the definitive result, is agreeable to
 that of Bossut.
     Longitude of Florence. — C. Lalande read a memoir on the
 longitude of Florence, the position of which was very uncer

  Ciccolini, and which he has calculated, that the difference
 between the meridians of Paris and Florence is oh. 35 40".
     Secular motion of Venus. — This memoir was also by La

  the equation of the orbit, and that there is no change to be

     Natural liijlory. — C. Jurine  has made some curious ob
servations   on the puce monocule, called commonly the water
flea (monoculus), a small crustaceous animal which abounds
in stagnant water, and which sometimes has given rife to
reports of showers of blood, because the eggs, with which it
is full in the spring-time, give it a red colour, so that th«
water where there are a great many of these insects, seems
really to be mixed with blood.
   The ablest naturalists, Swammerdam, De Geer, Schæffer,
and Otto Frederic Mnller, have successively studied this ani
mal ; but Nature is inexhaustible even in her least produc
tions, and C. Jurine, of Geneva, associate of the Institute,
has still discovered, respecting this insect, a number of curious
particulars which had escaped these learned naturalists.
   The most singular fact discovered by C. Jurine              is,
                                                            that      a
female which has had intercourse with the male, transmits the
influence of      itto her female descendants     so that they all

lay eggs, without being obliged to couple, till the sixth gene
ration; after which their young perish in moulting.           An
other species carried this influence to the fifteenth genera
tion.     Itis~well known that Bonnet made similar observa
tions in regard to pucerons.       These generations produced
without copulation are less abundant, and succeed with less
rapidity, than those in which the males have had        share.

   A great many experiments have been already made on the
preparation of sugar from white beets both in Russia and
in other countries; and a variety of opinions and facts in re
gard to this subject, which however are, in part, contradic
tory, have been published. As this subject is considered to
be of great importance, the Society require a dissertation, in
which shall be shown :
   What has been hitherto discovered with certainty in re
gard to the preparation of sugar from the beet-root : what,
on the other hand, is doubtful ; and, in particular, what is
properly the kind of beet which ought chiefly to be chosen
for that purpose : in what soil, and in what manner, it can

                  ASTRONOMICAL        NOTICES.
I. V_>.    CAIGNE,   notary, Rue de la Harpe, No. 237,               is-
commissioned                 of 600 francs to the first astro

  this period* and the end of the year 180s, provided it be
  not visible to the naked eye, and that its appearance be con
  firmed by another astronomer; in France, for example, by
 one of those at Paris, Toulouse, Marseilles, Montauban,
 Viviers ; in Germany, by one of those at Gotha, Berlin,
 Vienna; in Italy, by one of those at Milan ; and in Eng
 land, by the astronomer royal, Greenwich.
     To find a comet it is not necessary to be an astronomer,
 nor is it required that its place fliould be exactly determined ;
 it will be sufficient to indicate nearly the hour at which it
 appeared, at what height above such or such a star, or at what
 distance from the meridian ; which is very easy.                   There are
 so many amateurs who look at the heavens,                       that there is
 reason to hope some of them will employ this degree of at
 tention by considering that comets are at present the only
 desiderata in astronomy, and that they may be found by a
 common telescope mounted on a quadrant or parallactic ma
 chine of wood, which any one may construct by consulting
 the rules of astronomy.                                         Lalandk.
     II.   On the   1 2th  of July, at ten in the evening, C. Bouvard
 discovered     a small   comet near the head of the Great Bear.
 Its right ascension was m° 15', and its northern declination
 690 30', at nh 58™ of true time.            It was small and round,
 had no tail, and was somewhat nebulous.                   C. Bouvard has
told me that it was seen by C. Mechain at a quarter past
ten, and by C. Messier at half after ten. I do not yet know
who will be entitled to the 600 francs which Caigne, the
notary, has been commissioned to deliver to the person who
should discover a comet.                                         Lalandk.
     III.   The following notice respecting this comet was trans
mitted by     C. Mechain, to the minister of the interior :
                                       " Paris, at the National    Observatory,
                                                   July 13, 1801.
     " The interest which you take in the re-establishment of
the observatory, and the powerful means you procure lo us
to enable us to put it into such a state as to vie with the most
celebrated observatories of Europe, render it my duty to com
municate to you the discovery I made yesterday evening
about ten o'clock.          I observed a new comet in the northern
        of the heavens below the pole, between the constel-
  ations of the Giraffe and the Great Bear, and very near the
fiart
head of the latter.         This comet was not visible to the naked
eye,    it  was   even   very faint in the telescope : it had no tail

than two or three minutes diameter; a little more luminous
towards the centre than the edge, which was diffuse, or not
well defined.
   " According to my observations, this comet at 12 hours
mean time had 1 1 1 degrees 14 minutes right ascension, and
69 degrees 31 minutes northern declination.     This period
was very nearly that of its lower passage of the meridian,
where its altitude above the horizon was 28 [- degrees.   It
appears to descend towards the south about 3 !- degrees in
24 hours, and is proceeding rapidly towards the east.                     I
shall follow it attentively; and, when I have made a suffi
cient number of observations to determine its orbit, 1 (hall
have the honour of transmitting to you the result of my re
searches.
   " If  you think this notice of the appearance of a new
comet worthy the attention of the First Consul, it belongs to
you to present it to him.
   " This is the third comet which I have discovered at the
National Observatory since I entered        it,
                                         after having termi
nated the portion of the measurement   of the meridian, with
which  I   had the honour of being charged      and     ; the   it   is

   " C. Bouvard, assistant of the Board of Longitude, who
resides also in the observatory, and who pursues with zeal
the course of the daily and fundamental observations, dis
covered yesterday the same comet nearly at the same time as
myself, and without our having had any communication on
the subject.                                                 Mechain."
     IV. The   comet discovered on the 12th             by
                                                       three astrono
mers at the fame time,        issingularity,

example:      it   the
                    is  twentieth   of C.   Messier,  the  twelfth of
Mechain, and the fourth of Bouvard.               It
                                                   was seen on the
18th near the star Lambda, in the paw of the Great Bear;
having moved at the rate of four degrees per day, and ac
quired    little increase of light.
          a                            As   it   proceeding towards
                                                  is

 I   had the pleasure of finding in my 50,000 stars, that which
was near the comet at the moment when              was discovered.

                                                                      CHI

l88            Decomposition    of Earths and Alkalies.
                      CHEMICAL NOTICES.
    Professor Lampadius      has offered some speculations, accom
panied    with  experiments,    respecting the possibility of decom
posing    the earths and   fixed  alkalies. The following observa
tions deserve attention :
    i . The caustic strontian earth, barytes, and lime, are decom
posed in the strongest white heat, by combining them with
carbon; the first is particularly attracted by coal, and forms
azote, water, and carbonic acid, during that process.             The
decomposition of those bodies, also, proceeds under the blow-
pipe. — 2. Earths possess much affinity for oxygen, which is
proved bv the excellent experiments or Humboldt, in decom
posing the pure argillaceous earth by oxygen gas ; and it ap
pears, from the following facts, how great the influence of
oxygen is upon the earths. — 3. The fermentatio fojfilis of the
porcelain earth, according to some mineralogists, is formed
by the fossil fermentation of the fieldspar; but it continues
to be in this way decomposed,           when it is further exposed to
the action of the air, by which means it is also prepared for
the intended use, losing thus its sandy particles, and becoming
soft, and fit for being worked. — 4. The oxidated argillaceous
earth is with more difficulty dissolved in acids than the dc-
oxydated.      Pure argil, which he happened to keep in com
bination with oxygen gas and water for six months, was not
perfectly soluble in sulphuric acid. The solution, however,
proceeded, as soon as the earth, after being dissolved by caustic
lye in a silver crucible, was precipitated by acetous acid; by
which it seems probable, that the caustic fixed alkali deprives
 the argillaceous earth of its oxygen in a red heat.        Hence it
may be explained why the sapphire is soluble in acids, after
being burnt with kali, &c. — $. It deserves to be attended to,
 and proved by further experiments, what the late Mr. Gir-
 tanner has conjectured of the oxidation of earths. —6. The
 earths are formed in plants and animals from elements, which
 they receive with their nutriment, and through the mediums
 with which they are surrounded. The interesting experiments
 of the ingenious Vauquelin on the formation of the calcareous
 earth iu hens, arc known to every chemist. The earths con
 tained in plants are the fame, even when they grow in dif
 ferent soils, from which, of course, they do not originate. —
 7. Earths are also formed in the atmosphere,           which appears
 from the late observations of stony masses having fallen from
 the atmosphere.       If we dare acknowledge hydrogen, oxy
 gen, and azote, as the elements of the earths, that pheno
 menon will be easily explained. From these remarks we may
                                                            conclude,

                    Man in    the Savage State.                 189
conclude,    that the analyses, which have hitherto been made
of terreous substances, are very little to he depended on.
Professor Lampadius is at present much engaged in experi
ments to ascertain the nature of siliceous earth ; which he
conceives to be nothing but argillaceous earth in the highest
degree of oxidation, and which is changed into argillaceous
earth by treating it with deoxidating substances.         It seems,
therefore, probable, that several foflils, which, according to
their external or oryctognostic signs, appear to be siliceous,
are changed      in the hands of chemists into argillaceous
earth ! Though conscious of the boldness of this assertion,
the professor observes, that in different analyses of the fame
substances he has sometimes obtained a greater, sometimes a
less, quantity of argillaceous or of siliceous earths, which he
ascribes to the above circumstance. On the whole he thinks,
that earths as well as fixed alkalies are composed of azote,
hydrogen, and oxygen.
    Mr. Lambe      has proved, by several experiments, that the
precipitate   formed  upon mixing muriate of lime with muri
ate of magnesia is carbonate of lime, which arises from the.
muriatic acid not having the power to separate the last por
tion of carbonic acid from carbonate of magnesia, when as-
fused on that substance to convert     it into a muriate.
   C. Vauquelin,     in a late paper  on the combination os me
tals  with sulphur, divides them into      three orders: 1. Metals
and sulphur, or sulphurets properly so called : 2. Metallic
oxides and sulphur, which ought to be called sulphurated me
tallic oxides: 3. Metallic oxides with sulphur and hydrogen.
These triple combinations he calls metallic bydro-sulflmrated
oxides.   It is obvious, and chemists should remember the fact,
that the action of the different acids upon such compounds
must be altered and modified according to the class to which
they may belong.
                 MAN IN THE SAVAGE STATE.
   A great deal has been said in the journals of the savage
child found in the department of Aveyron ; and such disco
veries cannot fail of being interesting to mankind, especially
if they could lead to means for civilizing and restoring to so
ciety these unfortunate beings, whom nature seems to have
cut off from the rank of men to place them among the num
ber of irrational animals.
   Such are the ideas suggested by examining the young man
                                                              found

  190                 Man in     the Savage State.
    found about a year ago in the island of Madagascar, now
   exhibited in Toulouse. He is of the usual size, that is to fay,
   about five feet eight inches in height ; he is pretty stout, and
   well made in all his parts, and seems to be between twenty
   and twenty-five.    The colour of his skin is the fame as that
* of all the Europeans; which gives reason to think that he had
   been cast upon the above island by some storm during his
   infancy, and found means to preserve his existence by de
   vouring whatever he could find ; for he swallows stones, iron,
   and every thing that falls into his hands.     He eats raw flesh
   with unexampled avidity, flowers, herbs, and even dogs and
   cats, dead or alive, if given to him; but he has a great aver
   sion to bread and dressed victuals, and, in general, for every
   thing baked, boiled, or roasted ; and this he testifies every
   time they are presented to him, by convulsive movements
   and tearing his own skin : in a word, he always appears to
  be in a state of suffering; his head is in a continual state of
  motion, leaning alternately to either shoulder; lie twists his
  hands, or employs them in pulling the skin of his breast with
  an air of grief truly affecting.   His manner of swallowing is
  also worthy of remark : he does not exercise this function
  like other men, but, having turned the meat for a few mo
  ments in his mouth, he throws it violently into his gullet,
  into which it seems to descend with pain.       He seems not to
  understand any thing spoken to him, and only emits a faint
  cry from his throat when he wishes to have food. Yet this
  being, so voracious, so well formed, and who is neither de
  stitute of beard, nor hair on those parts usually covered, seems
  in other respects not to be a man : women have no attrac
 tions for him ; and his keeper asserts that he never could dis
 cover the least movement in his parts of sex.
      Such is the state of this unfortunate being, who has no
 thing human but the form, and who in judgment and un
 derstanding seems inferior to the greater part of animals.       It
 is supposed that the Dutch captain in whose ship he was
 brought to Europe, used him very ill : he      is,indeed, exceed
 ingly timid, and seems to have no other sentiments than
 those of hunger and fear.        The least threatening motion of
 his keeper frightens him   so  much as to produce total change
                                                      a
 in his physiognomy   :    he can neither laugh nor weep       and

 employs the fame cry to express his joy when food             pre
 sented to him, his desire when he fees it, and his pain when
 struck.  It    has hitherto been impossible to accustom him to
 wear clothes; and, in order that he may be exhibited to the
 curious,a    skin
                 is  fastened around his loins  : even this cover

ing he   seems to bear with impatience, and makes every effort
to tear it off.     As long as he is permitted he remains lying
on the ground naked, with his head low, and in a posture
which appears to be extremely constrained.
                      VOYAGES OF DISCOVERT.
    I. His majesty's ship the Investigator, of 22 guns, which
 had been preparing for some months before, fared from the
Nore on Monday the 20th of July, on a voyage of discovery
 to the south-wen of New Holland.             She was to have failed
 some time ago, but it was thought advisable to procure first
 the protection of the French government, to prevent the
 object of the voyage from being defeated bv any of the
 common accidents of war; and some delay was occasioned
 before the necessary papers were procured.         The Investing or
 is commanded by lieutenant Flinders, to whom the w-m:.\ is
 indebted for several discoveries made in that quarter; having
 been sent from Jackson's Bav, and failed round that country
 known by the name of Van Diemcn's Island, pasting through
 the strait which separates it from New Holland, to which he
 gave the name of Bass's Strait.         He is now to examine the
 whole coast of New Holland; to discover what large bays,
 but especially what rivers are to be found there ; as it is na
 tural to suppose that so large an ifland, or, more correctly
 speaking, so extensive a continent, (being considerably larger
 than alf Europe,^ must have many such, which may enable
 him to penetrate far into the interior.
     Persons versed in astronomy, natural history, mineralogy,
 &c. and able draftsmen, accompany the expedition.
     II. The following       is an extract of a letter from captain
 Baudin,    now on       a  voyage  of discovery, dated on board le
  Geographe,     Iste  of France, March 20th :
     " We    entered      this port yesterday; and I embrace the
 opportunity of a Swedish vessel, just about to sail, to inform
  you of our arrival at this colony, after a passage of four
  months and two days, from Tenerisse.            We have been al
  ternately distressed by contrary winds and calms ; yet no kind
  of malady has appeared on board either or the two vessels,
  and all, without exception, have enjoved perfect health.
  Our voyage, very uninteresting in regard to geography, has
  been highly interesting in regard to natural history: we have
  collected more than two hundred new and hitherto unknown
  objects, which to connoisseurs will occasion as much asto
  nishment as pleasure."

   The following singular phænomenon, which must be in
teresting to thole fond of observing nature, has been com
municated in a letter from Silesia : — Last year, a goose, like
the other animals of her species, on the causeway of Schauris,
not far from Wartenberg, placed herself on a nest in the
spring, as if with intention of laying, but produced no eggs.
She, nowever, remained in the nest during the whole hatch
ing-season ; and completed that period, bus without having
laid.   This goose, being killed in the autumn following,
those who had observed Tier during the hatching-time were
much astonished when she was opened, to find in her bowels
two young ones completely hatched, perfectly formed, and
pressed  towards each other. They were both dead; their           *
bodies, like those of other young geese, were covered with
yellowish down; and they had feathers in their wings an
inch in length. Near them was a large egg perfectly hard.

  An epoch of singular importance to the internal commerce
of the kingdom in general, and particularly of the metro
polis,       is,
           the opening of this canal, which took place with
great formalities on the ioth of July. This stupendous mo
nument of British spirit was undertaken and finished during
the course of the war, at an expense of nearly  million ster

  the choking or their pumps, made it an important object, in
  naval affairs, to find some machine for freeing ships from
  water not liable to so dangerous a defect. -The chain pump,
  having been found least exceptionable in this respect, was
  adopted in the British navy ; but, as Mr. Townfend observes,
  " the chain pump itself is not free from imperfections.                  If
  the valves are not well fitted to the cylinder, through which,
  they move, much water will fall back j if they are well fitted,
  the friction of many valves must be considerable,              besides the
  friction of the chain round the sprocket wheels, and of the
 wheels themselves." To which may be added 'the great wear
 of leathers*, and the disadvantage which attends the surging
 and breaking of the chain.                 " The preference, therefore,
 which has been given to chain pumps over those which work
 by the pressure of the atmosphere, must have arisen from this
 one circumstance, that they have been found less liable to
 choke.
     "   In point of friction, of coolness, and of cheapness, the
 sucking pump has so evidently the advantage over the chain
 pump, that it will not fail to gain the preference whenever it
 shall be no longer liable to be choked with gravel and with
 chips f."
     Buchanan's pump, which, like the common pump, acts
by the pressure of the atmosphere, is not liable to the defects
incident to other pumps upon that principle, being essentially
different from any now in use.
    The construction of this pump will be easily understood
from the following short description :
    Fig. 1. (Plate III.) is a vertical section of the pump, as
made of metal, in which A is the suction-piece, as it is com
monly called ; B, the inner valve; C, the outer valve.                 The
valves are of the kind called clack valves ; their hinges are
generally made of metal, as being mo/e durable than leather;
and, requiring no boxes, are peculiarly simple in their con
struction.      D, the working barrel ; E, the piston ; G, the
spout.

 the lower valve B may have its sockets formed in the flanche
 at the lower end of the working barrel, and therefore re
 quiring no box. The outer valve is also constructed in the
 same manner.
    The piston E, being raised in the working barrel D by any
 of the methods practised with the common pump, rarefies the
 space between the piston and the valve B, which valve opens
 upwards ; the exterior atmosphere, at the same time, by its
 pressure on the surface of the water in the well, forcing the
 water to ascend in the suction-piece A, to restore an equili
 brium.      On the return of the piston, the valve B, by its own
 gravity   and the increased weight brought upon its upper sur-
 Face, closes the upper orifice of A ; while the valve C, by the
 fame increased weight acting on its inner surface, is forced
 out towards b, allowing whatever is contained between the
 valve B and the piston E to pass into the spout G, from
 whence it cannot return into the working barrel; for, the
 moment the piston begins again to ascend, the valve C, by
 its own gravity and by the pressure of the atmosphere, is
 forced back into its first position, and shuts up the commu
 nication between the spout and the working barrel.             A few
 strokes of the piston exhaust the suction-piece A of all the air
 it contains, driving it off through the valve C ; the water, in
 the mean time, rising in A till it pass the valve B, and, by
 successive strokes, be discharged throuch the spout G.
    It will be readily perceived that this pump, so far as we
 have described      it,agrees exactly with the common suclion-
sump as to its prime principle, the water being raised to the
 height at which     it   delivered
                           is          by the pressure    ofthe atmo
sphere alone; but that          possesses also important advantages
                                it
 in point of construction.         In short, it  hasall the desirable
 properties of the common pump without any of its- disad
 vantages, besides possessing not       a  few good qualities which
 are peculiarly its own.
    The principal object of its invention was to remove the
 imperfection of choking; and in attaining this important end,
a   variety of collateral advantages have also been produced,
 which enhance its utility.
    The points in which it differs essentially from the common
 pump, and      by   which       excels, are, that
                                it                   it discharges the
 •water below the pi/ion, and has its valves, which are        of  the
 most simple and durable conslruSion, lying near each other,
 and    ofeasy access, without the disjunction    of  any part  of the
machine.
     The   advantages of this arrangement are  that the sand,

without injuring the barrel or the piston leathers ; so that,
besides the avoiding of unnecessary tear aud wear, the power
of the pump is preierved, and not apt to be diminished or de
stroyed in moments of danger, as is often the cafe with the
common and chain pumps : that the valves are not confined
to any particular dimensions, but are made capable of dis
charging every thing that can rise in the suction-piece, without
danger of being choked: that if there should happen upon any
occasion to be an obstruction in the valves, they are both
within the reach of a person's band, and may be cleared at
once, without the disjunction of any part of the pump. Be
sides, it occupies very little space in the hold, and thus saves
room for stowage.
    But this is not all : the pump under consideration may be
instantaneously converted into an engine for extinguishing fire,
as it commands at will all the advantages which result from
the principles on which forcing pumps are constructed. This
is obtained by simply screwing an air vessel H on the top of
the spout G, while the mouth of the spout is furnislied with
a stopple, fig. 3. made for receiving such pipes and hose aa
are common to sire engines.           This stopple is elliptical and
tapered, and, being introduced transversely, upon being pulled
back becomes immediately tight.
    These parts being provided, all that is necessary to make
the pump act as a fire engine, after having been used as a
sucking pump, is to plug up the spout with the stopple.
When not wanted to act as a forcing pump or sire engine,
these parts are not necessary.
    The advantage to a (hip of having a pump, which, as oc
casion requires, may either be used tor raising water or extin
guishing fire *, is too obxious to require comment.              It may
however be observed, that in its latter capacity it may also be
useful on (hip- board for many common purposes, such as
washing the decks and sides, or for wetting the fails in light
winds.     For those purposes clean water may be appliedin
various ways, but perhaps the most simple is by the stop-
cocks, used in many ships for sweetening them.
    But this pump is not confined to nautical uses alone ; its
adaptation extends to the raising of water in all situations,
and with peculiar advantage where it happens to be mixed
with send, or substances which destroy other pumps; as, for
instance, in alum works, soap works, mines, quarries, the
 clearing of foundations: and in its double capacity it will be
 very convenient in gardens,        bleaching grounds, on West
 India estates, (combining a still-house pump and a fire

 engine,) in stable and farm yards, and in all manufactories
 or other places, where there is a necessity for raising water,
 and the risk of fire.
    With all these advantages it is a simple and durable pump,
 and maybe made eitherof metal or wood at a moderate expense.
    No particular mode being essential in the working, of this
 pump, it may, according to choice or circumstances, be
 wrought by all the methods practised with the common
pump.       In many cases, however, it may be advantageous
to have two of them so connected as to have an alternate
motion ; in which cafe, one air vessel, and even one suction-
piece, might serve both.
    Its principles admit of various modifications ; but as what
is already mentioned may be sufficient to indicate its supe
riority over the common and chain pumps, and the advan
tages likely to result from its general use, a further detail is
unnecessary.     We cannot, however, dismiss this article with
out mentioning that we have seen two certificates respecting
its utility at lea, which deserve particular notice.     One of
them, dated the 23d of June last, is from captain William
Murray, of the Prince of Wales excise yacht, of 20 guns,
who had one fixed on board that vessel in the year 1794,
which was found to answer so well, that he has since had a
second and third one : he finds that the piston leathers are
not in the least hurt by fix years use, and recommends the
pump highly to vessels which carry corn, or such substances
as are apt to choke or injure other pump9.       The other cer
tificate, dated the 14th of July last, is from captain Hurst, of
the Britannia of Glasgow, but then in the Thames.            He
states, that one of these pumps was fixed on board his vessel
in April 1800, and had answered its purpose in the most
complete manner, and gives one particular instance in the
                       "
following words : — When at sea, about six weeks ago, a
quantity of coffee, by some means, had got into the ship's
well. Upon trying the common pump, it was soon rendered
almost useless by the coffee preventing, in a great measure,
the valves from acting.        I then tried the patent pump,
which, with the greatest facility, completely discharged the
coffee from the well."      He then adds : ** the piston lea
thers are still as good as when the pump was first fixed, nor
had I ever occasion to give any part of the pump the smallest
repair.    I well know the great advantage of having a pump
not liable to choke, having, during the voyage before
yours was put on board, been nearly lost in the Britannia,
laden with corn, from the choking of the pumps. A9 an

    On the Influence      of the Proportions in   Complex  Affinities.
i. In      my researches on the laws of affinity I have ascertained
the principal results presented by complex affinity, when the
force of cohesion or that of elasticity is sufficiently strong to
produce that change of base which has been ascribed to the
superiority of the divellent affinities over the quiescent affi
nities.     But I avoided entering into the necessary details for
determining the changes which may arise from different pro
portions of the substances brought into action, when the force
of cohesion is not sufficiently great to cause the effects of this
difference to disappear.          I promised (Art. XII. No. 6.) to
return to this subject, which I sliall now proceed to do.
    According to the theory explained (Art. V. No. 5.), all
substances exert a mutual action while they are in the liquid
state j so that in a solution, for example, of sulphate of potash
and muriate of soda, these two salts are not distinct, while
there is no cause to determine the separation of their com
bination ; but there exist in this liquid sulphuric acid, mu
riatic acid, soda, and potash.          I shall, however, continue to
make      use of   the  ordinary language, which after this notice
can produce      no  ambiguity.
     2. 1 begin with mixtures in which a considerable force of cry
stallization must determine the combinations which are formed.
    Experiment A. Equal parts of nitrate of lime and sulphate
of potash were mixed : after the separation of the sulphate of
lime first formed, the liquid, by successive evaporations,
yielded only nitrate of potash and sulphate of lime.               After
the last evaporation, however, some crystals of sulphate of
potash were procured ; there remained only a very small
quantity of uncrvsiallizable liquid, which precipitated with
carbonate of soda and with nitrate of barytes; so that it con
sisted of a little sulphuric acid and lime, and very probably a
 larger portion of nitrate of potash.

the course of the evaporation was much more considerable,
than.would have been obtained from the simple solution of
this salt and water ; so that its solubility was augmented by
the action of the other substances.
     By Two parts of sulphate of potash and one of nitrate of
lime, gave first sulphate of potasli and sulphate of lime ; and,
by succeeding evaporations, nitrate of potash and the two sul
phates, the proportions of which continued to decrease to
the last crystallization.    There remained only some drops of
the liquid uncrystallized, which did not precipitate with car
bonate of soda, but did with nitrate of barytes : hence they
were probably farmed of sulphate of potasli and a small por
tion of nitrate of potasli.
     C. Two parts of nitrate of lime, and one of sulphate of
 potasli, yielded, during the first evaporation, a small quantity
 of sulphate of lime, and, by cooling, nitrate of potasli : the
other evaporations only produced nitrate of potasli.       In the
 latter, however, some crystals of sulphate of lime were per
 ceived at the surface of the liquid.     The residue, which was
  abundant, was several limes submitted to evaporation and
 cooling, but did not afford crystals of any salt. This uncry-
 stallizable residue, treated with alcohol, formed an abundant
 deposit, which, having been dissolved in water, scarcely af
 forded any precipitate with nitrate of barytes. It contained,
 therefore, little or no sulphuric acid, and consisted of pure
 nitrate of potasli : the portion dissolved by alcohol was nitrate
  of lime, with a small portion of nitrate of potash. The un-
  crystallizable residue was therefore composed of nitrate of
  potash and nitrate of lime.
      In this experiment we fee that the sulphate of lime was
  rendered much less soluble than in the preceding experiments ;
  but that a considerable quantity of nitrate of potash lost the
  property of crystallizing by the action exerted on it hy the
  nitrate of lime.
      3. In these three experiments sulphate of lime must have
  been formed, because the lime and sulphuric acid coming in
  contact, would separate on account of the insolubility which
   belongs to their combination.
      The sulphate of lime in the experiments A and B, was
   rendered much more soluble than it naturally          is,   by
                                                                the
   action of the substances which were in solution   ;  but in the
   experiment C, its solubility was not sensibly increased, pro
   bably because the nitrate os lime and the nitrate of potash,
   which formed the uncrystallizable liquid, mutually experi
   enceda     degree of saturation, which considerably weakened
   their action upon the sulphate of lime,
                                                          4. From

    4. From these considerations, I shall proceed to deduce,
first,  the theory of the uncrystallizable residues found in
evaporated solutions of salts : it will be confirmed by the suc
ceeding observations.
    Saline substances exercise upon each other an action which
increases their solubility, an effect that has been particularly
                                                        tons,
established by Vauquelin.        (Annales de Cbimie,          xiii.)
This mutual action varies in the different salts. It has, how
ever, been thought, that salts with an earthy base do not in
crease the solubility of the nitrate of potash, though these in
reality increase it the most.       There is in this respect a dif
ference in the effect produced by the salts, which depends
on their nature ; but this difference is in general very small,
compared with that which proceeds from the force of crystal
lization.
    D. Equal parts of nitrate of potash and sulphate of potash
afforded by evaporation, successively, and in proportion to their
solubility, sulphate of potash and nitrate of potash, without
leaving any uncrystallizable liquid; but the same experiment
being made with nitrate of soda and sulphate of soda, both
of which have only a flight tendency to crystallize, and are
nearly of equal solubility, only a small quantity of sulphate
of soda was separated by crystallization; all the rest remain
ing liquid, without any crystallization.        A mixture of mu
riate of soda and sulphate of alumine having been submitted
to the same proof, it was clearly perceived that the two salts
had become more soluble ; but they were entirely separated
by alternate evaporation and cooling.       Substances, therefore,
which possess a considerable force of crystallization, thpugh
 rendered more soluble, separate on account of their insolu
bility, and leave very little or no uncrystallizable residuum.
But the mutual action of salts, which have only a feeble dis
position to crystallize,- counterbalances their force of crystal
 lization, so that there then remains much liquid which can
 not crystallize ; particularly when the residuum contains a
substance in itself uncrystallizable;       as in experiment -C,
 where, by the proportions employed, there was found a
 superabundance    of nitrtfte of lime, which by its action upon
 the nitrate of potash reduced a considerable quantity of that
 salt into an uncrystallizable liquid.       How came, it, then,
 that the most learned chemists, Lavoisier, Fourcroy, Vau
 quelin, Guiton, and the Commissaries of the Academy of
 Sciences, among whom myself was one, could have been
 led, by the experiments made upon the proof of saltpetre,
 to believe that the nitrate of lime exerts no action upon the
 nitrate of potash, nor increased its solubility ? (Annales de
                                N4                          Cbimie,

aoo                      Researches    respecting
 Cbim'ie,   torn. xi. xiii. xv. xxiii.)    It was because, in the ex
 periments     that were  made,   a solution   of nitrate of potash was
 put   to digest  upon  dried  nitrate  of lime.    The latter necessa
 rily caused a division of the water, upon which it has a strong
 action.     It would therefore have precipitated a considerable
 quantity of nitrate of potash, if this effect had not been com
 pensated, or nearly so, by the solubility which it imparted to
 that salt ; but if the solution had been evaporated, there would
 have been separated by crystallization much less nitrate of
          than was contained in the liquid, and an uncrystal-
   izable residuum would have been left, similar to that of ex
 fiotafh
periment C. The proof, therefore, which was considered as
 conclusive, induced an error respecting the chemical phæ-
nomenon.         Hence it follows, that when the mother waters
of the saltpetre works are decomposed by potash, the nitrate
of potafli obtained consists not only of that which has just
been formed, but also of that which was rendered uncrystal-
lizable by the salts with an earthy basis.
     5. I made mixtures of crystallized sulphate of soda and
nitrate of lime.      Here the sulphate of soda, and the nitrate
of soda which might proceed from the operation, differed
little in point of solubility, and had a crystallizing power less
considerable than the sulphate and nitrate of potafli.
     E. Equal parts of crystallized sulphate of soda and of dry
nitrate of lime gave by evaporation only a small quantity
of nitrate of soda. The uncrystallizable residue, which was
abundant, did not precipitate with muriate of barytes, but
did with oxalic acid.
     F. Two parts of sulphate of soda, and one part of nitrate
of lime, afforded, after evaporation, a greater quantity of ni
trate of soda than the preceding experiment : the uncrystal
lizable residue did not precipitate with oxalic acid, but did
with muriate of barytes.         To compare the two last with the
experiments A, B, and C, it must be observed that the cry
stallized sulphate of soda contains more than half its weight
of water of crystallization. Even sulphate of soda was not
formed in experiment F, as sulphate of potash was in expe
riments A ana B, because sulphate of potash has a force of
crystaHiztion much greater than sulphate of soda.
     The residue of experiment E did not contain a quantity of
sulphuric acid perceptible by the muriate of barytes; but
was formed of nitrate of soda and nitrate of lime, which pro
bably, by their mutual action, so much exhausted their dis
solvent power as not to prevent the separation of the sul
phate of lime No. 3.
     In experiment F the residue was not precipitated by oxalic
                                                                  acid,

                      the Laws of Affinity,                   301
acid, but by the muriate of barytes ; so that this residuum
was composed of sulphate of soda and a greater proportion
of nitrate of soda, which mutually prevented their crystalliza
tion, as in experiment D.
    6. Experiment G. Equal parts of nitrate of potash and sul
phate of soda gave by successive crystallizations, I. Sulphate
of potash, and some small crystals of nitrate of potash ; a. A
little sulphate of potash, and a greater proportion of nitrate of
potash; 3. Small crystals of nitrate of potash, and much ni
trate  of soda :  there was an uncrystallizable residue, notwith
standing   the  care  which had been taken to obtain the utmost
crystallization : this residue was formed of nitrates and sul
phates; for it precipitated abundantly with the nitrate of
barytes, and, after drying, it flowed on ignited charcoal.
This experiment ought to he compared with experiment F.
    H. One part of nitrate of potash, and two of sulphate of
soda, gave, 1 . Sulphate of potash ; 2. Sulphate of potash, and
some needles of nitrate of potash ; 3. Sulphate of potash in
small prisms, suspended from a pellicle formed by nitrate of
soda, fine crystals of nitrate of potash and nitrate of soda :
the residue contained nitrates and sulphates.
    In these two experiments, the least soluble salt of those
which were formed, viz. the sulphate of potash, was the first
which was crystallized. When the proportions had been
thus changed, the action of the nitric acid on the potash re
sumed its superiority, and nitrate of potash was formed,
though the liquid still contained sulphuric acid.
     In the second, the more abundant sulphuric acid gave rise
 to a greater quantity of sulphate of potash ; but, after the first
 crystallization, more nitrate of potash was formed, though
 there would have been a sufficient quantity of sulphuric acid
 to cause a complete change of base, if this exchange could
 have been made as has "been imagined.           The residue was
formed, even in experiment G, of sulphate of soda and ni
 trate of soda; and probably of a small quantity of salt with

     7. Experiment I. Equal weights of nitrate of potash and
muriate of lime were mixed together : by evaporation there
 were, 1. Nitrate of potash ; %. Muriate of potash, in which
 was found a little nitrate of potash : the residue gave with the
 sulphuric acid an abundant precipitate of sulphate of lime,
 and vapours of muriatic and nitric acid were disengaged.
     K. The experiment having been made with two parts of
 puriate of lime, and one of nitrate of potash, an abundant
 crystallization of muriate of potash was produced, with no
                                                       appearance

 202                     Researches refpecling
appearance     of nitrate  : the residue, treated as in the preceding
experiment, gave analogous results.
    L.  A mixture of equal parts of muriate of potash and ni
trate of lime, afforded,      i. Nitrate of potash, mixed with a
little muriate of potash; a Muriate of potash, which was
mixed with a small quantity of nitrate of potash.             The un-
crystallizable residuum was dissolved in alcohol ; there was
a separation of nitrate of potash, which was fused upon ig
nited charcoal, but contained a little muriate of potash, as
was seen by the test of the solution of silver.        The sulphuric
acid showed that the part dissolved by the alcohol contained
muriatic acid, nitric acid, and lime.
    In the above experiments, in which substances were em
ployed whose combinations could not have a considerable
force of crystallization, and differed but little among each
other in this respect, it is evident that the formation of the
salts obtained by crystallization depended on the proportions
of the substances which mutually acted among each other.
In experiment I, which might afford nitrate and muriate of
potash, as these two salts differed little in their solubility,
which, however, is rather the least in the latter, the nitrate
of potafli was obtained by the first crystallization ; but as in
experiment K the muriatic acid existed in a greater propor
tion, muriate of potash only was then obtained : one part of
potash with muriatic acid, nitric acid and lime formed the
residuum. The proportions employed in experiment L dif
fered little from thole of I, and the results were nearly the
fame. Opposite combinations, therefore, are obtained ac
cording to the proportions employed, or according to the
period of crystallization ; that is to fay, according to the pro
portions of the substances which remain in action when a
 sufficient force of cohesion does not exist in the combinations
that might be formed. But according to the opinion adopted
by chemists, the entire change of base, which it is affirmed
 must take place, may be judged of even by a first crystalliza
 tion. If, for example, nitrate of potash be first obtained from
 the proportions which have been employed of muriate of
potash and nitrate of lime, a conclusion is made, that an
 exchange of base has been effected between the muriatic and
 nitric acids. If other proportions had been employed which
 would have afforded muriate of potash, as in experiment K,
 an opposite consequence would have been drawn.               Chemists
 have   even   gone   further:   from  the  conclusion  respecting the
 change   of  base, for. example,   between   the muriatic   and nitric
 acids, a further inference has been made, that the combina
                                                                  tions

not be at all affected by their mixture.
   8. I have examined what change might be produced in
                                                                       '
the results by a substance which has the property of forming
triple salts, such as magnesia.
   M. Equal parts of sulphate of potash and muriate of magnesia
afforded, 1, Sulphate of potash ; 2. Sulphate os potash, a little
muriate of potash, and a triple salt, composed of lulphuric acid,
potash, and magnesia : this salt forms fine rhomboids, which,
by exposure to the air, do not lose their transparency; its so
lubility is nearly the fame as that of the sulphate of potash :
3. Muriate of potash and sulphate of magnesia. The residuum
contained sulphuric acid, muriatic acid, potash, and magnesia.
    N. Two parts of muriate of magnesia, and one of sulphate,
of potash, afforded, 1. Sulphate of potash; 2. Muriate of
potash, and the triple salt of the preceding experiment;
 3. Muriate of potash, and sulphate of magnesia : the resi
 duum was analogous to that of the preceding experiment.
    In experiment M, sulphate of potash was obtained by two
 crystallizations; but in experiment N, where the muriatic
 acid was in a greater proportion, it was obtained on the first
 crystallization ; the triple salt, which in solubility nearly ap-,
 proaches the sulphate of potash, crystallized after the second
 evaporation.      When the proportion of sulphuric acid was
 sufficiently   diminislied   by these crystallizations, then the,
 muriate of potash was separated nearly according to the order
 of solubility ; and lastly the magnesia, which beine; still abun
 dant, crystallized with part of the sulphuric aci3. We see
 that a different opinion might have been formed in these two
 experiments, according to the period of the crystallization at
 which it might have been observed ; and how erroneous the
 established opinion  is,    that
                               a    complete change of bases takes
 place   on the  mixture   of  muriate of magnesia and sulphate of
potash.
     In experiment M, where the sulphuric          acid was present
in  greater proportion, sulphate   of   potash was  obtained in both
 the first crystallizations; but   in experiment N, where the
 muriatic acid had more influence           by
                                            its relative quantity,

                                              the first crystalliza
 tion ;  the magnesia, for the most part, remained in the un-
 crystallizable residue, because    has no force of crystalliza

 circumstances, are retained in the residue which opposes their

 and C, in which a deliquescent calcareous salt was put into

 the difference of solubility which exists between the sulphate
 of lime and the sulphate of magnesia.
     9. After having treated of saline substances in the preced
 ing experiments, as if they formed separate or distinct com
 binations in a liquid, I shall now consider some effects which
 are owing to the mutual action which is in reality exerted
 by them all when they are mixed in this state.
    O. An aqueous solution of acetite of lead was gradually
 poured into a solution of muriate of soda, till no more pre
 cipitate was produced. The liquid which remained above
 the precipitate strongly reddened blue paper, which effect
 was not produced by the mere solution of the acetite of lead,
 nor by the muriate of soda ; but it assumed a deep colour
with hydro-sulphurets, and afforded an abundant precipitate
 with the muriatic and sulphuric acids. During its evapo
 ration a deposition was formed of a scarcely soluble muriate
of lead, and also a crust which had not a crystalline ap
pearance. Lastly, some fine crystals were obtained, which
were an acetite of soda and an oxide of lead.       On dissolving
the saline crust, a deposition took place of muriate of lead
with excess of oxide, analogous to that described by Vau-
quelin. (Annales de Chimie, torn, xxxi.)       It was necessary to
repeat the solution aud crystallization several times before the
deposition ceased ; and the saline crust thus became divided
into two substances, muriate of soda and muriate of lead.
    If the muriatic acid remain engaged in the liquid together
with the acetous, as both acids are volatile, the excess, which
is but slightly engaged, and which may be expelled by the
action of heat, must be composed of two acids.            In fact,
having distilled a mixture similar to the preceding, after
having separated the deposition which was first formed, the
liquid which passed into the receiver contained acetous and
muriatic acid: this circumstance deserves particular atten
tion, and serves to explain several phænomena.
    10. C. Prieur has remarked that when lead was employed
to purify a solution of silver mixed with muriatic acid, a part
of the latter acid passed over by distillation. This takes place
because the muriate of lead is soluble, and much so by the
action of the nitric acid. The liquid is therefore composed
of oxide of lead, muriatic acid and nitric acid. The oxide
of lead divides its action upon the two acids, and both are
subjected to the action of the expansibility produced by the
heat.
   If the sulphuric acid were to be retained, lead would be

                      the Laws of Affinity.                  265
an efficacious agent : 1. Because the sulphate of lead is much
less soluble than the muriate;    a. Because the sulphuric acid
is much less volatile than the muriatic acid.
    Muriate of silver being much more insoluble than muriate
of lead,   silver is much better than lead for retaining the mu
riatic acid which happens to be in the nitric acid. Velter
and Bonjour observed, howeyer, that muriatic acid always
came over in distillation, if the operation was made without
the precautions indicated by those learned chemists.          To
obtain a pure nitric acid immediately, it is necessary to make
the operation upon an acid little concentrated, that it may
not hold in solution any muriate of silver, and to separate
the muriate of silver which precipitates before the liquid is
subjected to the action of heat, or, which is better, to pre
cipitate, by a solution of silver, the muriatic acid from the
nitrate of potash ; after which, by decomposing this nitrate,-
the nitric acid is obtained perfectly free from muriatic acid.
    When muriate of silver remains in the solution, a very
       nitric acid may nevertheless be obtained by distillation,
  y setting aside the first portion which distils over, till it is
Eure
seen by the test that no more muriatic acid is afforded.     For,
as the chemists I have just quoted observed, the muriatic
acid in this process assumes the nature of oxygenated muri
atic acid, and is disengaged in this state at the beginning of
the operation.
    P. Sulphate of potash having been treated with the acetite
of lead in the same manner as the muriate of potash, sul
phate of lead was precipitated.       The liquid retained only a
small quantity of oxide of lead.     By the progress of evapora
tion some crystals of sulphate of potash were obtained, though
before the evaporation the acetite of lead produced no more
precipitate ; and, lastly, the acetite of potash, which retained
a small quantity of oxide of lead.     The decomposition of the
sulphate of potash was much more complete than that of the
muriate of soda.
    In the experiments I have just described, we see, then, that
the decompositions, or exchange of bases, also follow the
order of the solubilities of the combinations which may be
formed; and that the only difference observed in most of the
preceding experiments, arises from the property possessed by
the oxide of lead of forming triple combinations, which
sometimes again separate in combinations of different degrees
of solubility, as happens with the muriate of soda and of
lead. (Experiment O.)
    11. The following experiment will confirm the truth that
                                                              the

 20j5                  Researches resettling
 the force of cohesion produces a different effect, according
 to the properties of the solvent.
    Q. I mixed an aqueous solution of plombate of soda with
the water of sulphate of soda; a flight precipitate only was
produced, though the sulphuric and muriatic acids, if added,
would have produced an abundant precipitate : when the ex
periment was made with the muriate, the precipitate was
much more abundant than with the sulphate of soda.
    On the first view, these effects may appear to be contrary
to the principles I have established.    For the sulphate of lead
is much less soluble than the muriate of lead ; so that it
might be expected that a more abundant precipitate would
be obtained in the experiment made with sulphate of soda
than with muriate of soda. This happens otherwise because
sulphate of lead is much more soluble in soda, as I have as
certained, than muriate of lead with excess of oxide, such as
is precipitated in the preceding experiments.       And the pre
cipitation is not a direct consequence of the force of cohesion,
but arises from the excess of the force of cohesion beyond
that of the solvent.
    12. These observations    may be reduced to the following
results.     In the complex affinities, or double affinities, the
force of cohesion, when considerable,      and differing much in
its intensity among the combinations which may be formed,
determines a change of bases, in such a manner, that the
most insoluble combination is formed and separated inde
pendently of the proportions, which have an influence only
upon the state of thole substances which remain in solution.
The result of a mixture of different saline substances may
therefore be foretold from the mere consideration of solubility.
In this cafe, the adopted theory of the quiescent and divellent
affinities does not mislead us as to the principal result; that
is to sav, the formation of the insoluble salt.       But, as it is
not deduced from facts of a superior order, it will demand as
many experiments as particular facts.         The doctrine does
not rest upon any foundation from which we can foretel the
mutual actions of substances presented to each other; and
again, it has the disadvantage of affording no indication re
specting the properties which the remaining fluid portion
ought to exhibit when subjected to evaporation or to the
action of a new substance.       Though this certain relation in
the   results  may  be productive of doubt as to the theory in
the foregoing cafe, it is not the fame when there is but a
small difference between the solubility of the combinations
that may be formed. The proportions of the substances, in
             6                                           quantity,

                     the   Laws of Affinity.                     iof
quantity, then, determine the formation of the different salts,
either by a first crystallization, or by crystallizations which,
by subtracting some of the parts, must alter the proportion,
and occasion a difference in the disposition of the remaining
principles to crystallize in the successive formation of the salts.
It is here that the application of the theory of the quiescent
and divellent affinities may produce many errors, by leading
us to conclude, from the commencement of the phenome
non,   that the subsequent    effects will be all  of the fame de
scription, though in reality a succession of opposite combina
tions may be established, according to the forces which are
made to act at the moment of their respective separations.
The joint consideration of the difference of solubility, and
of the proportions employed, or which varv at the different
periods of an operation, must consequently be our/ole guide
in the explanation of the successive formation of different salts
which have no great difference in solubility. It is true, never
theless, that the mutual action of the substances themselves
 may produce some difference in the results, which would be
indicated by the preceding observations.
    All substances in a state of solution exert a mutual action,
 which increases their solubility.    Hence the reason why it is
difficult to obtain, by a first crystallization, each salt in a
state of purity ; except in the case where it differs consider
ably from the others in its force of crystallization.         Hence
arise the uncryflallizable   residues which    succeed  the  ci-ystal-
lizations wherein salts are found in the liquid, which possess
but little force of cohesion.      But here also the considera
 tion of the proportions and of the solubility will serve to
 predict the existence and composition of any uncrystallizable
 residuum. While the substances are in solution, the action
 which they mutually exert renders it easy to expel an acid
 from a combination, though, according to the received opi
 nion, it ought to assume the place of another, supposed to
 be weaker.     Insolubility must not be considered as an abso
 lute property, but merely as relative to the liquid in which
 a precipitation is made.      Thus a combination insoluble in
 water, may lose this property when the water holds alkali in
 solution.
    In all these experiments, and in several others which             I
 have thought it useless to describe, I perceived no chanee of
 saturation, either after the mixture of the neutral salts, or
 after the separation of the precipitates        or crystallizations
 which took place, except in the experiments P, Q, made
 with a metallic substance.     This permanent state of neutral
 ization, after the change of bases which look place, seems to

   indicate that the acids have constant relations of quantity,
   in the neutral salts they form, with different alkaline or earthy
   bases.   So that, if the sulphuric acid, for example, exist in
   greater proportion in the sulphate of potash than in the sul
  phate or lime, the muriatic acid, with which it may make
   an exchange of base, will be found in the same ratio of
   quantity in the muriate of lime and in the muriate of potash;
   a conclusion that would not agree with the proportions which
   chemists have often attributedto the component parts of the
   different non-metallic salts.      Guyton has already made se
  veral very just and important reflections on this subject, and
  quotes the observations of Richter, with whose work I am
  not yet acquainted. (Annales de Chimie, torn. xxv. p. 392.)

                    On the Clarification of Wines.
  c°j  JJESIDES          the operation of sulphuring wines, there
 is another, no     less essential, called clarification.    It consists,
 in the first place, in drawing off the wine from the lees,
 which requires certain precautions, and in then disengaging
 it from all the principles suspended or weakly dissolved in it ;
 so that nothing may be retained         but the spiritous and incor
 ruptible principles alone. These operations are even per
 formed before that of sulphuring, which is only a continua
 tion of them.
    The first of these operations is called drawing off, trans-
 vasation, defecation.      According to Aristotle, this operation
ought to be often repeated : quoniam supcrv entente ajlatis ca-
lore folent forces fubverti, ac ita vina acefcere.
     In the different wine countries there are certain fixed pe
riods of the year for this operation, established, no doubt, on
the constant and respectable observation of ages.                At the
Hermitage, the wine is drawn off in March and September;
in Champagne, on the 13th of October, about the 15th of
February, and towards the end of March.
    Dry, cold weather is always chosen for this operation. It
is certain that it is then only that the wine is in a good con
dition.    Damp weather, and southerly winds, always render
                  6                                                wine

tvine turbid ;  and care must be taken not to draw  it,off while
these prevail.
   Baccius has left us some excellent precepts respecting the
most favourable periods for the defecation of wine.      He ad
vises the weakest wines, that is to fay, those produced from
sal covered foil, to be drawn off at the winter solstice; mo
derate wines, in the spring; and the most generous, during
summer.      He gives as a general precept, not to draw off
wine but when the north wind prevails; and he adds, that
wine drawn off at the time of full moon is converted into
vinegar   !
   The manner of drawing off wine     can be a matter of indif
ference only to those unacquainted with the effect of atmo
spheric air on that liquid : by opening the tap, or placing a
cock at about four inches from the bottom of the cask, the
wine which runs off becomes aerated, and determines move
ments in the lees; so that, under this double view, the wine
acquires a disposition to become sour.      A part of these in
conveniences has been obviated by drawing off the wine by
means of a syphon; the motion is then gentler, and by these
means one may penetrate to any depth at pleasure, without
agitating the Ices.   But all these methods are attended with
faults, which have been completely remedied by the help of
a pump, the use of which has been established in Champagne
and other wine countries.
   To a leather pipe, of from sour to fix feet in length, and
two inches in diameter, are adapted at each end wooden
pipes, nine or ten inches in length, which decrease in dia
meter towards the ends, and are fixed to the leather pipe by
means of a piece of packthread.       The bung of the cask in
tended to be rilled is taken out, and one of the extremities of
the pipe is put into it. A good cock is fixed in the cask to
be emptied two or three inches from the bottom, and into
this is inserted the other extremity of the pipe.
   By this mechanism alone, the half of the one cask is emptied
into the other : for this purpose nothing is necessary but to
open the cotk; and the remainder may be made to pass by
a very simple process, for which a pair of bellows about
two feet in length, comprehending the handles, and ten
inches in breadth, are employed. The bellows force the air
through a hole formed at the anterior part of the small end :
a small leather valve, placed below the small hole, prevents
the air from rushing out when the bellows are opened, and
to the extremity of the bellows is adapted a perpendicular
wooden pipe to convev the air downwards: this tube is fitted
into the bunghole in such a manner, that when the bellows

are worked,        and the air forced out, a pressure is exercised on
the wine, by which means it is obliged to issue from the one
cask, and to ascend into the other.            When a hissing is heard
at the cock, it is speedily shut : this is a sign that all the wine
has passed.
     Funnels of tin plate, the tubes of which are at least a foot
 and a half in length, that they may be immersed in the liquor
 without causing any agitation, are also employed.
     Drawing off wine separates a part of its impurities, and
 consequently removes some of those causes which may alter
 the quality of it ; but there still remain some suspended in the
 liquor, which cannot be caught but by the following opera
 tions, which are called fining of wine, or clarification : Fish-
 glue (isinglass) is almost alwaysTemployed for this purpose: it
 is unrolled with care, and cut into small morsels, and it is then
 steeped in a little wine, where it swells up, becomes soft, and
 forms a viscid mass, which is poured into the wine.                The
 wine is then strongly agitated, after which it is left at rest.
 Some whip the wine, in which the glue has been dissolved,
 with a few twigs of birch, &c. and by these means occasion
 a considerable foam, which is carefully removed. In all
  cales a portion of the glue is precipitated with the principles
  it has enveloped, and the liquor is drawn off when the de
  posit is formed.
      In warm climates the use of glue is dreaded, and during
 summer its place is supplied by whites of eggs : ten or twelve
  are sufficient for half a muid*.            The eggs are first beat up
  with a little wine; they are then mixed with the liquor in
  tended to be clarified, and it is whipped with the fame
  care.      It is possible that gum arabic might be substituted for
  glue. Two ounces will be sufficient for four hundred pots of
   wine.      It is put into the liquor in the form of a fine powder,
  and the liquor is then stirred.
      Wine must not be drawn off till it is completely made:
  if the wine is green and harfli, it must be suffered to ferment
   a secoricl time on the lees, and must not be drawn off till to
   wards the middle of May ; jf it continues green, it may even
   be left till the end of June.      It even sometimes happens that
   it is necessary to convey back the wine to the lees, and to
   mix them strongly, that the wine may again acquire that
   movement of fermentation which is neceflary to bring it to
   perfection.
      We are told by Miller that when Spanisli wine becomes
   turbid by the lees, it may be clarified by the following process:

  face,   and  pour     the   composition into the wine cask from
  which a part of the liquor has been drawn off: at the end of
  two or three days the liquor becomes clear, and acquires an.
  agreeable taste.      After being suffered to remain at rest for
  about a week, it is then drawn off.
      To revive claret injured by floating lees, two pounds of
  calcined flints, well pounded, ten or twelve eggs, and a large
  handful of salt, are beat up with two gallons of wine, which
  are then poured into the cask: two or three days after, the
 wine is drawn off.
      These compositions may be varied without end : sometimes
  starch is employed, and also rice, milk, and other substances,
  more or less capable of developing the principles which render
 the wine turbid.
      Wine is clarified also, and its bad taste is often corrected,
 by making it digest over shavings of beech wood, previously
  stripped of the bark, boiled in water, and dried in the fun or
 in a stove : a quarter of a bushel of these shavings will be suf
 ficient for a muid of wine. They produce a slight movement
 of fermentation in the liquor, which becomes clear in the
 course of twenty- four hours.
     The art of cutting wines (couper du vin), as it is called,
                                          —
 (correcting one wine by another giving a body to those
 wines which are weak — colour to those destitute of it — and
 an agreeable flavour to those which have none, or which
 have a bad one,) cannot be described.              In these cases, the
 taste, fight, and smell must be consulted.            The highly va
 riable nature of the substances employed must be studied;
 and it will be sufficient for us to observe, that in this part
 of the management of wines every thing consists: ist. In
 sweetening wines, and rendering them saccharine by the ad
dition of baked mujt, concentrated             with honey, sugar, or
 another wine of a very luscious quality.           2d, Colouring the

of the flowers of the vine suspended in the cask, tied up in a
bag, as is practised in Egypt, according to the testimony of
Hasselquist.
     In the Orleanois, and other countries, a wine is made
called there vin rapt.          It is prepared ftom picked grapes,
which are trod with wine or ley ; plating in the press a stra
tum of vine-twigs and another of grapes in alternate order,
or by infusing the twigs in the wine. These wines are made
to boil strongly, and they are then employed to give strength

and colour to the weak colourless                   wines of the cold and damp
countries.
   Though wine may work at all times, there are certain pe
riods of the year at which fermentation seems to be renewed
in a particular m inner; and, above all, when the vine begins
to bud, when it is in flower, ov when the grapes begin to
become coloured.           At these critical moments, wine ought
to be watched with particular care ; aud every movement of
fermentation may be prevented by drawing off, and sulphur
ing   it, as above indicated.
    When wines are completely clarified, they are preserved in
casks, or    in  glass.    The largest vessels are the best, and they
ought   to   be   well  closed.   Every body has heard of the enor
mous capacity of the tun of Heidelberg,                     which wine
                                                                    in                     is
preserved     for  whole    centuries,  always    improving      quality;   in
 and   it   is allowed that wine keeps better in very large casks
 than  in  small ones.
    The choice of situation             which vessels containing wine
                                              in
 ought   to  be   deposited,    not is  matter a of indifference on this        :
 subject we find among the antients usages and precepts which
 deviate for the most partfrom our common methods, butwhich,
 in part, are worthy of attention.           The Romans drew off the
 wine from the casks to shut           up in large earthen vessels glazed
                                              it
 in the inside: this          what they called diff'ujio vinorum.
                               is                                                         It
 appears that for containing wines they had two sorts of vessels,
which  they called amphora and cadus. The amphora was of
a square or cubical form, had two handles, and contained
twenty gallons of liquor.     This vessel terminated      narrow           in   a
neck, which was stopped with pilch or plaster to prevent the
wine from exhaling. This we learn from Petronius, who fays,
Amphora vitrece ddigenter gypfatœ allatev /unl, quorum iu
cervicibus pittacia erant afjixa cum hoc titulo — " Falermun epi-
manum annorum centum." The cadus h;id the figure of the cone

    That wine may keep, and improve in quality, it ought to
 be put into vessels deposited in proper places, the choice of
 which is not a matter of indifference.       Glass vessels are the
 mod favourable, because, besides their presenting no principle
 soluble in wine, they (belter it from the contact of the air,
 from moisture, and the principal variations of the atmo
 sphere.    Care must be taken to shut these vessels very closely
 with good cork ; and to lay the bottles on their sides, that
the cork may not dry, and facilitate the access of the air.
 For the greater safety, the cork may be covered with a coating
of wax, applied by means of a brush; or the neck of the
 bottle may be immersed in a mixture of melted wax, resin,
and pitch.     Some people cover the wine with a stratum of
oil : this process is recommended by Baccius.          The neck is
then covered with an inverted glass tumbler, a vessel of tin
 plate, or any matter capable of preventing infects or mice
 from falling into the wine.
    The vessels most generally employed for keeping wine are
casks, which for the molt part are made of oak.         They vary
 in size, and are known by different names, such as pipes,
hogsheads, &c.       The great inconvenience of casks          is,that
they not only present to the wine substances which are soluble
in    it,
        but that they are affected    the variations of the atmo
                                           by
sphere, and afford     passage both lo the air which endeavours
                          a
to escape from them, and to that of the atmosphere which
penetrates them.
    Glazed earthen vessels have the advantage of retaining            a
more equal temperature but thev are more or less porous,
                               ;
and at length the wine in them must become dry.               In the
ruins of Hereulaneum vessels were found            which the wine
                                                     in
had dried.     Ilozier speaks of a similar urn discovered            in
                                                                     a

where the palace ot 1'ompey had formerly stood.           The lio-
mans remedied the porolily of earthen vessels bv covering
them with wax on the inside, and pitch on the outside          : they
covered also the whole surface with wax cloths, which they
applied with great care.
    Pliny condemns this use of wax, because, he savs,          made

    3d, The moisture in it must be constant, without being too
great : excess of moisture renders the papers, corks, casks, &c.
mouldy. Dryness desiccates the casks, and makes them leak.
    4th, The light ought to be very moderate: a strong light
dries ; darkness, almost absolute, rots.
    5th, The cellar must be sheltered from fliocks.       Violent
agitation,  or that making   occasioned  by the  rapid  passage of
carriages along the street, agitates the lees, mixes them with
the wine, where they are kept suspended, and occasions
acetisication. Thunder, and all movement occasioned by
fliocks, produce the fame effect.
    6th, Green wood, vinegar, and all substances susceptible
of fermentation, must be kept at a distance from a cellar.

changes the temperature of a cellar, must also alter the pro

VII. Maladies           of   Wine, and the Means                of   preventing or
                               carreEling them.
    There are some wines which improve                     by
                                                  age, and which
 cannot be considered as perfect till         long time after they
                                                      a
 have been made.       Luscious wines are of this kind, as well
 as all highly spiritous wines; but delicate wines are so apt
 to turn jour, or oily, that      it only
                                       is             by
                                               means of great pre
 caution they can be preserved for several years.
    The first of the principal kinds of wine known     Burgundy,     in
is  that of Volney, near Beaune. This wine,           delicate,and
                                                                 so
 agreeable, will not bear the vat ahove 12, 16, or 18 hours,
 and can scarcely be kept from one vintage to another.
    The second of the principal kinds of wine         Burgundy  in              is
that of Pomard     :
                        keeps better than the former
                        it                             but     kept  ;     if
longer than    a  year,     becomes oily, spoils, and assumes the
                             it
colour of the peelings of onions.
    In every canton the wine has fixed and known period of
                                            a
duration   ; and   it   every where known that this period must
                        is
be shorter or longer according to the nature of the season, and
the tare employed in the process of vinisication.       No one                  is
                                                          ignorant

ignorant that the wine made from grapes collected in rainy
weather, or produced in fat soil, is not of long duration.
   The antients, as we are informed by Galen and Athenæus,
had determined the epoch of age, or the period at which the
different wines ought to be drunk : — Falernum ab annis de
cent ut potui iduneum, et a quindecim usque ad viginti annos :
after that period grave       capiti et nervos ojfendit. Albani

    The care employed in drawing off wine, and mixing                                 it
 with mute wine, contributes greatly to its preservation,           few
 kinds are shipped without this precaution.                  of import
                                                                 It   is
 ance then, for the prevention of all its alterations, that all
 these operations should be multiplied and repeated             and    ;         it   is.
 to this valuable practice we are indebted for the power of
 being able to fend wine to all climates, and to subject               to.       it
 all temperatures, without fear of decomposition.
    Among the diseases to which wines are most subject, oili-
 ness and acidity are the most common and most dangerous.
    Oiliness  isan alteration which wines often contract:           they,
 lose their natural fluidity, and become ropy, like oil.
    The less spiritous wines turn oily and weak wines, which
                                                         ;
  have fermented very little, are the most disposed to this ma
 lady.     Weak wines, made from grapes which have been
 picked, are also subject to it.
    Wine turns oily in the best corked bottles. Of this there
 are too frequent instances in Champagne, where the wine of
a   whole vintage, when put into glass vessels,           exposed some
                                                                 is
 times to this alteration.

 and oily spirit.
    This fault may be corrected several ways.
     1st, By exposing the bottles to the air, and, above all, in
a   well-aired barn.
     2d, By shaking the bottle for         quarter of an hour then
                                                     a                       ;

    3d, By mixing        the  wine    with  fish-glue and whites of
 eggs    mixed together.
    4th, By introducing into each bottle one or two drops of
 lemon juice, or any other acid.

     jst, Wine never turns four until the spiritous fermentation
is  terminated or, in other words, till the saccharine prin

                     is
pave the way for acetous decomposition.                  Hence the prac
tice of putting          little sugar into the bottle to preserve the
                              a

 In some places of Spain and Italy all the must                    baked;              is
and Bellon savs. that the wines of Crete would not keep at
sea unless the precaution were taken to boil them.
     2d, The least spiritous wines are those which soonest be
 come sour.        We know, bv experience, that when the season
is  rainy,      the grapes be little saccharine, which consequently
                if
give little alcohol, the wines readily turn four.               The weak
wines of the north become four with great ease; while the
 strong, generous, spiritous wines obstinately resist acidity.
      It is however    no less true, that the most spiritous wines
furnist) the strongest vinegar, though their acetification                                  is
more difficult, because alcohol                necessary to the formation

                   and the Method of making Wines,                  217
       3d,  Wine perfectly     free from all extractive matter, either
¦ in    consequence    of  its   being deposited naturally by time or
  by clarification, is not susceptible of turning sour.           I have
  exposed old wine in uncorked bottles to the ardour of the fun
  of July and August for more than forty days without the
  wine losing its quality ; onlv the colouring principle was con
  stantly precipitated under the form of a membrane, which
  covered the bottom of the bottle.           The fame wine in which
   I  infused vine-leaves, became sour      in a few days.  It is known
   that   old wines,  well   purified, do  not turn four.
       4th, Wine does not acidify, or become four, but when in
   contact with the air: atmospheric air mixed with wine is a
   real leaven of acidity.       When wine grows flat [se pousse) it
   suffers to escape, or exhales, the gas it contains, and the ex
   ternal air then enters to assume its place.          Rozier proposes
   to adapt a bladder to a pipe inserted in the vessel, in order to
   ascertain the absorption of the air and the disengagement of
   the gas.     When the bladder sills, the wine tends to flatten;
   if it empties itself, it is a sign of its turning four.
        When wine flattens, the cask suffers the wine to ooze
   through the (ides, and isa hole be made with a gimbl t, the
   wine escapes with a hissing noise and foam : on the other
   hand, when wine turns four, the fides of the cask, the bung,
   and the luting, are dry, and the air rushes in with violence
   as soon as it is unstopped.
        From   this circumstance it mav be concluded that wine
    shut up   in very close vessels is not susceptible of becoming
    sour.
        5th, There are certain times of the year when the wine
    turns more rcadilv sour.          These periods are, the moment
    when the sap rises in the vine, when it flowers, or when the
    grapes assume a reddish tint.        It is during these periods, in
    particular, that precautions must be taken to prevent its be
    coming acid.
        6th, Change in the temperature also promotes acidity,
    especially when the heat rises to 80 or 90 degrees.          The de
    generation is then rapid, and almost unavoidable.
        The acidity of wine may be easily prevented by removing
    all those causes before mentioned which tend to produce this
    alteration ; and when it has begun, it mav be remedied by
    the means, more or less effectual, which we are going to
    mention.
        Baked must, honey, or liquorice, are dissolved in wine in
    which acidity has manifested itself: by these means its four
    taste is corrected, being concealed by the svveetisti savour of
    these ingredients.
                                                                      The

 81 8               On the Cultivation   of the Vine,
     The little acid which has been formed may be seized br
 the means of ashes, alkalies, chalk, lime, and even litharge.
 This last substance, which forms a very sweet salt with
 acetous acid, is exceedingly dangerous.        This criminal adul
 teration mav be easily detected oy pouring hydro-sulphuret
 of potash (liver of sulphur) into the wine.             There will
 be immediately formed an abundant and black precipitate.
 Sulphurated hydrogen gas may also be made to pass through
 this altered liquor : this will produce a blackish precipitate,
 which is nothing but fulphuret of lead.
     The works of oinologists abound with recipes, of greater
 or less value, for correcting the acidity of wine.
     Bidet fays, that about a fiftieth of skimmed milk added to
 four wine restores it; and that it may be drawn off in five
 days.
     Others take foiir ounces of the best wheat, boil it in water
 till it bursts ; and, when it has cooled, put it into a small bag
 which is immersed in the cask, shaking it with a stick.
     Some recommend also the seeds of leeks, fennel, &c.
     To show the futility of the greater part of these remedies,
it will be sufficient to observe, that it is impossible to make
 fermentation proceed in a retrograde manner, and that it can
at moll be suspended ; that the whole of the acid then formdti
may be seized, or its existence may be concealed, by sweet
and saccharine principles.
     But besides these alterations there are others, which, though
less common and dangerous deserve to be noticed.              Wine
sometimes contracts what is called a taste of the cask.        This
malady may arise from two causes : first, when the wine is
put into casks, the wood of which is rotten or damaged; se
condly, when lees have been left to dry in the casks into
which new wine is put. Willcrmoz proposes lime water,
carbonic acid, and oxygenated muriatic acid, to correct the
bad taste arising from the cask : others recommend mixing
the wine with isinglass, drawing it carefully off, and infusing
roasted wheat in it for two or three days.
     A phænomenon, which has struck and embarrassed the
numerous authors who have spoken of the diseases of wine,
is what is called ihe flowers of wine.         These are formed in
casks, but particularly in bottles, in which they occupy the
neck ; they constantly announce and precede the acid dege
neration of wine.       They manifest themselves in almost all
fermented liquors, and always more or less abundantly ac
cording to the quantity of extractive matter existing in the
liquor.     I have seen them formed in such abundance, in a
fermented mixture of molasses and the yeast of beer, that
                                                               they

                    and the Method           of making Wines.                      aio
they precipitated themselves in the liquor in pellicles, or nu
merous and successive strata. In this manner, I have obtained
twenty strata.
   These flowers, which I at first took for a precipitate of
tartar,  is,
           in my opinion,       vegetation, or real byffus, which
                                     a

seous odour, which went off after      long-continued' fermenta
                                                  a
tion.   This effect was owing to an enormous quantity of
tree-bugs, (punaises de bois,) which had settled on the grapes,
and which had been crushed in treading them.

  Wine    has become the most usual beverage                       of man,    and   is,
at the  fame time, the most varied.     Wine                         known in all

be salutary.     The antients ascribed to        the property of

the celebrated Galen, who assigns to each fort its peculiar
uses, and describes the difference they acquire          age, cli        by
mate, &c.
    Excess     regard to the use of wine has at all times called
               in
forth the censure of legislators.      was customary among the
                                                  It

of that famous legislator, who, to restrain the intemperance
of the people, authorized           it   by
                                  an express law,    well known     is              ;

 220                   On the Cultivation        of the Vine,
Lacedæmonian youth;         By a law of Carthage, the use of
wine   was   prohibited  in the time of war.    Plato interdicted
it to voung persons   below  the  age of twenty-two.    Aristotle
did the same to children and nurses.       And we are informed
by Palmarius that the laws of Rome allowed to priests, or
those employed     in the sacrifices, but three small glasses of
wine at their repasts.
   But, notwithstanding the wisdom of laws, the hideous
pidture of intemperance, and the fatal consequences wiih
avhich it is attended, the attractions of wine have been so
powerful among certain nations, that their fondness for it
has degenerated into a passion and real want.       We daily see
men, prudent in other respects, gradually acquire the habit
of indulging immoderately in the use of this liquor; and in
their wine extinguish their moral faculties and their physical
strength.
                          Narratur tt prisci Catonis,
                         Sæpe mero incaluilse     virtus.
   We learn from history, that Wenceflas, king of Bohemia
and of the Romans, having come to France to negotiate a
treaty with Charles VI. repaired to Rheims in the month of
May 1397, where he got intoxicated every day with the wine
of the country, choosing rather to forego everything than
not indulge in this excels*.
   The virtue of wine differs according to its age. New wine
is flatulent, indigestible, and purgative: mujlum fiatuojum et
concoilu difficile.   Unum in fe bonum continet^ quod alvum
emolliat.    Vmum    rarum  infrigiddt ; — mujluvi crajji Jucci eji,
et   frigidi.
   The antients confounded these words — mujlum et novunt
vinum.      Ovid fays, Qui nova mujla bibunt.       XJnde virgo
mujla   ditla    ejl
                 fro inlacla et  novella.
   Light wines only can be drunk before they have grown
old.    The reason we have mentioned in the preceding pages.
The Romans, as we have observed, followed this custom,
and drank their wines             in
                                succession  Vinum Gauranum el

   New wines are not at all nourishing, especially those which
are aqueous, and little saccharine: corpori alimentum fubge-

   These wines readily produce intoxication;     and the reason
of this     the quantity of carbonic acid with which they are
          is,

    Old wines, in general, are tonic, and very wholesome :
they are suited to weak stomachs,              old people, and in all
cafes where strengthening is necessary : they assord very
little nourishment, becaule they are deprived of their really
 nourishing principles, and contain scarcely any other than
 alcohol.
    It is of such wine that the poet speaks, when he fays :
                           Generosum et lene requiro
           Quod curas ahigat, quod cum   spc divite rnanet

           Quod me, Lucanc, juvenein comniendct
    Oily thick wines are the most nourishing.               Pinguia san-
guinem augent et nutriunt ; — Galen.            The same author re
 commends the wines of Therea and Scibellia as highly nou
 rishing : quod era/sum utrumque, nigrum et dulce.
    Wines differ also essentially in regard to colour. Red, in
 general, is more spiritous, lighter, and more digestible :
 white wine furnishes less alcohol, and is more diuretic and
 weaker, as it has remained less time in the vat : it is almost
 always more oilv, more nutritive, and more gaseous, than
 the red.
     Pliny admits four shades in the colour of wines — album,
fulvum, sanguineum, rubrum : but it would be too minute as
 well as useless to multiply shades, which might become in
 finite, by extending them from black to white.
     Climate, culture, and variety in the processes of fermenta
 tion, produce alio infinite differences in the qualities and
 virtues of wine.        To avoid fatiguing repetitions, we must
 refer to what we have already said on this subject.
     The art of tempering wine by the addition of one part of
 water was practised among the antients : wine of this kind
 they called vinum dilutum.         Pliny, after Homer, speaks of

 historian informs us, that in his time wines so spiritous were
 known, that they could not be drunk: nisi pervincerentur
 aqua et attenuentur aqua calida.
     The antients, who had very just and correct ideas respect
 ing the art of making and preserving wines, seem to have
 been unacquainted with that of distilling spirit from them :
 the first correct ideas respecting the distillation of wine are
 ascribed to Arnaud de Villeneuve,           professor of medicine at
 Montpellier.
     The distillation of wines has given a new value to this
 production.       It has not only furnished a new beverage,

  XXXIII.       Description of the Table and tbe Vaarlberg Moun
     tains, in Southern Africa.        By John Barrow, Esq.*
        HE     first appearance  of so stupendous a mass of naked
  rock as the Table Mountain, cannot fail to arrest, for a time,
  the attention of the most indifferent observer of nature from
  all inferior objects, and most particularly interest that of the
 mineralogist.        As a description of this mountain will, with
  few variations, answer to that of almost all the great range*
 in Southern Africa, it may not, perhaps, be thought too te
 dious to enter into a detail of its form, dimensions, and con
 stituent parts.
     The name of tulle land is given by seamen to every hill or
 mountain whose summit presents to the eye of the observer
 a line parallel to the horizon.        The north front of the Table
 Mountain, directly facing the town, is a horizontal line, or
very nearly so, of about two miles in length. The bold face,
 that rises almost at right angles to meet this line, is sup
 ported, as it were, by a number of projecting buttresses that
 rife out of the plain, and fall in with the front a little higher
 than midway from the base. These and the division of the
front, by two great chasms, into three parts, a curtain flanked
by two bastions, the fust retiring and the others project
ing, give lo it the appearance of the ruined walls of some
gigantic fortress.      These walls rife above the level of Table
Bay to the height of 3582 feet, as determined by captain
Bridges, of the royal engineers, from a measured base and
angles taken with a good theodolite.              The east fide, which
runs off at right angles to the front, is (till bolder, and has
one point higher by several feet.          The west fide, along the
sea shore, is rent into deep chasms,           and worn away into a
number of pointed masses.             In  advancing to the southward
about four miles, the mountain descends in steps or terraces,
the lowest of which communicates by gorges with the chain

            Paarlberg Mountains, in Southern Africa.           223
that extends the whole length of the peninsula. The two
wings of the front, one of the Devil's Mountain, and the
other the Lion's Head, make, in fact, with the Table, but
one mountain.      The depreciations of time and the force of
torrents, having carried away the looser and less compact
parts, have disunited their summits, but they are (till joined
at a very considerable       elevation above the common base.
The height of the first is 3315, and of the latter 2160 feet.
The Devil's Mountain is broken into irregular points; but
the upper part of the Lion's Head is a solid mass of stone,
rounded and fashioned like a work of art, and resembling
very much, from some points of view, the dome of Saint
Paul's placed upon a high cone-shaped hill. These three
mountains are composed of a multitude of rocky strata, piled
on each other in large tabular masses. Their exact hori
zontal position denotes the origin of the mass to be neptunian,
and not volcanic ; and that, since its first formation, no con
vulsion of the earth has happened in this part of Africa suffi
 cient to have disturbed the nice arrangement of its parts. The
 strata of these postdiluvian ruins not being placed in the order
 of their specific gravity, might lead to the conclusion that
 they were deposited in successive periods of time, were it not
 for the circumstance of their lying close upon each other,
 without any intermediate veins of earthy or other extraneous
 materials.    The stratification of the cape peninsula, and, in
 deed, of the whole colony, is arranged in the following order :
     The sliores of Table Bay, and the substratum of the plain
 on which the town is built, compose a bed of a blue compact
schistus, generally placed in parallel ridges in the direction
 of north-west and south-east, but frequently interrupted by
 large masses of a hard flinty rock of the fame colour, belong
 ing to that class of aggregated stones proposed by Mr. Kirwan
 to l)e called granitelhs.   Fine blue flags, with whitish streaks,
 are procured from Robben Island, 111 the mouth of Table
 Bay, which are used for steps, and for paving the terraces in
 front of most of the houses.
     Upon the schistus lies a body of strong clay coloured with
 iron from a pale yellow to deep red, and abounding with
 brown foliated mica.       Imbedded in the clay are immense
 blocks of granite, so loosely cemented together, that the con
 stituent parts are easily separated by the hand.       The mica,
 the sand, and indeed the whole bed of clay, seem to have
 been formed from the decomposition of the granite.            Be
 tween the Lion's Head and the sea, are vast masses of these
 aggregated stones entirely exposed.      Most of them are rent,
 and falling asunder from their own weight; others are com

%%4              Description of the Table and    the
pletely hollowed out, so as to be nothing more than a crust
or shell ; and they have almost invariably a small aperture
on that side of the stone which faces the bottom of the hill
or the sea shore.    Such excavated blocks of coarse granite
are very common on the hills of Africa, and are frequently
inhabited by runaway (laves.
   Resting on the granite and clay is the first horizontal stra
tum of the Table Mountain, commencing at about five hun
dred feet above the level  of the sea.   It is siliceous sand-stone
of a dirty yellow colour. Above this is a deep brown sand
stone, containing calciform ores of iron, and veins of hema
tite, running through the solid rock. Upon this rests a mass,
of about a thousand sect in height, of a whitish-gray shining
granular quartz, mouldering away in many places by ex
posure to the weather, and in others pasting into sand-stone.
The summit of the mountain has entirely undergone the
transition into sand-stone; and the skeletons of the rocks,
that have hitherto resisted ihe ravages of time, are surrounded
by myriads of oval-stiaped and rounded pebbles of semi-trans
parent quartz that were once imbedded in them.                Those
pebbles,   having  acquired   their  rounded    form    bv friction,
when the matrix, in which they are still found buried, had
not assumed the form and consistence of stone; and the situa
tion of this stratified matrix on blocks of primæval granite,
clearly point out a grand revolution to have taken place on
the surface of the globe we inhabit.      No organized remains,
however, of the old world, such as stiells buried in the rock,
petrifactions of fishes, or impressions of plants, appear on
the sides of the Table Mountain, as has been aslerted.
   To those whom mere curiosity, or the more laudable desire
of acquiring information, may tempt to make a visit to the
summit of the Table Mountain, the best and readiest acccls
will be found directly up the face next to the town. The
ascent lies through a deep chasm, that divides the curtain
from the left bastion.      The length of this ravine is about
three-fourths of a mile, the perpendicular checks at the foot
more than a thousand sect high, and the angle of ascent
about forty- five degrees.   The entrance into this deep chasm
is grand and awful.     The two sides, distant at the lower part
about eighty yards from each other, converge within a few
feet at the portal, which opens upon the summit, forming
two lines of natural perspective.       On passing this portal, a
plain of very considerable extent spreads out, exhibiting a
dreary waste and an insipid tamencss, after quitting the bold
and romantic scenery of the chasm.      And the adventurer mav
perhaps, feel strongly disposed to ask himself, if such be afl

     All the objects on the plain below are, in fact, dwindled
 away to the eye of the spectator into littleness and insignifi
 cance. The flat-roofed houses of Cape Town, disposed into
 formal clumps, appear like those paper fabrics which children
 are accustomed to make with cards.                 The shrubbery on the
 sandy isthmus looks like dots; and the farms and their in
 closures as so many lines, and the more finished part9 of a
 plan drawn on paper.
     On the swampy parts of the flat summit, between the
 masses of rock, are growing several sorts of handsome slirubs.
 The cenœa mucronata, a tall, elegant, frutefeent plant, is
 peculiar to this situation ; as is also that species of heath
 called the pkyjbdes, which, with its clusters of white flowers,
 glazed with a glutinous coating, exhibits in the sunshine a
 very beautiful appearance.             Many other heaths, common
 also on the plains, seemed to thrive equally well on this ele
vated situation as in a milder temperature.                 The air on the
summit, in the clear weather of winter, and in the shade, is
generally about fifteen degrees of Fahrenheit's scale lower than
in Cape Town *.            In the summer season the difference is
much greater, when that well known appearance of the fleecy
cloud, not inaptly called the tablecloth, envelops the summit
of the mountain.
    A single glance at the topography of the Cape and the
adjacent country, will be sufficient to explain the cause of
this phænomenon, which has so much the appearance of
singularity.      The mountainous peninsula is connected with
a still more mountainous continent, on which the great
ranges run parallel to, and at no great distance from, the sea

coast.    In the heat of the summer season, when the south
east  monsoon blows strong at sea, the water taken up by eva
poration is borne in the air to the continental mountains,
where, being condensed, it rests on their summits in the form
of a thick cloud. This cloud, and a low dense bank of fog
on the sea, .are the precursors of a similar but lighter fleece
on the Table Mountain, and of a strong gale of wind in.
Cape Town from the south-east.               These effects may be thus
accounted for     : —  The condensed air on the summit of the
mountains of the continent, rushes, by its superior gravity,
towards the more rarefied atmosphere over the isthmus, and
the vapour it contains is there taken up and held invisible, or
in transparent solution.            From hence it is carried by the
south-east     wind     towards the Table and its neighbouring
mountains, where, by condensation from decreased tem
perature and concussion,            the air is no longer capable of
holding    the  vapour with which it was loaded, but is obliged
to let it go.    The atmosphere on the summit of the moun
tain becomes turbid, the cloud is shortly formed, and, hur
ried by the wind over the verge of the precipice in large fleecy
volumes, rolls clown the steep sides towards the plain, threat
ening momentarily to deluge the town.                 No sooner, how
ever,  does   it arrive,   in its   descent, at  the point of tempera
ture equal to that of the atmosphere in which it has floated
over the isthmus, than it is once more taken up, and " va
nishes into air — to thin air."          Every other part of the hemi
sphere   shows   a  clear  blue   flev, undisturbed  by a single vapour.
    The Paarlberg, on the left of the pass into the valley, is a
hill of moderate height, and has taken its name from a chain
of large round stones that pass over the summit like the pearls
of a necklace. Of these, the two that are placed near the
central and highest point of the range are called, par excel
lence, the Pearl and the Diamond ; and a particular descrip
tion of them has been thought worthy of a place in the Phi
losophical Transactions. From that paper, and Mr. Maffon's
description, it woold appear that these two masses of (tone
rested   upon their own bases, and were detached from the
mountain ; whereas they grow out, and form a part of it. It
has also been said that their composition was totally different
from the rocks that are found in the neighbouring mountain,
which led a naturalist in Europe to observe, that these im-
nunlc blocks of granite had probably been thrown up bv
volcanic explosions, or by some cause of a similar nature.            It
has been observed in the preceding pages, that the sand
stone strata of the Table Mountain rested upon a bed of pri
mæval granite, and that an infinite number of large stones
                                                                   were

were     scattered   at the feet     of  the mountains along the sea
coast, from the Lion's Head to the true Cape of Good Hope.
All these are precisely of the same nature and the same ma
terials as the Pearl and the Diamond ; that is to fay, they
are aggregates of quartz and mica; the first in large irregular
masses, and the latter in black lumps resembling fhorl : they
contain also cubic pieces of feltspar, and seem to be bound
together by plates of a clayey iron-stone.             All the stones of
this description appear to have been formed round a nucleus,
as by the action of the air and weather they fall to pieces in
large concentric laminæ.              The Pearl is accessible on the
northern fide, but is neatly perpendicular on all the rest.
This sloping side is more than a thousand feet, and the per
pendicular altitude about four hundred feet, above the sum
mit of the mountain ; and the circumference of its base is a
full mile.       Near the top it is quadrise6ted by two clifts,
crossing at right angles, in which were growing a number
of beautiful aloes, several cryptogamous and other plants.
A great part of the slanting side was covered with a species
of green lichen. Down the perpendicular fides were im
mense rifts, as if the mass had been torn asunder by its own
weight.        The Diamond is the higher block, but less bulky,
and, being cone-shaped, is difficult and dangerous to ascend.
XXXIV.          Observations   on the Means of enabling a Cottager
    to keep a    Coiu  by the Produce     of a small Portion of Arable-
    Land.       By Sir   John Sinclair,          Bart.    M.P.*
 I  N several part3 of the kingdom, as in Lincolnshire, Rut-
landsliire, &c, which are calculated for grazing, it is not
unusual to give, industrious cottagers as much land as will
enable them to keep a cow, and sometimes two, or more,
besides other stock ; and it appears from the communications
of Lord Winchelsea and others to the Board of Agriculture,
from the publications of the Society for bettering the Con
dition of the Poor, and from a late interesting work printed
by Mr. Arthur Youngs, that such a system is productive of
the happiest consequences.            It is supposed, however, to be
totally inapplicable to an arable district.             I trust that such
an opinion will not be admitted . without full consideration.

238        Means of enabling a Cottager     to keep  a Coin
Indeed,     so far as I can judge, this advantageous system is to
the full    as  well adapted for the one district as for the other.
 It requires unquestionably more labour on the part of the
cottager, and of his family ; at the fame time, the occupation
of so great an extent of ground is not so necessary in arable
as in grazing countries; a circumstance, in various respects,
extremely material.
    In arranging the following plan, (which the reader will
 please to consider merely as furnistiing an outline, to be per
 fected by further discussion and experiment,) it is proposed
 to keep in view the following principles:
     I. That the cottager (liall raise, by his own labour, some
of the most material articles of subsistence for himself and his
 family.
     a.  That he shall be enabled to supply the adjoining mar
 kets   with the smaller agricultural productions. And,
    3. That both he and his family shall have it in their power
 to assist the neighbouring fanners, at 'all seasons of the year,
 almost equally as well as if they had no land in their occu
 pation.
    It can hardly be questioned, that if it were practicable to
 have a number of cottagers of that description in every parish,
 it would promote, in various        respects,  the   interests  of the
 public.
                     /. Extent of Land    necessary.
    Unless the experiment were fairly tried, it is impossible to
 state  exactly the extent of arable land requisite to enable a
 cottager lo raise the articles generally necessary for the fuste-
 liince of himself and family ; and to keep a cow, some pigs,
 and poultry.      Much must depend on the natural richness of
 the foil ; (though, under the management about to be pro
 posed, almost any soil would, in time, become fertile;) on
 the nature of the climate; on the size of the cow: on the
  industry of the cottager; on the age and number of his fa
 mily, Sec. But I should imagine that three statute acres
 and a quarter of good arable land, worth from 20s. to 305.
 per acre, would be sufficient.      It is proposed that the three
  acres sliall be under a regular course of cropping.              The
 quarter of an acre ought, if possible, to be converted into an
 orchard; where the cow might occasionally pasture, and
  where a pond ought to be kept in good order, that it may
  have plenty of water at command.         Were the land of a qua
 lity fit for lucerne, perhaps two acres and a quarter might be
 sufficient.
                                                             II.  Stock

             II.Slock mid Instruments of Husbandry.
   It is evident that so small an extent of land as either two
or three acres, under cultivation, excludes all idea of plough
     *
ing ; and, indeed, unless the cottager shall manage the
whole in the simplest and cheapest manner, there is an end
to the whole system.     It would require, indeed, four or five
acres to keep a single horse, and the expense of purchasing
horses, or even oxen, ploughs, and other instruments of
husbandry, must be far beyond the abilities of a cottager;
whereas with a spade, a hoe, a rake, a scythe, a sickle, and
a flail, which are all the instruments really necessary, he is
perfectly competent to the management of his little farm.
                           III.
                       Course of Crops, &c.
   The three acres proposed to be cultivated should be divided
into four portions, each consisting of three roods, under the
following system of management               :
                                                                  Roods.

Under winter tares two roods, spring tares one                      3
Under barley, wheat, or oats        -       -                       3
Under clover, with a mixture of rye grafs %                         3

   Other articles besides these might be mentioned, but it
seems to me of peculiar importance to restrict the attention
of the cottager to as few objects of cultivation as possible.
   It is proposed that the produce of the two roods of potatoes
(hall go to the maintenance of the cottager and his family§;
and that the rood of turnips should be given to the cow in
winter and during the spring, in addition to its other fare.
  The second portion, sown with tares, (the two roods of
potatoes of the former year to be successively sown with
winter tares, and the turnip rood with spring tares,) might
partly be cut green, for feeding the cow in summer and au
tumn; but, if the season will permit, the whole ought to be

                 might, perhaps, be hired ; but, on the whole, the spade cul

cularly in   winter, a;d to supply the family with linen.
J    Some recommend the proportion per acre to be at the rate of one
bulhel of rye grass to 1* Ibs. of red clover; others, 14 Ibs. of red clover
to balsa bulhel of r\e grafs.
  §   By Sir John Meihuen Poore's experiments        itwas found that half    a
rood, or one-eighth of an acre, produced, for several years, as great         a
weight of potatoes as was sufficient for       family of four persons.

                                         3                                 made

%$o         Means    of enabling  a Cottager to keep a Cow
made into hay for the winter and spring feed, and three roods
of clover cut green for summer food.
    The third portion may be sown either with barley, wheat,
or oats, according to the foil or climate, and the general
custom of the country. The straw of any of these crops would
be of essential service for littering the cow, but would be
still more useful, if cut into chaff, for feeding it.
    The fourth portion, appropriated to clover and rye grass,
to be cut green, which, with the assistance of the orchard,
will produce, on three roods of land, as much food as will
maintain a cow and her calf for five months, namely, from
the end of May, or beginning of June, when it may be first
cut, to the first of November, besides some food for the pigs.
It is supposed that an acre of clover and rye grass, cut green,
will produce 20,000 lbs. weight of food for cattle. Three
roods, therefore, ought to yield 15,000 lbs. weight. A large
cow requires 110 lbs. weight of green food per day; a mid
dling sized cow, such as a cottager is likely to purchase,
not above oolbs.; consequently, in five months, allowing
 1320 lbs. weight for the calf and the pigs, there will remain
 13,680 lbs. for the cow*. Were there, however, even a
small deficiency, it would be more than compensated by the
rood of land proposed to be kept in perpetual pasture as an
orchard.
       IV.   Mode in which      the Family may      be maintained.
    It  is calculated that three roods and eight perches          of pota
 toes   will maintain     a  family of fix persons for about nine
 months in the year; but, according to the preceding plan,
it is proposed to have but two roods under that article ; for
 however valuable potatoes are justly accounted, yet some
 change of food would be acceptable, and the cottager will
 be enabled, from the produce of the cow, and by the income
 derived from his own labour, and from that of his family, to
 purchase other wholesome articles of provision.
             V. Manner in which the Slock may be kept.
     It appears from the preceding system of cropping, that ten
 roods of land, or two acres and a half, are appropriated to
 the raising of food for the cow in summer and winter, besides
 the pasture of the orchard; and unless the season should be
 extremely unfavourable, the produce will be found not only
  adequate to that purpose, but also to maintain the calf for
 some time, till it can be sold to advantage.            It is indeed ex
 tremely material, under the proposed system, to make as
    * These calculations are                                        It must
                             merely given as data for experiment.
 depend upon the season, whether the tares or the clover should be madt
 into hay.
                                                                     much

                 on a  small Portion os Arable Land.                       23 J
much profit of the calves as possible, as the money thus raised
will be a resource, enabling the cottager to replace his cow
when a new one must be purchased.
    For the winter provision of the cow, which is the most
material, because summer food can be more easily procured,
there is the produce,
    1. Of about three roods of tares made into hay.
    2. Of three roods of straw, deducting what may be neces
sary for litter; and if dry earth be put in the cow's hovel, and
removed from time to time to the dunghill, little or no litter
wilj   be necessary.
    3. Of one rood       of turnips.
    The whole will       be sufficient for seven months in the year,
namely,     from   the   1st November to the ist June; and during
the remaining five months, the pasture of the orchard, some
of the winter tares, and the produce of three roods of clover
and rye grafs, will not only suffice, but will furnish a surplus
for the calf, if it is kept for any length of time*, and some
clover for the pigs.
    The inferior barley, potatoes, &c. will of course be given
to the pigs and the poultry.
                        VI. Value of the Produce.
    The land thus       managed will certainly produce, by means
of  the extra industry of the family, and at a small expense, a
most important addition to the income which the cottager
may derive from his ordinary labour.               For instance :
     1. The orchard (after the trees become fruitful)              per Ann.
           will probably yield              -        -         £. 1 10 o

    *
       In a pamphlet just published by Richardson, Cornhill, on the Culture
 of Potatoes, price 1 s. the following mode of applying the refuse potatoes
 to the feeding of calves is ftrongK- recommended :
    " Take two gallons ot small potatoes, wash them clean, put them into
 a pot of boiling water sufficient to cover them, and let them boil till the
 whole becomes a pulp : then add more water, and run the whole through
 a hair sieve, which will produce a strong nutritive   gruel.    At first use a
 very small quantity, warmed up with milk, to make it palatable to the
 calf, and increase the quantity daily, till it becomes equal.      A quart of
 fotatoc gruel, and a quart of scald or skimmed milk, will be sufficient for
 a pood meal, which should be given warm three times a day."
     f  According to Mr. Kent's calculations, a cow should produce six quarts
                                      P4                                      of

  23 s        Mtatu os enabling       a Cottager to keep a Cow
       Where wheat can be raised instead of barley, the prosit
   would be still more considerable.           Opinions will differ much
   regarding   the   value   put   on  each  article  ; but that is of little
   consequence,    as  the  total  cannot   be  accounted     too high.
             VII.  Time required for cultivating the Land.
       The quantity of land intended to be cultivated, will not
   materially interfere with the usual labour of the cottager.
   It will only require to be dug once, and is then fit to be
   cropped.     It is proposed that only nine roods shall be annu
   ally cultivated, (the remaining three roods being under clover
   and rye grafs,) and nine roods may be dug in the space of
   about 558 hours, or at the rate of 62 hours per rood. This
   might be done at bye hours, (more especially when the family
  of the cottager shall be somewhat advanced, and consequently
   more able to furnish assistance) ; but supposing that the dig
  ging, manuring, harvesting, &c. will require twenty entire
  days per annum in addition to the bye hours, and allowing
  sixty days for Sundays and holidays, there will remain 285
  days for tire ordinary hand labour of the cottager, which, at
   is. 6d. per day, would amount to £.21 Js. bd.; the earn
  ings of the wife and children may, at an average, be worth
  at least £.4. per annum more.            This is certainly a low cal
  culation, considering       how    much    may be got during the hay
  and corn harvests ; but even at that moderate estimate, the
  total income of the family will be as follows :
      1. Produce    of the farm              -          -      £.21     2   o

      It is impossible to calculate the expense of building a cot
  tage, as so much depends upon its size, the place where it
  is situated, the materials of which it is composed, the price
 of labour in the country, and a variety of other circum
 stances.     On this important subjedt, much useful informa
 tion is contained in the first volume of the Communications
 published by the Board of Agriculture.                  But it is proper to
 observe that no expensive        additional  buildings will be neceflary
 in consequence      of  the  proposed system.       A stied or hovel for
 the cow cannot       occasion    any very heavy charge, and a small
of milk per day. worth I d. per quart, equal to t, <. 6c/. a week, or £.9 is.

barn, of the simplest and cheapest construction, may be of
use, not only for threshing the crop, but also for securing the
hay, and making it to more advantage, in case the season
should prove unfavourable : if the corn is put up in small
stacks, the barn may be made of very moderate dimensions.
                 IX.
                   Rent, and Balance of Income. (
   The rents of cottages and of iand vary so much in different
parts of the kingdom, that it is difficult to ascertaiu an ave
rage.   But if the cottage shall be stated at £.3 per annum,
the Iand at 25 s. per acre, and the orchard at \os. the whole
will not exceed £. 7 15 s. The cottager will also be liable to
the payment of some taxes, fay to the amount of £.1 $s.
more.    Hence the total deductions would be about £.g,
leaving a balance in favour of the cottager of £.37 o*. 6d.
Considering the cheap rate at which he is furnished with a
quantity of potatoes, equal to several months consumption,
and with milk for his children, surely, with that balance, he
can find no difficulty not only in maintaining himself and
family in a style of comfort, but also in placing out his chil
dren properly, and laying up a small annual surplus, that
will render any parish assistance, whether in sickness or old
age, unnecessary; and thus he will be enabled to preserve
that manly and independent spirit which it so well becomes
a British cottager to possess *.
                             CONCLUSION.
                 Advantages     of   the proposed    System.
   I   shall   now endeavour briefly to explain some of the ad
vantages,      which may be looked for with confidence from the
propoled system.
   In the first place, the land possessed by the cottager would
be completely cultivated, and rendered as productive as pos
sible.    The dung produced by the cow, the pigs, 2cc. would
be amply sufficient for the three roods under turnips and po
tatoes; which would afterwards produce, 1. Tares, a. Barley,
and 3. Clover; with a mixture of rye grafs, in regular suc
cession, without any additional manure.        The barley should
yield  at  least eighteen bushels, besides three  bushels tor feed ;
and if wheat or oats are cultivated, in the fame proportion.
The milk, deducting what may be neceflary for the calf, and
for the cottager's family, might be fold in its original state,
if there {hall be a market for             it,
                                         or converted into butter,
  » The different                                                will,
                      expense of fuel in the various district*           it   is   evi
dent, greatly affect the annual surplus.
                                                                                   for

            Means    of enabling    a Cottager to keep a Cow
*34
for the purpose of supplying the neighbouring towns or vil
lages.      Such cottagers, also, might certainly send to market
both eggs and poultry.
    3. It is hardly possible to suggest a measure more likely to
promote the benefit of a numerous and valuable body of
people. The system of keeping cows by cottagers, which
has been found so advantageous in the grazing districts, may
thus be extended over the whole kingdom ; and, indeed, if
the above plan is found to answer, in place of four or five
acres employed in feeding a single cow, it would be much
better, even in the grazing counties, to restrict the land to a
smaller quantity, under a tillage mode of management ; for
thus not only the cow, but also the cottager himself, and his
family, would, in a great measure, be maintained by a less
surface of soil.
    3. It is of infinite consequence to establissi the practica
bility of this system, as the means of removing a most unfor
tunate obstacle to the improvement of the country.                  It is
well known       to be  the  only popular objection    to the inclosure
of our wastes and commons, that, while uninclosed, a number
of cottagers are enabled to keep cows by the means of their
 common rights, and that their cows disappear when the
 commons are inclosed.            But if so small a portion of land as
3^ acres,     when   improved and properly cultivated, can enable
a cottager to keep a cow even to more advantage than with
 a right of common; which can hardly be doubted, as he is
 enabled to provide winter as well as summer food, there is an
 end to that obstacle to improvement.             Indeed, if sufficient
 attention    be  paid to  the   principles above detailed, the situa
 tion   of the cottager,    instead   of being deteriorated, would be
 materially    bettered    by   the  inclosure;  and his rising family
 would be early accustomed to habits of industry, instead of
 idleness and vice.
     I shall conclude with asking, if any one can figure to him
 self a more delightful spectacle than to see an industrious cot
 tager, his busy wife, and healthy family, living in a com
 fortable house, rented by hiniself, cultivating their little ter
 ritory with their own hands, and enjoying the profits arising
 from their own labour and industry ; or whether it is possible
 for a generous landholder to employ his property with more
 satisfaction, or in a manner more likely to promote, not only
 his own, but the public interest, than in endeavouring to in
 crease the number of such cottagers, and encouraging, by
 every means in his power, the exertions of so meritorious
  and so important a class of the community.

  work as a common daily labourer, he might, at least, answer
  as a useful labourer by the piece.

    " I      have    had the honour of mentioning in conversa
tion, to your lordship, the advantages that appeared to me
in cultivating land in the Flemish manner, or what is now
called, about Fulham and that neiehbourhood, the Jidd-
gardening husbandry.                 I have for some years encouraged
my cottagers         in Yorkshire         in this mode of managing their
small garths or gardens, which are in general from one to
three acres; and I have now an opportunity of stating the
husbandry of a poor industrious cottager's garth.                                As the
man can neither read nor write, these particulars have been
transmitted to me from his own mouth ; and, as I saw bis
land almost every day during the last harvest, I can vouch
that this account is not far from the truth.

evident that this man clears from his three acres more than
a farmer can possibly lay by from more than eighty acres of
land in the common husbandry of the country, paying for
horses, servants, &c; and it must be obvious to every one how
great the advantages must be to society by cultivating land in
this manner. It would have taken more than half the quan
tity of his three acres in pasture for one cow at grafs during
half the year ; whereas (excepting the summer's gait for one
of his cows, as mentioned before) his stock of two cows and
two pigs is kept and carried on tbe whole year.        The family
lives well, and a handsome sum has been yearly saved to place

       6. Arrows tbe Symbol of a general Proclamation.
  X HESE arrows, which were blunt, were not feathered,
and had a greater resemblance to small sticks than to arrows.
They were employed at first for foretelling future events. The
names of the objects respecting which information was re
quired were written upon two of them, and a third remained
without writing; one arrow contained the things good or
 bad which had been observed, and another forbade them.
All the three were put into a covered vessel, and on drawing
one of them out, the person who consulted this kind of oracle
knew what to do. Ir-the thing was allowed, the person pro
 secuted his purpose; if it was forbidden, he pursued measures
of a different kind ; but if the arrow without writing was
drawn out, it was believed that the proper period for engaging
 in the undertaking had not yet arrived. These arrows, how
ever, are not the kind here alluded to, but those by which
 the assembling of a whole people was forbidden.        They were
 much used, in particular, in the northern kingdoms. " When
 an army comes into the land," fay the Norwegian laws, " or
 when any insurrection takes place in the country, a mes
            4                                                   sage

 238                   Conje&ures       respeSbig the
sage  stick shall be cut and sent through it."        In Sweden,
orders for summoning the magistrates to administer justice,
as well as every other message, in the time of peace as well as
war, were issued in the like manner. According to all ap-
            the art of writing was then unknown, and therefore
 iich sticks were employed instead of circular letters.
J>earance                                                     The
fame custom has been observed among the Moguls in Siberia,
among the Ostiaks and the Tartars.         Barlæus fays, that the
American savages of Chili, when they intended to make war
on the Spaniards, sent an arrow, with a string fastened to            it,
to their neighbouring allies.           If
                                    the chief received the arrow,
it was  a  sign  that  he  was resolved  to support the war; he
made   a  knot on the string, and sent the arrow to the next.
The other chiefs did the fame, and the messenger returned
with his arrow, having the string full of knots.       Le Gentil,
who made     a  voyage round the round, fays that the knots are
of different colours, which not only denote the plan, but the
place and day on which             to be carried into execution.
                                  it   is
Don Antonio de Ulloa, however, fays nothing of the knots
being of different colours, but in other respects he coincides
with the abovcmentioned writers.
            7.   Tattooing    on the    Face and ivbole Body.
    Figures cut out in the skin of the human body were,
according to the testimony of Herodotus, tokens of              a  noble
birth.    Ammianus Marcellinus fays that the Huns cut out
figures on the cheeks of their new-born male children, with
a   view, as he supposes, of preventing the growth of the
beard.    This, however, does not appear to have been the real
cause; for the Huns, like their neighbours the Chinese, had
from nature very little beard, and only          afew straggling hairs
on the cheeks and chin. We are informed                  Claudian that
                                                        by
the Picts, formerly    a  people   of   Great   Britain,   and the Ge-
loni,  a  people   of   Greek   extraction  who     inhabited    on the
Dnieper,    made    figures  on   their  limbs   with   an  iron instru
ment.     This practice       very common in Siberia among the
                             is
Tungusians,      as we are       expressly    told      by Gmelin the
elder, in the account of his travels.          In the small island of
Meangis, not far from Mindanao, the men as well as the
women cut out figures on their skin according to               a certain
pattern they
        ;         then   put  into  the   wounds     finely pulverized
       and afterwards rub over them         certain salve.
                                             a                  Captain
Eim,
   ampier, who examined           aMiangi prince, speaks highly
of this kind of painting, and fays that              it   isexceedingly
beautiful, and that the flowers, leaves, &c. are                so inge
niously executed, that they bespeak no small degree of art.
                                                                     We

                 Origin of the American Nations.                   239
We     are told by Lady Mary Wortley Montague, that the
women in the neighbourhood of Tunis ornament their neck,
face, arms, and shoulders, with flowers, stars, and figures of
all kinds, which are burnt in with gunpowder ; and that
this is considered as a mark of extraordinary beauty. The
women on the river Gambia, when young, form, on their
neck, breast, and arms, with a hot needle, figures of all
kinds, which have the appearance of flowers worked on silk,
and which never are obliterated. In the kingdom of Widah,
young maids are prepared for the service of the great snake,
which is their principal Fetisli, or deity, by, scratching out
various figures, particularly of snakes, on their skin with an
iron instrument, by which means their skin has the appear
ance of fine figured satin.         This is a sign that such persons
are devoted to the great serpent.
    The savages of the isthmus of Darien, in America, form
figures on their bodies in like manner.          They make an out
line of the figure they intend to paint, fays Wafer, and prick
it with   a thorn  till the blood   guslies out; they then besmear
the place with      the   colour   most  agreeable to them, and the
 figures cannot   afterwards     be effaced.   This custom was very
prevalent in many countries          of  America,   such as Florida,
Virginia,   Louisiana,   and  Canada,    and even in the cold climate
of Greenland.       The women, acccording to Anderson, sew,
 with a thread which they have drawn through the foot of
their lamps, between the eyes, on the cheeks, chin, and
ears, all kinds of small characters between the skin and the
flesh, the black marks of which, when the wounds have
healed up, constantly remain, and have a resemblance to the
well-known figures which those who visit the holy sepulchre
cause to be formed on their arms.
   8. Scalping Prisoners, or Enemies ivbo have           been, killed
                               in Battle.
    This operation was performed in the following manner :
The (kin, being cut on the forehead, was torn offbackwards
to the ears and the hind part of the head.          The skin, after a
certain preparation, was made to afliimc a round form, then
stuck upon the end of a pole, and carried about in triumph.
A passage in Herodotus relating to this subject has been im
properly translated by Gronovius, for it alludes to the scalp
taken from an enemy killed in battle.            The Scythians freed
it from the flesh adhering to it by means of the rib-bone of
an ox, and then gave it the fame preparation as their leather
in order to render it durable. A remarkable passage on this
subject, also, occurs in Orosius,         Speaking of the Cimbric
                                                                   aud

440                         ConjeSIures   refpeding the
and Teutonic women, he says they defended themselves cou
rageously against the Romans till the skin of their head was
pulled over their ears, in which state they were left to their
fate. It may naturally be asked where the Romans acquired
this barbarous practice, of which no other instance is to be
sound in antient history.            I
                              am therefore inclined to think
that the Cimbri had first treated the Roman prisoners in the
fame manner, and that the Romans, out of revenge, copied
their example. The Cimbri may have inherited this practice
from the Scvthians their ancestors.   We are. told by Animi-
anus Marcellinus that the Alani, who lived beyond the Palus
Mæotis, stripped the skin from the heads of their vanquished
enemies, and suspended it from their horses as an honourable
trophy of victory.
   In North America this barbarous practice is exceedingly
common, especially among the savages of Canada. The most
remarkable circumHance here               is,
                                 that some of those who are
scalped survive the operation.  Lafiteau asserts, that, during
the course of his mission, he saw the wife of      Frenchman
                                                          a
in  Canada who was cured after the operation, and continued
in good health.
          9.    Putting      Death old and infirm Persons.
                              to
    Herodotus speaks of an Indian nation, whom he calls the
Pagæi, who put to death and ate their old and infirm people,
both male and female.          The first inhabitants of Sardinia had
a  law, in virtue of which children were obliged to kill their
parents when they had passed the age of 70.                Ilartknoch
speaks   ofa   like   practice among    the  antient Prussians. It   is
well-known, in regard to the northern nations, that old
people, who had become useless on account of their great
age, precipitated themselves, partly with their own consent
and partly      a by compulsion, from        mountain into the sea.

kutians do the fame thing: they build huts for their sick in
a  foreii, leave them there with some food, and pay no further
attention, to them.
                                                                 The

                    Origin of the American Nations.              44!
    The   savage Americans of Brazil, according to Piso, put to
death those who laboured under incurable diseases.            When
any person in the province os Terra Fir ma was sick, he was
 carrricd by his relations to the neartst mountain, where he
 was put into a hammock which was suspended from a tree,
and the relations danced and fung around it the whole day.
They then left food and drink to serve him for several days,
and departed.        Jf he recovered his strength so far as to be
able to return home, they received him with every demon
stration of joy ; if he remained sick, they provided for him a
new supply of food and water; but if they found him dead,
he was immediately put into a deep hole made on the spot,
with a little food and water.
        IO.   Virginity little valued among the Barbarians.
    Marco Polo, in his description of the eastern countries,
fays, that in the kingdom       of Thibet it was not customary to
marry    a  virgin.    Married women carried their daughters to
strangers, that they might cohabit with them during their
stay in the country : and when a young girl separated from
her lover, slie requested /rom him some small present, as a
memorial and a token that flie had slept with him.             This
(lie wore as an ornament when flic went abroad ; and those
who had the greatest number of such marks were always
most esteemed.        The fame thing is related by Renncfort of
the inhabitants of Madagascar, and by Gerber of the people
of Taulistan.
    In Brazil,   the voung women before they are married resign
themselves,     without  shame, to the embraces of the unmarried
men. Their relations frequently offer them to the first person
that occurs ; so that, according to the testimony of Leri, not
a single virgin is found among those who enter into ihe state
of marriage. The savages of Quito, according to Ulloa, are
so foolish as to imagine, that if the person they have chosen
for their bride has not before had intercourse with another
man, it is an undoubted sign of her not being of great value.
To their honour, however, it must be added, that when they
once enter into the state of wedlock they abstain from all
intercourse with other men ; and among these people adul
tery is punished with death.
    Among some savage nations, however, it is customary for
the men to prostitute their wives.          It is asserted by Muller
that this is the case among the Tschukti ; and Regnard gives
the fame account of the Laplanders.          In Cumana, a district
of the continent of South America, a woman does not lose
her honour or reputation if flic submits to the embraces of
    Vol. X>                          Q^                      another

 ?4   -                  CoHJeflures  respecting the
  another man by the consent of her husband.             But if she doe«
  so without his knowledge he ha3 a right to put her to death.
      These accounts might be considered as fabulous, were they
  not confirmed by diflereht authors ancient and modern, laity
  as well as clergy, some of whom were eye-witnesses to what
  they relate.      Herodotus, speaking of the Thracians, fays that
  they permitted their daughters to have promiscuous inter
  course with whomever they pleased.              We are told by the
. same author that It was a law among the Babylonians, that
  all the women of the country should, once in their lives, ex
  pose themselves to the embraces of strangers in the temple of
  Venus.       Each fat in a particular place, separated from the
  other by a rope stretched between them; and durst not move
  from her station till some one threw apiece of gold into her
  lap, and made her retire with him. The handsome women
  were soon engaged ; but the ugly sometimes remained a long
  time, even three years, without being solicited by any one.
  On this occasion, the prophet Barucn, a much older writer
   than Herodotus, fays, that the one were soon set at liberty,
  but that the others, who were obliged to remain sitting,
  were exposed to ridicule, because thev had not been thought
  worthy of having their girdle unloosed. Strabo gives exactly
  the fame account of this circumstance as Barucn and Hero
  dotus do.
        Another custom among the savages, no less singular,
  is what is called their marriage proof.            In the kingdom of
   Congo, in Africa, young people of both sexes beat each other,
   in order to fee whether they can endure each other. Both
  are equally at freedom to separate, in case they do not suit
   each other.       Ulloa mentions a like custom among the In
   dians of Quito.       I remember to have read somcw'here that
   this custom prevailed formerly in the Briiisl) isles, and that
   it is (till practised in some parts of Ireland and Scotland.
        Were I to enlarge further on this subject, a whole book
   might be formed of the manners and customs which the
   Americans have in common with the people of other quarters
   of the globe.        But, that I may come nearer to the object
   in question, I stmll here take a fliort view of the singular
   customs which the Americans have in common with the
   Chinese and the inhabitants of the western part of Africa ex
  clusively.
           II.  Comparison    of the Americans with    the Chinese.
        I. The Peruvians had four grand festivals in the course of
    the year; the principal of which was held at Cufko, the ca
   pital of the country, immediately after the solstice ; the second
                                                                     and

                   Origin of the Amcric m Nations.              243
  and third were celebrated at the time of the equinoxes; the
  fourth had no fixed period. These festivals of the Peruvians
  have a great similarity to those of the Chinese, both in number
  and the times when celebrated; with this difference, that the
  Chinese observe with great attention the four periods of the
  year, viz. the two solstices and the two equinoxes.
      ad, The Peruvian and Chinese monarchs both assumed the
  title of Children ot the Sun, from which deity they pretended
  to be descended.
      3d, Within the city of Cusko was a field which no one
  was allowed to cultivate but the Peruvian monarchs and
  their family.     This affords a new reason for conjecturing
  that the Peruvians were a Chinese colony; for the monarchs
  of China retained also a piece of land, which was set apart
  for them and their family.
      4th, To this we may add, that the Chinese and the Peru
  vian monarchs were invested with spiritual as well as tem
   poral power, and that the political establishments       in both
   countries were excellent of their kind.
      5th, The Creole ladies in Peru, according to the testimony
  of Frezier, are exceedingly fond of small feet. Those who
   have the smallest are reckoned more perfect than the rest;
   and therefore their feet are confined, at a very early period,
   in narrow (hoes.     Who does not know that among the Chi-
,  nef'e women small ftet are accounted a great beauty ? This
   custom may have come also from China; though Frezier al
   ludes only to the Creoles, and not to the original inhabitants
   ot the country ; for it may have been introduced before the
   arrival of the Spaniards in Peru ; and, if that be the cafe,
   the Creole ladies received this custom from the Indians, and
   the Indians from their ancestors the Chinese.
       6th, The Peruvians had no writing, but instead of it they
   made use of their quipu; which word, properly speaking,
   signifies knots, but, according to the rrtore extensive meaning,
   a reckoning, catalogue,    or list of something. The Chinese,
   before the invention of their writing, made use also of such
   knots to convey their ideas to distant places.
      The Peruvian quipu were threads of different colours, each
   of which had its peculiar meaning; for example, yellow de
   noted gold; white, silver; red, warriors, &c.          The Peru
   vians employed them chiefly for keeping accompts ; in which
   they were so expert, that they could reckon as fast with these
   threads, as the readiest accomptant can in Europe with pen
   and ink.    Bv this method they could calculate the number
   of the inhabitants in the whole country, according to their
   age and sex : an account was kept, by means of these knots,
                                   O   2                          of

544                  ConjeSiUres   tejpetling the
of allthe taxe3 which the inca received annually ; they cotl«
tained also the roll of all the warriors, and a list of the births,
deaths,   &c.
    They denoted also certain words or modes of speech : when
the inca, for example, sent an embassy to anv foreign powers,
the latter could comprehend the inca's meaning, though they
did not understand the proper words.        What tome historians
assert, that the Peruvians employed different coloured threads,
with knots upon them, in the stead of our twenty-four letters,
is entirely false.    Thcv could always express any thing, toge
ther with the circumstances of time and place, but never the
meaning in literal words ; much less were these knots a sub
stitute for historical books.    Garcilaffo de la Vega, therefore,
a descendant of these incas, did not compose his history from
information preserved by means of these parti-coloured knots,
but from the oral tradition of his predecessors.
    In a word, these quipit were merely arbitrary ; for they
could be changed at plcalure, and arranged in a quite dif
ferent manner.        The incas, therefore, did not always adopt
the fame arrangement ; but, according to the nature of the
thing, changed one colour for another, suited to the meaning
they had afligned to them. If the Peruvians, therefore, came
originally from another quarter of the world, they are descend
ed, in my opinion, from the Chinese.         The distance between
these two nations     is, however, too great; whether they tra
versed the Pacific ocean, passed through the straits of Magel
lan, or, what amounts to the fame thing, doubled Cape Horn.
The last way    is  longer than the first, and    far too difficult
                                                    by
and dangerous. Their passage through the Pacific ocean may
have been occasioned        bysome accident; though,      in
                                                           my opi
nion, they did not all arrive at the same period. Thcv might
land on some of the islands which they found              by
                                                          the way,

supply of provisions.        may, however, be objected, that the
                            It
Chinese (hips were made ot too frail materials to hold out
during such     a  long passage.   Lint we have every reason to
think that the Chinese vessels would, on the contrary, be
sufficient for that purpose; especially as we know that the
Ruffians who live on the Jakufk have proceeded with their
paltry vessels from the Lena, past the Eissen and Tschuktfchi
Noss, as far as the mouth of the Anadir; which the largest
and strongest built stiips employed for the expedition sent out
under the emprels Anne, and va hich cost           much expense,
                                                     so
 could not have done.       'Who first peopled Solomon's islands,
between Asia and America, which were discovered under the
 reign of Philip II., and, according to the testimony of Ulloa,
                                                                   were

                Origin of the American Nations.                       245
were found to be inhabited        ?  The Americans had no ships ;
and consequently     it must    have   been done by the Chinese,
although    the  passage    from    China   is much longer than that
from America.
   This conjecture receives considerable weight from De-
guignes, who has distinguished himself by his knowledge of
the oriental literature and history; for he fays expressly, that
the Chinese, about the year 458, carried on a great trade to
America from the north-welt part of California: and this
opinion is adopted by Buache the geographer,              who calls the
country   Quivara.      If  it be true,   therefore,   that the Chinese
discovered Quivara, it is possible that they or their descend
ants may have gradually proceeded along the coast to Peru,
and that a part of them may have settled there.                 It is not
improbable    that Mango Capac,         the  first inca, and  founder  of
the great kingdom of Peru, and his followers, were Chinese.
   This also may be taken into consideration, that navigation
among the different nations of the globe has never been on
the fame footing and in the fame state. The cafe is the fame
in this respect as with commerce, the arts, and the sciences,
Thcv are conveved from one nation to another, and, by their
influence, convert ignorant savages into enlightened people,
and civilized and polished nations into rude barbarians. Who
were more expert in navigation and trade than the Phœni
cians ? They founded important colonies both in Africa and
Europe, and carried on a great trade on the Atlantic. The
Egyptians coasted along the whole peninsula of Africa, pro
ceeding from the Red to the Ethiopic sea; then round the
Cape of Good Hope to the Atlantic ; thence to the Mediter
ranean, and so back to Egypt.            The Greeks had large fleets
both for the purposes of war and of commerce.                  They de
stroyed the naval power of Xerxes, and by these means re
stored the freedom of their country : but the importance of
these people has vanished, and thev must now groan under
a foreign yoke till it shall please Providence to fend them a
deliverer.
12.  Comparison     of  the Americans       with the Africans on the
                      wejlcrn Coajl of Ajrica.
   Among the people of the Old World, who in their customs
and manners bear a resemblance to the Americans, of which
some instances     have    been   already given, we ought to com
prehend, in particular, the inhabitants of the western coast
of Africa. They have more customs, 8cc: in common with
the American nations than all the other people of the earth,

%ifi              Origin of the American Nations.
and   from them alone it would appear that the Americans
are descended.     Os this ( shall here give a few proofs.
   jst, The Hottentot women, from the age of twelve, always
wear thongs of sheep or calves (kin wrapped round their legs
from the knee'down to the ancle bone.          The inhabitants o.
the Caribee islands, in America, bind similar thongs around
the legs of their women after the age of twelve, onlv wiih
this difference, that the latter are of cotton.    This difference
is owing to the Hottentots having plenty of cattle and (beep,
in which the Caribs are deficient. The women, therefore,
alone wear such bandages on their legs ; the reason of which
          is, that the women go out to the fields and woods to
fierhaps
 abour, and consequently must secure their legs and feet from
being pricked by briers and thorns.
   2a, .When a Hottentot widow intends to marry again, for
each husband with whom she is afterwards united (ne must
cut off a joint of one of her fingers, always beginning with
the little singer.   The Tucumans, a people of Brazil, have a
similar custom ; for on certain occasions, but of a different
nature, they must cut off one singer of the left hand.         The
Hottentot women cut off a joint when they marry again, but
the Brazilians cut off their singers on the death of their nearest
relations.
   3d, The Hottentot and the Carib women bend the limbs
of their deceased friends till they assume that form which they
had in the mother's womb.
   4th, The idolatrous negroes in Africa have almost the
fame religious ceremonies as the Americans, but it would be
too tedious to enumerate them.          Those desirous of making
the comparison may peruse the account of George Candidius,
the Dutch clergyman.
    I have concluded, from the cufloms common to both na
tions, that the Peruvians are descended from the Chinese,
though they are separated by an extensive ocean         If this be
probable, the probability in regard to the inhabitants of
the western coast of Africa is (lill greater, for of all people
of the earth these approach the nearest to the Americans.
These two people, however, are separated by the Atlantic ;
but the breadth of it from Guinea to Brazil is not more than
twenty degrees ; and besides this, an easterly wind generally
prevails in that sea, which sometimes drives the European
ihips to the coast of Brazil. I am not, however, of opinion
that America was peopl?d from China and the western coast
of Africa alone. As the small boats of the Laplander?, which

The' immersing of cotton in an alkaline ley, however well
it be rinsed, always leaves with it an earthy deposit.                  It is
well known that cotton bears the action of acids better
than hemp or flax ; that time is even necessary before the
action of them can be prejudicial to it; and, by taking ad
vantage of this valuable property in regard to bleaching,
means have been found to sice it from the earlhv deposit by
pressing down the cotton in a very weak solution of sulphuric
acid, and afterwards removing the acid by washing, lest too
long remaining in it should destroy the cotton.
                 Of   the Oxygenated      .Muriatic Acid.
    This   acid    is  one    of   the   most   valuable    discoveries     of
modern chemistry, for which we are indebted to Scheele.
Berthollet is the first who applied it to bleaching, alter having
carefully examined its properties.
    The muriatic acid is greedy of oxygen, and takes it from
almost ail its combinations:            to its union with oxygen it is
indi bled for its detersive property. Manganese, a metal com
paratively of little value, presents an immense reservoir of
oxygen, which the muriatic acid speedily disengages from it
in the gaseous form.          This gas, combined with water, forms
the oxygen;1. ted muriatic acid of the bleachers.              Water thus
saturate i assumes a greenish -yellow colour, its odour has a
f.iilocating acridity, arising from the emanation of the gas,
which adheres little to the fluid in which it has been con
centrated, and whi'h every moment endeavours to escape.
    This acid, then, is nothing but a combination of the mu
 riatic acid and oxygen; but the latter principle adheres but
weakly to the muriatic acid, as is seen bv the decoloration
 effected by the oxygenated          muriatic acid, which restores it
 to its primitive Hale of simple muriatic acid.
     All vegetable colours are attacked by this acid, and
 whitened with more or less celerity: this depends on their
greater or less facility of combining with oxygen.                The co
 louring matter unelergoes a real flow combustion, which ter
minates bv the formation of carbonic acid, which, escaping
under the form of elastic fluid, produces what we cal]
 bleaching.

   In whatever manner the oxygenated muriatic acid is pro
cured, it is evident that the oxygen adheres to it only weaklv;
and it is on this property that the possibility depends of pro
ducing speedily in manufactories that action which the
atmosphere produces but slowly, and of bleaching in a space
of time proportionally short.
   Oxygenated muriatic acid is produced by distilling together
sulphuric acid, manganese, and muriate ot soda, (common
salt,) and condensing      in water the acid gas which thence
escapes.    The   apparatus and proportions of the ingredients
will be treated of when we come to speak of the processes for
bleaching with this acid.
                       Oxygenated     Muriates.
   Notwithstanding the little affinity which some earths and
alkalies have for the oxygenated muriatic acid, means are found
to combine them together, and to compose substances called
oxygenated muriates. Ot the earths, none but lime and mag
nesia can be conveniently converted into oxy-muriates ; and
the latter is even too clear to be employed. The oxy-muriate of
lime is at present used at all thebleaching-grounds of Ireland.
For the process of preparing it we are indebted to Tetmant:
he combines it with the oxygenated muriatic acid under the
gaseous or liquid form ; but the latter is preferable.          Lime-
water saturated with oxygenated muriatic acid may be em
ployed liquid; or, by supersaturating the mixture, the earthy
moleculæ may be precipitated to the bottom of the appara
tus : if the liquor, which is always surcharged with oxygen
ated muriatic acid, be then drawn off by means of a syphon,
you will obtain a residuum saturated with that principle, the
paste of which may be employed in the processes of bleaching.
This oxy-muriate, under the concrete form, is sufficiently
impregnated to form a bleaching ley when dissolved in water.
    The alkalies of which such oxy-muriates may be formed
are barvtes, potash, and strontian.         The first and the last are
still too rare, and their price     is  too  high, to suit that œco-
 nomy which the processes        for   bleaching require; but these
 substances have begun to be discovered in France. .In regard
 to potasli, we are already acquainted with the part it adts in
 condensing the oxygenated muriatic acid, and rendering it
inodorous.      To obtain the fame results with oxv-muriate of
lime, nothing is necessary but to saturate it in like manner.
    The advantages obtained by these preparations are very
important.
    One is enabled to make these leys, and to fend to a distance
 these muriates, which form the detersive fubsiancej without
                                                                  fear

ready  mentioned   the extreme   volatility of the liquid oxygen
ated muriatic acid, and the almost impossibility of transport
ing it without the loss of nearly one-half of its strength ; and
however little it may be shaken in its passage, the acid gas
will entirely escape. We sliall show hereafter the method of
preparing and employing these muriates in bleaching.

   The        substance     known     in commerce under the name of
tttajb, and which acts so important a part in the process of
bleaching, is a saline matter produced by incinerating plants
or wood, and lixiviating, concentrating, and calcining the
ashes.  The use of ley or ashes was known in the remotest
 periods; but the Germans were the first who taught us to
 concentrate the fait diffused throughout the water of the
 solution, and to which they gave the name it now bears,
 from the vessels employed in the fabrication of                viz. pot it,
 ashes, or potash.
     Though potash be very common                    in

                                              Of   Soda.
    Nature presents us with soda in still greater abundance than
potalh ; and it is even found in a prettv pure stale in Egypt,
where it is collected at the bottom of the lakes. Thc\:om-
bustion of plants, and the different kinds of saltwort ot soda
which grow on the sea-shore, furnish it in great abundance :
it is from this plant that it takes its name. But modern che
mistry has taught us how to obtain it in still greater profusion
by the decomposition of sea salt (muriate of ioda).
    Its properties in regard to bleaching are nearly the fame
as those of potash, with this exception, that it does not unite
itself to the oxygenated muriatic acid ; in general, the action
of soda, even when caustic, is much weaker; and it attacks
cloth and stuffs much less than potash.        We sliall therefore
make choice of it in preference for our process of bleaching
with      steam.
    Soda is generally more mixed with heterogeneous matters
 than potash, and the fraud is more difficult to be detected.
In this cafe, recourse must be had to repeated crystallizations.
 Kirvvan, in his excellent memoir, recommends boiling the
soda in three times its weight of water ; suffering the solution
to remain at rest; then filtering                        it,
                                       aud boiling the residuum
left on the filter with half the quantity of water, and making
it  again pass through the filter. Soda, being caustic, requires
some days exposure to the air before        crystallizes.   If be it                         it

by potash.     Soda gives a hard soap; potash, on the other
hand, a soft kind.       Pliny ascribes to the Gauls the invention
of this valuable composition. The soap of our ancestors was
formed of goat's grease mixed with the aflies of beech wood ;
and several improvements were successively introduced into
the manufacturing of this substance, as chance, the mother
of the most important discoveries, pointed out the necessity
of them. The progress of the arts towards perfection has
been very flow, on account of the prejudices of that ignorance
which prevailed in the past ages. We have, however, now
reached a period when the Iciences and the arts, aided by
their reciprocal resources, are advancing rapidly towards a
certain degree of perfection.
    In France, two kinds of soap only are made — hard soap,
and soft soap : the first with soda and olive oil ; the second
with potash, and vegetable oils of less value.
    In Hungary, soap is made of tallow and natron; as is the
cafe in several parts of Germany and Russia.            The Russians
make a hard soap also with bad salt butter ; but this kind is
not much esteemed ; its rancidity and the quantity of salt and
caseous matter found in it degrade its quality. Wieelcb asserts
that a very hard soap, which has a very agreeable smell of al
monds, is made with vellow and white wax.
    The English, as they hive not vegetable oils in abundance,
make soap onlv with tallow or sisti oil, sometimes with kitch
en-stuff" or spoilt butter.     They have sour kinds. 1st, White
soap,   made  with    soda  of Alicant,  or the soda of Varech, and
tallow. 2cl, Marbled soap, made of tallow and kitchen-stuff".
The marbled appeirance does not arise from an oxide, as
among us, but because a little of the lev is dispersed through
out the whole mass.         3d, A hard vellow kjndof soap, com
posed   of soda,   tallow,  and  resin. This last substance is intro
duced onlv for the purpose of rendering; the soap cheaper, but it
certainly does not augment its detersive strength.       The fourth
kind of soft soap is formed of whale or sifli-oil and potash.
    It was long an object of research to discover substances
which might be substituted for oil and tallow in the fabrica
tion of soap.     It was reserved for Chaptal to lay open this
field by his important discovery of a process for saponifying
wool, and converting into excellent soap rags of old cloth
and worded, the waste of carding, and the other refuse of
cloth manufactories.        This discovery gave rife to that of sir
John Dalrymplc, who supposed that, bv a method similar to
that os Chaptal, it would be possible to convert the muscular
part of fat fish into soap ; and some experiments, crowned
with complete success, soon confirmed him in this idea.

                         Sulpburet  of Lime.
    Lime and sulphur are two substances which nature presents
to us with profusion.          They combime perfectly together.
Their union is called sulpburet of lime, and they then form
a very active detergent        matter.    Kirwan first observed that
saline sulphurets, or the combination of an alkali with sul
phur, might be employed with advantage in bleaching on
account of their detersive properties, and even supply the
       of alkalies. What Kirwan proposed was executed by
  liggins in Ireland ; and by analogy of reasoning he was led
flace
to the discovery of the detergent power of sulphurets of lime.
    In whatever manner these substances are combined, the
result is always the fame; either in the dry way, by fusing
them together, which produces a very strong and very solid
sulphuret ; or by uniting quicklime and sulphur, and pouring
over them eight or nine times their weight of water; the
heat alone of the lime while flaking will be sufficient to com
bine them : or, in the last place, by following the process of
Higgins, which consists in boiling together flaked lime and
sulphur.     The last method is that which ought to be pre
ferred for bleaching.
    The liquor which results from this union of water, lime,
and sulphur, is liquid sulpburet of lime: it is of a dark yellow
colour, and has a harsh styptic taste ; it emits an odour some
what similar to that commonly perceived in sulphur and flaked
lime. This emanation, however, is not of a noxious nature
like that of the oxygenated muriatic acid.
    Liquid sulphuret of lime loses its colour by exposure to the
air, and speedily absorbs the oxygen of the atmosphere. These
properties deserve the attention of the bleacher, as they will
show the advantage of employing this solution as fresh as
poflible, lest the quality of it should be hurt; and they explain
 a part of the pnneipfes, according to which liquid sulphuret
of lime exercises an action in the art of bleaching.
    From the above observations the following practical prin
 ciples may be deduced :
    Sulphuret of lime, of all the alkaline compounds, is the
 most powerful solvent of the colouring matter of flax ; caustic
 potash is the next ; then caustic soda ; then common potasti ;
 and, in the last place, common soda.          Sulphur, if employed
 pure,  stains  cloth a   little; but  the  stains may be easily re-

moved by the application of potash.            The alkali arising from
the combustion of plants is more powerful than the mineral
alkali, as I have already observed.           The alkaline sulphuret,
which is formed by the combination of sulphur and soda, is
far from possessing so detersive a quality as that made with
potash.
   Various    Processes  for Bleaching Hemp, Linen, and        Cotton.
     Having     already spoken of the different methods hitherto
pursued      for bleaching vegetable substances, and examined
the menstrua and detersive substances most used in the va
 rious processes, I shall proceed to 9 description of the dif
 ferent manipulations to which these matters are subjected
 in order to give them that degree of whiteness which is ne
 cessary to fit them for commerce.
                        Bleaching in the    open Air.
      The air with which        the   earth  is surrounded is far from
  being homogeneous.          Every thing volatilized on the surface
  of the globe; all the emanations of the earth, as well as the
  beneficent fluids, which assume the gaseous form, are con
  founded in this aeriform sea by which we are surrounded. It
  is an immense laboratory always in action, where the play
  of composition and decomposition is incessantly renewed.
       Of the numerous properties of the atmospheric air, it will
  be sufficient if we mention only a few.             About a fourth of
  this fluid is composed of a gas, which appears to be the acidi
  fying principle : this is oxygen, which readily suffers itself to
  be absorbed by a great number of bodies, among which are
  carbon. This union with carbon forms carbonic acid, which
   is also an aeriform fluid.
       Without calling in question those principles for which we
  are indebted to modern chemistry, mankind have at all times
   employed free air as the most convenient menstruum for
   bleaching.       When tired with the slowness of its action, they
   assisted   it by detersive leys, which abridged the process a
   little ; and this union of boiling, and exposure on the grass,
   formed the whole of the antient art of bleaching. Formerly,
   Avhen it was necessary to bleach cloth, it was customary to
    immerse it in pure water to free it from the dressing.           This
    preliminary operation     was   sometimes    hastened by  a cold  ley,
    the cloth was then rinsed in running water and spread out on
    a meadow, round which ran a stream of limpid water that
    served for watering the different pieces.
        After being exposed in this manner for some time, the
    cloth was washed and boiled in a fresli ley ; it was then again
                                                                   spread

 $,$6                  An EJJay    on Bleaching.
spread out on the grass ; and this operation was several times
repeated until the required whiteness was obtained.          It was
still necessary to wind it through soapy water, notonlv to give
it softness and pliability, but to bleach completely the borders,
which oppose the longed resistance.
     It was brought to its ultimate Hate of whiteness by draw
ing it through whey or diluted sulphuric acid. By this short
description it may be seen that a considerable time was ne
cessary before the absorption of oxygen could take place: to
hasten this operation of nature appeared impossible, until
modern chemistry had demonstrated that oxygen, solidified
in various budies, might be extracted and combined with
water, to be afterwards applied to substances where its influ
ence might be necessary.
                     Bleaching   by  Water alone.
    I  have already observed that, during the fermentation that
takes place in the vats in which cloth is immersed to free it
from the dressing, the fibres assume the first tint of whiteness.
It had been before remarked that the percussion of stampers
in paper manufactories bleached, in some degree, the pulp
impregnated with water; it was known that, by suffering
hemp and flax to ferment a very long time, a greater degree
of whiteness was obtained, but always at the expense. of the
fibrous tissue, destroyed by too long maceration.           Taking
advantage    os these observations,   Brasse, an artist of Amiens,
found means to bleach hemp and linen by the action of water
alone.
    When the hemp was pulled, he watered it a little longer
than usual, having previously cut off the roots by laying the
stalks on a board furnished with an instrument destined for
that purpose:      When the cortical tissue was attacked, and
destroyed by the putrid fermentation, he removed the hemp
from the water, and, by drawing it through a kind of heckle
or comb, completely separated the fibrous tissue, which, on
account of its parallelism, was not hurt by the teeth of the
instrument; while the reticular tissue of the bark or exterior
covering, already half putrid, stuck on the points, and readily
suffered itself to be separated from the hemp. During this ope
ration the hemp was immersed successively in water, between
each stroke of the heckle, to facilitate the removal of the green
matter above the bark.        The. whiteness which hemp assumes
bv this (ingle operation can hardly be conceived: it acquires
a splendour and brilliancy which can never be communicated
to it by the usual processes, but its strength is also diminished
as well as the product by the too great progress of the fer-

 with great atlvjntage in the arts. , It is here proper to ob
serve, that bleaching by water never gives complete white
 ness, like the usual processes of the bleaoh-fie'd.  To finish
 the bleaching of hemp, it would be necessary to have recourse
 to the different means described in this essay.
     Of     Bleaching -with the Oxygenated            Muriatic Acid      alone.
   In this process oxygenated muriatic acid is substituted for
the action of the air, and presents itself with advantage, be
cause its oxvgcnatinc principle is not drowned in a chaos of
different fluids, like the oxvgen of the atmosphere; its action,
                                                 I
too, must therefore be speedier. As have already examined
the principles of this acid, and its intimate nature, I shall
now proceed to the application of         and to  description of
                                                it,            a
the       best apparatus.
     Thematters which serve for the production of the oxygen
ated muriatic acid are manganese, common salt, (muriate of
soda,) and the sulphuric acid. Manganese        metallic oxide
                                                          is   a
very much diffused throughout the lurface of our globe, and
which may be procured at small expense. The greater part
                                       a

must be pounded,        order to facilitate the mixture with the

manganese.
  The proportions generally observed are, one part (by
weight} of manganese; two of sulphuric acid, diluted with
alittle more than its volume of water; and three of salt. The
better these matters are combined together, the more easily
will  the acid gas be disengaged by the action of the sulphuric
acid.         proper also to remark, that the acid ought to be

they might break in consequence of the heat produced by
 the union of the acid in water.          In some places these pro
 portions vary.      In England, the following are used :
                   Manganese                      30 parts.

  and the preceding proportions.

  the proportions used in the French manufactories. They are ;
                    Manganese                      20 parts.

                    Water                          54
      The necessity of distilling this acid on a large       scale, has
   given rife to the invention of different kinds of         apparatua
   more or less convenient.     Berthollet has proposed matrasses
   with bent tubes, which convey the oxygenated muriatic acid
   to the pneumatic tub, in which the bubbles, traversing the
   water, are forced, by means of an agitator, to combine more
   or less with it.    Paiot de Charmes recommends the use of
   tubulated retorts ; but, besides these vessels being too dear,
   they do not answer the proposed end, since a portion of sul
   phuric acid not decomposed, and which injures the process,
   always passes into the water.
       C. Widmer, at Jouy, has arransed his apparatus in such
   a manner as to lose the least gas possible during the condensa
   tion : he receives the gas under a capsule inverted at the bot
   tom of the apparatus ; above these are two tours de gouturt
    also inverted, then another capsule above these ; then two
    more tours de gout'ure, and then another capsule, which ter
    minates the apparatus. The disposition of his tub is such,
    that he places around in his laboratory several distilling ap
   paratuses, which are going at the fame time.
       Apparatuses constructed on similar principles are also in
   use at Glasgow and Manchester.              Bourboulon-de-Bonneuil
   has likewise invented an apparatus, consisting of several ma
                                                                 trasses,

trasses, ranged as in an aquafortis manufactory, the tubes of
which arc conveyed into a chamber containing concentrating
tubs.       His apparatus for the bleaching of paper is very in
genious, and deserves to be described.              In the last place,
others have arranged five or six large casks, like Wolf's ap
paratus, in such a manner as to make each cask perform the
functions of a tubulated flask.        The bleachers in Ireland em
ploy a kind of leaden alembic capable of containing forty
gallons of water; a capacity more than sufficient to contain
the charge, and to favour the swelling which takes place by
the reciprocal action of the matters during the distillation.
This alembic, (fee Plate IV.) of a conical form, and having
a very broad base, reds in a balneum mariæ, in order that it
mav be subjected to a progressive heat ; and the neck is of
such a height, that any sulphuric acid which happens to
rife may fasl back. The cover is perforated to afford a pas
sage to the handle of an agitator, which serves to stir the
matters at the bottom of the alembic : this agitator is of iron
as well as its arms ; but the iron is covered with a pretty
thick plate of lead, that the acid may not attack it 5 the
handle goes through a leather collar, to prevent the escape of
the gas.      The sulphuric acid, diluted with water, is intro
duced into the leaden apparatus by means of a small glass or
leaden funnel, the tube of which is bent to guard against the
reaction of the gas.       The apparatus is also furnished with a
condenser, into which the gas is made to pass. This vessel
has several shelves and an agitator.         The latter goes through,
a leather collar in the top of the condenser, passes down
through the shelves, and is furnished with arms between
each of the (helves; by which means the gas in its ascent is
exposed to the action of the liquid in a state of great agita
tion, and has a long way to travel through it. (See the Plate.)
    I shall now speak of an apparatus which, in my opinion,
is free from those faults which generally attend an apparatus
ol lead, which always becomes oxidated, and is at length de
stroyed.      This apparatus * consists of a series of conical ma
trasses with long necks, furnished with bent funnels as well as
tubes, both of glass, which are conveyed into a common reser
voir. This relervoir ought to be perforated in such a manner
as to leave room for the introduction of a tube of a larger size
(two inches) communicating with the first condensing cask
or cylinder, made of white wood, twenty inches in diameter,
bound round by hoop., made tight with screws, and com

with a coating of japan, as it is called, or with oil paint,
to prevent the oozings of the liquor from rusting them. The
height of this cylinder must, be seven or eight feet, and even
more, if possible, in order tp increase the pressure ; and ought
to have placed over it a large two necked bottle deprivedof
its bottom, or a glass bell with two necks cemented to the
upper edge of the cylinder.      In one of these necks the large
tube of tne reservoir is introduced, and made to descend to
the bottom of the cylinder.        The air bubbles, as they are
disengaged, being forced to traverse the fluid under a pressure
equal to the height of the column of water, will combine
with it until it be saturated ; the second neck is also furnished
with a bent leaden tube, the orifice of which is below the
surface" of the water ; the superabundant gas passes through
this tube, and, descending into the second cylinder of wood,
similar in all respects to the_ preceding, saturates the
water in it : — a third cylinder may be added, if judged ne
cessary.     By this arrangement the smallest portion of the gas
cannot escape : care must be taken to apply a leaden cock at
the bottom of each cylinder, in order to draw oft" the bleach
ing liquor as it is formed.
    The residuums, after the distillation of the oxygenated mu
riatic acid, may be fold to earthen-ware manufacturers to be
 employed as a glazing for their coarse articles.     The manga
nese contained in it gives it a blackish appearance, like that of
bronze, which is far from being disagreeable to the eye.         I
        employed this glazing several times by way of trial ;
   rst fusing it with sand In a potter's furnace, throwing it into
Save
 cold water to facilitate its division, and grinding it in a mill
in order that it might be diffused in water.       This glazing is
 attended with the advantage of being fret from thole danger
 ous qualities so common in all preparations made from the
 oxides of lead ; but the most important object is the extrac
 tion of the soda from the sulphate of soda, which is formed
 in great quantity by the process, and remains in the residuum
 of the distillation.
                   is,

composed, this object merits the greatest attention at bleach^
fields on account of the considerable                degree of ceconomy
which results from the different manipulations.                  The ley of
oxygenated muriatic acid will be obtained at little or no ex
pense bv bleachers, when they serioufly set about extracting
the soda from the sulphate formed during the distillation.
    In whatever manner the muriatic acid gas may be distilled,
the great object        to saturate the water with this aeriform,
                       is
fluid.    Its action       in

or earths, as     in the subsequent operations of which                  am         I
about to speak.       The volatility of the acid, however,             such,       is
and the loss of the gas          enormous, that, when the thread or
                                 so

 may   be  estimated   at  about       third,
                                           a   at least, of  the whole gas.
 The mixture of potash, indeed, renders the liquor inodorous;
 but besides that this salt           is
                                   expensive,         greatly weakens the

 detersive quality of the liquor.
    Rupp, of Manchester, has invented an apparatus for bleach
 ing cloth exceedingly simple in its construction, of small ex
 pense, and which contains the liquor in such                    manner as a
 to prevent the escape ot the oxygenated muriatic acid gas.
 A consideration of no less importance in the arrangement of
 this apparatus      is,
                       the impossibility of the vapour injuring the
 health of the workmen.                Ihave witnessed, in        very Targe

 first effects of the oxygenated muriatic acid.               In Rupp's ap

Berthollimetre.           shall also examine the method proposed
                          I
 by   Rupp.
     The process of Descroizilles consists in dissolving indigo                                irt
dilute sulphuric acid in the following manner :•— dram of                           A

tion    is  facilitated       by
                             immersing      the  matrals    into      balneum,  a
jmarjaet the solution of indigo is then diluted                    flask con
                                                                           in   a
taining 134 ounces of distilled water, until no traces of                   re           it
main in the matrass;                   by
                                    which means the indigo then be
comes mixed with the liquor                  the proportion of one to
                                                 in                                            a
thousand. The instrumpnt afterwards serves to indicate the
discolouring force of the oxygenated muriatic acid. The me
thod of employing            may be seen
                              it                  the memoir published,
                                                       in
 by   Descroizilles in the year 3.
     The method pointed out                  by
                                            Rupp appears to me to be
simpler, and calculated to avoid those errors to which the
sulphuric acid always gives rife              he adds acetite of lead to
                                                  :
the solution of indigp until the lead               precipitated, and the

     The utility of these means for ascertaining the strength or
 exhaustion of the oxygenated muriatic acid may be readily
 conceived.         If  certain quantity of stuffs or thread put into

the Berthollimetre, there is reason to conclude that there has
been an exhaustion of a fourth : the fame reasoning may be
applied by analogy to proofs by the acetite of lead.
    Cloth is prepared for immersion in oxygenated water, by
soaking in a ley of weak potash, and rinsing it afterwards in
a large quantity of water in order to free it completely from
the weavers' dressing and the saliva of the spinners.   In Eng
land and Ireland, machinery is employed for rinsing and
beating : in some places this operation is performed by means
of planks to which an alternate motion is communicated ;
but this mechanism wears the stuffs, though it greatly acce
lerates the operation.   In place of such planks, which are
too long, in our manufactories we employ stampers, placed
in very large conical tubs, the levers of which change their
direction every stroke, passing successively over the whole
quantity of cloth immersed. But the best method of all is
beating by mechanism. For this purpose a circular platform,
which performs its revolutions around a moveable axis, and
is supported at the ends of the spokes by rollers of cast iron,
is employed: the circumference of this wheel is notched to.
receive a catch, which makes it recede one notch every stroke
 by the motion of the mill- tree.    This tree bears on its axis
spokes that raise several wooden beaters, which, falling on
 the moveable platform covered with cloth and thread, rinse
 them completely : buckets attached to the water-wheel raise
 the water, and pour it into gutters that convey it under the
 beaters, which are thus abundantly watered.
     Cotton and cotton cloth require in particular this prepara
 tion ; otherwise the ley could not penetrate to the inside of
 the cotton, on account of the extracto-resinous matter con
 tained in    as we have already observed in speaking of that
              it,

from Kremsmunster. He received the rudiments of his edu
cation     the convent of ^.remsmunfter,
               in                            which was indebted
to his uncle the abbpt, A'exa,1QVr Fixlinillner, for an ex
cellent school ajid an observatory.       Placidus conceived an
early attachment to the mathematics, and took               much                                so
pleasure      delineating mathematical figures, that his mo
                    in
ther, out of derision, called him the almaiiac-piaker.      After
some stay at the above seminary he removed to Salzburg,
where he completed his course of philosophy, and obtained
 in that faculty the degree of doctor. His taste for the ma
thematics, however, "became still stronger. His father having
 asked him one day what present he should give him, he re
 quested Wolf's Epitome of the Mathematics             which be                         ;

viciate at Kremsmunster in 1737, and next year he publicly
took the vows before his uncle, the abbot Alexander.
    After a stay of two years in the convent his obeim sent him
again to Salzburg to complete his studies in jurisprudence
and theologv ; but at the same time he applied with great
assiduity to the mathematics, languages, history, an d anti-
quitic- We learned also to play on the harpsichord and organ ;
and made so much progress in music, that he composed se
veral pieces both in the sacred and theatrical style.      He dis
puted in some theological theses; obtained the degree of
doctor in theologv; and in 1745 returned to his convent,
where he was consecrated to the priesthood.
     About this time the Ritterscbule having been established
at Kremsmunster, Placidus was appointed profess>r of canon
law; a department in which he had acquired great reputation
at the university.      This office he held for forty years, and
resigned it only a short time before his death.       Almost about
the fame period he was appointed dean of the higher school,
and soon aster principal regent over the young nobility;
which places he retained also till his death. He poflesled
great knowledge of the canon laws, and on that account was
often employed in processes and other affairs relating to the
convent: he was likewise inscribed Kolarius apojiulicus in
 curia Romana.
     In the year 1760 he published a theological work under
the title of Reipublicce Sacra: Origines Divina; but he ac
quired far more celebrity by his astronomical labours, both as
an observer and a writer.      The abbot Alexander Fixlmillner,
a great friend of the sciences, and particularly of the mathe
matics, having resolved, in the year 1747, to form an esta
blishment in his convent for promoting the latter, first set
apart a spacious apartment for the purpose of containing ma
 thematical and philosophical instruments.         This paved the
 way for something further ; and he determined, for the im-
               of his conventuals in astronomv, to erect an ob-
 Sirovement
   ervator'y.   Among those convents which for a longtime
 have devoted their leisure and riches to the advancement of
 science and the good of mankind, none has distinguislied
 itself more than that of Kremsmunster.        This very old abbey
 is not the seat of infidelity and indolence, but a patron of
 the noblest branches of science.      The observatory founded in
  1748   was  completed   in 1758,  and  the superintendence of it
 was intrusted to fclugenius Dobler, a brother of the order.
      Alexander's successor, the abbot Berthold Vogel, who
  Jong resided at Salzburg as nrofessor of canon law and rector
  of the University, being well acquainted with Fixlmillner's
                                                              great

    great knowledge, particularly in the mathematics, appointed
    him in 1762 to be astronomer at Kremsmunfter, with leave
   to retain his office   as professor of canon law. He now applied
   with   great  zeal  to  render himself more fit for his new occu
   pation,    as he  had  not   yet attended much to practical astro-
  Jiomy,     and  was   even  but   little acquainted with those books
    from   which     he could obtain information          on the subject.
  Jlis   great  attachment,    howerer,     to this science,   fine genius,
   and a desire of being useful to the institution in which
   he resided, and to the world, made him overcome every diffi
   culty.    The first book that fell into his hands was Lalande's
   Exposition du Calcul AJlronomic/ue, with which alone, with
   out any oral instruction, he began to study and to make ob
   servations.     This work, together with Vlacq's logarithmic
   tables, were for a long time his only sources and guides, till
   he at length obtained Lalande's large work on astronomy.
   Fortunately, a carpenter, named John Illinger, born in a vil
   lage belonging to the abbey, though he could neither read
   nor write, was able, under the direction of Fixlmillner, to
   construct for him very neat mural quadrants, zenith sectors,
   transit instruments, and pendulum clocks.                Other instru
   ments were made for him by Brander of Augsburgh, and he
   procured achromatic telescopes from Dollond ; so that by his
   activity the observatory at Kremsmunfter soon became one of
   the most celebrated, and best supplied with apparatuses, in
   (Germany. His principal assistants were Theod. Derfflinger,
  who afterwards became his successor, and Father B. Waller.
       Fixlmillner now acquired a considerable rank among astro
  nomical writers. In 1765 he published his Meridianus Spe
  cula Ajlron. Cremifanenjis, jn which he established the first
  dements of his observatory, and determined its longitude and
- latitude. In 1776 he publistied his second astronomical work,
  called Decennium AJlronomicum, which contained the observ
  ations made by hjm at Kremsmunfter from 1765 to 1775,
  and which is replete wjth iniportant and useful information.
  His third work, on which he was employed towards the close
  of his life, and which was printed after his death, appeared
  in 179'. It contains a valuable collection of observations
  made between the years 1776 and 170s, together with a
  great many calculations and treatises, which, still add to his
  celebrity in this department.          Besides these, many important
  articles written by him are to be found jn the Journal des
  Savans; Bernoulli's Epistolary Correspondence ; the French
  Epbemerides       des Move',      the Astronomical         Almanac of
  Berlin j the Astronomical Ephemerides of Vienna; and the
  Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris.
                                                                      The

     The important service rendered to the science of astronomy
by Fixlmillner is well known to all astronomers. The great
number of his observations of Mercury, at a time when they
were rare, and difficult to be made, enabled Lalande to com*
plete his accurate tables of that planet, for which the French,
astronomer publicly returned him thanks.              Fixlmillner was
one of the first astronomers        who observed the orbit of the
jiewly discovered planet Uranus. He was also the first who
supported Bode's conjecture, that the star 34, in the Bull,
observed by Flamstead         in the year 1690, and which after
wards disappeared, was the new planet.               Fixlmillner was
a man of lo great application and activity that he not only
made observations, but calculated them all himself, and de
duced from them the necessary results. All his observations,
of whatever kind, he calculated on the spot ; and to avoid
errors he always calculated them a second time. To un*
common industry he united great penetration and deep re
flection, as is proved by the great many excellent remarks
and discoveries to be found in his works.            It must here be
added, that this able astronomer lived in a remote part of the
 country, at a distance from all literary helps, and from others
who pursued the same studies ; that is to fay, from all those
 things which could animate his zeal ; and yet he continued,
 till the last day of his life, a singular instance of perseverance
 and attachment to his favourite study.          But few men were so
 little subject to the imperious power of the passions.          Simple
 in his manners, he poflefscd great equanimity and firmness,
 like the immutable Jaws of nature which he studied.                 His
 wide extended celebrity did not render him proud : whatever
 was written or said in his praise, he endeavoured rather to
 conceal than to publish.       His close application at length im
 paired his health, and brought on obstinate obstructions,
 which ended in a diarrhœa. He died on the 27th of August
  1791, in the 71st year of his age, the 53d of his residence in.
  the convent, aud the 46th after his entering into the priest
 hood.
  XXXIX. A          brief Account os the Origin and Progress           of
              Letter-press-plate or Stereotype Printing.
  XT. AD I       listened to the solicitations of friends,     I  should
  Jong  before this time have published some account of an art
  to the advancement of which         I  had in some degree contri
  buted, and in which,        I may affirm,     I was tolerably profi
   cient upwards of twenty years ago        : I  might add, that the
                                                                     ide*

 268           Account   of the Origin and  Progress  of
 idea was truly my own — for such was the fact — hut in per*
 fecting the invention I had the assistance and joint labour of
 another.     At the time of the discovery I flattered myself that
 we were original ; and, with those sanguine ideas which are
 natural to a young man, indulged the hopes of reaping some
 fame at least from the discovery : nay, I was even weak enough
 to feel vexed when I afterwards found that we had been anti
 cipated by a Mr. Ged, of Edinburgh, who had printed books
 from letter-press plates about fifty years tefore! The know
  ledge of this fact lessened the value of the discovery so much
 in my estimation, that I felt but little anxiety to be known as
 a second inventor; and but for the persevering attempts of
 others to deprive Ged of the fame his memory so justly merits,
 and which he dearly earned, I might have still remained silent.
      It is not my intention at present to enter into a detail
 of particulars respecting the processes connected with letter-
 press-plate or stereotype printing, nor would it be proper
'without previously obtaining the concurrence of Mr. Foulis,
 the gentleman who assisted me in my labours. Much less is
 it my intention to enter into 3 history of printing in general:
 a few remarks, however, respecting its varieties may not
  prove unacceptable to some readers.
      Impressing forms or images upon various substances, as
  clay and metals, by means of seals, stamps, dyes, punches,
  and the like, must have been an early invention : antique
  coins, antient bricks with inscriptions on them, &c. are
  proofs of this.   In this cafe, the body to be impressed must
  be in a state comparatively soft and plastic, and the seal or
  other stamp is applied with such a force as to make it leave
  its image in the substance of the clay or metal. The tranfi-
"tion from this to printing, which, in its simplest form, con-
  fists in smearing over or daubing the prominences of a stamp
  with any coloured substance, that when applied to another
  body it may leave its impression on the surface of such body,
  appears so simple, so easy, and natural, that it has been a
  matter of much wonder to the moderns that it should not
  have been discovered for so many ages ; not, indeed,          till
  within these few centuries. This pbservation, however, docs
  not apply with all its sojee to the Asiatics j for jn China the
  period of the discovery is so remote as to baffle any attempt
  that might be made to fix the, æra of printing from blocks in
  that country.
      Printing from blocks may be considered as the first species
  of printing properly so called. The end intended by this pro
  cess is obtained by cutting, upon a flat block of wood or me
  tal, but commonly the lormer, the words or sentences in
                                                            tended

              Littcr-press-plate or Stereotype Printi?ig.      36*9
tended to be multiplied by printing; and the cutting is ma
naged in such a manner, that the letters are left prominent,
 and present the original surface of the block, while every
 Other part of the surface is cut down so much lower, that the
 paper, linen, or other material to be printed, when applied
 to the block or vice vers', can come in contact with no part
 of the bottom of the incisions, but only with the projecting
 places which present the letters.       The block being provided,
  its surface is either applied to another flat surface covered
 over with a coloured composition, as is the practice wi'h ca
  lico printers, by which means it receives a sufficient charge
 to enable it to give off a portion of the colour, and, with the
  colour, its own form to the fluff to which it may then be
  applied ; or the colour is diffused over its surface by means
  of a ball, commonly made of soft (kin stuffed with wool, as
  is the practice with book-printers, in which cafe the coloured
  body gets the name of printing ink, and the paper receives
  the impression by being applied to, and pressed upon, the
  block. Were the block applied to the paper, the effect would
  be the fame ; but in practice it is sound much more conve
  nient to apply the paper to the block, for one reason among
  others — the paper is the lightest, and the easiest taken up in
   the hand.
      This kind of printing, from the best information that can
   be collected, appears to have been applied to the manufacture
  of playing cards long before any idea was entertained of mul
  tiplying copies of books by its means.        These cards had va
  rious kinds of figures upon them ; and among others, we may
  observe in parting, one called the devil; and nence, probably,
  the antipathy expressed by many against all games with cards;
   and hence, too, may have come the opprobrious name given
   to them of the devil's book.
-     At length the idea of copying MSS. by means of blocks
   was taken up in P^urope in the fifteenth century, and several
   books were soon executed in that manner, which may be
   called the first specimens of European stereotype.      It was a
   wonderful help to the propagation of truth ; and the facility
   with which books could be thus multiplied, compared with
   the trouble of writing them, would have left little cause for
  wonder, had it induced men to be satisfied for a long time
  with this first step in typography.
      This method, however, continued but a short time in prac
   tice till it suggested another.   Cutting or engraving a block
   for every page, was a work accompanied with considerable
  labour and expense: to cut separate letters on small pieces of

  JLJO         Account  of the Origin and Progress of
 wanted, appeared to be a likely way of still further reducing
 the price of book-making, as the fame types might be after
 wards employed for different works.
     This advance in the art was also soon obtained, but still
 printers were not satisfied.    A great number of each parti
 cular letter was required to enable them to set up or compose
 (as putting the letters together is called) a single sheet of any
 work ; each letter was to be cut and adjusted with such ac
 curacy, as to make it stand exactly to the fame height of every
 other letter; and all so as to range well with each oiher.        If
 the cutting of a Jingle alphabet could be made to answer in
 stead of so many, what a saving of labour !       Can we wonder
 that the attempt was made ? It succeeded, and gave rise to a
 new art, that of the type-founder, as pra6tised at this day.
     In this art, the letters are first cut upon steel punches :
 these are afterwards hardened, that they may bear striking
 into pieces of copper, in which they leave their impression,
 which pieces, called matrixes, being furnished with a proper
apparatus for forming the stalk or shank of the type, serve as
 moulds, from which any number of types may be cast, every
one exactly like its original punch.
     Thus we fee that book prihting has been, in its progress,
 connected with arts very different in themselves.       At its first
origin the blockcutter was the principal agent in producing
the copy of the MS.         Pressmen were also necessary.     In its
next step, the block-cutter turns letter-cutter, each like each
 other in height and body, that they might range properly in
lines; a labour so prodigious that words cannot convey any
idea of the mechanical patience it must have required 1 An
other set of workmen now became necessary, a new business
was formed, that of the compositor; the person who arranges
the letters into words, lines, and pages.      The third stage of
the art was that in which moveable metallic types were
employed, which embraces the arts of the punch-cutter,
the sinker and adjuster of the matrixes, the mould-maker,
(the mould, properly speaking, is that part of the apparatus
which forms the shank or body of the type ; the letter formed
by the matrix is called the face;) the type-founder, the com*
positor, and the pressman.
     This kind of printing is called letter-press, to distinguish it
from another, which is radically different both in the mode
of its production and in that of its working — we mean copper-
plate work.
     Engraving on melals is an art of great antiquity.      Almost
every lcind of antient armour that has yet been found, as also
many antique household implements, are embellished with
engravings of less or more merit.         We speak not now of
                                                         sculptures

             Letter-press-plate or Stereotype Printing.          Vjt.
sculptures and carving3 in metal, which are probably equally
antient, but of engraving, properly so called, figures of flow
ers, animals, men, formed on surfaces more or less uniform,
by incisions or lines cut into them with graving tools. But
though the origin of this art is so remote that it cannot be
determined, that of taking impressions,           or printing from
such engravings, appears to have been discovered subsequent
to the art of letter-press printing.     It is performed by rub
bing over the plate with printing ink, and then cleaning its
surface in such a manner that the ink may still remain in the
incisions.     Moistened paper is then laid upon the plate, and
both are passed through between rollers, with a piece of
blanket or soft cloth on the back of the paper, which forces
 the latter into the incisions, and brings it into contact with
 the ink left in them, a portion of which adhering to the
 paper, gives to it the forms engraved on the copper.           This
 kind of printing, from the manner in which the impression
 is obtained, is called rolling-press, and sometimes copper-
 plate printing.
      By the progressive steps which we have endeavoured
 briefly to enumerate, typography was brought to that state
 of perfection to which it has attained. It is a curious fact,
  however, that all the improvements followed each other in
  such quick succession, that in a few years from its first in
 vention in Europe, we find the printers in possession of all
  our common modes of working, and producing specimens of
  their art, which even now cannot be surpasted.             Some of
  the early printed missals upon vellum are proofs of this.
      But if we have reason to be surprised at the quick steps by
  which printing with moveable types was perfected, we have
  more cause to wonder why with the acquisition of moveable
  types the art became stationary.       The . transition from solid
  pages, cut at an expense and labour beyond the value os the
  interest os any capital that could be required to besunk in print
  ing an edition of any work, made it a desirable object to devise
  means for making the same letters do over and over, not only
  for different sheets in succession of the same work, but for
  subsequent publications.       Hence came the first moveable
  types ; which, however, as we have already observed, were
  all cut singly. The success which followed the attempts
   made to lessen this labour of cutting, by making well formed
   letters once cut serve for ever, by the facility of multiplica
   tion which founding afforded, ought, one would think, in
   stantly to have led to a further improvement.          If founding
   could be applied to single letters, <why not to pages, to get
   rid of a.focrisice of capital submitted to at first, because of

sent limits allow it, that not only the business of the press
men, but of the compositors, would be materially benefited
and increased        by  the general adoption of such an improve
ment) and       all   errors  as soon as discovered could be rectified
in the plates, to prevent them from appearing in after copies,

    Such considerations as            Ihave just stated first led me to
turn my thoughts to the improvement of the art of printing                         ;
and the more      I   thought upon              it,

vinced of its practicability.            communicated my ideas upon
                                          I
the subject to Mr. Foulis, printer to the university of Glas
gow, my native city, and where                 then resided, who fur
                                                  I
nished me with       a  page   of tvpes ready set up, or composed, for
my    first  experiment,     which    had sufficient success to induce
me to try others, and convinced Mr. Foulis of the possibility
of producing plates, which would yield impressions not to be
distinguished from those taken from types.
    If had seen some of the advantages which such plan
    I                                                                          a
promised, Mr. Foulis saw and pointed out many more, of
such    a   nature as could only present themselves to            regular  a
bred practical printer.          We agreed to prosecute the business
together, and,       if  possible, to bring       to perfection, and in
                                                        it

rable experiments, till we at last overcame every difficulty,
and were able to produce plates, the impressions from which
could not be distinguished from thole taken from the types
from which they were cast.
    In the mean time we learnt that our art, or one extremely
similar, had been practised many years before                 Mr. Ged,by
as  I  have before observed          and soon after the world was fa

Embattel'd roll'd, as Hector rusiYd along.

The heav'ns re-echo, and the shores reply ;
They vow destruction to the Grecian'name,
And in their hopes, the fleets already flame.
    But Neptune, rising from the seas .profound,
The god whose earthquakes rock the solid ground,
Now wears a mortal form ; like Calchas seen,
Such his loud voice, and such his manly mien ;
His   shouts incessant ev'ry Greek inspire,
But most th' Ajaces, adding fire to sire.

'Tis yours   to save us, if  you cease to fear ;
Flight, more than shameful, is destructive here.

There, Greece has strength : but this, this part o'er
Her strength were vain      ; I dread for you alone.
Here Hector rages like the force of fire,
Vaunts of his gods, and calls high Jove his sire.
If yet some heav'nly pow'r your breast excite.
Breathe in your hearts, and string your arms to fight,
Greece yet may live, her threaten'd fleet maintain,
Aud Hector's force, and Jove's own aid, be vain.

              Letter-press -plate or Stereotype Printing.        273
 Informs us, was printed from a MS. dictated by Ged some
 Mme before his death : the second part was written by his
  daughter, for whose benefit the profits of the publication were
 intended : the third was a copy of proposals that had been
  published byMr. Ged's son in 1751, for reviving his father's
  art; and to the whole was added Mr. Mores's narrative of
  block printing.
     From this publication it appears, that so far back as the
 year 1725 Mr. Ged had begun to prosecute plate-^making.
 In 1727 he entered into a contract with a person who had a
 little capital, but who on conversing with some printer got
 so intimidated that at the end of two years he had laid out
 only 22I.     In 1729 he entered into a new contract with a
 Mr. Fenner, Thomas James a type-founder, and John
 James the architect ; and some time after a privilege was ob
  tained fron the university of Cambridge to print bibles and
 prayer-books.       But it appears that one of his partners was
 actually averse to the success of the plan, and engaged such
 people for the work as he thought most likely to spoil it. A
 straggling workman who had wrought there informed Mr.
 Mores " that both bibles and common-prayer-books had been
             but that the compositors when they corrected one
   ault made purposely half a dozen more, and the pressmen
 {>rinted,
 when the masters were absent battered the letter in aid of the
 compositors.      In consequence of these base proceedings, the
 books vVere suppressed by authority, and the plates sent to the
 King's printing-house, and from thence to Mr. Caflon's
 foundery."
     After much ill usage, Ged, who appears to have been a
           of great honesty and simplicity,     returned   to  Edin-
 Eerson
   urgh.     His friends were anxious that a   specimen of his art
should be published, which was at last done by subscription.
 His son, James Ged, who had been apprenticed to a printer,
with the consent of his master set up the forms in the night
time, when the other compositors were gone, for his father to
cast the plates from    ; by which means Salust      was finished in
 1736. Of this work I have a copy, and, which is more sin
gular, the plate of one of the pages ; and from it the speci
men of Ged's work given with the present article was printed.
This plate I first saw in the hands of the deceased Mr. John
Murray, bookseller, in the year 1782, but do not now recol
lect the way in which he said it came into his possession.
Having about a year ago applied to his successors in business,
Messrs. Murray and Highley, to request, if the plate could be
found, that I might be allowed to take some impressions
from it ; they very politely insisted on my acceptance of what
    Vol. X.                        S                            they

3^4           Account of        the   Origin and   Progress       of
they had     used     as a flat weight to lay upon papers on
                    for years
thp end     of the
               desk. After what 1 have jull stated,       need             I
hardly add  that the plate  has  received considerable injury,
and that it would be unfair to judge by its present appear
ance   ofthe degree of perfection to which Ged had brought
the art.   It is extremely probable too, that the forms from
which he made his moulds were composed of worn types,
which will always produce plates that may be said to be worn
before they are used.
   Besides the Salult, T have another work printed some years
 after from plates of Mr. Ged's manufacture.            The book is
"   The Life of Gon in the Soul of Man," printed on a writing
pot, i2mo, aud with the following imprint :
                                                  " Nh we A stle :
 Printed aud    fid  by John Wh i tk, from plates made by
William         Gi.n, Goldsmith in Edinburgh, mdccxlii."
 It is a very neat little volume, and is as well printed as books
generally were at the time.
    Though we had reason to fear from what we found Ged had
met with, that our efforts would experience a similar opposition
from prejudice and ignorance, we persevered in our object for
a considerable time, and at last resolved to take out patents
for England and Scotland, to secure to ourselves, for the
usual term, the benefits of our invention ; for the discovery
was still as much our own as if nothing similar had been
practised before ; Ged's knowledge of the art having died
with his son, whose proposals for reviving              published in
                                                            it,
175s, not having been followed with success, he went to
Jamaica, where he died. The patents were accordingly ob
tained nay, they are even e:;pired
       ;                                   and yet we hear people,
                                              :
who only began their stereotype Ydhours ycjlerday, taking to

have hardly had time even to think upon             since.
                                                       it      ought   I
however to observe here, that its being suspended was not on
account of any imperfection attending the art, or objections
against its being      sit object to be prosecuted.
                         a                              On the con
trary,  several small  volumes   were  actually printed from plates
made    by  myself and Mr. Foulis, and the editions were fold
to the trade without any intimation of their being printed
out of the common way                 We had heard whispers that
                                          1
our work could not possibly be such as would pass for com
                                                                               IfUM

The first essays, therefore, were in the lowest fense of the
word common : one or two histories*, and a cheap edition of
The Economy of Human Life. We also printed a Greek vo
lume, Xenophon's Anabajis, 1783, and had plates for several
small volumes of the English Poets almost finished, but the
latter were never put to press. Having preserved two or three
of the plates made along with Mr. Foulis,       shall subjoin to            I
the present account a specimen of one or two. They have
been damaged by lying about for a number of years, and by
a carriage or 400 miles j yet                    I
                                shall offer no apology sot their
appearance.
, Twice then had this art been invented and practised   in
Britain, when about three years ago Didot, the celebrated
French printer, applied it to logarithmic tables, and afterwards
to several of the Latin classics, and to various French publi
cations, which he has executed with considerable accuracy.
The press-work     has been carefully attended to, and does great
credit to the printer.      Indeed, after what Didot has done,
clamour and prejudice will attempt in vain in future to decry
letter-press-plate, and his name will always be mentioned as
a principal promoter of this useful art, the introduction ot
which will be marked as a singular æra in the history of
printing.    Some of his countrymen indeed (for I cannot sup

     " Above    a hundred years ago, the Dutch were in possession
 of   the art of printing with solid or fixed tvpes, which in every
 respect was superior to that of Didot's stereotype.                 It may,
 however, be readily comprehended that these letters were
 not cut in so elegant a manner, especially when we reflect on
 the progress which typography has made since that period.
 Samuel and J. Leuchtmans, booksellers at Leyden *, have
 still in their possession the forms of a quarto Bible which were
 constructed     in this ingenious manner.            Many thousand im
 pressions were thrown off, which are in every body's hands,
 and the letters are still good.
     "   The inventor of this useful art was J. Van der May,
 father of the well-known painter of that name. About the
 end of the 16th century he resided at Leyden.                     With the
 assistance of M idler, the clergyman of the German congre
 gation there, who carefully superintended the correction, he
 prepared and cast the plates for the above-mentioned quarto
 Bible. This Bible he published also in folio, with large
 margins ornamented with figures, the forms of which are
 still in the hands of Elwe, bookseller at Amsterdam *: also
 an Englissi New Testament, and Schaaf's Syriac Dictionary,
 the forms of which were melted down; and likewise a small
 Greek Testament in i8mo.
     " As far as is known, Van der May printed nothing else
 in this manner ; and the art of preparing solid blocks was
 lost at his death, or, at least, was not afterwards employed.
 The cause may readily be conceived ; for, though this pro
 cess in itself is very advantageous,            it is far more expensive
 than the usual method of printing, except in those cases
 when such works are to be printed as are indispensably ne
 cessary, and os standing worth.           The number of these, how
 ever, is certainly small ; especially as we are acquainted with
 no instance in the annals of Dutch printing, that any de-
 pendance can be placed on the sale of 150,000 copies, as
 was the cafe with the brothers Guyot."
     The publisher of      the preceding notice supposes, nay, as
 serts,   that the expense of stereotype precludes its use, ex-
    * Should the present article chance to meet the eves of Messrs. Leucht
mans or Elwe, the gentlemen mentioned in this extract as being possessed
of fume of Van der May's forms, they uould confer a perlonal favour on
the author of the present article, and at the i'jnie time a service to truthrif
they would have the goodness to part « itli the phtes or blocks of a few
pages, and forward them to his addrcls in London by any of the vessels
which bear his Prussian majesty's flag, and which arc daily passing between
the two countries.     By inspecting them, he thinks he could determine
whether Van der May's process was the fame that he himself has practised.

cept           case of standard authors, whose works are sure
          in the
of an extensive sale : but, unhappily for his mode of reason
ing, exactly the converse of this is the truth; for, if there
would be an advantage in applying the stereotype art to books
of rapid sale, there would be a still greater one in the case of
those publications whose sale may be less certain, as at the
worst there could only be the loss of the plates, in place of
that of the paper and presswork of a whole edition, which,
in almost every cafe, would amount to a much larger sum.
The expense, then, attending the process (if, indeed, Van
der May's was the lame as ours) was not the cause of its
being laid aside in Holland. The probability       that his art       is,
died with himself; for we find that Ged had " offers from
Holland, repeatedly, either to go over there, or fell them his
invention *          ;"
                which would not have been the cafe had they
been possessed of their own countryman's.                A.                      1.

    in all possible directions, and adhering to one another by a cer
    tain degree of cohesive force. He thought that if he could,
     t>y any process, destroy that adherence, without altering much
    the solidity of the crystals themselves, he might thus obtain
a      loose, but entire, stony aggregate, which would become
    flexible on account of the relative mobility of the integrant
    crystals, but keep its solidity and preserve its form in con
     sequence of their being deeply implicated and interwoven,
    among themselves.
        According to that theory, he undertook          series, of expe
                                                                   a

     hardness.      He gave to his friends some specimens of Carrara

     Mr. Tillocb,                                  Robertson Buchanan.

                       On the Velocity of Water Wheels.            279
   THERE are many cases in which it is of importance to
know the proportion of power necessary to give different degrees
of velocity to a mill *. But as the construction of mills, and
the purposes they serve, are various, it is perhaps impossible to
find any law of universal application. Mr. Banks, in his Trea
tise on Mills f, has drawn a conclusion, which he appears
to consider as invariable, namely, that " when a wheel acts
by gravity, its velocity will be as the cube root of the quan
tity of water it receives."
    But if we suppose a wheel raising water, by means of cranks
and pumps, on Mr. Banks's principle, it might easily,                 I
think, be demonstrated, that, by reducing the velocity of the
wheel to a certain degree, the wheel would raise more water
than would be neceflary to move it at that velocity j a thing
evidently impossible.
    In this view, it would seem there is no actual cafe in which
Mr. Banks's conclusions will hold true. But, however they
may apply to other mills, the experiments which I am going
to mention seem to me to prove, at least, that they do riot
apply to cotton mills.    On the ground of these experiments,
made at different times, and with all the attention in my
power, (and not from any abstract consideration,) have                 I
presumed to call in question an authority for which I enter
tain the highest respect.
    In January 1796 I measured the quantity of water the old
Rothesay cotton mill required, 1st, when going at its common
 velocity; and, 2dly, when going at half that velocity;       The
 result was, that the last required just half the quantity or
 water which the first did.   it is to be observed, that in these
 experiments the quantities of water were calculated from the
 heads of water and apertures of the sluices.
    From these experiments I inferred, " that the quantity of
 water necessary to be employed in giving different degrees
 of velocity to a cotton mill, must be nearly as that ve
locity."
   I was satisfied with this experiment, and the inference             I
drew from            it,
                 till some gentlemen, well acquainted with the
theory and practice of mechanics, expressed their doubts on
the subject.         had then recourse to another experiment,
                       I
which I  considered as less liable to error than the former.
  The water which drives the old cotton-mill falls,        little
                                                               a
below      it,
           into      perpendicular-sided pond, which serves as

a8o             On the Velocity    of Water Wheels.
t ion al quantities of water used by the old mill, nothing more
was necessary than to measure the time the water took to
rise to a certain height in that pond j and accordingly, on
the first of May 1798, I made the experiments noted in the
following   table   :
      I     2       3     4    Number of experiments.
                               Revolutions of one of the upright
     46    46       24    23     shafts per minute.
      5     5       5      5   Rife of water in the pond in inches.
  6.58     6-57 H-45 15.0 Time in minutes and seconds.
   The first and second experiments were made with the          mill
at its common velocity ; the third and fourth at nearly         half
that velocity.
   The time which the mill required to use the same quantity
of water in these experiments may be taken in round num
bers ; the proper velocity at 7 minutes, and half that velocity
at 15 minutes.
   The result of these experiments approaches very nearly to
that of 1796. The difference may be accounted for by the
small degree of leakage which must have taken place at the
sluices on the lower end of the pond ; and the time being
greater in the third and fourth experiments, the leakage
would, of course, be greater.
   Mr. Smeaton * and others have proved, in a very satisfac
tory manner, that
                     " the mechanical power which must be
employed in giving different degrees of velocity to the fame
body must be as the square of that velocity."    But it appears
to me that the result of the above experiments may be easily
reconciled to this proposition by considering what Mr. Smea
ton says immediately afterwards : — " If the converse of this
proposition (fays he) did not hold true, viz. that if a body
in motion, on being stopped, would not produce a mecha
nical effect equal or proportional to the square of its velocity,
or to the mechanical power employed in producing              it,
                                                             the
effect would not correspond with its producing cause.      Now,
it     to be observed, that Mr. Smeaton's experiments were
      is
made on the velocity of heavy bodies free from fri&ion and
                         See Smeaton on   Mills,   p. 1$.

other Causes of rejijlance; but in mills there is not only fric
tion, but obstacles to be removed : and experiments made on
friction have proved that the frictions of many kinds of bodies
increase in direct proportion to their velocity.               But the ve
locity    of a  cotton-mill     at work    may   be  considered   as a me

 XLII.      Account of a new Instrument for             the  Extraction of
     Teeth,    by the Inventor,        Mr. Reece,         Member of the
     Royal College of Surgeons, London.
         SIR,                         Craven-Street,  Strand, Aug. 15, 1801.
 IN     the first Number of the second Volume of your very useful
 Publication     is an account of an instrument for the extraction
 of teeth,    which    the inventor (a Mr. Brown) represents as a
 very great improvement of the German key instruments. This
         improvement consists in a depression on the front of the
f-reat
   ulcrum, which (as he observes)          "  forms a bed to receive the
 tooth." The experiments            of   Mr.    Brown, I am well in
 formed,      were  made    on  an old  jaw   of a skeleton,   the alveolar
 process    of which    being imperfect,     the  application of the con
 caved     fulcrum    to  the   convexity   of  the  tooth was easily ad-'
 mitted ; and, no doubt, its extraction effected                "  without
 much violence to the jaw, or pain to the patient."                  But in
 the living fubjecl, the alveolar process and contiguous soft
 parts being interposed between the concaved fulcrum and the
 tooth, the great advantages derived from this invention are,
 an unavoidable laceration and contusion of the gum, and great
 violence to the jaw-bone and socket, producing troublesome
 inflammation and often alarming hemorrhagies, from there
 being no corresponding eminence of the gum, on which it
 rests, to sill up the hollow (the bed) of the fulcrum : the
 corners, by the pressure necessary for the expulsion of the
 tooth (which, when firm, is very considerable) are produc
 tive of very serio\is mischief; and those practitioners who
 were induced to give these instruments a trial, experiencing
 their bad effects, nave returned them to the maker.
     Similar effects (however, in a much less degree) too often
  arise from the pressure of the heel of the instrument in common
 use, and the oblique direction in which the tooth is extracted ;
 to obviate which I have invented an instrument which, by
  the peculiar curvature of the claw3 elevates the tooth in nearly
                                                                     a per

a perpendicular direction, and from the structure of the ful
crum, the pressure, not falling on the gum till the tooth is a
little raised, is very trifling For its complete expulsion, by
which means the injury of the jaw-bone and contusion of
contiguous soft parts are avoided, and, consequently, the most
painful part of the operation.     The surrounding gum being
previously separated by the scarificator (which accompanies                    it)
from the tooth, that the claw of the instrument may be ap
plied as low down as the alveolar process will admit of, the
upper part of the fulcrum will, on turning the instrument,
apply itself exactly opposite to the end of the claw the ope        ;

my patients have uniformly expressed their surprise at the
flight pain they experienced. As the instrument may be
seen at Mr, Whitford's, surgical instrument maker, St. Bar
tholomew's Hospital, who          fully competent to give every

   The following question, proposed as the subject of a prize,
will be decided in the month of November 1801 : —
   As the great difference between the oriental historians and
the Greek and Roman writers, in regard to the history of the
antient kingdom of Persia, has not yet been properly elucidated,
the society requires that it may be critically examined, and in
such    a manner that, neglecting the oldest and fabulous
kings,  the  subject may be confined to the historical age after
Alexander, that           is,
                      the Greek and Parthian kings, or the                            fa
milies  of the Arsacidæ  and the Sassanidæ. The kings of these
dynasties,   together with some account of their reigns, must
be collected from the oriental writers.     The sources from
which   these derived their information must be examined, the
chronology of these kings and periods must be compared
with the Greek and Roman chronology, and the causes of
their disagreement must be examined; also the means of re
conciling them, and which method of computation in regard
to historical truth ought to be preferred.

of the holes may be the better regulated, so as to have them
 about half an inch distant towards the bottom, but gradually
at wider stistances, so as to be an inch asunder at toe npper
 part ; by which means the lower part of the com will have its'
 due proportion of fresh air.       To the top of the stick let there
 be fixed a leathern pipe ten inches long; which pipe is to be
 distended by two yards of spiral wire coiled up within it.        At
 the upper part of the pipe is fixed a taper wooden fasset, into'
 which the nose of a common household bellows is to be put,
 in order to ventilate the com.

  It  is with extreme pleasure we announce to the friends of
agriculture, and indeed to the world at large, that the Duke
of Bedford      going to establish, at his own individual ex
                 is
pense, an agricultural college at Woburn.
   What are to be the particular regulations of this institu
tion, as princely as     itnovel, we have not at present been
                               is
informed; all that we yet learn               is,
                                        that the Professor will
have the opportunity of availing himself of whatever          is
                                                           going
forwards on his Grace's very extensive farm, and of super
intending the various operations and experiments which
now are, or will be in future, carried on there.       The gen
tleman, whom the Duke has selected to fill this important
office is, we understand, the Reverend Mr. Edmund Cart-
 wright.    His Grace's choice, the reader must agree with us,
could not have fallen on any one more competent to         situa
                                                               a
tion requiring not only much practical knowledge,             but
great variety of scientific attainments.
    Sincerely do we congratulate the public on the establish
 ment of this most useful institution, the first certainly of its
kind in this country, and, we believe, in Europe.         Of the
 real patriotism and munificence of its truly noble founder,
 there can be only one sentiment.
                               SPANISH      wool.
   One of the prejudices which most strongly oppose the pro
pagation of sheep with superfine wool,           the opinion, too
                                                    is
generally diffused,  that this  race cannot    succeed  in our cli
mate   and  with   our ordinary pastures.     The   useful   voyage
that C. Lasteyrie has recently made in the north of Europe,
enables us to announce, that even the excessive cold does
not contribute to the degeneration of wool, as the Spa
nish race     preserved pure in the most northern parts of
             is
Sweden and Denmark.        A fact lately observed        by
                                                       C. Richard

 of  the animals themselves, do not impair the beauty of the
 wool,     tie had been called to particular functions else
 where, which obliged him to abandon to the care of in
 ferior agents the flock of the pure race kept on his own
 property.    This flock has been, for ten years past, managed
 like all those of the department of the Allier, that is to soy,
shut up at nights in close narrow stables, the dung of which is
 only taken away once a year, and led out at days by children
into the most marshy pastures, and without any precaution
against epizootic diseases.    C. Richard, on returning to his
farm, found his sheep in the worst possible state of health,
but the wool had not, by any means, degenerated; and he
has presented the Society of Agriculture some patterns of
very fine cloth, which he has caused- to be manufactured
with this wool in many of the best manufactories. Citizen
Teiflier had recognized the fame fact in an experiment which
he had tried at Rambouillet.      He had abandoned, for many
years together,   a  male and female   of pure race, in a meadow
Very moist and all encompassed with water.          Those animals
had become completely wild; they took them in order to
shear them with snares or gins, and, in spite of such a long
and unfavourable residence,     their wool and that of their pro
geny had not degenerated.

of it is lodged at the Royal Institution.

XLVI.     Description os the Salt Mines qslViehtska,        in Poland.
                    By  J. Peschier, M. D,*
  J. HE   village of Wielitska lies at the distance of two leagues
to the south-west of Cracow ; it is situated on the gentle de
clivity of a cultivated mountain, and is very populous. These
Valuable mines were discovered in the year 1251, and since
that time they have been constantly worked ; but it is only
since the late changes effected in the political state of Poland
that the working of them has been carried on with the pre
sent degree os spirit.
    The descent into these mines is through square pits, twenty
fathoms in depth and from twelve to fourteen in diameter,
cut through the pure salt, if we except a few fathoms of earth
by which thev are covered. There are six of them, of different
dimensions, distant about a hundred feet from each other,
and which all communicate with each other internally.
   This descent, which is attended with some novelty, in
some excites fear rather than curiosity.            Those who visit it
are seated in a sort of chair made of ropes, and strongly at
tached to a thick rope, which passes round a large wheel
moved by a horse, aiid which is thus let down into the pit.
From two to ten persons may be seated around this rope, pro
vided they hold very fast with their hands ; but if they are
subject to giddiness, they must then be secured bv a girdle
which passes round the body.            It ii customary before they
descend to offer up a short praver, which adds considerably to
the awfulnefs ot the preparation           for the descent ; but the
efforts which each afterwards makes to conceal his terror on
viewing the vast and obscure pit, the extremities of which
they dare not consider, generally overcome every sensation of
timidity, and the six minutes employed in reaching the bot
tom soon glide awav amidst mirth and security.
    When you arrive at the depth of fen fathoms you find
yourself in fresh and agreeable air, and afterwards experience
only very flight modifications of the temperature till you
reach the bottom, the depth of which is twenty fathoms.
    On leaching the bottom of the pit, a great number of the
workmen flock round you offering you their services; and
you then find yourself in the centre of six radii, each of which
forms an extensive gallery.         It is at this centre that salt dug

 from the mine is collected, and conveyed to the top of the*
pit     by means .of the fame rope that brings down those who
 visit it from curiosity.
      The first remarkable object that occurs is a magnificent
 altar, of moderate dimensions, cut out of the purest salt, and
 decorated with four columns ten feet in height, one and a
 half in diameter, and perfectly transparent : it i» ornamented
  all around with sculpture representing the attributes of the
  vine and agriculture : on the right is Jesus on the cross, of
  the naturas size, and executed with great elegance; on the
  left is a faint in the attitude of offering up his devotions, the
  work of the fame chisel : three steps conduct to the altar,
  which is richly ornamented with elegant vessels of salt ; and
  the whole receives a verv remarkable degree of splendour
  from about thirty small flambeaux lighted around it.
       In this place the salt is remarkably pure, and is distin-
     uiflied by the name of fcbiblka; the iecond kind, which is
  f
  ICbund at the distance of a few fathoms, is mixed with argil,
   and is called griin; the third, called Jpiza, is mixed with
   calcareous earth, argil, and water : the argil is almost always
  of a schistous form and of a dark gray colour ; in some morsels
  it serves as a base to the calcareous earth, disposed with great
  elegance in cottony balls, exceedingly white and of different
  iizes.
       The strata of salt are always parallel to the surface of the
   mountain ; but no regularity has hitherto been observed in
   the respective situations of the different strata : they are often
   separated from each other by strata of argil, and in some
   places intersected by veins of calcareous spar : where the air
   is dampest the soil falls into a state of efflorescence, and is
   remarkably white; everywhere else the colour varies from
   blackish blue to a dirty white. Where the water is collected
   and remains the salt dissolves, and then moots into very re
   gular cubic crystals : crystals of the like kind arc found some
   times buried in the mountain itself; the crystallization found
   there is quite formed in the manuer of four steps of equal
   dimensions, which, placed in a square, and converging to
   wards a centre, form a pyramid of great elegance and re
   gularity.
        We   proceeded from the altar through a large alley fifteen
    feet  in height and twelve in. breadth, entirely cut out in the
   salt, which conducted us to an immense magazine silled with
    casks.    This cavity, of an enormous size, constructed at the
   depth    of 120 feet below the surface of the earth, was sup
   ported only by four pillars of salt, and these even were con
  sidered as superfluous.      The sides of this hall consist of salt
                                                                more

 tnore or less pure, which reflected the rays of light proceeding
 from our lamps in a thousand different points*         We then,
 directed our course to a large stair of a hundred steps, each
 nearly fifteen feet in length and one in breadth, covered with
planks to preserve the angles of them 1 by this stair we de
 scend twenty-five fathoms without experiencing any very
sensible change in the temperature ; the dampness of the air
even is so weak, that planks whiph have been in use for up
wards of a hundred years, and at the depth of 270 feet below
the surface of the earth, appear still as fresh as if new.    The
workmen assured me that they experienced almost the fame
degree of heat during the whole year : the air here is so sur
charged with salt that the saline particles are deposited on the
hair, eyebrows, and eyelasties of the Workmen.
    We soon arrived at a hall of as great extent as the former,
in which the miners were employed in digging out the fait
with great activity. By the chisel and gunpowder they some
times cut out blocks three feet in breadth, and sufficiently
thick to form three masses, each weighing 560 pounds.
When the edges are rounded off, they give them the form of
an elliptical cask.
    The workmen employed in these mines are in number 800;
 they work in the interior of the mine from five o'clock in the
morning to one in summer, and from seven to three in win
ter. They are naked to the middle, (which announces a very
mild temperature,) and are not subject to any particular ma
lady: their paleness arises from the want of light and bad nou
rishment.     They have nothing to dread but the terrible ex
plosions which often burst forth from places formerly worked
and now closed up.       At the moment when they enter with
their lamp, the air seems as if traversed by flashes of light
ning in every direction : the combustion is sudden, extends
to the neighbouring galleries, extinguishes      the lamps, and
severely scorches the workmen if they do not throw them
selves flat on their faces.
    We now descended a second magnificent staircase to the
depth of 30 fathoms more, and of 450 feet below the surface
of the mountain, where we found horses yoked to a wheel
like the former, and which serves to move the rope that
brings up the salt dug out in the lower galleries. These ani
mals pass the greater part of their lives in these subterranean
regions, and yet enjoy good health. At some distance is a
large stable with fix pair of horses which relieve each other.
Being here struck with a strong smell of sulphur, I found that
it arose from the disengagement of sulphurized and phospho
rated hydrogen gas, produced by the fermentation of the
                               Ta                          horses'

 horses' duns;, and; in my opinion, must greatly contribute
 towards those aerial explosions of which I have spoken.
     We next proceeded to a neighbouring gallery, where,
 aster two hours' respectful admiration, we were filled with a
 sentiment of astonishment and surprise which it is impossible
 for me to describe.        Through the enormous mass of salt,
 which presents to the eye no interruption in its saline tex
 ture, and at the depth of 450 feet, flows a stream of pure
 frefli and transparent water, which is received in large wooden
 Vessels, where the workmen and horses of these subterranean
 regions quench their thirst. As it was impossible that this
 spring could filter through the salt, Nature, which buries her
 masterpieces in the bowels of the deepest mountains, has
 placed in this monstrous mass of salt a stratum of clay suffi
 ciently thick to allow this stream of water, destined to refresh
 the workmen, to pass through it in such a manner as to be
 protected from the action 0! the salt, of which a very small
 quantity would injure its salubrity.       To visit a place where
 Nature seems to have scattered her gists with profusion, and
 to have concentrated her most valuable secrets, must be highly
 interesting.
      We now set out to quit the mines, and in our way found
 several other altars recentlv cut out from the fait, and in
 a very neat manner, which displayed considerable taste.
 Having soon reached the bottom of one of the pits, we placed
 ourselves, as before,     on feats made of rope, and arrived in
 safety at the village    of Wielitfka. By an estimation, made
  nearly fifty years  ago, of the size of these mines, it appears
  that they extend from east to west 6000 German feet, from
  north to south 2000, and to the depth of more than 800.
      The working of these mines, which gives bread to more
  than 400 families, enriches the village, and supplies the
  neighbouring      countries with salt, produces       more than
  168,000 quintals per annum, and brings to the emperor a
  net profit of five millions of florins.
      Such are the most interesting circumstances which I ob
  served at the famous mines of Wielitfka, of which so many
  fabulous descriptions have been given, and against whicn
  people ought to be on their guard : it is even astonishing that
  where the mind can scarcely seize the grandeur of what
  Nature presents, the imagination should still be so lively as to
   fee there " people who never behold the light of the fun,
  who inhabit subterranean villages, who govern themselves
» according to their own laws," &c-
      During my stay at Cracow, I formed a design of visiting
   also the salt mines or mountains of salt al Bochnia, five leagues
                                                              south

south-east from Cracow, to which I repaired for that purpose;
but I was not allowed to descend into them, for want of the
necessary written orders.       They are constructed like those of
Wielitska; but the pits are deeper, and they contain more of
that kind of salt called Jchibika. The salt, however, is nei
ther so pure nor so various in its nature, nor are there to be
seen in the latter any of those masterpieces of art above de
scribed.     Large fragments of black wood and alabaster are
often found mixed with the salt.
XLVII.      Account of Lord Dundonald's Discovery of a
   Process   for extruding from Lichens a Gum applicable lo
   most   Purposes  in which Gum Senegal has been hitherto em
   ployed.
  A HIS important discovery was announced by a circular
letter from his lordsliip, which was followed by a meeting
of calico printers at Glasgow, and the publication of different
papers, a perusal of which will put our readers in posseslion
of all that has yet transpired respecting this business. The
following are copies of the letter and papers alluded to :
To Calico Printers       and other Consumers    of Gum Senegal in
                                Scotland.
      GENTLEMEN,                                      April 2}, iRor.
   IT   is now upwards     of nineteen years since I discovered that
a gummy extract, or gum, (equally well adapted as gum Se
negal for most purposes in which that article is employed,)
was to be procured, by an easy process, from the plant called
in botany lichen, or the moss which grows on trees and
hedges ; to be had in considerable quantities in many parts of
this country, and still in much greater abundance in Sweden,
Norway, and in the northern parts of America.
   At the time 1 made this discovery other objects, apparently
more important, occupied my attention ; but having, some
months ago, been informed that foreign gums had risen to
such a price as to bear hard on several branches of manufac
ture, I again turned my attention to the preparation of gum
from the lichen, and can ;iow, with confidence, inform vou
that it answers equally well as gum Senegal for your branch
of manufacture.        I intended at one time to have taken out
patents, but have now come to the determination of layin
 my invention open, for the benefit of the calico printers am
other consumers of gum.
                                  T  3                          With

294         Process   for      extracting a Gum from Lichens.
   With this view,         I
                       invite you to meet me at the Black Bull
inn, Glasgow,               o'clock, on Tuesday the 28th cur
                      at twelve
rent, when samples of the raw material and prepared gum
extract shall he shown you ; directions given how to prepare
it, as well as information from whence a sufficient supply of
the raw material is to be had.
    My life has, in a great measure, been spent in pursuits
which appeared to me calculated to advance the manufac
 tures, commerce, and agriculture of my country : to the
attainment of these objects, it is well known, I have sacrificed
what fortune I possessed.       It would therefore be affectation
in me to say, that I am independent of such pecuniary re
compense as the communication offered to be made may be
thought deserving of.    This I leave to yourselves, and to the
other calico printers and consumers of gum in Great Britain
and sreland.     Exclusive of any considerations personal to
myself,  it gives me satisfaction that I have been able to
render you irdependent of foreign nations for the supply of
an article so indispensably necessary for your manufacture,
and that at a rate not exceeding               i-i
                                          2th part of the present
price of gum Senegal.
                             I am, gentlemen,

   AT     a meeting of calico printers, called bv public adver
 tisement, to consider of a plan of recompense to the earl of
 Dundonald, for laying open, in the. handsome manner he
 has done, his discovery of a substitute for gum Senegal and
 other gums, James M'Dowall, Esq. in the chair, the meet
 ing came unanimously to the following resolutions:
     1ft, That the discovery of the use ot lichen, &c. as sub         a
 stitute for gum,     likely to be of great advantage to calico
                      is
 printers, and of national importance.
     adly, That Lord Dundonald should be liberally rewarded
 for that discovery    and that an annual sum per table, and
                       ;
 presses  that use gum,     considered
                               is              by
                                         the meeting as the best
 and most certain method of recompense.

           Process for extracting a Gum from Lichens.           395
 Statement    of the Benefits and Advantages to ensue to Indi
    viduals and to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
    Ireland, from Lord Dundonald's Discovery of extracting
    Gum from the Lichen' or Tree Muji, as a Subjtitute for
    Gum Senegal and other foreign Gums.
    GUM      Senegal, or other foreign gums, have hitherto been
indispensably    requisite for printing fine goods, and those of
light shades   of colour.
    No proper substitute had been found to answer for this part
of calico printing until Lord Dundonald discovered the pre
paring gum from the lichen.
    Gum Senegal, and foreign gums, are at times scarce, and
 difficult to be procured.
    The settlement of Senegambia belongs to the French:
they have a monopoly of gum Senegal. The price since the
war has risen from 1,50/. to 400^. per ton.
    Gum from the lichen may, all charges included, be pre
pared at 1- 14th part of the present price of gum Senegal,
and at i-6th of the peace-time price.
    The united kingdoms may now be said to be independent
 of foreign states for the gum requisite for their manufactures,
such as calico printing, preparation of ink, staining and ma
nufacture of paper, dressing and stiffening silks, &c. &c.
 And, in consequence of Lord Dundonald's discovery, large-
 sums of monev, formerly lent abroad for the purchase of
 gum, will, in future, be saved.
    Starch and wheaten flour have hitherto been used as cheap
 substitutes for gum in printing coarse goods, or to fix on other
 printed goods, the mordants, and some of the dveina mate
 rials, for deep (hades of colour.     Cut there is nov reason to
 expect,   as gum   from   the lichen will cost less than those arti
 cles, particularly starch, it will be used in their stead, and so
 prove the means of saving or (economizing a considerable
 portion of wheat and wheaten Hour at present consumed in.
 calico printing.
    The collecting the lichen from the forest and fruit trees
 and hedges, will give employment to a number of poor
 people, principally women and children.
     A cheap supply of. gum from the lichen may, perhaps, in.
 several manufactures, lupersede the use of the higher priced
 article of glue or size, which often has a very disagreeable,
 smell.
     Gum from the lichen may, perhaps, be used as a dressing
 |n weaving, particularly fine goods, either by itself or when
                                  T4                           wade.

2,96       Process  for extracting a Gum from Lichens.
made into a kind      of soap, according to directions given in a
separate publication.
   Lastly, It is probable that all       the benefits to ensue from
the discovery of procuring gum from the lichen may not yet
have occurred, it being well known that there is no art or
discovery that is not the parent or sister of some other.

                                  Lichen or Tree Moss, &c.
     ITdoes not appear, from such trials as Lord Dundonald
has hitherto made, that there is any very great difference in
the produce of gum from the lichen collected from different
trees or shrubs : all of them answer equally well for yielding
a gum sit for calico priming.     The lichen is most abundant
on the trees which grow in a poor, stiff clay soil, particularly
if situated at some considerable height above sea level. It
should be pulled in dry weather, otherwise it is apt to break
in the pulling; besides, in this case, requiring to be dried
before it can with safetv be laid up in the storehouse, where,
if put in dry, it may be kept for years.      Should a sufficient
quantity ot it not be sound in this country, it may be had
in almost unlimited abundance in Sweden, Norway, and in
 the northern parts of America, where it grows to the length
 of from a foot to eighteen inches, and pressing the branches
 of the tree by its weight. There                   is,
                                         however, every reason to
 believe that   sufficient
                        a  quantity   to  be had in this country.

every fourth year.
  The lichen does              not consist entirely of gummy matter.
                                                                  a

   The first process in preparing gum from the lichen             to            is
free  itof the outer skin of the plant and the resinous matter.
This      done
          is        scalding the lichen two or three times with
                            by
boiling   water,  allowing     to remain it  long            so

                                         gemly boiling the lichen
for about Ht'teen or twenty minutes, then washing            in cold       it
water, laying       afterwards upon
                            it         stone or brick floor, where

it should lie tor ten or twelve hours, or perhaps more.         The
reason for this                   is,
                         that the exposure for that tirrle to air
*greatly facilitates the subsequent extraction of the gum.

   298       Process  for extracting a Gum from Lichens.
     The   scalded lichen is then to be put into a copper boiler
  with a   due proportion of water, fay three Scotch pints, or
  two wine gallons, to every pound of lichen, and boiled during
  four or five hours, adding about half an ounce or three quar
 ters of an ounce of soda or pearl-ashes for every pound of
 lichen; or, instead of these salts, about half an English pint
  of volatile alkali. The boiling should be continued until the
 liquor acquires a considerable degree of gummy consistence.
  It is then to be taken out of the boiler, allowed to drain or
 drip through a wire or hair cloth, or searse.     The residuum
 to be put into a hair cloth bag or bags, and to be squeezed
 in a press similar to that which is used by the melters or
 rinders of tallow.
     The first boiling does not extract the whole of the gum.
 The lichen should be boiled a second and even a third time,
 repeating the process as above described, diminishing at each
 process the quantity of water and the quantity of alkali, which
 a little experience will soon point out.   When three boilings
 are employed, the gummy extract of the last boiling should
 be kept for the first boiling of a fresh batch of lichen.    The
 extract proceeding from the first and second boilings should
 be mixed together, and evaporated to the consistence neces
 sary for block or press printing.       The evaporating vessels
 should be of tin or thin lead, placed over a range of stoves,
 and moderately heated by fire or the steam of water. It has
 been neglected to state, that before evaporating the gummy
 extract to the consistence necessary, it should be kept ten or
 twelve hours, so as to allow the sediment or dregs to subside.
The clear liquor may either be drawn off by a syphon, or the
dregs may be drawn off by a cock at the bottom of the
wooden vessel ; the bottom of which stiould be made sloping,
 higher at the back than the fore part, in order that the dregs
may run more completely off.          The proportion of gummy
matter remaining in the dregs may be got off by mixing
them with a due proportion of boiling water, allowing the
liquor to clear, and proceeding as above directed, employing
this weak solution for boiling the next batch of lichen.
    The residuum ot the lichen, after the third boiling, con
sists of a matter somewhat analogous to that of animal mat
ter, together with a proportion of the fibrous matter of the
plant. From the animal matter a kind of soap may be made,
The process is as follows :
    Let a small proportion of pounded resin be dissolved by
toiling in a solution of alkaline salts. When the resin is
dissolved, put in a certain quantity of the residuum of the
lichen, and continue the boiling until this last article is pretty
                                                             wel\

 half of white soap, shaved down or cut into thin slices, to
  every ten pounds weight of the residuum of the lichen. Con
 tinue the boiling until the white soap is fully dissolved. Then
 pass the soapy solution through a hair sieve or hair bag.       Let
 the soap pan then be cleaned out, and the soapy solution re-,
 turned to the pan, to be boiled to the consistence necessary.
 A kind of soap very similar to this may be made from sea
 weed, as well as from several other articles. Of this and of
 other matters highly important to calico printers, a more full
 and detailed account will be given in a future publication.
 When gum from the lichen is to he employed for making
 ink, manufacturing and staining paper, and for stiffening
 silks, crapes, and gauzes, it should be extracted from the
 lichen without employing any alkaline salts, continuing the
 boiling or digestion longer, and with a moderate degree of
 heat, in which cafe the gummy extract will be nearly co
 lourless. When volatile alkali is used, the boiler should be
 of iron, as volatile alkali a6ts on copper.

      HE      oxygenated      muriatic acid has the property of
whitening paper        without   altering iis texture. Chaptal first
made known the process for this purpose, which is valuable
for restoring old books, and prints stained with smoke.         His
process    has even been executed, with astonishing success, by
Vialard and Heudier : when the lewes are not too much de
composed by time, the oxygenated liquor or the acid gas is
employed.        Immersion in the liquor is to be preferred, as
being more expeditious.

     Bleaching     by the oxygenated    Muriatic Acid and Pota/h.
   The suffocating emanation of the gas has rendered it neces
sary to employ potash in the liquor; Dut this mixture, though
it enabled the workmen to manage the stuffs without incon
venience, occasioned an outlay of money for the alkali, and
weakened      the detersive quality of the oxygenated muriatic
acid.    It is a fact well known, that a solution of oxygenated
muriate of potash does not bleach goods, yet it differs from
the oxygenated muriatic acid ley only by having the alkali in
it: it is, then, incontestable that the acid liquor loses its pro
perty of destroying the colouring matter of vegetables in pro
portion as it is neutralized by potash.
   Notwithstanding the truth of this observation, it is proper
to fay a few words respecting the method of composing this
ley: the proportion of the alkali in general          is,
               parts (in weight) of sea salt,

     This method was first thought of in Ireland.         The sub
 stance employed is the oxygenated muriatic acid combined, as
 we have said, with earthy or saline bases. Calcareous earths,
 such as lime and chalk, are those used in general ; magnesia
 is too dear, and the rarity of barytes and strontian will ex
 clude them for some time from our manufactories.              A  di
 stilling apparatus of lead, such as we have already alluded to,
  (p. 259,) is employed.      A  tube /, (fee Plate IV. the lower
 most figure) three inches in diameter, rises from the top of
 the alembic gg, and proceeds to the bottom of a leaden re
 servoir m, capable of containing about 15 gallons, two-thirds
 of which are filled with water. Another tube n, of the fame
 dimensions, also of lead, the orifice of which is above the
 level of the water, rises from the reservoir m, and enters the
 tub 0, e, in which the liquid oxy-muriatc of lime is prepared.
 This tub must be large enough to contain twelve barrels, or
  about 1500 (English) gallons of water: -80 pounds of lime,
  flaked in the air and well pulverized, is introduced into it:
 .the sides of this tub are furnished with {helves or a grating,
  qqq, which projects in the inside, 'while the arms of the agi
  tator t, to which a rotatory motion is communicated, move
  between the shelves, and constantly stir the liquor: this dis
  position is indispensable to prevent the lime from being pre
  cipitated before its saturation, and to present, by renewing
  them, the greatest number of surfaces possible to the action
  of the acid gas. The use of the intermediate reservoir, m, is
  to arrest the portion of the muriatic acid gas which escapes
  during the commencement of the operation without being
  oxygenated, and also any sulphuric acid which may chance
  to pass, and which would hurt the process if it were suffered
   to be introduced into the tub 0, 0.     The property which the

 muriatic acid has of easily combining with water, facilitates
 its condensation by the intermediate reservoir.
    By drawing out a little os the ley from time to time one
 may know when the liquor in the tub is saturated;         When
 it suffers the lime introduced to be precipitated, the operation
 is terminated. This oxy-muriate of lime is drawn off from
 its deposit, and it is then fufficienily concentrated to be em
 ployed for bleaching when diluted with three times its volume
 of water.
   This liquor is found to be preferable to the oxygenated
muriatic acid and potasti.   At the great bleach-fields in Ire
land, four leys of potash are applied alternately with four
weeks exposure on the grass, two immersions in the oxygen
ated muriate of lime, a ley of potash between the two, and
the exposure of a week on the grass between each ley and
the immersions.      During summer, two leys and fifteen days
exposure are sufficient to prepare cloth for the action of the
oxygenated    muriate; then three alternate leys, with immer
sions in the liquor, will be sufficient for complete bleaching :
nothing then will be necessary but to wind the cloth through
the sulphuric acid.
                Bleaching   by calcareous    Sulphuret.
    In all  the processes for bleaching which I have hitherto
 described it is seen that potafli acts a distinguished part, either
 as an auxiliary or a principal agent.        To find a detersive sub
 stance which might be a substitute for              was an object of
                                                     it,
 the utmost importance.         Kirwan suspected that      itwould be
 found in the sulphuret of lime, and his opinion was con
 firmed    byHiggins.
    Repeated trials, and the most evident success, have proved
the advantage of employing this method, and the possibility
of bleaching completely     by   condensing the muriatic acid with
the sulphuret instead of potafli. The process with the sul
phuret of lime    is   attended with some advantages peculiar to
itself. In the first place, quicklime and crude sulphur are
matters which can be procured at            a  cheap rate, especially
when the latter enters into the mixture in small quantity           :
secondly, their combination      is  effected in the easiest and most
expeditious   manner,    and  may   be  comprehended    and executed
by any   common      workman :     the  application being then made
by   immersing   the  cloths  cold,  there  is   a complete saving of
fuel, and no riskis  incurred either from the ignorance or negli
gence of the workman, as the ley does no injury to the stuffs.
    The sulphuret of lime   is  prepared in the following manner;

flaked lithe sifted, and 16 gallons of water. When the whole
is well mixed, it must be kept in a state of ebullition for half
an hour, strongly stirring it several times.  When the ebul-
lition subsides, the solution of the sulphuret becomes clear 3
the liquor mav be drawn off from the insoluble deposit by
means of a syphon #. The liquor will have the colour almost
of small beer, but is not quite so transparent.
    Sixteen gallons of water must still be poured over the de
posit,   to take away entirely the remaining sulphuret. When
the liquor becomes clear,            must first be well shaken,)
                                        (it

drawn off and mixed with the former: to this mixture of the
two liquors 33 gallons of water are to be added, in order to
reduce    it to the degree of strength necessary for the immersion
of cloth.
    Making allowance for the water evaporated, and for that
retained       by
                the precipitate, there ought to remain 60 gallons
of liquor produced        bythe four pounds of sulphur.
    The cloth freed from the weaver's drefiing must then be
immersed for twelve or thirteen hours in the solution of suU
phuret, and be then rinsed in running water. When dry,
it   isimmersed for twelve or fourteen nours in              solution of

it  must then be washed and dried as before.             The operation
must be repeated fix different times; that                to fay, there

the sulphuret, and supported the proof of being boiled with
soap better than others        ;though the latter had acquired in

appeared after six or seven days exposure on the grass.

 not deserve to be taken into consideration.     Cloths immersed
in the solphuret, and then boiled in a ley of potash, and af
 terwards introduced into the oxygenated liquor, are whiter
 than after they have been subjected to two immersions in the
 solphuret, and been made to pass through the ley : thus the
 two substances seemed desirous of co-operating.        Two suc
 cessive immersions, however, in the solphuret, before
                                                            bein^
 immersed in the oxygenated liquor, produced a better effect
                                                                •
 than one immersion ; which is not the cafe with potash.
    It is of importance to observe, that stuffs are always and
 invariably thicker and more swelled up when they come from
 the solphuret of lime than after they have been subjected to
 the ley of potash; and they continue to retain these qualities
 even after they have been washed, and dried on the grass.
 The solphuret opens the fibres of the cloth better and more
 speedily than potash, by softening them, and rather by mak
 ing them swell up, than by dissolving the extracto-mucous or
 colouring matter. This may serve to explain why potash
 produces a better effect on cloth when it has been before
 immersed in a solution of solphuret of lime.
    The proprietors of bleach-fields, who persist in not making
 use of the oxygenated     muriatic acid, but who bleach in the
 Open   air, may perhaps  derive some advantages from this pro
 cess, if they use solphuret of lime and potash either con
jointly or separately.    The advantage and saving of expense
 which result from solphuret of lime are evident : for ten years
 the price of soda and potash has been excessively dear, and
has always increased.      In all Europe, at present, the latter
 article costs about 70 francs (about 2/. 18 s.) per hundred
weight; and soda is nearly a third less. Sulphur may be
estimated at 25 or 30 francs ; on the other hand, lime, as it
is every where found, costs very little; the price of this de
tersive liquor, therefore, will become so low that we have no
coin small enough to represent the value of a quart of it. The
truth of this fact will appear by a comparison with the price
of common ley.
    At large bleach-fields the ley is made by dissolving four
pounds of potash, or six pounds of soda, in 60 gallons of
water : some employ a little more : but four pounds of potash
at 70 cents, make two francs 80 cents., and a like quantity
of sulphur at 25 cents, makes one franc : but this is not all,
as there is a saving in fuel as well as of materials ; no more
is required than the quantity necessary for boiling eight gal
lons of water, while the common ley requires that 64 sliould
be brought to the state of ebullition.     The time requisite for
heating    this mass of  water  presents also  a saviug which is
                                                               far

far from being a matter, of indifference in a large establish
ment.     To this we mav add, that in the application of these
detersive liquors the cloth must be boiled at least seven hours
Sn the alkaline ley, while the solution of sulphuret of lime
requires only half an hour; and even if we suppose that pot-
afli shall continue to be used along with the sulphuret of lime,
as is the cafe at present in Ireland, the saving will be still
very considerable.
                     Ble.sching  <with Steam.
    The different processes which we have hitherto described
form almost an historical abridgement of the art of bleaching.
 We have followed the progress of the human mind; and,
indeed, a plain account of the various processes and different
kinds of apparatus sufficiently stiows what service has been
rendered to this important art by modern chemistry.
    But it still remains to make known a new method, for
which we are indebted to Chaptal.        This respectable chemist
published, about two years ago, a notice respecting the method
of bleaching by steam ; a process brought to us from the Le
vant some time after the introduction of that for dyeing
Adrianople red, and which is now used in the south of
 France under the name of blancbiment a la fum'se. Till the
 period when Chaptal was Ib disinterested as to disclose it to
the public, it was a secret the knowledge of which was con
 fined to a certain number of manufacturers.           It was em
 ployed only for bleaching cotton and cotton thread after the
 manner of the orientals ; but C. Chaptal foresaw, with his
 usual acuteness, the possibility of applying this method to
 bleaching linen and hemp thread; and he invited manufac
 turers to adopt this process, hi order to improve it and extend
 its use.
    ChaptaPs invitation excited several manufacturers both in
 France and in foreign countries.       Almost at the fame time,
 the effects of the new method of bleaching were tried in the
 neighbourhood of Paris and in Ireland : the apparatus seen
 at the cotton manufactory of C. liawens, at Bons-Hommes,
 near Passy, gives the most astonishing results.     It can bleach
 from two to three thousand yards of cotton cloth per day, at
 a price so moderate, and with such facility, that no other
 process can be compared to it.       The first experiment which
 he tried was made on fifteen hundred vards of cloth destined
 for being printed : it exhibited no blemish or shade, but was
 all equally white.
    His apparatus has a perfect resemblance to that described
 by Chaptal, and which mav' be employed exceedingly well

side of the boiler, indicates the height of the ley and the state
of its exhaustion. The boiler         isheated in the usual manner,
or     by
        Count Rumford's plan.
 I    caused to be constructed at Troyes another apparatus
destined for bleaching hosiery.          As these articles cannot be
unrolled, and as heaping them together might impede the
action of the vapour,       I employed frame3 covered with cloth,
and placed at the distance of four inches above each other.
On these the hosiery was deposited in such             manner, that
                                                       a
the vapour, in rising from the boiler, might penetrate            in        it
every part, destroy the colouring matter, and bleach           com    it
pletely.
   Some new observations          induced me to propose for the
winding of cloth       aroller, which might be immersed at plea
sure     in
         the boiler    in order to moisten the cloth from time to
time.    All these kinds of apparatus will be explained here
after.
      Having thusspoken of the instruments employed           this         in
new art,    shall examine the principles on which
              I                                            found it   is
ed, and describe the best method of bleaching       this process.

we intimately acquainted with the nature of potash and soda*
we might be able to explain the cause of this burning ; but it
is sufficient for us at present to know the ejsetl.        The ex
posure     of vegetable matters  on  the  grafs subjects them to
the action of the solar rays ; and moistening them during
 their exposure facilitates, with the vaporization of the water,
 the emanation of the carbonic acid formed by the oxygen of
 the atmosphere, which combines with the carbon resulting
 from the alkaline combustion.        It even agrees pretty well
 with theory, in terminating the process of bleaching, to im
 merse the cloth and thread in sour milk, acidulous liquors,
 or, what is more convenient, very weak sulphuric acid.
     In proportion as the alkali, during the first immersion,
 destroys the colouring matter, the oxygen of the atmosphere,
 or that furnished by the oxygenated muriatic acid, joins that
 carbonized matter, and forms carbonic acid, which after
 wards resolves itself into gas.    This is contained the more
 in the principles, as the bases of all the acids are insoluble in
 water; but when the combination takes place between the
 carbon and the oxygen, it immediately becomes soluble.
 Thus, on the one hand, to burn the colouring matter, and
 to dissove it on the other, form the whole secret of the art
 of bleaching ; and the greater or less tendency of vegetable
 substances to experience      that combustion constitutes       the
 gradations of their whiteness, and the facility or difficulty of
  bleaching.
     The slowness of the old processes arose, in a great measure,
  from bleachers being unacquainted with these principles.
  A long succession of leys, and exposure on the grass, was
  necessary to penetrate the fibres of the linen from stratum to
  stratum. The texture was sufficiently close to resist the action
  of the heat of a common ley ; and a considerable time was
  required to absorb the oxygen presented by the delicate stra
  tum of atmospheric air.
      In the process of bleaching by steam, these difficulties are
   removed. The high temperature of the steam in the interior
   part of the apparatus swells up the fibres of the thread or
   cloth; the pure alkali, which rises with the elastic fluid, seize*
   with avidity on the colouring matter, and burns it : seldom
  does the tissue of the flax or hemp resist the penetrating effect
  of this vapour bath. The whole matter, therefore, by which
   they are coloured is attacked and decomposed by this single
  operation ; and even if we suppose that a part has been able
   to resist, nothing is necessary but to repeat the operation,
  after a previous immersion and exposure on the grass, to in
  sure its complete effect.     The alkali even appears to have
                                                             a much

a much livelier and more caustic action, when it is combined
with caloric, than in ordinary leys, where the temperature
never rises above 162° F.: for a ley of one degree of strength,
at most, by the areometer,      is sufficient for the steam appa
ratus, and, in general, half a degree will be enough.            By
making the cloth or thread pass through one ley of oxygen
ated muriatic acid or oxygenated muriate of lime, an union.
is effected between the solution and the carbon arising from
the burning of the extracto- mucous matter of the flax; car
bonic acid is formed; the water, even, in which this new
compound is diluted concurs to promote this combination :
if the cloth be then exposed on the grass, the carbonic acid
is dissipated, and the cloth is bleached.
    It was believed that the steam of a pure alkaline ley would
not be caustic, and would not produce the fame effects as
the saline solution ; and the reason assigned for this opinion
was, the concentration of all the salts by the evaporation of
the aqueous fluid t but what takes place in the open air,
where the atmosphere every moment absorbs the moisture
which is evaporated, cannot be applied 10 a close apparatus,
where the temperature is elevated in an extreme degree : be
sides, the caloric always carries with it a little alkali even in*
low temperatures, as is observed when water is poured over
potafli ; the steam which issues from it changes blue vege
table colours green.
    It is asserted that in India cloth is bleached by the steam of
lime water, and that the Indians brought to France by ad
miral dc Sussrein employed this method. To us, however, it
would appear very strange, if it really succeeded, that it should
 have been so long neglected.        In theory, we find nothing
that can warrant such an operation, except that the vapour,
which issues from quicklime when staked, changes the colour
of vecetables exposed to its action : on this account alone the
fact Jescrves to be put to the test of experiment.
     It follows, from these chemical principles, that the action
 alone of steam does not bleach, and that the concurrence of
oxygen is necessary to aid the composition of the carbonic acid :
 this acid requires for its formation 28 parts of carbon, satu
rated with 72 of oxygen ; but all the oxygen contained in the
 apparatus     would not be sufficient to saturate the considerable
quantity of colouring matter burnt by the alkaline combus
 tion and converted into carbon : this deficit must be supplied
 by immersion in any oxygenated liquor whatever, and the
 dispersion of the elastic fluid thus formed must be then faci
 litated by exposure on the grass.

raw cotton cloth and thread ought to be subjected in order to
bleach them by this new method ; and I (hall begin with
that of Chaptal, whose apparatus I have before mentioned.
   The cotton, disposed in haiulfuls, must first be impregnated
with a slight solution of soda rendered caustic by lime. This
operation is performed in a wooden or stone trough, in which
the cotton is trod down by mean^of the feet covered with wooden
shoes.     When the alkaline liquor has uniformly penetrated
the cotton, it is put into the boiler, and piled up on the wooden
grate before mentioned ; the redundant liquor runs through
the bars into the copper boiler, and forms a stratum of liquid,
which permits the mass to be heated without any danger of
burning either the cotton or the metal. To form the alka
line ley, Alicant soda equal to a tenth of the weight of the
cotton subjected to the operation is employed, and in a boiler
such as that the dimensions of which I have given, about
800 pounds of cotton may be put at one time. The ley is
generally of two degrees by the areometer.                As soon as the
cotton is introduced into                     it,

    To bleach cloth, it        must be immersed       in the same manner
 in  a  flight alkalino-eauliic       solution marking two degrees by
 the areometer.         I here suppose that the cloth has been sub
jected     to  the necessary    preparations to free it from the dress
 ing, according       to   the   instructions I gave when speaking of
 flax and hemp.
     While the cloth is immersed, and impregnating itself with
 the alkaline liquor, the boiler is filled to the height of a foot
 with a ley of equal strength.              This may be done by means
 of a bent leaden funnel ; but the door is large enough to pour
 it in, by taking it up from the tub with buckets : the work
 man then enters the apparatus, and sixes the end of a piece
 of cloth, with packthread, to one of the amis of the furthest
 reel A, sig. 1. (Plate V.) while another -workman without
 turns it till the whole piece is rolled up: he then fixes a se
 cond piece, tacking it to the former, if this operation has not
 been done before ; then rolls it up, and continues in this
 manner till eighteen or twenty pieces are rolled up. He then
 throws the extremity of the last piece which remains over
 the roller B, near the arch ; conveys it under the two lower
 rollers C,D, in the copper EEE; then makes it pass over
 the other roller F, placed near the arch of the apparatus;
 and at last sixes it to one of the arms of the reel G.                  The
 workman ascertains the height of the liquor in the inside by
 means of the regulator II, and immediately flmts the cock ;
 after which he surrounds the door K with ,old rags or tow,
 and sixes it strongly in its place by screws, which serve to
 check and prevent the escape os the steam.                  The sire being
 kindled, and the heat increased to that of boiling water, the
 workman winds up the cloth, beginning with that reel which
 was empty, until it is entirely charged with it; he then
 lowers the cranks of the rollers C,D, to immerse the cloth
 in the boiling liquor, speedily winds it off, rolling it up on
 the reel which has been emptied, unhooks the lower rollers,
 and winds back the cloth in another direction without im
 mersing it in the liquor.           At the end of two hours, more
or less according to the fineness of the stuffs, the alkali car
 ried up by the caloric will have completely penetrated the
 fibres of the cloth, swelled by the extraordinary heat of the
 steam.       The sire is then slackened ; and when the apparatus
is sufficiently cold the door is opened, and preparation is
made for immersing the cloth in the oxygenated muriate of
lime *. Care midi be taken, in order to shorten the mani
 pulation, to charge in the last winding the reel near the door :

  In manufactories of printed cottons, when it is intended
to print various figures by means of mordants, they are made
to pass through madder, and a combination is formed be-
tween the mordant or base and the colouring matter *. The,
alum used by calico printers is applied to the cloth by means
of blocks : after it has been dissolved, by a process foreign to
this memoir, in vinegar (acetous acid)/ it suffers to be depo
sited on the stuff the earthy base, and thus renders it proper
for combining with the colouring matter : the strong affinity
which exists between that matter and the base (mordant)
causes the cloth, when it passes through the madder, to as
sume different shades : however, as some of the colour ad
heres, though weakly, in the places destitute of the base, it
must be removed by repeated boilings with bran or cow's
dung, and exposure on the grass.
    As one of the properties of the oxygenated muriatic acid
is to brighten colours, its agency has been employed in va
 rious cafes.    The process of bleaching by steam makes no
 change in the old dispositions, but only shortens the labour,
 especially   when its action- is combined with oxygenated
 liquors.
    After being made to pass through madder, and lying for a
 short time on the grass, the cloth is exposed to the vapour
 bath; then immersed in very dilute oxygenated liquor; and,
 in the last place, exposed on the grass again. Great care                          is.

of the arts, since it   is
                   as nonsensical            as the expression oilof  vitriol
                                                                            isabsurd
when employed as the synonyme of sulphuric acid.            The dyers formerly
employed saline solutions, in which thty immersed their stud's, thinking
that the action of this salt served to bite, as it were, the substance of them,
and to enlarge their pores, and, according to this idea, they gave them the
name of mordants (or biters). At present, when these effects enn be better
explained,        much to be wished that the word base were substituted for

a proportional distance from each other.                   After the steaming
it  must    be   immersed       in  a   ley  of  oxygenated muriatic acid,
and    should    be   then     put   into   bags to be rinsed in running
water   :  it is next   to    be   exposed to the light, spread out on
large sheets: in the last place, it must be made to pass
through sulphuric acid, and the matter will then have ac
quired the most beautiful degree of whiteness possible to be
given to it.
   The property which the oxygenated muriatic acid has,
when in the state of gas, of expelling the carbonic acid from
its saline combinations, a property which it does not possess
in the liquid state, gives reason to believe, that if the pulp,
aster being subjectedto the vapour a second time, were ex
posed in an apparatus or chamber where it might be subjected
to the action of the gas, the carbonic acid formed by-the
carbon arising from the burning of the colouring matter in
the first ley, and by the oxygen which combined itself to it
during the immersion in the oxygenated liquor,) would be
expelled from the combination                   which might have been
formed during       the  second     ley,   and   the rags would be imme
diately   bleached     without       having   recourse     to exposure on the
grass.     In  all cafes   it  must   be  observed     that  this process pre
sents an incalculable advantage, by pointing out the means
of employing the coarsest and dirtiest cloth and rags to be
converted into pulp of the first quality : besides, this process
combines ceconomy with speed.                   It is to be remarked, that
in using two leys it is of essential importance to rinse the rags
when taken from the first : their fibres are then more re-;
laxed, and their distension permits the water to carry away
and dissolve the dirt and colouring matter attacked by th»f
alkaline vapour: in the last place, they must be made to pass
through acidulous water in order to expel, by the action of
sulphuric acid, the acid of the oxygenated muriate of potash
from its combination with the alkali.                   I must here also call
the attention of the intelligent manufacturer to the employ
ment of the refuse arising from the beating and heckling of
hemp and flax : these substances, treated by this method,
would furnish valuable materials for the fabrication of paper*.
   The reader will recollect that, about eight years ago, a
proposal was made for regenerating old paper by employing
it again in the manufacturing of new. Tins process, which
has been repeated with success, was neglected                      in France,
while it was received with interest in foreign countries.                   At
present    we    must  assert   our   right  to   this  discovery,  and  prove
the possibility of rendering it useful by employing the effect
of the alkalino-causlic vapour.

   When the old paper, soiled, has been exposed, in an appa-
Tatus with frames, to the action of the steam of boiling water
alone for twelve hours, it is subjected to slight trituration
under a cylinder ; it is then immersed in a strong alkalino-
caustic ley ; it is well pounded in the tub, that it may be
strongly impregnated; and it is introduced a second time into
the apparatus, the boiler of which must also be filled with
the ley. The pulp, after being exposed to a vapour bath for
ten or twelve hours, is taken out and pressed, that the alka
line liquor which runs off may not be lost : it must then be
put into bags to be beaten, and rinsed in running water j after
which it is subjected to trituration under the cylinder till it
has acquired the proper decree of whiteness.         it be neces If
sary to give the utmost brilliancy to the white, it will be suf

an excellent method, as it completely renews the surfaces,

When it is requisite to render the cloth' fit for certain mar
kets, it is necellarv to give it a bluei(h tint, which is done by

                           CONCLUSION.
  A    plain comparison of the process of bleaching by steam
with   the others above described will prove its greatTuperiority
 in regard to saving of time, materials, fuel, and manipula
tions, independently of the advantage of not injuring the
stuffs : but there is still an application of this principle highly
important, which concerns all classes of society — I mean the
Weaching of linen.      Here no other agent is required than
 the mere action of steam ; an agent much more powerful and
more efficacious than the leys and soapy water employed by
washerwomen.       This process presents also the invaluable ad
 vantage of preserving the linen longer, as it is not necessary
to rub it with violence, which is done in the usual manipu
lations merely to save soap and ashes. An apparatus similar
to that at Troyes, on the frames of which the linen might
be placed, and then exposed to the steam of ley of & fourth of
a degree only, would be sufficient to dissolve completely the
impurities with which it is charged ; and by then rinsing it
in running water, or in water slightly saponaceous, all the
dirt would be removed, and complete whiteness obtained.
   It belongs to public functionaries to adopt this process,
and to apply it in hospitals and other establishments,       where
it would be attended with a considerable Caving.
   I shall observe before I conclude, that experience must de
cide whether the apparatus I propose for bleaching woollen
cloth and stuffs by the vapour of ammonia, might not be
employed as well as the other kinds of apparatus for pleaching
linen cloth.    The condensed steam, by again returning into
the boiler, affords the means of totally exhausting the ley,
and of using the very last portion of the alkaline substances.

 serve to oppose the motion occasioned                    by the agitator,

 XLIX.     Observations on the    Oil extratled from    the Female
     Cornel or Dog-berry Tree,     the Cornus    sanguinca of Lin
    næus, Class 4tb; Tetrandria Monogynia.           By C. Mar-
     oueron, of the Hospital for Military inJlrucHon at
    Strafburgb *.
   A HE     cornus fanguinea of Linnæus,      a shrub much sought
 after by gardeners for the fake of ornament, both on account
 of its figure and of the beautiful red colour assumed by its
 stem, branches, and leaves, towards the end of summer bears
 a berry which, when in a state of maturity, has a blackisti
 colour, and of which the utility in medicine as well as in
 the arts has been hitherto unknown.
    The fat and unctuous appearance exhibited by these berries
 when bruised between the singers inclined me to think that
 they might contain an oil possessed, no doubt, of some pecu
 liar properties. Fully persuaded of this truth, that nothing
 which Nature has produced is useless, I engaged C. Che-
 vreuse, a gardener and botanist at Molsheim, in the depart
 ment of the Lower Rhine, where this shrub grows in great
 abundance, to collect a quantity of the berries.
    Ten kilogrammes (22 pounds English) were collected and
 spread out in a barn, not to be dried, but to make them as-
 time a softer consistence : in this state they were reduced to
 a paste, and subjected to the press.        Without the assistance
 of heat I obtained about two litres (2? wine pints) of a fat
unctuous liquid, having a viscosity similar to that of oil, a
green though very bright colour, and perfect homogeneity,
as well as all the other physical properties of real oil, and
without any disagreeable odour or taste; which determined
C. Chevreuse and myself to eat of it in salad, which we did
several times without experiencing any inconvenience.
    But as these different properties were not sufficient to make
this liquid be considered as a real oil, I thought it my duty
to subject it to various experiments, of which the following
is the result :
    A drop of this oily liquid, thrown into a vessel filled with:
water, extended itself into a very thin pellicle, reflecting the
prismatic colours.
    Being desirous to know whether it would be possible to
deprive this oiry product of its green colour, I washed it in
cold and hot water, charged with sulphate of alumine (alum),

powder of slate, pulverized charcoal,       &c:   but all these means
were attended     with  no  effect ; the  above   liquids did not be
come in      the  least coloured,    and  the green colour of the oil
still remained the fame.
    Alcohol was also employed.           As this vehicle     assumed a
greenish    tint, I thought I mould         be able    by its means to
carry off   the colouring matter ; and I added         to a portion of
the alcohol thus coloured, a certain quantity of water.           The
mixture immediately became colourless, and some drops of
oil floated on the surface of it. Having evaporated in an
alembic another portion of this coloured alcohol, the alcohol
I obtained was without colour, and there remained a portion
of the oil, having the fame colour as before : the alcohol,
then, was indebted for its colour to a solution of a portion of
the oil, and not to a separation of the colouring matter.
    Sulphur combined perfectly with this oil by the aid of
caloric.     There resulted from this combination a real balsam
of sulphur of a dark red colour inclining to brown, and of a
very foetid odour.
    Potash, soda, and ammonia, formed with this oil real soap
more or less solid.
    Concentrated sulphuric acid combined with this oil pro
duced a real acid soap of a yellowish colour, having the ap
pearance    of resin.
    The nitric and muriatic acids, cold, had no sensible action
on this oil, but they assumed a slight green colour.
    The nitric acid heated with this oil made it assume a solid
consistence, and a yellow colour perfectly similar to that of
citrine ointment : during the ebullition there was a consider
able swelling, disengagement of nitrous gas, &c. The theory
of this operation being well known, I shall forbear saying any

    Not having been able to procure nitrous acid, it was im
possible for me to ascertain the inflammability of this oil with
acids.
     In boiling this oil for some time over litharge, it acquired
the drying property which rendered it proper for painting 5
 a property it possessed before its oxygenation, but in a less
degree than after it.
     By continuing the ebullition the oxide of lead became de,-
 oxidated, and was totally dissolved;          the mixture assumed
 consistence,    and a brown colour perfectly similar to that of

     The  fame experiment was repeated, taking care to add
 water, and to stir the mixture continually, as is done in re
                                                                   gard

described by C. Deyeux, I shall not say any thing of it here.
    I subjected a portion of this oil to the contact of the atmo
spheric air, and found that at the end of some time it had
assumed a little more consistence.
    The same experiment was repeated, but with the addition
of water, taking the precautions prescribed by BertholleL
At the end of a month the oil had assumed a solid consist
ence, and a white colour similar to that of wax.
    Being desirous to ascertain, in the last place, of what use
this oil might be in domestic œconomy, I filled with it a
lamp containing a cotton wick, which, when lighted, gave a
strong and beautiful light, without smoke or any sensible
smell ; the same lamp, containing a wick of the same kind,
was successively filled with olive oil and rapeseed oil; the
latter lasted two hours, the olive oil two hours and a quarter*
and that of the cornus sanguinea two hours and a half.
    If we add to these different experiments the property which
this oily liquid has of not freezing, we shall have all the cha
racters of the oil of the cornus sanguinea.                       >
    From these experiments, the only ones possible for me to
make, there is reason to conclude, that the oily juice obtained
by expression from the berries of the cornus sanguinea is a
real oil possessing certain properties which may render it use
ful to the arts, to commerce, and even to medicine.          I am
of opinion also that, according to the principles of Fourcroy,
it ought to be placed in the second class containing the sicca
tive oils, which speedily grow thick, do not become fixed by
cold, which inflame by the nitrous acid only, and which,
with the sulphuric acid, form a sort of resin.

i. In      the two preceding memoirs *               I  considered chiefly
those substances which are simple, or of which the composi
tion is not variable ; in the present one             I shall endeavour to
ascertain what influence the degree of oxidation of m^etals
may have on their chemical action, and shall compare gene
rally this action with that of other substances, independently
of the   properties I have already examined (Art. XIII.).
    The solutions and precipitates of mercury appear particu
larly worthy of attention ; for chemists have observed them
with more care, and it is more easy to determine their con
ditions.
    2. In the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences 1790,
Fourcroy has described a sulphate of mercury analogous to
calomel, that is to fay, formed by mercury little oxygenated;
and has shown that the sulphate of mercury, particularly
when such a degree of heat only is employed as not to pro
duce complete desiccation of the sulphuric acid and mercury,
is divided by the action of the water into two sulphates, one
of which may be called oxygenated sulphate, and the other
mild sulphate.        A simple method of obtaining this last com
bination is to dilute, with an equal volume of water, the sul
phuric acid which is treated with mercury, and to boil the
mixture : a little sulphureous acid is formed, and, instead of
oxygenated       sulphate of mercury, that sulphate is obtained of
which the properties have been so well investigated by Four
croy.     In determining the constituent parts of the mild sul
phate of mercury, he fixes at 0,05 the proportion of oxygen,
which is combined with the mercury; and supposes that, on
decomposing this salt by potaih, it is pure oxide of mercury
which is precipitated.         But the metallic precipitates retain a
portion of acid which he has neglected ; I therefore believe
that in his experiment the proportion of oxygen ought to be
rather greater than that which he establishes.                 In many re
cent determinations made by chemists, this consideration has
 been overlooked; which renders them, in some measure, un
 certain.    The mild sulphate of mercury forms a permanent

the mercury becomes too much oxided to form the mild sul

                                      is
oxygenated sulphate,     which   varies  in the quantity of sulphuric
acid which       retains. Let us examine
                 it                               in the state

    If for simple water an alkaline solution be employed, which
exerts     more powerful action upon the acid than pure water,
             a
two combinations are formed, one of which                  sound to be
                                                                is
almost entirely the oxide, and the other in which the acid                       is
for the most part engaged          :the precipitate obtained differs

depends on the degree of concentration of the alkaline liquor
which acts upon it.
    When the oxygenated sulphate of mercury retains more                  a
 considerable    excels of acid, the action of the latter may
 be     so
         weakened     bythe water, that no separation wiH take
place.
    3.  I have hitherto supposed but two sulphates of mercury
 to exist, one with the smallest possible proportion of oxygen,
 and the other with the greatest           but
                                             ;    itmanifest that two

df these intermediate combinations differ so much as to leave
no room for the determination of their particular properties t
unless both the degree of oxydation and the proportion of the
acid be known.
   What I now observe as to the intermediate degrees of ox
idation must also be applied to the other metallic salts, such
as the sulphate of iron, in which there are likewise only two
fixed terms, that of the weakest and that of the strongest ox
idation.
   4. Bergman had before discovered that a solution of mer
cury by the nitric acid made in the cold, has different pro
perties from that which is prepared by means of heat; and,
in his excellent treatise on the analysis of waters, he remarks,
that the former does not so readily afford a precipitate with
the solutions which contain sulphuric acid, and that the pre
cipitate it forms is white, whereas that of the solution made
with heat is yellow; that the first then forms mild sulphate
Of mercury, which is white, and more soluble in water than
the oxygenated sulphate, while the latter forms the oxygen
ated sulphate.
  When nitrate of mercury is prepared by means of heat,
some nitrous gas is at first disengaged ; but when the disen
gagement is complete, the mercury is perceived to be dis
solved, with the production of scarcely any nitrous gas.                 I
am indebted for this observation to C. Gay^ a young chemist
of the Polytechnic School, who adds much sagacity to consi
derable zeal. We see, therefore, that by means of heat an
oxygenated nitrate is formed, which, if the operation be not
stopped,  afterwards combines with mercury, as in another
operation the oxygenated muriate of mercury combines with
a fresh quantity of this metal *.      But in the fluid nitrate of
mercury,    there  are no  determinate  proportions between the
mercury   most   oxygenated,  and  that least so : it appears that
all the intermediate proportions may exists as I have observed
with respect to the sulphates.
  When nitrate of mercury     is precipitated by muriate of soda,
mercurial muriates are obtained, which differ according to the
oxidation of the mercury.     With the nitrate a little oxided
a white precipitate is obtained, which retains a part of the
pitric acid, and cannot be dissolved in the muriatic acid, nor
   * Fourcroy has shown that the oxygenated sulphate of mereury, sub
mitted to ebullition with water and mercury, acts also upon the metal ; it
must therefore pass to the state of mild sulphate. The corrosive mercurial
muriate, when dissolved in water, does not act upon mercury ; but by tri-
turation with mercury without water, it begins to combine with   it, and to
impart its oxygen:   the combination becomes uniform   by sublimation.
                                 X   3                                  be

be taken up by the" concentrated nitric acid, without giving
out much nitrous gas.       From the solution prepared by heat,
a precipitate  is obtained rather of a yellow colour, which is
not soluble   in   muriatic, but readily dissolves in nitric acid,
           out  little nitrous gas.
                 a                       The supernatant fluid affords
fiving
  y evaporation      a little corrosive mercurial muriate.
     If this experiment be made with a nitrate so prepared that
 the mercury shall be in the most oxided state, and which has
 not redifsolved any metallic mercury, and if it be diluted with
 a considerably large quantity of water, no precipitate is formed,
 but all the mercury is found in the state of corrosive mercu
 rial muriate : it is obtained in this state, however, only but
 in a small quantity, and sometimes even none is had, accord
 ing to the proportion of muriate of soda employed, because
 the corrosive mercurial muriate has the property of forming
 with the nitrate of soda a quadruple salt. This salt is capable
 of forming rhomboidal crystals, grooved on their face, of a
 considerable size : it fuses upon red-hot coals; by exposing it
 to a sufficient heat in a retort, all the mercury is separated in
 the form of corrosive mercurial muriate.              The residue is a
 nitrate of soda which retains a little muriatic acid, so that
 the separation which takes place is decided by the respective
 volatility of the substances, and by a difference of affinity be
 tween the nitric acid and the muriatic acid for the oxide of
 mercury.      After the crystallization of this salt, another is ob
 tained in small needles, which appear to be a complex salt,
 in which the oxide of mercury is found in a greater propor
 tion.
    Nothing certain can be determined as to the results of the
mixture of the nitrate of mercury highly oxided, and the mu
 riate of soda, because they vary according to the proportions
of the substances which act.
    I deduce from the preceding observation.-, that the nitric
solution of mercury may hold this metal in solution from the
lowest degree of oxidation to the highest, or to that which
is required for the constitution of corrosive mercurial muriate;
that it may possess it in all the intermediate degrees, but that
jts properties will be different according to the degree of
oxidation.
     15. Fourcroy laysit     down asa     principle, that any metallic
oxide whatever gives to acids     a     colour similar to that which
it  has itself; whence he concludes, that when          a    mercurial
precipitate which proceeds from white salt acquires another
                                       a
colour,    a  change must have been made in the oxidation.
This opinion does not appear to me to be well founded.             I
                                                     some red oxide of
                                             in
took some muriatic acid and dissolved        it
                                                            mercury ;

                      the  Laws of Affinity.                   325
mercury; the solution was easily effected, without any disen
gagement either of oxygen gas, or oxygenated muriatic acid :
it spontaneously afforded fine crystals of corrosive mercurial
muriate.      I may here remark, that this process appears to
me to be the most simple and the least expensive for the pre
paration of the corrosive mercurial muriate.       The combina
tion which I had formed contained the red oxide of mercury
with all its oxygen; yet it was colourless: with ammonia it
would have given a white precipitate, and with lime and the
alkalis a precipitate more or less orange coloured.
    The red oxide of mercury readily dissolves in the nitric
acid without any disengagement        of oxygen : this solution
crystallizes and forms a white salt ;. but if there be not a suf
ficient excess of acid, it gives with water alone a white pre
 cipitate ; with a greater quantity of water recently distilled, a
yellow precipitate ; with lime and the fixed alkalis, a precipi
tate of a much deeper yellow colour.       A coloured oxide may
therefore form white salts, and afterwards assume other co
lours, without undergoing any change in its oxidation.
     6. It is known that the muriatic acid has a greater disposi.
tion to combine with highly oxided metals than the nitric
and sulphuric acids.        Fourcroy applied this consideration
 with advantage to explain several phænomena.         He thus ex
presses himself: {Mem. tie I'Acad. 1790, p. 381.)
                                                          " Every
 acid requires quantities of oxygen in the metals in order to
 combine with them; the muriatic acid, in general, does not
 combine with those metals, unless they be much loaded with
 this principle, or highly oxided : the mercury appears to be
 more oxided in the corrosive muriate than in the nitrate."
 I (hall take the liberty to make some observations on the
 principles laid down by my learned colleague.
     It does not appear correct to fay, that each acid requires
 different quantities of oxygen in the metals to combine with
 them ; the nitric, the sulphuric, and the muriatic acids, form
 combinations with mercury, from the least to the most oxided
 terms; and it is the series which results in the muriates which
 makes the principal difference in all pharmaceutical prepara
 tions, from the corrosive sublimate to the mercurial panacea :
 but there is this difference, that the combination of the sul
 phuric acid and the nitric acid with highly oxided mercury
 is much weaker, and more easily decomposed, even by the
 action of water, than that of the muriatic acid, which pre
  sents a very permanent constitution.      If we turn our atten
  tion to those metals which have the property of assuming
  large proportions of oxygen, such as iron, tin, antimony, &c.
  we (hall find the fame properties with regard
                                            "     to the sulphuric,

 5 26                     Researches respetling
 nitric, and muriatic acids; so that the action of the two first,
 which diminishes in proportion as the oxidation advances, is
 sometimes      so much weakened, that they abandon entirely, or
 aie incapable of dissolving some very oxided metals: on the
 conliary, the muriatic acid dissolves them and holds them in
 solution, so that it cannot be perceived whether its action be
 weakened,       or whether, on the contrary, it be not increased
 by   a   greater oxidation.     A probable explanation may be
 given    of this.   Sulphur  and  azote, the bases of the two for
 mer, are saturated with oxygen, so that their resulting affinity
 for the substances that are also greatly oxygenated is very
weak ; but the muriatic acid, which appears to have in its
constitution only a very small portion of oxygen, ought to
 have a much greater disposition to combine with oxygenated
 substances.
    7. In the foregoing observations      I have supposed that the
different alkalis share the acid of a metallic solution with the
oxide which is precipitated. I speak not of precipitates by
ammonia, which in some circumstances is decomposed, and
by that means changes the constitution of the precipitate, as
has been particularly shown by Foureroy ; but this property-
is subject to modifications which demand particular attention.
Bayen's experiments have ascertained that the precipitates
of mercurial nitrates and muriates retain a greater or less
portion of acid, so that, on exposing the precipitates of the
mercurial nitrate to a sufficient heat, some nitrous acid is
disengaged ; and on making the same experiment on the pre
cipitates of mercurial muriate, a greater or less quantity of
insoluble mercurial muriate is sublimed.           I shall here add
some observations to those I have already made. (Art. XIII.
No.     1.)
    When      oxygenated    muriate of mercury is decomposed by
the precise quantity of carbonate of soda necessary to effect
its precipitation, the precipitate contains muriatic acid, car
bonic acid, and oxide of mercury, in excess; so that on ex
posing the precipitate to the action of heat, carbonic acid gas
and oxygen gas are disengaged; nearly half the mercury is
reduced to metal, and the rest of the precipitate is sublimed,
retaining all the muriatic acid which remained in combina
tion with the oxide, and forming the mercurial muriate ob
served by Bay en.       The liquid over the precipitate affords by
evaporation, at first earbonate of soda, and afterwards a triple
salt in which soda predominated.
    Carbonate of potash presents different phænomena,              A

  pitate obtained does not amount to half the weight of what
  would be given by the fame quantity of oxygenated muriate
  of mercury, precipitated by the carbonate of ioda. This pre
  cipitate, exposed to the action of heat, gives out carbonic
  acid, and sublimes almost totally in the state of mercurial
  muriate, with the least portion of acid ; a very small por
  tion only resumes the metallic state. The liquid that covers
  the precipitate makes no effervescence with the acids; so that
 here the whole of the carbonic acid is combined in the pre
  cipitate with the oxide, and a portion of muriatic acid nearly
 double that contained in the precipitate by carbonate of soda.
 The liquid when evaporated affords a triple salt much more
 soluble in water than the oxygenated muriate of mercury :
 this salt crystallizes in silky needles.
     Carbonate of ammonia causes an effervescence on decom
 posing corrosive mercurial muriate, and no acid is found either
 in the precipitate or in the supernatant liquid. The weight
of the precipitate constitutes nearly five-sixths of the muriate
 decomposed ; a disengagement        of ammonia takes place on
 the addition of lime.     When urged by heat, the ammonia is
 decomposed,      and azote gas only is received.    All the mer
 cury    is sublimed  without reduction.    But in this sublimate
 the mercury cannot be as much oxided as in the sublimation
 of precipitates obtained by the fixed alkalis or lime, a part of
the oxygen having gone, decomposes the ammonia.                The
liquid which covered the precipitate contained a combination
or oxide of mercury, of muriatic acid, and ammonia.
     The precipitation by ammonia presented the same phæno-
mena, except the effervescence.
     8. By attending to the other metallic solutions and preci
pitations, the character of those of mercury are easily disco
vered, as well as the modifications which depend on the par
ticular affections of each oxide ; I therefore think we are justi
fied in stating the following principles :
     1 . Acids act upon metallic oxides as upon other substances,
in proportion to their mass ; for when a metal has become
but little soluble or insoluble, it may be dissolved by an excess
of acid, or may form, by means of such excess, a more dur
able combination.
     a. When a metallic combination is decomposed, the alkali
or alkaline earth made use of, produces a division of the acid
in proportion to the energy of its action. When the metallic
combination is weak, water is sufficient to decompose it ;
salts with either a maximum or minimum of acid are then
formed.       In this cafe the metallic oxides follow the fame
 laws as other substances; but it sometimes happens that the
                                 X4                        alkaline

ja8                       Researches respecting
 alkaline base which is added does not assume its share of the
 acid, but the metallic oxide, on the contrary, divides the
 precipitate with the acid ; as when we form fulminating gold,
 or the orate of ammonia.          Sometimes also the precipitant,
 the acid, and the metallic oxide, form two complex com
 binations ; one of which is insoluble and the other remains
 liquid, as we have seen in the decomposition of the corrosive
 mercurial muriate by ammonia, and in the experiments that
 I  have described (first series, Nos. X. and XI.).      In general,
 but particularly with respect to the metallic solutions, we
 must not separate in our reasonings the substance employed
 by the name of precipitant from the liquid in which the pre
 cipitation is effected.      Attention ought to be paid equally to
 all the substances present which can possibly form new com
 binations.
     3. Coloured oxides may produce colourless combinations 5
 but on giving out a part of the acid with which they have
 been combined, their colour will again appear in proportion
 to the quantity of acid they have parted with ; so that this
 colour is an indication of the constitution thus established,
  provided the state of oxidation has not been changed by any
 particular circumstance.
     4. Metallic oxides cannot be compared together, unless
  they are taken in a determinate state of oxidation.        All the
  combinations they are capable of forming vary, not only
  from this cause, but also from the proportidn of acid they
  retain, when this proportion is not determined by a crystal
 lization. With respect to oxidation there are only two ex
  tremes ; that of the least and that of the greatest oxygenation,
  which can be considered as constant ; and hence it follows,
  that the nomenclature can only indicate vaguely, and with
  great latitude, any metallic combinations in which the oxida
  tion and the proportion of the acid are not determined.
     5. The acids do not follow the fame order in their affinity
  relative to the degrees of oxidation. There are some in which
  the affinity diminishes with the oxidation, such are the nitric
  and sulphuric acids ; in others again jt appears to increase,
  such as the muriatic acid.        Hence we may perceive, inde
  pendently    of all the considerations 1 have mentioned, how httle
  reason there was for classing the affinities of metals for the
  different acids by considering them as constant forces.
     6. The results of the complex affinities of metallic solutions,
  mixed with other salts, may also vary from the proportion of
  those salts,
                conformably to what has been observed [on the
  influence of proportion in the complex affinities) ; so that then
 the proportion, of oxygen in the metallic oxide, that of the
                                                              oxide

                      the    Laws of Affinity.                            3 20
oxide in the solution, and that of the saline combination
brought into action with            all contribute to the new com
                                  it,
binations which arc established.
   7.   In the chemical action of the metallic solutions, the
laws which we have established in that of the other combina
tions might be admitted,          oxidation did not cause change
                                 if                                  a
in the affinity of the metal, either for the acids or for the
other substances, and multiply, as            were, in the metals the
                                                  it
property of forming combinations; whence the results are
often so complicated, that though                 by
                                              accurate observation we
may develop the facts and the circumstances which deter
mine them, yet they cannot be foreseen                  by
                                                      theory, from the
mere consideration of the known properties, as may be done
with respect to other substances, the action of which depends
 ona    smaller number of conditions.
     8. The state in which oxygen exists combined in the me
 tals, has likewise an' influence upon the properties of the me
 tallic oxides, and of the precipitates compared with each
 other.     Bayen observed that several mercurial precipitates,
 as well as the red oxide, detonate strongly, though in an
 unequal manner when exposed to heat, after having been
 mixed with sulphur, and that some do not possess this pro
 perty  ;  but has not given the reason of the phænomenon and
 the exceptions.      It appears to me indubitable, that this pro
 perty   of the oxide of  mercury, and of the precipitates in which
 it predominates,     is    consequence of the oxvgen possessing
 more caloric than        it a
                            preserves in its combination with the
 sulphur or in the sulphuric acid. The same thing therefore
 happens as with the nitrate and oxygenated muriate of pot
 ash, except that the effect            less considerable
                                        is                     but in the
                                                                 ;
  precipitates of the corrosive mercurial muriate, part only of
  the mercury can be considered as not combined with the
  muriatic acid, namely, that part which may be reduced into
  metal by the action of the heat which produces detonation.
  Such      of
             the precipitates therefore as retain        sufficient quan
                                                             a
  tity of the muriatic acid to admit only of            small reduction
                                                         a
  of mercury     bythe action of heat, cannot produce detonation;
  and such really are the precipitates             by
                                                ammonia,             by
                                                                  the car
  bonate of ammonia, and             the carbonate of potash.
                                     by
      9. The property discovered             by
                                            Bayen       therefore analo
                                                         is
  gous to the fulminating property of the orate and the argen-
  tate of ammonia      but         not perceptible in the other me
                                 it

                      ;
  tallic oxides and precipitates. Hence the oxygen in the latter
  must necessarily contain       less portion of caloric.
                                 a
      10. The properties which depend upon oxidation vary
   therefore in each metal on account of the proportions of

 330                    Experiments on the A/bes
 oxygen ; amd those which depend on the state of concentra
 tion possessed by oxygen, constitute the leading cause of those
 phænomena which arise from the changes of combination in
 elastic substances.    (Art. XIV. Nos. 13               and 15.)

                   burnt, during the winter of the year 8, a
               of poplar  as fire-wood, I remarked that the ashes
  freat
    y being  re-burnt  on  the hearth, formed crusts of real frit,
  such as that of the ashes of sea-weed, with this difference,
  that they were only thin and of little extent, having neither
  been stirred, nor received any other heat than that of a mo
  derate fire used in a parlour.    I first suspected I had obtained
  an extraordinary quantity of potash ; but as 1 durst not ven
 ture to ascribe it to the quality of the wood, as the white kinds
 of wood have always been considered as furnishing little sa
 line matter, the trembling poplar (Populus tremula, Linn.)
 a tree of the fame kind as our common poplar (Populus alba)
 furnishing only, when burnt with the greatest care, 9 drams,
 45 grains, of potash per quintal of wood, I imagined that
 it depended on an alteration in the ligneous body. We culti
 vate the poplar for the purpose of obtaining props for our
 vines, and as it is bad fire-wood, we never cut it till it ceases
 to throw forth shoots.      It is not uncommon to fee poplars
 having the bark and branches exceedingly vivacious, while
 the trunk is reduced to a few handfuls of vegetable mould.
    This idea of the augmentation of potash in rotten wood
was not perfectly correct, but it will be seen that it conduc
ted me to results very different from the opinions commonly
received.     But I shall return to these theoretic points when           I
have detailed the following experiments, which will serve to
illustrate them.
    1st, A hundred parts of dry and found poplar wood pro
duced four parts of ashes.
    ad, A hundred parts of dry and rotten poplar wood, but
not yet in the state of mould, produced eight parts of ashes.
    3d, A hundred parts of each of these kinds of ashes, lixivi

waters were very strong.
   4th,         A
            hundred parts of the fame ashes re-burnt and
treated as above lost only 22 parts : the leys were stronger
and more caustic than the preceding.
   5th,         A
           hundred parts of the asties of dry and found oak,
re-burnt and treated as above, lost 16 parts.
   6th, A hundred parts of moist mould of oak of an ochre
colour, placed on an ignited plate of iron, became dried and
incinerated very speedily, and left three parts of ashes, which,
though re-burnt, had the colour of iron filings.         This is
nearly the double of what a quintal of dry oak gave when
burnt with the greatest care.       These asties were perfectly
insipid.
   7th, A hundred parts of the frit mentioned in the begin
ning of this paper, treated in the fame manner as the ashes
of No. 3, lost 37 parts in weight. This frit appeared at first
to be insipid ; the potash was concealed in      but,     length            it,       by

very caustic.
     8th, Some morsels of this frit brought to     red heat in the           a
sire, and quenched    in   small  quantity  of awater, furnished                                 a
ley       so
        caustic as to convert  into soap  melted wax and tallow,
on   which  the ley was  poured  cold.
   9th, This ley filtered on baked plaster of Paris (sulphate of
lime mixed with lime) reduced to powder, lost its alkaline
taste, and furnished         spontaneous       by
                                            evaporation beautiful
crystals            of   sulphate         of       potash.
     It follows from these experiments                             :
     xst, From the four first compared with the fifth, that the
wood of the white poplar             richer in saline matter than oak
                                                     is                                          :
here then we have an exception to an admitted rule, which
 considers hard wood as the most abundant in potash.                 The

  of wood, while the poplar furnishes 72 (11,088 grains.)
  To what is it indebted for this quantity ? An answer to this
  question will be found by analyzing its sap. The acrid and
 viscous juice of its buds, used in pharmacy, will also furnisli
  some data.
      A myriagramme (22 libs.i ounce, avoirdupoife) of the po-
 fulus tremula (trembling poplar) furnishes only 7 grammes
   (1078 grains) of saline matter, as appears by a calculation
  made from a very accurate experiment*.                     This difference,
  more than decuple, in saline matter between one tree and
  another of the same species,will astonish only those who do not
  know that the rhubarb and sorrel are of the same genus, and
  that the four cherry belongs to the fame species as the com
  mon wild-cherry.          Nature is not confined to our narrow ideas
  of analogy. It has been laid down as a principle, that plants
 of the fame family may mutually supply each others place in
 medicine, but it is prudent to apply this principle only after
  a very accurate analysis of the plant employed, and that in
  tended to be substituted for it.
      2d, It follows from the first five experiments, that rotten
 wood gives more aslies than found wood, often more than
 double, which may be readily conceived. Wood by rotting
 becomes spongy and light.             I have seen some which weighed
 a half less, under an equal volume, than found wood of the
 fame tree.      It burns without flame like tinder, and is diffi
 cult to be incinerated.           It appears that the hydrogen has
 been almost destroyed, and that the carbon concealed by the
 earthy parts escapes combustion.              This wood is often phos
 phorescent,     a  phænomenon          the cause     of which is yet un
 known. Rotten wood must not be confounded. with that
 which is pierced by worms.               In the latter cafe the wood
 without changing its colour is reduced to an impalpable
 powder, and in the small part which remains solid is found
 the orifice the worm has formed, and often the worm itself f.

ter from the poplar, is the estimation by exhaustion appeared to me more
certain, because it is difficult to bring back the laline matter always to the
fame point of calcination.      But having calculated, that the alhes of the
oak loses in lixiviation o-i6, and gives in saline matter 0-13, I deducted
3-i6ths, or C19, for the loss by lixiviation, and I think 1 obtained nearly
the product in saline matter, this difference arises from the carbonic acid
which the saline matter loses in calcination.

would venture to talk, is found in old trunks of the oak.

properly   to  be called worm-eaten,    has   nothing then in com
mon with rotten wood called also worm-eaten, but the name
improperly applied to the latter.
    It has been said, that rotten wood furnishes little saline
matter * : this observation       is correct in regard to wood
drenched by the rain ; the eighth experiment proves it ; but
it is proved by the third that wood which has rotted with
out being drenched by rain, does not lose an atom of its pot
ash, and that taking equal weights, as rotten wood furnishes
a double quantity of aflies equally rich, it will furnish a
double quantity of saline matter. This affords a resource for
manufactories, especially when we consider the moderate
price of this wood, which in general is much neglected.
    The ashes of dead timber, the tops and bark of which
being well preserved have left no place of entrance for rain,
 may be employed either in leys for domestic purposes, in
 saltpetre manufactories, or salt works.         The mould of these
 trees will also form an excellent manure, since it will have re
 tained all its potash.   It is thence seen, that where the mould
 has been drenched with rain, vegetation has been benefitted.
 We know by the experiments of Vauquelin, that the potash
 in the sap of trees is in the state of acetite : it would be highly
 gratifying to know in what state it is in the wood and in the
 mould.
    3d, The fourth experiment proves that the aflies by being
 re-burnt lose a fifth of saline matter, and this must be the cafe
 since it divests itself more and more of carbonic acid ; but
 by these means it gains as much in quality as is proved in
 particular by the eighth experiment.         However, if very rich
 ashes, such as that of the poplar, be re-burnt, a frit will be
 obtained, or a semivitrification, which will retain a part of
 the potash : besides, this frit, in order to be lixiviated, must
 be triturated, which will increase the labour.            This frit,
 from which may be extracted 30 per cent, of saline matter,
 and which will then still contain a great deal of      it,
                                                          would per
 haps be as proper for glass-making as certain kinds of soda.
    This semi-vitreous state, and the firmness of the soaps ob
 tained in the eighth experiment, induced me at first to be-

Iieve that the ashes      of the poplar contained soda, but the
ninth experiment         undeceived       me.     I employed plaster of
Paris, which I had       at hand, for want of sulphuric acid ; it is
a convenient thing, said Franklin, to know how to saw with
a gimlet : for the same reason I used wax and tallow.
    I  shall conclude with some ideas suggested by these expe
riments.      Melted wax, tallow, and hog's lard, and heated
oils, assume a degree of heat superior to that of water, and
even to that of boiling ley. When an alkaline ley is poured
into them, the mixture swells up in an extraordinary manner,
all the water evaporates in a moment, and with equal pro
portions of ingredients, the soap remains firmer than that
made by the usual processes in manufactories ; besides it be
comes dry as soon as made.            These advantages are worth the
trouble of making a trial, and in that cafe the following ques
tions ought to be examined :
    ist, In heating the oil before the water, may not the ex
pansion which takes place at the time of mixture produce some
accident ?
    In my opinion it will not, if the boiler is very deep, and
filled only one-fourth.
    2d, May the mixture be agitated ? Yes, when the whole
of the ley has been employed, the mixture then remaining
in a state of tranquil fusion.
    3d, Do the salts foreign to soap, particularly the alkaline
carbonates, pass off with the exhausted ley ? I fear not ; in
my trials on a small scale no liquor remained.
    4th, Do not oily bodies too much heated become so much
altered as to alter the soaps ? I apprehend they do j my soaps
were grayish.
LII.    RefleQions    on the Difference between         the Acetous and
            Acetic Acids.      By C.     Dabit, of Nantes     *.
B,BEFORE         the memoir       of Berthollet on the acetous and
acetic acids     (vulgo   radical   vinegar) had appeared, chemists
agreed pretty generally          in   ascribing the difference which
exists between them to a greater concentration on the part of
the acetic acid. But since the publication of that work, in
which the above celebrated chemist proves that this differ-'
ence is owing to something else than a greater concentration
of the acetic acid, this opinion has been almost entirely
abandoned. The experiments on which Berthollet supports

                                                                     hit

                   between the Acetous            and Acetic Acids.                335
his opinion   seemed so conclusive, that all chemists almost
were eager to adopt it.   The pneumatic chemists, explaining
this opinion in the language of their theory, have laid that
the acetic acid is the acetous combined with a new quantity
of oxygen   ; consequently, in a state of more perfect combina
tion.   Such has been the opinion hitherto generally adopted.
   C. Adet, in a memoir read before the National Institute,
and inserted in Vol. XXVII. of the Annahs de Chimie, op
poses this opinion, and maintains :
   1    That no such acid as the acetous exists.
        ft,
   2d, That the acid of vinegar continually presents itself at
the highest degree of oxygenation to which               can attain   it             ;
and consequently, that          always
                                   it   in
                                        is  the state of acetic acid.
   3d,  That   the difference   which   exists  between   the acetic
acid extracted from the acetate of copper, and that extracted
from vinegar, depends on the less quantity of water contained
in the latter.
   Has C. Adet completely attained the end which he pro
posed    ?In my opinion he has not. In the first place, the
greater part 01 the experiments on which the opinion of Ber-
thollet rests, have not even been attacked, and consequently
remain in full force.      Such are               :
   1st, The pungent odour and taste which this acid retains
though diluted with water           as to make its specific gravity
                                             so
equal  to that  of distilled vinegar; an odour and taste which
the latter does not possess.
   ad, The property which the acetic acid has of immediately
combining with copper, while the acetous acid does not
combine with       until
                      it     has been oxidated.
                                   it
   In the next place, the proofs which this chemist brings to
support his opinion, are far from being         conclusive as might.
                                                           so
be wished.      C. Adet himself allows that they still leave some
desiderata.                ,   ¦
 I   proposed to present some objections to the opinion of
C. Adet, and to prove that           cannot be admitted.
                                             it               even             I
had written        paper

could have done,           have thought proper to suppress the
                            I
greater part    of  my  labour     should even have suppressed
                                        ;    I                                       it
entirely,    the experiments
              if                 made, and the results
                                        I                obtained,         I
had not led me to adopt an opinion different from that of
Chaptal.       It   is   this part of my labour that            I   have determined
to give.
  C. Chaptal, after having proved,                        by
                                        several experiments,

33®                Reflections    on the Difference
  two acids does not arise from a greater concentration on the
 part of the acetic acid, concludes by saying:
     ift, That there is a difference between the acetous and
  acetic acid.
     2d, That this difference arises from a less proportion of
 carbon in the acetic acid than in the acetous acid.
     3d, That the acetous acid does not pass to the state of
 acetic acid but by carbonization.
     4th, That the difference which exists between that acid
 and some others equally susceptible of modifications              by
 changes made in the proportions of their constituent princi
      is, that in this acid the oxygen does not appear suscepti
 ples
  ble of addition nor subtraction, and that the carbon alone
 experiences variations and determines all the changes, while
 in other acids   it   isthe oxygen which varies and occasions
the changes.
 I     am of opinion with Chaptal, that there             difference-
                                                              is   a
 between the acetous and acetic acids          even admit that the
                                               :I
latter contains less carbon than the acetous acid          but does;
the acetous acid pass to the state of acetic acid only           de-       by
carbonization, as that celebrated chemist asserts             do not
                                                                   ?   I
think so. On the contrary,        I hope to be able to prove,                   by
several experiments:      1st, That the difference     which exists
between the two acids         owing to the different proportions
                             is
of oxygen: 2d, That this substance           in greater quantity in
                                               is
the acetic than the acetous acid 3d, That
                                      :                  by
                                                     adding oxygen
to the acetous acid     it may be made to pai's to the state of
acetic acid.
    C. Adet having laid      down as
                            it          principle, that the acid of
                                          a
Vinegar, in its combination with potash,             in the state of
                                                         is
acetic acid, and, as Chaptal has not disputed this assertion,
which,  if   correct, would give great weight to the opinion of
C. Adet, thought
            I          it proper first of all to examine whether,
as C. Adet asserts, the acetic acid, obtained from the decom
position of the acetite of potash,      means of sulphuric acid,
                                          by
really existed in that salt, because that chemist says
                                                               " the
acetic acid  is  obtained before the least atom of sulphureous
acid manifests itself," or rather, whether        be not owing to
                                                    it
a   commencement of the decomposition of the latter acid, as
seems to be proved bv the sulphureous acid obtained towards
the end of the operation.      To obtain solution of this pro
                                               a
blem, which appeared to me to be of the utmost impor
tance,I     thought it  would be sufficient to employ an inde
composable acid, which, however, should be susceptible of
acquiring   a   concentration nearly equal to that of the sul
phuric acid. As the muriatic acid appeared to me to posses*
                                                                  all

              between    the Acetous and Acetic         Acids.            337
ail the requisite properties, I proceeded in the following
nianuer.
    Exper. L One part of concentrated muriatic acid, and
two parts of the acetite of potash, were put together into
a retort, and distilled with a proper apparatus,              till nothing
more passed over ; I then unluted the apparatus, and found
that the acid obtained was in every thing similar to concen
trated distilled vinegar ; only that it was mixed with a little
muriatic acid.
    Exper. II. Equal parts of concentrated muriatic acid and
oxide of manganese in powder, and two parts of the acetite
of potash mixed together, and subjected to distillation, as in
the preceding experiment, gave me acetic acid, similar in all
its physical properties to that obtained by sulphuric acid, ex
cept that it was mixed with a little oxygenated muriatic acid
which was disengaged towards the end of the operation.
    Exper. III. Acetite of potash, mixed with the fourth of
its weight of sulphuric acid, was distilled in a sand bath, in a
moderate heat.         Acetic acid passed at the commencement
of the operation, and before the least atom of sulphureous
acid had manifested itself, as observed by C. Adet; but
when about the fourth of the liquor which I obtained had
pafled, the sulphureous acid began to disengage itself, and
continued to do so till the end ot the operation.
    It evidently results, in my opinion, from these experi
ments, that in the acetite of potash the acid of vinegar is
not in the state of acetic acid, but of acetous acid, and that
an addition of oxygen is indispensable,                     to convert the
acetous acid into acetic.         These principles being once ad
mitted, no doubt will remain that the sulphuric acid may
lose a portion of its oxygen without however passing to the
state of sulphureous acid, as I have advanced in my eflay on
the theory of ether, and consequently that this acid may be
in an intermediate state between the sulphuric and sulphu
 reous acid*.
   *
      Fourcroy andVauquelin, in their observations On my work respecting
ether, oppose this opinion.    It is not on suppositions, they fay, that the
ories are established, and they add, that I ought to have begun by proving
that the sulphuric acid may lose a portion of its oxygen, without passing
to the state of sulphureous acid.    lam sensible of the full force and just
ness of this objection,    I omitted proving this assertion, because   I consi
dered it as an acknowledged principle, which the experiments contained
in my essay on ether, and that described in the observations of the above
chemists, only confirmed.    Though it is only a fcort time since I received
the volume of the AnnaUi which contain these objections,         I   have em
ployed myself on the means of obviating them, and two experiment*
which I have already made give me hopes of succeeding.

338              On a cheap Substitute         for Oil Paint.
    If any doubt should still remain, that an addition of oxy
gen is indispensably necessary to convert acetous into acetic
 acid, the following experiment must, in my opinion, en
tirely remove it.
    Exper. IV. Equal parts of distilled vinegar, concentrated
by freezing, and of oxide of manganese in powder, mixed to
gether and distilled to dryness, gave me the following pro
ducts. There first passed about one half of the vinegar,
which had not experienced the least alteration.               I then
changed the receiver, and the acid which I obtained had ac
quired the odour which characterizes the acetic acid. When
it was thus proved that the addition of oxygen is indispen
sably necessary to convert acetous into acetic acid, it re
mained for me to examine how the oxygen effects that
change, — whether by taking from it a portion of its carbon,
as Chaptal supposes, or rather by combining with               as the
                                                                  it,
following experiment will prove.
 I    repeated the second experiment in            mercurial appa
                                                     a
ratus, that I    might collect the carbonic acid gas, which
would necessarily be disengaged           the acetous acid passed
                                              if
to the state of acetic acid only in consequence of losing        por    a
tion of its carbon, which in this operation must have com
bined with the oxygen of the manganese.           When the opera
tion was terminated, lime water did not show the least atom
of carbonic acid.
    From the above experiments         think myself authorized to
                                        I
conclude,
    1st, That there       difference between the acetous and
                       is
                       a
the acetic acid.
    2d, That this difference       owing to
                                   is           greater proportion
                                                    a
of oxygen in the acetic than in the acetous acid.
   3d, That the acetous may be converted into acetic acid,
 by  combining     with
                  it     a new quantity of oxygen.
   4th, That the acid,   in what     now called acetate of potash,
                                        is
is in the state of acetous acid.
   5th, That the acetic acid obtained from the decomposition
of that salt,    by
                  the means of sulphuric acid,           owing to a
                                                             is
portion   of oxygen  which     takes
                              it     from   the  latter acid.

 soup : add gradually the oil, stirring the mixture with a
 small wooden spatula; then pour in the remainder of the
 milk, and dilute in it the Spanish white. Skimmed milk,
 in summer, is often found curdled, but this is a matter of
 little importance to our present object 5 by coming into con
tact with the lime it will soon be restored to fluidity.          It
 must, however, not be sour, as it would then form with the
 lime a fort of acetite (or, more correctly, a ladlite) of lime,
 susceptible of attracting humidity.
     The lime is slacked by immersing it in water, then taking
 it out and leaving it to effloresce in the air. The choice of
 the oils is a matter of indifference ; but, for painting white,
 oil of pinks ought to be preferred, because it is colourless;
 even the most common oils may be employed for painting
 with ochre. The oil, by falling into the mixture of milk
 and lime, disappears: it is completely taken np by the lime,
 with which it forms a calcareous soap.
     The Spanish white mult be pounded, and strewed gently
 on the surface of the liquid, by which it is gradually im
 bibed, and at length falls to the bottom.          This paint may
 be coloured like that for distemper, by charcoal pounded         in
 water, vellow ochre, &c.        It is employed in the fame man
ner as paint for distemper. This quantity will be sufficient
 for giving a first stratum to six fathoms.         The expense for
the above quantity is about four-pence halfpenny, which
makes about three halfpence per fathom.
     When it is necessary that the painting should be more du
rable, ¦the following mixture may be employed : slacked
lime two ounces, oil two ounces, and Burgundy pitch the
fame quantity.      The pitch must be dissolved in the oil, in a
gentle   heat, and the  clear liquor of the milk and lime must be
added.     During    cold  weather, the milk and lime ought to
be heated, that the pitch may not be too suddenly cooled,
and to facilitate its union with the milk and lime. Painting
with this substance has some analogy to that known by the
name of encaustic.
    These kinds of painting will stand against the common ef
fects of the weather for years, and answer well for garden
railings, fencings, and the like.       The first time that wood is
thus painted, it should receive a second coat after the first one
is dry; but when re-painted, a single coat only will be ne
cessary.

LIV.   ExtraSl of a Memoir on the Bronze of the Antients,
  and an Antique Sword.    Read in the Public Sitting of the
  Injlitute, July 4. By    C
                           Mongez.
V>i»     TRAULLE, president of the Society of Emulation
at  Abbeville,   presented to the class of literature and the fine
arts,  a sword  of bronze, found near Corbie, in the turf-moss,
formed by the deposits of the Somme. A small figure of a
warrior found in the same moss, and several Roman medals,
some of which are frequently dug up there, give reason to
conjecture that this weapon belonged to the Romans ; be
sides its dimensions, the blade, being eighteen inches in length
and two-edged, together with its point, its strength, its weight,
seem to characterize a sword of the conquerors of the world.
Though it was found near the skeleton of a man and that of
a horse, h seems doubtful whether it belonged to a horseman,
because the swords of the cavalry were longer than those of
the foot soldiers. It is also probable that it was an object
of luxury, or served as a mark of distinction to some officer,
for we know, by the testimony of Polybius, that the ordinary
sword of the Romans was of iron.         In a word, such a weapon
of bronze would cost at present as much money as a cutlass
of the fame length. It would, therefore, be no saving to
adopt the use of bronze swords, but they could be sooner
manufactured, as they might be cast; so that in a country
destitute of manufactories for making sabres and swords,
twenty thousand men might be easily armed in the course of
a month.
   After having examined the alloy of which the antique sword
is composed, I generalized my labour, and made some re
searches in regard to the bronze of the antients.      The follow
ing is the result. — We employed copper under the metallic
form in three different states : — pure copper; brass or cop
per alloyed with zinc ; and bronze, that        is, copper alloyed
with tin.  I      ascertained,  by different experiments made in
concert with Dize, that we have no remains of pure copper
from the antients.       The sheathing even of ships, which was
known to, and practised        bythem, was not performed with
copper, but with plates of lead     the nails only were of bronze.
                                    :
Leo-Baptista Alberti observed            on an antient ship, dis
                                        it
covered, while some researches were making under his direc-
t.on, in the neighbourhood of lake Riccia.            If to this be
 added, that all the antient instruments, vases, and medals,
 have been cast, we may conjecture, that the antients made
 \ery little use of pure copper.

              Memoir on the Bronze        of   the Antients.        34.1
    The same thing cannot be said of the antient brass. Col
lections of medals contain several which have been evidently
formed of this alloy, which is known to be factitious, but
which Pliny believed to have been a long time before ex
tracted from the bosom of the earth quite formed.
    By the chemical analysis of the medals of various nations,
of a poniard, of a sword, found at Corbie, of nails, See. all
antiques, and of bronze, we have learned that they con
tained tin and some atoms of zinc, but neither arsenic nor
iron were found in them.          The proportion of tin varies from
four thousandths to thirteen hundredths, one of the nails con
tained eight hundredths of tin.             We know also that tin
forms a part of the nails used for the sheathing of snips, which
are driven into the timbers with as much force as is used for
iron nails. Why did the antients employ bronze alone ?
It was not hecaufe the earth presented that alloy quite formed,
since tin mines do not contain a sensible quantity of copper,
but because they call all their instruments, and because cop-
       alone, though rendered fluid             an extreme degree of
                                               by

                                           a           The addition of
tin renders   it   very fluid, and disposes    itto assume all the de
 licacy of the mould.         It, therefore, forms       tenth of the
                                                         a
 metal used for cannons, and       a    fourth of that emploved for
bells.     Besides, bronze is  less susceptible of being covered with
 verdigrease than pure copper.
    This dangerous effect, however, cannot be avoided when
grease, acids, and even vegetables, are long kept in bronze.
 For this reason the Romans adopted the use of tinning, which
 Pliny says bad been invented in his time           by
                                                     the Gauss these
                                                               ;
 people they haughtily treated as barbarians, though they had
learned from them the art of working iron, and of making
 ploughs with ears, &c.
    Philo of Byzantium has made us acquainted with another
 object, which the antients had in view when they alloyed
 copper with three hundredth parts of tin.           Itwas tor the pur
 pose of making elastic plates, employed in shooting darts and
javelins from their warlike machines.              He adds, that they
 hammered them     a    long time to give them perfect elasticity.
This alloy might be employed in our machines, and parti
 cularly in carriages for making bronze springs, which might
 be substituted for those of steel, the latter being oft short and
 brittl/;.  Bronze also might be substituted with advantage for
iron An machines, which may be suddenly deranged               by   the
 iron work breaking, such as axles for carriages, and hinges for
 rudders. We have already adopted, for fixing the wheels to

the- axles, boxes of copper, the models of which were fur
nished by the antiquities found at Hereulaneum.  It is thus
that the study of antiquity, contributing to the improvement
of the £rts, will  free its followers from the reproach of inuti-
lity, which has     been so often thrown out against them by
superficial minds.
    At the period of the revival of letters, the learned men who
examined a great many sharp instruments of bronze, found in
the ruins of antient cities, imagined that the antients gave
them the hardness necessary for cutting by means of temper
ing.    Pliny, however, who details all the operations in regard
to the working of copper, those in regard lo iron, and the
method of tempering         it,
                              observes perfect silence respecting the
tempering of copper: on the contrary, we have seen blanks for
copper money thrown into cold water, after being strongly
heated, to soften them.         Count Caylus endeavoured to dis
cover the pretended secret of the tempering of copper. For
this purpose one of his chemical friends composed alloys, that
is  to fay, mistook the method, even          such
                                             if      a secret had ever
 existed.   By alloying     a sixth of iron with copper he con
 structed     sword of bronze, which exhibited indeed the form
              a
 of the antique swords, and cut like them, but which consisted
 of different alloy, exercised an action on
     a                                              amagnetic bar, in
 the same manner as different alloys of iron and copper, even
 to the weak proportion of one part in eighty-one,              term at
                                                                 a
 which the magnetic bar remains motionless. But of more
 than     ahundred morsels of antique bronze, medals, statues,
 knives, poniards, swords, &c. which         I subjected to the same
 proof, not one cxibited the least trace of iron.        In word we
                                                                 a
 ascertained,      byvery simple experiments, that the antient
 bronze contained no arsenic, though           amodern chemist has
 ascribed to the addition of that substance the hardness possess
 ed      the cutting instruments of the antients.
         by
     C. Darcet, the son os>our colleague, who analysed the
  sword dug up near Corbie, followed the real method for dis
  covering the causes which gave to that weapon the faculty of
  cutting, which     itstill possesses. At my request he formed a
  similar alloy with twelve hundredths of tin           :  means of a
                                                            by
  mould he formed two knife-blades, and one pen-knife blade.
  One of the knives was submitted to the class, who found that
it   was not inferior to our common knives.             The edge was
  formed      byhammering, and sharpening          iton    grind-stone.

It   was thus that the antient sword had been formed, and
  traces of the hammer may be still seen on its edges.

 sea,  the blades, which the acidity of the atmosphere rusts and
 destroys when made of iron, would be preserved from that
 inconvenience.
     I shall terminate this extract with some reflections on the
 price of metals in the time of Pliny. Lead at Rome, during
 the first century of our œra, was worth twenty-four times the
 price at which it is fold at present at Paris, and tin eight times
 its present price ; so that lead was three times as dear there as
 tin, while among us it docs not cost a third of the price.
The comparative deamefs of these metals among the antients
must make us sensible of the advantage which more extensive
 commerce, and metallurgic labours conducted in a more
 scientific manner, give us over them.              But we ought not to
 forget that this advantage is the result of eighteen centuries of
 experience and improvement; and that, notwithstanding this
 great number of centuries, the antients arc still our masters in
 that part of literature, and the fine arts, which forms the pe
 culiar domain of the imagination.
 LV    On the Expansion       of Wood     by  Heat.      By  David Rit-

 J.N    the present state of experimental philosophy it is well
known that bodies in general enlarge their dimensions, or ex
pand, on being heated, and contract in cooling.                From some
experiments      heretofore   made,    wood   has  been   thought to make
an exception to the general rule, and this opinion has f> pre
vailed that many curious persons have applied wooden pen
dulum rods to their time-pieces, to prevent the variation in
theirrate of going, arising from the expansion and contracting
of a metal rod. From my own observations, however, as weft
as those of some of my friends, the wooden pendulum rod does
not appear to answer the expectations formed on it.                I had in
my possession     for  several  years   an   excellent    time-piece made
for this society by an ingenious workman and worthy mem
ber of the society.       The result of my constant attention to this
clock was, that, though its regular variations with heat and
cold were probably much less than those of metal pendulums,
it nevertheless went always faster in winter than in summer,
and was liable to very sudden and considerable variations j
arising, no doubt, from the combined effects of heat and cold,

moisture and dryness.            This determined me to make some
careful experiments       with    a pyrometer capable of receiving a
piece   of  wood    of  the  length of a second pendulum.         Several
years   ago  I made    some   experiments     of this kind, perfectly  cor
responding     with   those   I   have  lately  made,   and  which    Inow
communicate to the society.
   I took a straight-grained- piece of white hiccory, green, for
I could not procure any seasoned, its length 39 inches, and
about 3-8ths of an inch square.              This I placed in my pyro
meter, and kept it fully extended by a weight fastened to a
string, going over a pulley. To the pyrometer I applied the
tube and glasses of a good compounded microscope, and a
micrometer, the value of the smaller divisions whereof I found
to be nearly .00053 Parts of an inch each.
   The rod of wood being placed in the pyrometer,                      I
                                                                   poured
sand all around     it,  heated to about 250 of Fahrenheit, which
degreeof heat found the wood would bear without scorching.
                I
On pouring in the hot sand, the rod expanded very much,
but soon began to contract, even before the sand was sensibly
cooled, which   I     suppose arose from the hot Tand extracting
the moisture of the wood.            It continued to contract as the
whole grew cool,          sothat when the rod had acquired its first
temperature   it    was near 30 of the above divisions shorter than
at first.I     repeated the operation second and third time, and
                                             a
had then reason to conclude that the wood was nearly as dry
as  it would become            by
                               lying long in      adry air.     now let it
                                                                   I
cool to the temperature of the atmosphere,which was 750, and
heating the sand to 200 only,            poured
                                         I        it around the rod. In
a few minutes     it   expanded 16 divisions.         In half an hour the
sand had cooled to 125, and the rod had contracted 11 divi
sions.     In an hour more the sand was 80, and the rod short
ened full   4    divisions more, being nearly equal to its length
when the sand was first applied.              On the whole conclude,
                                                                   I
that very dry wood expands with heat pretty regularly, though
certainly in much less degree than any of the metals, or even
              a
glass.
   The rod above mentioned having been kept         dry place   in a
for twelve months, again tried
                           1      with the pyrometer, having
                                             it
fixed near one end of     small graduated scale of ivory, 360
                                it   a
divisions whereof were equal to one inch.      This scale was
viewed with the microscope, furnished with cross hair, and a                    I
thought this method preferable to the screw micrometer used
before.
   The rod was placed               in
                           the pyrometer when the temperature
of the air was about 60*. On pouring sand around       heated          it,
a little higher than boiling water perhaps,   immediately ex
                                                           it
                                                                             panded

panded        a half        division, but in
                                    less than a minute it began to
contract, and continued      to  do so for an hour, when I drew off
the sand.    It  was  now   full   to divisions sliorter than at first,
so that it had imbibed a great deal of moisture from the air, .
which it again parted with to the heated sand. Three hours
afterwards, when the rod was cool, I again poured the sand on,
it, heated as before.          now continued to expand for about
                                        It
three minutes, when its length was increased                divisions,          3^                it
then began to contract, and became full               divisions shorter  3
than when the sand was poured on it.               caused the sand to
                                                                  I
run off once more, and let the rod cool. Then heating the
sand 250°              by
                   thermometer,         poured     on the rod, and in
                                                                 it it

a  few minutes              it
                    expanded 3'-     divisions,   then  began to con
 tract slowly, and in 15 minutes          became 2>3ds of division
                                                      it                             a
 shorter than at first.   On the whole, concluded that the ex

                   Lead in Wine.                By C. O.        Reinecke *.
 X        gratify sordid avarice at the expense of the health of
          O
mankind,               by
                 communicating to sour wines fallacious sweet            a
ness       means of the oxide of lead,
           by                                crime which for the
                                                            is   a
dignity of the human race we shall suppose to be committed
rather through ignorance than want of principle.           Haifa
bottle of Chably wine was lately sent me to test, with        no*                             a
tice, that     person, whose opinion, on account of his talents,
                   a
was entitled to great respect, had tried this wine, and be
lieved that he had found in       oxide of lead. itTo accomplish,
the object in view       employed the following means
                                 I                                                    :
      1   After being assured that the seal with which the cor
          ft,
respondent had marked the half bottle was in good preserva
tion,     Ibegan to examine the physical properties of the wine
it  contained.      was perfectly clear, had scarcely any colour,
                            It
and had formed no deposit.         The taste of this liquor alone,
convinced me that          had not experienced that adulteration
                                       it
of which         was suspected
                    it              had that pure and pungent
                                                ;   it
taste, which          much liked in Chably wine, without the
                        is      so
 slightest trace of that perfidious sweetness communicated by
acetite of lead, and which always betrays itself           styptic                   by   a
 relish, however small may have been the quantity of this
 poison mixed with the liquor.

346              Observations     on the Means   of detesting
    2d, As it was necessary that the detection should be of
such a nature as to be evident to those acquainted with the
first principles of chemistry, I endeavoured to find it in the
 relation which alkaline prusfiates have with metallic solutions.
 It is well known that they decompose them all in conse
 quence of that double affinity by which the pruffic acid
 abandons its first base to form with the metallic oxide an
 inloluble pruffiate, coloured according to the nature ol the
metal. Setting out from this principle, I dissolved crystal
lized prussiate of potash in distilled water, and mixed this so
 lution with a part of the suspected wine.        Having left this
mixture, exposed lo the air for twenty-four hours, and then
finding no other changes but a few atoms of prusfiate of iron,
very distinguishable by its blue colour, I contidered myself as
 authorized to announce that the wine in question did not
contain the least particle of lead.
    3d, To give to this first proof that degree of evidence of
which it is susceptible, and to place the principles of it beyond
all doubt, I mixed another part of the suspected wine with a
single drop of the acetite of lead; to this mixture two drops
of the fame solution of pruffiate of potash (2d) were added,
and I immediately obtained a precipitate of a dirty white
colour, being the pruffiate of lead, and proving in the fullest
manner, that in the preceding experiment the same wine
must have given the same precipitate if it had contained the
smallest particle of lead.
    4th, To these proofs and counter- proofs by the pruffiate
 (a and 3), that of the muriatic acid was added : the latter,
as is well known, separates lead from its solutions under the
form of a muriate very little soluble; it did not disturb the
transparency of the suspected wine, nor produce any change
in it t this, then, still tends to prove that the above suspicion
was   illfounded.
    5th, The proof      bysulphuret of potaffi, proposed long ago
as the sure means of detecting lead in wine, had been em
ployed       the person above mentioned. A number of causes,
            by
well known, render this proof doubtful; and            well known
                                                       it
                                                       is
that   it   isconclusive only when the presence of the metal
alluded    to has been proved           by
                                        complete   deoxygenation,
bringing back the oxide to the state of metal. For want of
this verification, this proof has very often been the source of
errors, the more serious as the suspicion to which they give
riseis  odious.    Itwas more than probable that the fame cause
had in the present case produced the same effect        but;   was  it
of importance to prove          it,
                               which was done as follows        :
                                                                         The

                  the Presence    of Lead in Wine.                       347
      The reagent in question was made in the proportions and
  manner indicated by the person who had employed this test * :
  equal parts of sulphur and potash (caustic) were dissolved in a
  sufficient quantity of distilled water; some drops of this solu
  tion, which the said person called sulpburet, and to which
  he ought to have given the name of by drogenated sulpburet,
  were mixed with the suspected wine, and no other change
  was produced, but that which ought to take place in pure
  wine of the fame kind, viz. a decomposition of the sulphuret,
  either by the malic acid or by the tartareous acid of the
  acidulous tartrite of potasli.     Had this wine held in solution
  a particle of lead, the latter must necessarily have immediately
. formed, not a salt, as the author of the note fays,       but a me
  tallic sulphuret, insoluble, and easy to be distinguished by its
  colour; being at first of a reddish brown, and passing soon to
  dark brown.      But as the wine did not experience from this
  reagent any other change than that arising from the said de
  composition, giving first a white cloud, then some traces,
  scarcely sensible, of a deposit of the same colour, which is
  nothing else than the sulphur precipitated, it is still proved
  the wine did not contain a particle of lead.
      6th, Another part of the fame kind of wine, but known to
  contain lead, was employed to confirm the proof (5) by a
  counter-test: a drop of the solution of acetite of lead was
        intoit, and hydrogenated sulphuret being then added,
  futimmediately obtained the insoluble sulphuret of lead of the
  colour which    I have mentioned.
      7th, Having at hand all the apparatus necessary for these
  researches,
            I    applied them to red wine sold in       tavern.
                                                        a          One
  part of this wine being mixed with       a few drops of the solution
  of aretiteof lead, and then with hydrogenated sulphuret, the
  sulphuret of lead was immediately announced                by
                                                             change of
                                                                 a
  colour.    The purple passed to blackish, and soon after the
  metal was detected   by  an abundant deposit of the fame colour.
  One part of the fame red wine being mixed with hydrogen
  ated sulphuret, without adding acetite of lead, the difference
  of the phænomena was       so  striking, that    alone
                                                  it          sufficient
                                                                 is
  to give confidence to persons whose regard for their health
  may induce them to make trials of this nature            the change
                                                             :                 '
  of colour is  no less speedy in pure wine than in that which
  contains lead, but this change     is   altogether opposite to that
  which have here noted.
        I                          Red wine containing lead grows
  darker  by   hydrogenated sulphuret: pure red wine, on the

 J.    HIS eminent mathematician and philosopher is a na
tive of the South of Scotland, the son of worthy parents, in.
the middle condition of life.
    He had, as soon as he was at an age capable of literary
instruction, the advantage of attending one of those paristi-
fchools, which are so much celebrated as the sources of the
general and extraordinary intelligence of the Scots, acquiring,
with great eagerness and facility, that knowledge of English,
Latin, Greek, writing, and arithmetic,             which usually
forms at such schools the complete course.          He was consi
dered as a genius that ought to be devoted to one of the
learned professions ; and his parents resolved to bring him
up to be a clergyman.
    He went to pursue his studies at the university of Glasgow,
in which some of the most eminent philosophers of the age
were then teaching with great reputation and success.           In
every branch of study he made distinguished proficiency,
but mathematics soon became his favourite. Dr. Ro
bert Simpson was his master in this science; and it is
well known how much that great man contributed to the
restoration of antient mathematics, and to the general diffu
sion of a taste for mathematical knowledge, among his con
temporaries. The sciences which are employed upon pure
truth and reasoning,     if,at   first trial, harder and less in
                                     a
viting than most other parts    of  study, yet, when their first
 difficulties are,  by an ingenuous mind surmounted, rarely
 fail to delight and captivate, and absorb the whole soul, more
 than any thing else that can become the subject of investi
 gation or continued thought.           With Dr. Ron son       1        it
 was perfectly so. His first progress in mathematics was
 easy and rapid ;  and, as he advanced, his passion for invest
 igating mathematical truth became continually more ardent,
 his intuition keener and more vivid, his perseverance         un  in

ravelling the most complex and tedious intricacies of de
duction, still more steady.
    Of antiknt mathemamics, in all its parts, he was
soon a master ; but, as it employs words for its signs in rea
soning, as it ventures on few daring abbreviations and el
lipses in its chains of demonstration, as its forms are apt to
cumber and cramp the march of a vigorous mind in tracing
mathematical truth, as it is in many respects ill-adapted to
those calculations and inquiries which the due prosecution
of the modern discoveries in astronomy and other parts of
physics necessarily demands, — it was, therefore, natural that
he should earnestly proceed to the study of a System, of Signs
for the use of mathematical reasoning, and of methods of ab
breviation founded on the peculiar convenience of those signs,
which were much fitter to give due scope to the intuitive
force and activity of reasoning powers like his. Algebra
engaged and pleased him still more than the previous parts of
mathematics.       He was especially delighted with that mode
of it, for the honour of whose invention Newton and Leib
nitz, with perhaps nearly equal claims, contended, and
which,       bysubjecting the relations of infinite quantities and
magnitudes to strict mathematical estimate, seems absolutely
to exalt and enlarge the powers of man beyond the native
destination of humanity.        As he took peculiar delight in
                                                     a
the study of fluxions,           he, of course, advanced in the
                                       so
knowledge of them far beyond any of his fellow-students.
He pursued them eagerly in all their applications to the cal
culations of astronomy, of mechanics, and even of moral
probabilities.    He contrived to employ them in the solution
of variety of problems, in regard to which more prolix me
  a
thods of demonstration had been hitherto used.
    Nor was his proficiency confined to mathematics alone,
even at the time of his being the most ardently devoted to
this study.     He excelled in the knowledge of those authors
who belong to the province of polite literature, in taste to
discern their beauties, and in (kill to enrich his mind with
the moral wisdom with which they are pregnant.            He en
tered deep into the study of moral philosophy.        He became
no mean proficient in that philosophy of public œconomy
and legislation which at that time was with singular fond
ness cultivated at Glasgow.         To the professional study of
theology, indeed, he became first indifferent, and then
averse; not, however, out of any scepticism concerning the
 truths of Christianity, but from that strong passion which en
gaged him to devote his whole life,          were possible, to the

     The study    of mathematics     has generally the effect ta fbrni
  to pensive   and   composed   habits ofthought, the student who
  attaches himself to it earnestly.        It had, at an early hour,
  this influence on Dr. Robison.                In social converse he
  was the delight of his" fellow-lludents, and was capable of as
  much vivacity and cheerfulness even as those among them
  who might be the most innocent of profound thought. But,
  he delighted     to shut himself up and muse alone in his cham
  ber, to steal out in solitary walks along the banks of the
  Clyde, to indulge in that studious melancholy which is so
  much akin to true genius.          It was not without a fort of
  friendly  violence   that  he  could  be carried from this employ
  ment of his hours away into society.           But his conversation,
  when he could be brought among them, was too engaging,

     He was contemporary as a student in the university of
  Glasgow with a number, of gentlemen, professors and stu
  dents, who, like himself, Will ever be distinguished among
  the first ornaments of the age to which they belong.         He ob
  tained the friendstiip of Mr.. Windham, lately Secretary at
  Wart who was then acquiring, under           Millar     and Smith,
  the principles of political, œcumenical, and legislative phi
  losophy. Richardson, since eminent as a poet, a critic,
  a philosopher, and a professor, about that time finished his
  studies at Glasgow, and went to Russia in the family of the
' late Lord Cathcart, the British Ambassador to that Court.
  Dr. John Gillies, the learned interpreter of Aristotle,
  was then entering successfully upon the studies in which he
  has become since so eminent.             Dr. Robison lived, fora
  time, in the house of Principal Leechm an, one of the molt
  pious, learned, and liberal-minded divines, that adorned any
  religious establishment in the eighteenth century.
     The civilization of Russia, as far as it has advanced,
  has been the work chiefly of the Germans and the Scots.
  Her Imperial Majesty, Catharine the Second, was then re
  viving the great naval designs of Peter the First.         She was,
  for that end, desirous to establish marine schools, in which
  young sea-officers might be instructed in those parts of ma
  thematics without         which a ship's reckoning cannot be
  kept, observations cannot be made at sea, nor can the dutic»
   of a naval engineer be performed. By the intervention, we

marine schools.      Dr. Robison, glad to escape from the-
logy   to  the  professional pursuit ofmathematies, was one of
the foremost to embrace the invitation.             He went from
Glasgow    to St. Peterfburgh   ;  and  entered soon after upon his
functions, as the mathematical teacher in a marine school, we
believe, at Cronstadt.
   In teaching mathematics he was employed to his wishes;
but he soon felt it exceedingly irktome to pass his days in ex
plaining the first simple elements of that science, to youths
rude, turbulent, careless, and illiterate, and in whose native
language he had, for a time, some difficulty to make himself
readily understood.       The emoluments of his appointment
were comparatively small ; and the manner of living differed
so much from that to which he had been accustomed in Scot
land, as to be considerably disagreeable to him. He found
that, for his favourite science, he had made a great sacrifice,
and had actually gone into a painful exile.
   Yet he was not without experiencing some flattering con
solations : his address and personal appearance, uncommonly
graceful and stately, bespeaking rather a military man of
nigh rank, than an obscure mathematician, recommended
him to the polite notice of the best company wherever he
had occasion to appear.         He had become in Scotland a
freemason; and his connexion with that fraternity intro
duced him, with advantage,            to many respectable persons
who were enthusiasts for freemasonry in Russia.              There
were at St. Peterfburgh some Scottish merchants, men of
pleasing manners and liberal education, who knew how to
estimate merit and talents like Dr. Robison's, at their just
value; and were, therefore, ever ready to distinguish him by
every agreeable civility in their power.          Of these, he de
lighted chiefly in the society of Mr. Pouter, a gentle
man who, after passing like himself with the highest suc
cess through a complete course of academical study,            had
been led by the circumstances of his life to engage in trade
at St. Peterfburgh ; and, with manners the most amiable and
the best of hearts, unites such a knowledge of books with
so much of deep insight into the human character in all its
diversities, and such a {kill in the modes of business, as one
shall very rarely find together in one man in any country,
•r in any condition of lite.
   But it was, above all, in the pursuit of mathematical and
philosophical discovery that Dr. Robison found his best
resource for amusement in Russia.         An occasion fortunately
arose to enable him to turn that discovery to advantage.         A,
Plan was required by the Empress, according to which the

  rate pension for life, were his rewards for a service so ac
 ceptable.
     All this, however, could not make him prefer Russia to
 the remembrance of Scotland ; and his desire of return to his
 native country was at length fulfilled.           He was, about 25
 years   since,  upon  the   death  or  retirement   of Mr. Russel,
 invited, in consequence of the high reputation to which he
 had attained, to> fill the chair 01 natural philosophy in the
 university of Edinburgh.
     High expectations bad been raised of extraordinary abi
 lity to be displayed in his lectures in that situation. It was
 amply gratified. The writer of this sketch heard his lec
 tures in the session of 1780-81, and in some sessions subse
quent; and it is but justice to own, that, in accuracy of de
 finition, in clearness, brevity, and elegance of demonstration,
in neatness and precision in experiments, in the comprehen
 siveness of his course, extending to every branch of physics
 and of mixed mathematics, and even in fullness of detail in
 each particular division, a more perfect system of academical
 lectures is not to be easily imagined.          Yet, as men of great
original genius in science        cannot   easily endure to dwell for
ever in the detail    of  its  simplest  and  most familiar elements ;
as they find it often difficult     to  confine  themselves to the use
of those media in reasoning          and   demonstration     which are
alone intelligible     to   ignorance ;    as their   natural march of
thought is not seldom too bold and rapid to be closely fol
lowed by genius and knowledge much less than their own ;
not a few, even of the most ingenious of Dr. Rob i son's
hearers, were found, at times, to complain, that they could not
always, with clear understanding, pursue him through those
series of demonstration of the truths in mixed mathematics,
with which his lectures were silled. He heard their com
plaints with kindness, and endeavoured to accommodate hi»
instructions still more and more to their apprehension. But,
till Mr. Playfair, the present Professor of mathematics-
in that university, had persuaded the young men intending to
study natural philosophy, to pay much more previous atten
tion than had been usual to pure mathematics, the subject
of the complaint was never entirely removed.

 in its application to the useful arts, .he condescended to con

Freemasons might, in this revolutionary age, be abused
to dangerous purposes,      he broke off, some years since, his
 connexion with that fraternity; and wrote and published an
 eloquent book to explain the grounds of his fears, and the
 reasons of his secession.    We presume not to judge between
 him and his opponents        this matter

that, after each process      of vapouring, the (luffs be    rinsed " al
ways in water a littleyosl^y, made with 2 oz. of that substance
for each Ib. of wool."          It may be necessary to caution those
who have never made any experiments in bleaching with sul
phureous acid vapour, that soap even of the very best quality
will always give the stusss z.yelloiv tint, and that too though
it be used in only i-4th the quantity here prescribed.                 In
deed, from a number of experiments made about three years
ago, (which I now quote from memory) I am convinced,
 that to attain a bright white, by the use of soap after the sul
 phureous acid, will be a very difficult, if not impracticable,
 attempt. Of silk I may venture to speak more positively;
 that the brightest white possible to be. made, cannot be pro
 duced where soap has been used after the sulphuring process.
 It is in vain, however, to have recourse to the expensive and
 dubious effort of soap, when weak alkaline leys are equally
 safe for the stuffs, much cheaper, and much more certain of
 producing a bright white.            In some peculiar kinds of silk,
 where the sulphureous         acid    vapour, (applied nearly in the
 fame manner        as directed  in  O'Reilly's-valuable essay)- the oxy-
 muriatic     acid,  with  soaps   and  alkaline leys, have' all failed to
 produce     a bright white,      it has  been effected by a mixture of
 sulphuric     and   muriatic   acids,  diluted  so as not to impair the
 texture    of  the   cloth.  The    proportions of the latter I cannot     ,
 at present specify.

  prove acceptable to your readers ; and the more so as it seldom

  which can make them witness the facts                I mean briefly to

rising to the top of the water, as if the latent sire, by kindling,
had diminished the specific gravity of the body, (which in
length was about four lines, and in diameter one line); soon
after I saw another, and another yet appeared, until there
might be about twenty of them, all formed alike ; i. e. large
toward the head, with a tuft of sine white hair issuing from
each side of the appa enl mouth.        The fieht being novel     I
took my station, and a few good magnifiers to watch the
event ; for, seeing so vigorous an exertion in each one, and
in so uncommon and frantic a way, as the delicacy of their
muscles did not seem equal to support long, I anticipated a
catastrophe   of some kind or other.         Ihad the curiosity to
touch several to try what effect it would produce, and found
it a stimulus adding new energy to their already amazing
agility.   They continued these violent contortions and dila
tations until they appeared quite spent ; in the last effort, how
ever, and after a sudden contraction, and as sudden an ex
pansion, with a kind of wriggle (they have no fins), they
would come quite to the surface of the water, and, an intestine
 motion taking place, a cleft began to appear upon the back
part of the head of this little amphibious creature, out of
which, to my great astonisliment, I saw emerging, as if pro
 pelled by an inward screw, a creature quite of another ele
 ment, form, and quality ; in a word, a gregarious fly, a gnat ;
 from which I judged, (not understanding the metempsychosis)
 that the ova mult have been deposited in the mud, and that
 in this bed, under the agency of the parent fly, or. perhaps
 nature, the nidification was performed while the incubation
 was perfected by the water and fun ; the last of which had
 now bellowed its quickening influence, and revived them from
their torpid state. The confines of their prison, wherein both
wings and lesrs were contracted and bound down to their
bodies in a very small compass, (as I have stated above) be
ginning to rend asunder, at first appeared their beautiful an
tenna;  (ifmales), or more beautiful plumage      (iffemales)

with more promising creatures       ; the head being now wholly
advanced, the body next appears with wings and legs, which
 heretofore were bound up      in  kind of swathing, but now re

And now,wholly emancipated, they stretch their silken pinions,

            Leave earthly cares and emulate the ikies.
     Some few, however, fell victims to that element which had
 first cherished them ; for if by any accident they happened
 to fall into the water, and their wings got wet, they were in
 capable of disengaging themselves (yet those that           I saw so cir
 cumstanced      I set at liberty) : others, though comparatively
 few, came to the birth, and were incapable, through want of
 strength, to bring forth, in which cafe I undertook, by the
 assistance of two needles, the part of accoucheur and brought
 them forth, though much maimed.

        HE    islands  of Banda, situated 130 miles to the south
south-east     of Amboyna, are ten in number, viz. Banda Neira,
 Gonong Api, Banda Lantoir, Pulo Ay, Pulo Rondo, Ro-
 syngen, Pulo Pisang, Craka, Capella, and Sonangy ; of these,
 Banda Neira is the feat of the supreme government of the
 whole.      In Gonong Api there is a volcano which constantly
 emits smoke, sometimes accompanied with a crackling noise :
 the surface of the ifland is covered with a quantity of sulphur
 and chalk.       There is no vegetation whatever on upwards of
one-third of the eminence on which the volcano is situated :
 there is a steep descent on the outside of it toward the sea, but,
 towards the harbour, the declivity slopes gradually to the
water, on the side of which are some plantations and a few

straggling houses.   In the space between Banda Lantoir and
these two islands there is a very good harbour, formed with
entrances both from the east ana west, which enable vessels
to enter it in either of the monsoons : these channels are well
defended with several batteries, particularly the western one,
which   is,  moreover, very narrow. Between Gonong Api and
Banda Neira there        is
                         a     third channel into this harbour from
the north, but     it   isnavigable only to small vessels. Pulo Ay
is   about nine miles west of Gonong Api, and Pulo Rondo
about four miles further, in somewhat             more northerly

yields some fine fruits, as well as mace and cocoa nuts, but
not any nutmegs.           Rosyngen       about seven miles to the

south-east of Banda Lantoir;             produces mace and yams,
an'.l feeds some cattle.       The convicts of Amboyna used to be
kept   on  this island, and were compelled to cultivate the land
for the use of the supreme government.               The other three
islands are nothing more than small barren rocks.
   The nutmeg-tree           cultivated only in the four first men
                             is
tioned of these islands       ;but the Dutch thought      advisable to

                                       in
of their distance from the feat of government, and of their
thereby affording greater opportunities of smuggling.              The
island of Banda Lantoir appears very high from the sea               its
                                                                       ;

table land, which extends nearly from one end of the island
to the other. The Banda islands are all high             but Gonong

almond-tree grows in great plenty, and            very useful, as well

for the shelter    it  affords the nutmeg-trees, as for the fruit           it
yields.     There are also sandal-wood trees, and           variety of

ferent islands, trees of all kinds are permitted to grow, as
they are considered useful in keeping off the spray of the sea

 work towards the sea.         In this fort the troops are quartered,
 and    the public granaries are kept ; but the storehouses for
 the nutmeg and mace are on the outside of the fortress,
 and situated near the government house. Above Fort Nassau,
 on an eminence, stands the cattle of Belgica * ; an old pen
 tagon with round towers at the angles, and a surrounding
 wall with small bastions; but it has no dilch : it is iaid to
 have been built by the Portuguese.            The next fortress of any
 consequence     is  situated   on the  ifland  of Banda Lantoir, and
 is called Fort Holandia.        It commands the western entrance
 into the harbour of Lantoir; but the works are very flimsy,
 and quite defenceless towards the land.
     At a first view, the situation of this fortress appears infi
 nitely preferable to that of any in these islands tor the rest -
 dence of the supreme government, not only on account of its
 being the strongest, and the most commanding situation, but
 from this ifland being the largest, as well as the richest, in
 respect to the produce of spices. Its unhealthfulness, however,
 proves a sufficient objection ; and numbers of houses, now
mouldering into decay, show that the experiment has been
tried, and found not to answer : moreover the water is laid
to be bad, and the vapour, which sometimes descends from
the volcanic mountain of Gonong Api, is represented as being
particularly noxious.       These circumstances seem to be con
firmed by the experience of the Wirtemberg company, who
formerly garrisoned this fort; and out of a hundred men
eight died, and forty fell sick, in the course of two months.
    Besides the above-mentioned forts, there are a number of
redoubts and military posts all round these islands, for the
purpose of preventing smuggling, and of protecting the plant
ations and the villages situated on the shores against the pre
datory invasions of the Papoo pirates, who infest these seas in
large prows, and frequently land and carry off the inhabit
ants, and whatever else they can take by surprize, though
they are seldom hardy enough to attack where resistance may
be expected.       The two redoubt3 of Kyk and the Kap, both
situated on the south fide of Gonong Api, were originally in
tended to defend the -west channel of Lantoir harbour; but,
owing to the irruption of the volcano in 1778, at the lame
time that a dreadful hurricane laid waste the whole of the
islands, the lava flowed down in such quantities as to form
a considerable promontory between these batteries and the

in a great degree, useless.          Some material improvements,

 howeyer, which have been recently made to the batteries of
Batavia and Sebergorberg, have put the western channel into
 a state of security ; and a new battery, which has been erected
 on the north-east part of Banda Neira, renders it a difficult
 matter to force an entrance into the harbour by the eastern
  channel.
     The frame of this government is different from that of
Amboyna; the whole society consists of the company's serv
 ants, some burghers, and slaves. The sole object of their
 attention being the care and cultivation qf the nutmeg-trees,
 the affairs of government cannot be supposed to be very com
 plicated : nevertheless it is at present a distinct establishment,
 consisting of a governor, a council of three, and a secretary,
 together with a regular court of justice as at Amboyna; but
 the governor of Banda not being subject to the check, much
 less the control, of any superior authority, his will may be
justly considered the only law of the settlement.
     The Dutch company were the absolute proprietors of the
 soil, as well as of the slaves who cultivate it. The rearing of
 the nutmeg-tree being the onlv object in view, those islands
 that produce it are divided into a number of plantations, or
         as they are termed, which are superintended       by native
 Earks,
   urghers, descendants of the Dutch, who originally settled
 in these islands.     A certain number of slaves belonging to
 the company is allotted to each park, whom the park-keepers
 employ in the cultivation of the nutmeg-trees.             They are
 ordered to fend daily two-thirds of their slaves to the parks to
 clear the trees and to gather the ripe fruit, as well as to pick up
 all that may have fallen from the trees in the night: for this
 purpose each Have is furnished with a small basket and a hoe.
     When the nutmegs arc brought in, the mace is stripped
 off, and kept in baskets to dry in the fun ; and the nutmegs
 with sliells on, are put into a drying-house allotted for the
 purpose, where they remain, on hurdles exposed to the in
 fluence of a slow fire, and to smoke, for about three months ;
 when they are dry, their sliells are broken, and the fruit put
 immediately into chunam or lime, which is necessary to pre
 serve them from worms and other insects.         It requires much
 experience, as well as a considerable degree of judgment, to
¦ascertain the precise time that they sliould be suffered to re
 main in the lime ; for if they be taken out too soon they are
 worm-eaten, and if left too long in    it, they are burnt up, and
 rendered useless.    After the nutmegs are taken out of the
 lime, they are cleaned and packed up in rattan bales of
 aoolb. ready for being shipped.       The mace   is  delivered into
 storehouses every month, and the nutmegs every three
                              Z  4                          months;

360             Brief Account of the Islands of Ban a.J
months      : they are both paid for on delivery, the mace at 7^
stivers per pound,     and the nutmeg at 2 .      From this price,
however, a deduction is made of 17 per tent, from the weight
of the spices; 10 per cent, in favour of the company as an
acknowledgment of their right to the foil, and 7 per cent, in
favour of the servants of the company.           The 7 per cent, is
an old custom ; but the additional 10 per       cent,   has only been
levied a few years previous to the arrival of the Englith.
     The quantity of nutmeas and mace produced tor several
rears past, has been inconsiderable, owing to an unaccounta
ble inattention in the collection of them.         But since the ar
 rival   of  Mr. Boeckholtz,  the   late Dutch  governor, the pro
 duce was so much increased, that the haf-vearlv collection,
 which was found in store when taken possession of by the
 Engli(l) in 1796, amounted to 81,618 lb. of nutmegs, and
 23,385 lb. of mace.      This was the first half year's crop since
 Mr.    ijoeckholtz's  government had commenced ; the crop of
 the half year following equalled it in quantity; and in future
 years, under proper management, the quantity produced may
 with confidence be supposed to average 600, coo pounds of
 cloves, and 200,000 pounds of nutmegs — an estimate founded
 upon the most moderate computations of the most experienced
 and best informed persons in the Spice islands.
      The nutmeg-tree grows to the size of a pear tree ; its leaves
 resemble those of the laurel ; it begins to bear fruit at ten
 years growth, and the fruit improves in quality and increases in
  quantity until the tree has attained the age of a hundred years.
•It requires to be securely slieltered from the hurricanes to
  which these islands arc sometimes exposed ; for many of the
  nutmeg-trees are situated on the steepest sides of the hills,
  where they cannot take deep root, and by consequence are
  likely to be torn up by sudden gusts of wind.           It is asserted
  that tile chief loss which the nutmeg plantations sustained by
  the hurricane in 1778, was in consequence of a great many
  of the almond- trees, which had afforded them slielter, having
  been cut down.
      The nutmeg, when ripe on the tree, has both a very curious
   and beautiful appearance : it is about the size of an apricot,
   and nearly of a similar colour, with the fame kind of hollow
   mark all round it ; in sliap-; it is somewhat like a pear : when
   perfectly ripe, the rind over the mark opens, and discovers
   the mace, of a deep red, growing over and covering in part
   the thin sliell of the nutmeg, which is black.
       There are persons called foresters who superintend the parks
   and the drying of the nutmegs and mate.          They are directed
    to make regular reports to the governor respecting the state of
                                                                      the

the different parks, and of the quantity of spices which they
yield.     Besides these persons there are directors of the parks,
who visit them every month to fee that the trees are properly
attended to, and planted at regular dillances from each other ;
and also to observe whether the foresters are active and careful
in the execution of their duty.
     Almost the whole of these islands being appropriated to
the cultivation of nutmegs, they neither feed cattle nor pro
duce grain enough tor the maintenance of the inhabitants.
Like Amboyna, they have therefore been supplied annually
 from Batavia with rice and other articles of provision.
     All the aforesaid regulations concerning the cultivation of
 the nutmeg-trees, and the price paid for the produce of them,
 were established by the late Dutch governor, who arrived
 about fifteen months before the English took possession of the
 Banda islands.      Previous to his arrival, most of the planters
 were in great distress, having been charged with very heavy
 debts incurred on account of loans in rice and money, made
 at different periods, to the former governors : and this cir
 cumstance, together with the great loss which they sustained
 by the dreadful hurricane in 1788, entirely ruined their pri
  vate fortunes as well as their plantations.     In this distressful
  situation, the  Dutch government,    with  a  wicked avarice, ag
  gravated their misery by compelling them to deliver their
  nutmegs at the reduced price of three farthings per pound,
  and the mace at a still lower rate.         Under the pressure of
  this accumulated distress, the spirit which had animated their
  fathers in the rude days of their savage independence seemed
  once again to revive, and they remonstrated in bold and de
  termined language : thev claimed the lands as their own pre
  scriptive inheritance, and actually proceeded to portion them
  out to each other. And the Dutch, though unsusceptible of
  any feelings of remorse for their own oppressive folly, which
  had reduced the country to this deplorable condition, had yet
  prudence enough to avert, by conciliatory measures, the im
  minent danger which threatened them ; and when they found
  that the fury of the people was not to be appeased but by ample
  concessions, they gladly consented to grant them.          But the
  general idleness,  and  consequent neglect   of the nutmeg plant
  ations, to which this insurrection had given birth, reduced
  the annual quantity of spices from 600,000 lbs. to 53,0 olbs.
  weight. It was thought adviseable, therefore, by the supreme
  government of Batavia, to adopt the scheme of reform pro
   posed by Mr. Boeckholtz, and to appoint him governor of
   the Banda islands.    One of the first acts of his government
   was entirely to cancel the old artear of debt, which was con-
                   5                                          sidered

362          Brief Account of the Islands of Banda.
fidered as due from several of the planters to the company,
and which most of them were little able to pay : he also made
some judicious regulations with respect to the government of
the slaves. The price of the spices was likewise raised at this
time, from the old low rate to that at which it is now fixed.
   The alterations were supposed to hold out great encourage
ment to the planters to give more attention to the culture of
the nutmeg-trees, and thereby to increase the quantity of the
 annual produce. But, however specious this supposition may
seem, it is utterly unfounded in truth ; for it will appear evi
dent, from a close examination of the subject, that although
the system of regulations established by Boeckholtz be co
loured with justice, it in fact depends on, and is intimately
blended with, the most despotic principles, as the following
circumstances will sufficiently explain.   The debt which the
Dutch government take the merit of having cancelled as an
act of indulgence, deserves not to be considered in that light ;
for the principal part of it was incurred on account ofrice
and other articles of provision given to the planters for their
own use and for that of their slaves, and without which they
would have perislied and the settlement have been annihilated.
And for this debt the planters certainly never expected to be
made accountable, having, at the time they received        it,
                                                           con
sideredit  asa donation upon which their existence -depended.
As to their other debts on account of loans of money, &c.
though there were some individuals who, from idleness and
inattention, were in low circumstances, and unable to dis
charge them without mortgaging their little property, yet
the greater part of the planters would have much rather con
tinued in possession of their parks, and paid the just deniands
upon them, than, under colour of remission of these' debts,
be deprived of that which, from long undisputed possession,
they considered as their actual right.      Besides,  it  appears
that some of the planters had purchased their land from the
company  ;   and for the company, therefore, to repossess them
selves or those lands   bycompulsion, was an act compounded
of wanton insult, treachery, and tyranny, which, as         justi
                                                           it
fied the most exemplary vengeance,     so
                                        itdemands the severest
reprobation.
    In the four islands which produce nutmegs, there are fifty-
seven plantations, and 1708 staves; but there   is no regularity
either in the division of the plantations or in the distribution
of the slaves and
             :     it   would be one of the most essential steps
towards the improvement of these islands to make an accurate
survey of them, to have the plantations better proportioned,
and their boundaries more clearly defined.        From the best
                                                    information,

             Brief Account of the Islands of Banda.            363
information, it also appears requisite to procure about 800
additional (laves, in order to bring the plantations into the
highest state of cultivation.
    The want of inhabitants in these iflands seems to impose
the unfortunate necessity of keeping up the above-mentioned
number of public slaves; though, whtn the expense attend
ing their maintenance is compared with the little work they
perform, thev must be considered as the moll expensive people
that could be employed. When works of any magnitude arc
carrying on, government are obliged to hire, at a very dear
rate, the few free artizans who are willing to work, as well
as the private slaves of individuals, whose labour their masters
turn to great advantage.
    Exclusive of the provisions sent annually from Batavia to
the Banda islands, there is also sent a large supply of piece
goods, cutlery, iron, and other articles of merchandize, which
are fold by auction either quarterly or at such periods as the
governor knows the inhabitants arc best able to pav for them :
upon all these articles there is a profit of fifty per cent. The
burghers, and Chinese merchants fettled here, not only buy
up all the coods which are fold on the company's account,
but also those which are imported by individuals.         For, be
 sides their own consumption, the Chinese merchants export
the aforesaid articles to the islands of Aron, New Guinea,
Ceram, and the south-west islands, between all of which and
the Banda islands there is a constant traffic carried on.        In
return, they get from Ceram, sagoe in bread and flour, and
sometimes lalted deer; and from Aion they get pearls, birds
nests, and tortoise (hells.   From these islands they are also
supplied   with  slaves.
    The islands which lie south-east of Banda are very low, and
surrounded with dangerous rocks and slioals.        The natives of
them as well as those of New Guinea are extremely treacherous
in their dispositions and savage in their manners, notwithstand
ing which the Dutch have a continual intercourse with them.
    The south-west islands, as they are called, are seven in
number, the chief of which is Kissier, in which the resident
or governor of the whole resides. His garrison consists of fifty
men, a few of whom are attached to the adjoining islands.
The only advantage drawn from these iflands is some sandal
wood and salted deer, which they produce, and a few slaves
which they furnish. The inhabitants of them are represented
by the Dutch as being excessively ferocious. They appear
to be a mixed breed, between the Coflerees of Africa and the
Fopoos, or natives of New Guinea : their hair is neither so
                                                              (hort

 (hort or woolly as the one, nor so long and bushy as the
 other; but in their features they bear a resemblance to both.
     In the last account of the Banda and south-west islands,
 all of which are under the fame government, the numbers of
 all descriptions of people were as follow * : The islands of
 Banda contain 5763 inhabitants, of which 119 are Europe
 ans; and the south-west islands contain 38,266, of whom
 232a were natives, who have been converted to the Christian
 faith.     From this statement it appears that the population of
 the south-west islands is very considerable, though the Dutch
 derived little benefit from them. Although so great a number
 of the inhabitants of these islands have embraced Christianity,
 yet it seems to have had very little effect in promoting civili-r
 zation among them ; and, unless the Dutch kept possession
 of those islands, in order to prevent other European powers
 from establishing themselves in any situation that might open
 an avenue of communication between them and the Spice
 islands, the dispersing their troops and extending their posses
 sions to such inconvenient, unprofitable, and hazardous di
 stances, cannot well be accounted for.
     However, as it is no less opposite to the policy than unsuit
 able to the disposition of the English to extend their conquests
 from such a motive, or form establishments on such princi
  ples, it is unnecessary to take these islands under our consi
 deration in the following suggestions, which we throw out for
  the better management of the spice trade in Banda.
     The circumstance of Banda having been hitherto a distinct
 government, has at different times produced very inconve
  nient effects ; and the great distance of Banda from the su*
  preme government of Batavia has rendered it difficult to de
 tect those delinquencies which are said to have existed for se
 veral years past in the administration of that island.                  Hence
  the governors being        left without    check    or  control,   and  their
  council possessing merely        a nominal      power, they      attended   to
  nothing but      their  own   private advantage,       and   made    no other
  use of the authority with which they were invested, but to
  defraud the company from whom they derived it : they not
  only sent spices to the neighbouring islands on their own ac
  count, but even supplied the natives of them with fire-arms,
  aud military stores at the very time when these people were
  at war with the government of Amboyna.                    If, therefore, we
  consider    the   value   of  the  Banda     islands,    together with the
.evils which     have   arisen  from   the  manner      in  which they have
     * The Aron islands, though also dependent on the government of Banda,
  are not included  in this account of the population.
                                                                           been

             Brief Account of the Islands of Banda.              365
been governed, it appears essential' to put them under the
authority of the governor of Amboyna.           He will thereby be
enabled, from the contiguity of his place of residence, to
make himself acquainted with all the occurrences in the sub
ordinate settlement, regulate its intercourse with the adjacent
countries, furnish it with every necessary supply, receive re
gular returns of the state and produce of its plantations, and
finally, punisti every infringement of the established regula
tions.    By these means the assairs of the Spice islands might
be conducted with an union and consistency which would at
once extend their commerce and consolidate their strength.
    With regard to the dispute between the Dutch company and
the native burghers, relative to the right claimed by the latter of
a property in the soil, though it behoves the justice of our govern
ment to investigate that claim, it were little instructive to our
readers to enter into a consideration of it; for it cannot be of
much consequence to have it ascertained who is the nominal
proprietor of the soil, when the whole of its produce is mo
nopolized by government. As the want of population, there
fore, seems to be the greatest hindrance to the progress of
 improvement, the planters stiould be encouraged to increase
 the number of their slaves; and, in order to give them an
 interest in the produce of the soil, they should have the pri
vilege of transferring their property.
    1 he company are, at present, obliged to furnish the Banda
i Hands with rice and other provisions at a rate so low as to
subject them to a considerable loss; they are also liable to a
vague and undefined charge on account of new buildings and
 repairs for storehouses, &x. all of which, in the general scale
of expenditure, mould be considered as deductions from the
value of the spices.     It would therefore be not only a material
saving to the company, but far more suitable to the interests
of the planters themselves, to increase the price of the spices,
and make them chargeable with all the expenses attending
those buildings and repairs ; and also to furnisli themselves
with rice, which, however, the government must at any rate
supply, but in this way would not lose by thaj; obligation
 which necessity has imposed on them.
    Upon investigating this subject with the most impartial
and best informed persons at Banda, it appeared evident that
this mode of arrangement would be the molt agreeable to the
people, and the most likely to produce beneficial effects to
the state; and, with regard to the increase necessary to be
made to the present price of the spices, an addition of J{ d.
for the nutmegs, and 15 d. for the mace, per pound, would
sufficiently satisfy the planters.
                                                                  As

  those who purchase them, and the selling of them be made
  punishable by the forfeiture of all the property of the delin

                          THE NEW PLANET.
  OIX       astronomers of Lilienthal, near Bremen, have formed
  an association of twenty-four practical astronomers, charged
  with corresponding from different parts of Europe, and whose
  object is to search for the planet supposed to exist between
  Mars and Jupiter, on account of the great distance of these
  two celestial bodies. M. Bode, the well known astronomer of
 Berlin, maintains that this planet to be discovered is nothing
  else than the comet seen by Piazzi.         But the association are
  not satisfied with this idea.      They have chosen as their pre
  sident M. Schrœter of Lilienthal ; they have divided the
  whole zodiac among the twenty-four associate correspond
  ents, in *order that each in his department may more easily
  follow the traces of the bodies, the position of which they are
  desirous of ascertaining.       Almost all the astronomers selected

                           EARTHQUAKES.
  An earthquake was felt at Edinburgh on Monday the 7th
of September, at fix in the morning.  It extended through
Fife, along the north bank of the Forth, from Kirkaldy                        fcy
Aberdown, Dunfermline,    Kincardine and Alloa    likewise        ;
northwards     byKinross, to some distance in      north-west di

rection to Cailander, and various parts of Perthshire.         At
Stirling and Glasgow the (hock was also very distinctly felt,
at nearly the same time as in the other places mentioned.
The appearances were nearly alike in all. At Edinburgh                       it
continued two or three seconds      was preceded by
                                       ;                rumbling,

ous, undulating motion, something resembling the motion of
the waves of the sea.       Beds, tables, chairs, &c.        some       in
houses were observed to make, resembling the rocking of                       a
cradle. Some persons who felt        had

warm, and calm      ;the barometer high, and the thermometer
about 5c. The preceding day, Sunday, there was good deal       a

had the best opportunities of observation, thought they felt
 two small shocks, and in their situations,     things that were
hanging on the walls were evidently moved from their places,
occasioning some noise.      Many people were awakened from
their sleep hy the motion which they felt in their beds, which
they generally describe by the rocking of a cradle, or as isa
person had lifted up one side of the bed from the floor, to
which a tremulous motion succeeded for a short space. At
 Grangemouth, and over all that neighbourhood, two pretty
severe shocks were felt, one at four, the other at six in the
 morning.
   At Crieff it resembled the sudden fall of a house, attended
with a rumbling noise, which continued about the space of
fix seconds.   It appeared to go from West to East. One per
son states that the roof over his head cracked, and appeared
as if it would burst.  The rattling of the dislies on the (helves,
and the loose partitions, helped to increase the fears of the
people, who ran to the doors.
   A letter from Stirlingshire describes it in the fame manner.
The writer fays, " at ten minutes before fix, I was surprised
with a sudden shaking of my bed, which continued for about
half a minute. The motion seemed to come from beneath,
but I can say nothing else concerning its direction.       A ser
vant who sleeps in a room adjoining lo my barn, was alarmed
by the creaking which it occasionecT in the joists.    There was
not a breath or wind, and the sky, though somewhat cloudy,
was altogether calm.     Soon after the morning became very
bright   and  warm ; nor was there any mist on Benlomond,
Eenledy,   or any of the neighbouring mountains."
   On the morning when it was felt, the gable of a barn, a
few miles to the westward of Edinburgh, where some sliearers
were sleeping, fell in, whether from the instability of the
building, or the concussion of the earthquake, is uncertain;
but the unfortunate tenants were completely buried in the
rubbish.    When the accident was discovered, and these poor
people dug out, two women were found dead, and another
very much bruised, who was immediately brought to the
Royal Infirmary. The others, eight or ten in number, were
not much hurt.
   It was observed at Leith, that the tides, for three days, had
not ebbed so much as usual at the then age of the moon ; so
much so, that the workmen at the New Dock had not been
able to accomplim the work they ordinarily do while the tide
is out.

   The foreign journals also notice an earthquake having taken
place at Colniar on the morning of the nth of September,
which had spread a considerable degree of alarm.          That
morning, at a quarter past one, a great number of people
were awakened by a hollow noise and certain agitation, which
was felt in the houses, and shook the furniture.          Several
{hocks followed the first : at a quarter past two, there was one
pretty strong.
                     WATER-PROOF CLOTH.
      Todiscover a process for rendering cloth water-proof,
without    at the fame time rilling its pores in such a manner
as to prevent perspiration, has long been a desideratum.             It
gives us pleasure to announce a discovery which promises             so
many advantages, in point of health and comfort, to all ranks
in the community.            By savour of the patentees, Messrs.
Ackermann, Suardy,          and  Co. we are enabled to present our
readers  with  a  specimen    of the  art, namely, a piece of blotting
paper;   one-halt   of which   has  been  subjected to the water-proof
process.    By sprinkling      a little water   over   it,the prepared
part will  easily  be  distinguished.
                           GALVANISM.
    Ata late meeting of the committee for apparatus of the
 Askesian Society, some experiments were made with             a  Gal
 vanic trough, of the construction invented            byCruickfhank.
 The one belonging to the society consists of sixty pieces of sil
 ver, and the fame number of pieces of zinc, each 2+ inches
 square.    They are soldered together at the four edges, and are
 very exactly in contact.      The trough    is of mahogany, with
 grooves   half an inch  apart  from   each  other.    The pieces are
                                   cement, composed of hard var
                             by
 secured in these groves     a
 nish and bee's wax. The cells between each pair were filled
 with weak solution of muriat of ammonia
           a                                            aquarter of an
 ounce to two quarts of water, which          is  nearly thequantity
 the apparatus takes.     The stiock taken from this trough          by
 two metallic conductors     is felt plainly in the moulders. The
 spasm or contraction at the time      is so severe as to deprive the
 person of the power of holding the conductors in contact with
  the end plates.   When kept in contact          by
                                                   an assistant,a  sen
  sation resembling  a highly heated fluid    is felt rustling through
  the wrists and fore-arm.
     A piece of small steel wire being made conductor to unite

                                                             observed.

  observed, With small scintillations, and had it been in oxygen
  gas, the wire would no doubt have deflagrated.
     The wire being armed at the end with a small piece of
  phosphorus, the latter inflamed instantly upon contact.
     A  connection was made from the trough to a galvanometer
  on the construction proposed by Pepys *.          Upon moving the
  regulating screws, the gold leaves, at the distance of hats an
  inch, began to divide : one of them suddenly struck the zinc
  and instantly inflamed, burning with a bright flame of a white
  colour ; — a sound was heard as though a small quantity of
  nitre had been projected upon ignited charcoal, and about a
  quarter of an inch of the gold was destroyed, leaving a smoke-
  coloured stain upon the plate of zinc.        This experiment was
  several times repeated with the fame success.
     A smaller trough, consisting of sixty pieces of silver and
  zinc, of an inch and a half square, being connected in the
  order of arrangement with the beforementioned, evidently de
  creased its power, which seems to prove that there will be no
  advantage obtained by uniting troughs of inferior powers to
  stronger ones, as is the cafe with electrical batteries; but ex
  periments are still wanting completely to determine the point.
     Professor Pictet, Mr. A.Aikin, and several other scientific
  gentlemen, were present at these experiments.
                          GERMINATION.
     E. A. Lefebure,    assistant chemist in the School of Health
  at Strahburgh, has lately made sonic curious experiments on
  germination.    As he employed in his experiments only rape-
  feed, they cannot be considered as sufficiently varied to admit
  of general conclusions; but as they may furnish hints to
  others who may be disposed to give them greater latitude,
  we shall briefly state the most striking results.
     Lefebure first observes that taking away the cotyledons
  or seed-leaves, retards and weakens vegetation, but by no
  means impedes the germination, if the upper part of the
  fibre, to which the cotyledons are attached, be not removed.
  M. Lefebure contradicts Bohmer, who fays that imbibing
  the moisture of the earth is performed merely by the umbili
  cal fibre; whereas Lefebure found, by experiments, that this
'
  function is discharged by the whole surface of the seed.      The
  earth is merely the excipient of the matter requisite for the
  germination of feeds. The conditions of tenderness, moisture,
  warmth, and darkness of colour in the excipient, are consi
  dered as necessary to the germination of the feeds deposited
  in it.    M. Lefebure, after the example of Bonnet, made
  choice of other substances for excipients, and found that
                   * See page 38 of the present Volume.

3f2                               Tbe Aris.
the seeds germinated in several of them ; but not in the oxide
of mercury, alcohol, ammonia, camphor, and saltpetre : nay,
oxide of mercury, eantharides, and salts, destroyed vitality
and the property of germinating.               Many of these matters,
aud particularly salts, seem to impede germination, chiefly
by their requiring too much water for their solution, and by
these means depriving the feeds of it: for this reason, cream
of tartar impeded germination the least, because it deprived
 the seeds the least of water.       Ashes also impeded germination
 as    long  as thev contained soluble salts, but as loon as they
 were     oxidated they promoted that process.             M. Lefebure
 examined also the different depths of the earth at which feeds
 germinate, the necessity of drawing the carbon from the
 earth, and of the access of atmospheric air. Though many
 cafes are known in which feeds have germinated without the
 access of air, (hut up in animal bodies or in potatoes, the
 matter of light, however, was not excluded.
      Of the different kinds of gas of which the atmosphere con-
 fists, germination requires oxygen alone.               Carbonic acid,
  hydrogen, and azote, on the other hand, impeded germination
  without destroying vitality.         Seeds grew in atmospheric air,
  however, mixed with different substances, provided it contained
 oxygen. The air in which feeds had germinated,            M. Lefebure
                                                      '
  found to be surcharged with carbonic acid.
      He examined also, in a more accurate manner, the influ
  ence of water on germination, and found that the more fo
  reign matter water is impregnated with, the more unfit it is
  for the purpose of germination.
                                 THE ARTS.
      In order     to diffuse a knowledge and inspire a taste for the
   fine  arts,   the  French government has resolved to establish
  galleries   in  15  of  the principal towns of the republic.      The
   principal motives for this arrangement are explained in the
   following report, presented to the Consuls of the French re
   public, by the minister of the interior, 31st of August.
      " The musæum of arts presents at this moment the richest
   collection of paintings and antique statues in Europe; there
   are to be found all the riches which were dispersed before the
   revolution.       We may reckon at present 1390 pictures of the
   foreign   schools,    270 of the antient French school, and more
   than 1000 of tbe modern school.           It possesses 20,000 designs
   of different schools, 4000 copper-plate engravings, and
   30,000 prints, besides 150 antique statues, and the most va
   luable articles in Etruscan vases, tables of porphyry, &c.
       " The immense gallery opened for public inspection can
   not contain a moiety of the cbefs d'aeuvre of which the nation
                    4                                                  i»

  is possessed.  More than 1000 pictures are deposited at Ver-
  failles, and 6 or 700 remain in the cabinets of Louvre, in ex
  pectation of a place proper to receive them.
      " The collection of these chefs d'œuvre was doubtless an
 advantage at those critical moments when the breath of Van
 dalism would have destroyed, without remorse, the works of
 genius.
     " It was an acquisition we were in want of, when our vic
 torious arms procured us the numerous riches of Italy. But
 these times are no more ! and we ought now to endeavour to
 conciliate the great advantages derivable from the arts, with
 the duties we have to fulfil towards the departments ; some
 of which have enriched us with their spoils, and all of which
 have concurred in appropriating to us the rich monuments
 of vanquished nations.
     "  Without doubt Paris ought to reserve the chefs d'œuvre
 of every kind. Paris ought to possess in its collection the
 works which most essentially belong to the history of the
 arts, which mark its progress, characterize its qualities, and
 enable the artist to read on its pictures all the revolutions
 and periods of painting.     Paris merits on every account this
 honourable distinction : but the inhabitants of the depart
 ments have also a sacred right to a share in the fruit of our
 conquests, and in the inheritance of the works of French
 artists.
     "This consideration alone will doubtless not permit the
 French government to hesitate with regard to the manner in
 which it ought to act; but this determination, which springs
 from a sentiment of justice, stiould nevertheless be fortified by
 the idea, that it is conformable to the real interest of the arts.
     " In fact, the contemplation of what is beautiful develops
 talent, and inspires the artist better than lesions.   The valu
able picture, which by being placed by the side of one still
more so is disregarded, will recover its right to admiration
when it sliall be isolated, or, to use the expression, restored to
itself. Some paintings, by being sent to the place that gave
them birth, will acquire a new interest by tradition, and the
recital os the circumstances which attach to productions of
merit.     The inhabitants of Anvers, Montpelier, and An-
delys, will be fond to stiow foreigners the chefs d'œuvre of
their countrymen Rubens, Bourdon, and Poussin ; and the
traveller will be unable to direct his steps to any part of the
republic, which will not offer a rich collection of pictures, or
the work of some men of genius who have shed lustre on
their country,
    " However, the monuments of painting must not be (In
seminated at hazard among the different points of France.

In  order that the collections may be profitable to the arts*
they ought only to be formed where a degree of knowledge
already acquired mav give them a value, and where a nume
rous population and the natural disposition of the people
afford a presage of success in the education of the pupils.    It
is for that reason I propole to form 15 grand depots of pic
tures at Lyons, Bourdeaux, Strasburgh, Brussels, Marseilles,
Rouen, Kantes, Dijon, Toulouse, Geneva,, Caen, Lisle,
Mentz, Rennes, and Nancy.
   " But it is little to have determined the places for these
depots — it is necessary to make choice of such collections as
present an interesting series of paintings of all masters, of all
kinds, and of all schools ; and I thins it is necessary to ap
point a committee charged with the labour of preparing for
each of the cities pointed out the collection adapted for
them."
     A   decree passed agreeably       to this report.

place, which rendered him an object of curiosity.
    According to the declaration of all the inhabitants of the
village, the proprietor of this horse, who has been dead some
time, finding the animal attacked with the strangles, gave
him to eat, for a whole year, leaves of the savine tree, which
grew in his garden, by way of a cure, and afterwards as a
preservative.    Soon after using this nourishment, the horse
began to have new hair, which the peasant considered as a
       symptom, and he hoped to make the horse a new animal,
  le continued therefore to supply him with this new food.
food
The hair, though beautiful, smooth, and sleek, dropped off,
and was succeeded by another coat no less beautiful : but
after some months the hair disappeared entirely, in such a
manner that the horse became quite naked.         Nature, how
ever, made a last effort ; the hair grew up for the third time ;
but it at last dropped off entirely, the peasant always conti
nuing his treatment with the green leaves of the savine tree.
    The horse therefore became naked and free from hair for
the fourth time, and irreparably, except a few hairs on the
upper part of the neck, on the four feet and the tail, of which
the person to whom the peasant sold the horse, and who had
become the jest of the whole village, at last deprived him.
In this state M. Sebald found the horse of which he had be
fore heard some account, at the house of a coachman of Och-
tinguen, to whom the peasant had sold him for three Louis
d'ors, in the month of January, 1793, he was then covered
with a cloth, and employed in drawing a cart.
    M. Sebald then informs us how the horse was carried
about from place to place by his new possessor, in order to
exhibit him for money, pretending that he was a horse from
the island of Cyprus.     The coachman of Ochtinguen being
struck with some qualms of conscience, and fearing that the
imposture might be detected,        resolved to sell him to an
Italian, who afterwards sold him to M. Alpy, in whose
 hands this horse became so famous.
    As M. Sebald mentions all the places, and being him
 self a person whose testimony is above suspicion, natural his
tory must in future renounce this pretended addition of a
new race, but this particular effect of the leaves of the savine
 tree is an object worthy the attention and researches of ve
 terinary professors.
