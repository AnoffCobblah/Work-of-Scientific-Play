                                  General                Remarks.
THE  topographical part of this sketch of Lake Ontario has
  been drawn up with a sole view to the subsequent geolo
gical details. Statements having no reference to them     have                           I
therefore usually avoided.      Whenever minuteness is em
ployed, it is to introduce a new and important fact, or to cor
rect error. I refer more immediately to the admeasurements
of the shores and islands of the outlet; which an official                                      si

rable, fill the fertile plains and undulations of           south bor           its

agitation caused by that element.     along the western rivers  All
and lakes there are small mounds and heaps of gravel of a
conical   form, erected by the fish for the protection of their
 spawn: these fish-banks are found at the foot of the ridge on
 the side toward the lake; on the opposite side none have been
 discovered. All rivers and streams which enter the lake from
 the south have their mouths affected with sand in a peculiar
 way, from the prevalence and power of the northwesterly winds.

 respond exactly in appearance with the entrance of the streams

few boulders:    sometimes these banks are of large size and two
in  number,   but more usually they are cut up by torrents and
rains into mounds and knolls; where they do not exist, the
ridge is a steep slope of woods and pasturage, with here and
there interrupted ledges of rock. At the village of Grimsby it
is rendered very picturesque by being crowned at a saliant
angle by a massive cliff resting on a slope of ruins, and half
buried in large elms and pines. At Stoney Creek the height
subsides to 130 to 160 feet; but about half a mile behind it
there is another, an upper ridge, continuous for some miles.
It is most probably an offset from that below.
   The flat beneath this ridge, or “Mountain,” as it is called
here, is not much above the lake at the west end; but in the
middle and eastern parts it is in gentle swells, which are forty
and eighty feet high at the foot of the ridge. They are cut
through by numerous rivulets nearly to the level of the lake,
and display a vast deposit of red clay and a good many boul
ders, and now and then some sand, of which there is a large
bed near St. Catherine's, and therefore it still remains in the
state of a pine-wood.
   This is the most beautiful and most improved part of Upper
Canada.

Bay, altogether about eight miles across and two deep*. It
is in some measure land-locked by two large and some smaller
islands. For further details I refer to Darby, as before quoted,
and to Spafford's Gazetteer of the State of New York. Sackett's
Harbour village bears from Kingston S. by E. twenty-five
miles; but it is thirty-five miles distant by ship's course.
Other harbours for small vessels on this shore between Sackett's
and the River Genesee are Sodus and Oswego. The former
is a fine capacious basin, embayed by a ridge curving from
the western angle, and which almost surrounds the bay: the
latter is on the River Oswego, which has at               mouth      bar       its             a
over which large          heavily-laden vessels cannot pass.

    your request in giving some further development to the ideas

   This opinion has naturally led       that     the Chinese writing

             as            figures  and  algebraic   signs  are. This
idea has been carried so far that some missionaries have wished
that the Chinese written language,                 called, should    as   it      is                           be
cultivated through the whole world; for then, the New Testa

not the  only  wonderful  systems      which this opinion has given

    This writing having been formed,                 supposed, without    as      is
any reference              to   or
                        connection with     spoken    language,    ques                              a

    It is true, that in the grouping of characters to represent
 single words, the inventors have called to their aid the ideas
 which the words express.      Thus the character which answers
 to the word hand, is grouped with those which answer to words
 expressing manual operations. But this was not done with a
 view to an ideographic language. It was merely an auxiliar
 means to aid in the classification of the numerous signs,
 otherwise the memory could not have retained. The sino
 logists see great beauties in these associations, of which  I  am
 not competent to speak.      I suspect, however, that there is in
 that more of imagination than reality.
    Be this as it may, as the Chinese characters represent the
 words of the language, and are intended to awaken the remem
 brance of them in the mind, they are not, therefore, indepen
 dent of sound, for words are sounds.       It makes no difference
 whether those sounds are simple and elementary, as those which
 our letters represent, or whether they are compounded from
 two or three of those elements into a syllable. There are syl
 labic alphabets, like that of the Sanscrit and other languages,
 and it has never been contended that they do not represent
 sounds.    And it makes no difference that the Chinese syllables
 are also words, for that does not make them lose their charac
 ter of sounds.     But on account of this difference, I would
 not call the Chinese characters a syllabic, but a logographic
 system of writing.
    This being the case, it seems necessarily to follow, that as
 the Chinese characters are in direct connection with the Chi
 nese spoken words, they can only be read and understood by
 those who are familiar with the oral language.      I do not mean
 to say that they cannot be applied to other monosyllabic
 idioms (and they are, in fact, applied even to polysyllabic lan
 guages, as I shall presently show), I only contend that their
 meaning cannot be understood alike in the different languages
 in which they are used.
    You very well know, my dear sir, how various are the
 forms of human languages. You know that even in the same
 language, there are not two words exactly synonymous; d.
jortiori it must be so in two different idioms. Take the word
 grand, for instance, which belongs both to the French and to
 the English languages. Though               its
                                          general meaning    be the
 same  in   both idioms, yet how strong are the shades which
 distinguish the ideas they particularly represent      Now
                                                        |    let   us

French character j'aimerois, without knowing the French mode
of conjugating verbs?   How would a Latin phrase be under
stood by an Englishman or Frenchman, merely by means of
signs appropriate to each word 2 Our ideas, independent of
speech, are vague, fleeting, and confused; language alone fixes
them, and not in the same manner with every nation.                   Some
languages take in a group of ideas and express them in one
word; others analyse a single idea, and have a separate word
for each minute part of which it is composed. Some take an
idea as it were in front, others in profile, and others in the rear;
and hence the immense variety of forms and of modes of ex
pression that exists in the different languages of the earth.
All languages abound in metaphors and elliptical modes of
speech, which vary according to the genius of each particular
idiom.      In no language are these figures more frequent than
in the Chinese, which is admitted to be elliptical in the highest
degree, and is full of far-fetched metaphorical expressions.
 For instance, the grandees of the empire are called the four
seas (quatuor maria), to express which the Chinese writing has
two characters, one for quatuor and the other for maria, which
is very distant from the idea of superiority or greatness.             I ask
how these characters can be understood or read in a              language
that has not adopted the same mode of expression ? Again:
the English phrase,                   “I
                               do not expect it,” is rendered in Chi
nese    by “how dare<U+017F>” and the sentence “What you are alarmed
 about is not of much importance,” is thus expressed : “You this
 one bother not greatly required *.”         It would be difficult to
 read this   intelligibly  in any  language   but the Chinese, or one
 formed    exactly  on the same     model,  and in every respect ana
 logous to      it. Nor could the     corresponding      literal English
 phrases       be
                read intelligibly      Chinese, for want
                                                in                   similar         of
 turns    ofexpression and grammatical forms.
     A  purely ideographical language, therefore, unconnected
 with   spoken    words, cannot      my opinion possibly exist; there
                                           in
is   no universal standard for the fixation of ideas; we cannot
 abstract our ideas from the channel               which language has

 what,  if in spite of your theory, Chinese books are understood

      Cochinchina, the language commonly spoken
          In                                         dialect                              is   a
 of the Chinese, monosyllabic like the mother tongue, and
 formed             on
           the same grammatical principles.    writing this                         In
                                                 language,

22            Mr. Du Ponceau          on some Points connected
  language, the Chinese logographic character is exclusively
  used; but it does by no means follow that a Cochinchinese
  book would be understood in China, or vice versä.        For       al
  though in both languages, each character represents a single
 word, yet the words so represented are not always the same
 in sound or in sense. Thus the character which in Chinese
 represents the word tân (a plain), in Cochinchina signifies dét
 (the earth). The character kin (metal), in Cochinchinese is
 read kim (a needle); Chinese y (kettle), Cochinchinese chi
 (lead); Chinese på (to land), Cochinchinese bac (silver)*. It
 is evident that the same book or manuscript could not be read
 or understood alike by a Chinese and a Cochinchinese.
     I cannot omit here an observation which appears to me to
 be peculiarly striking.         If
                              the Chinese writing be really ideo
graphic ; if it represents ideas and not sounds,-how does it
 happen that the same character is used in different languages
 to signify things that have no kind of connection with each
 other; as for instance, the verb to land, and the substantive
 silver? It is difficult to think even of a distant metaphor that
 will apply to both these objects.
     In Japan there are two languages in general use. The
 Koye, which is no other than the Chinese, with some variation
 in the pronunciation of the words, arising probably from the
 difference of the vocal organs of the two nations; and the Yomi,
 which is the most popular language, the former being devoted
 to religion and science.    The Yomi is polysyllabic, and has
 declensions, conjugations, and other complex grammatical
 forms, which the Chinese has not. Therefore it cannot be
 written with the Chinese character logographically, any more
 than the Greek or Latin could : yet the Chinese character is
 used in writing that idiom. . From a selection of those cha
racters a syllabic alphabet has been made, which is in com
mon use+. From a similar selection, says M. Remusat, the
 Coreans have made a monophonic alphabet of nine vowels and
fifteen consonants f, with which they write their language. At
the same time they can read and understand the Chinese, in
which their sacred and scientific books are written.
    We know very little of the language of the Loo Choo Islands.
Father Gaubil (the French missionary), says, that they have
three different idioms; others say that they speak a language
compounded of the Chinese and Japanese. . But little reliance
is to be placed in these reports.    It is probable that the Chi

      Ihave said enough, I think, to show that if the Chinese

  graphic character; but either because the Chinese                 also the

From this formula we obtain,
                                     -                -            2 x2

in which eº and a are to be considered as unknown quantities.
Now the length of a degree of the meridian, or which is better,
any measured arc of the meridian, will give another equation
between the same unknown quantities, which is sufficient to
determine them both. It would serve no purpose to apply
this method to the stations at Beachy Head and Dunnose, be
cause it seems certain that there is a great error in the ob
served azimuths and the difference of longitude.
   Taking the difference of longitude as in the Survey, and
assuming the value of a as determined by the measurement of
meridional arcs, in which there can be no great uncertainty,
we shall find by the foregoing formula,
                                         e°   = 01807.
This is nearly three times the excentricity of     the meridians;
which seems so    great  an  irregularity that we are forcibly led
to suspect that the difference of  longitude errs in defect, which
makes the chord of the    sphere  too short, and, in consequence,
e” too great.
   On the other hand, if we make the difference of longitude
1° 27' 5"-6, which, there is reason to think, is not far from the
truth, we shall then have,
                                         e”   = •00653,
which coincides with the excentricity of the meridian. . In
this case therefore the surface of the earth at the two stations
would coincide with the figure formed by the regular revolu
tion of the meridian about the earth's axis. Now it is very pro
bable that this is nearly true; and it is confirmed by the ex
actness  with which the same figure represents      the longi                all
tudes that have been accurately determined     the neighbour         in

advantageously employed.            It has the advantage that in case
one of the    quantities  P,   Q, R,  S should be erroneous, one can
see at once what influence this will have on the value of X.
But it has the disadvantage, that in general it is not known how
many terms P, Q, R, S will be sufficient, and be required for
an accurate interpolation; and one                            is,

    B. “Anterior wings very acute, subfalcate, the hinder mar
        gin having an emargination towards the apex: abdomen
        longitudinally striated: antennae obscurely clavate. Larvae
        not spotted, some of the anterior segments with a single
        large ocellus on each, and retractile; caudal horn smooth,

Mr.  Stephens, as seen in the synonyma above, has divided this group into
no less than seven genera, the characters of which I shall annex as the
species occur on which they are respectively formed, in order that such
entomologists as do not possess Mr. Stephens's elegant and important                         “Il
lustrations” may, if they please, be enabled to adopt his views, and know
on what grounds they are established.

    * Ochsenheimer has divided this genus into four families, the first of
which agrees pretty nearly with the second division of Latreille's genus     Li
thosia, and the second family contains three species of his genus Callimorpha.
Several species of the genera Lithosia and Callimorpha, Latr. are arranged
by Ochsenheimer under his own genus Eyprepia. Altogether, no small
share of confusion prevails with respect to the species of these three genera;
and we hope that some one better qualified for the task than ourselves, and
not too fond of creating new genera, will disentangle this perplexed web.
We are already indebted to Mr. Curtis for having done something towards
it; and the sure grounds which that author goes upon—dissection of the
essential parts, and the admirable manner in which those dissections are
executed and delineated—not only create unlimited confidence in his re
sults, but leave nothing to wish for, as far as he has gone.     To him and to
Mr. Stephens, amongst our own entomologists, now actively and so much
to their own honour devoted to the science, we must look to have “all
these odds made even.”        Of his genus Lithosia, Latreille says (Nouv. Dict.
d’Hist. Nat. vol. xviii. p. 130, 1817.), “This genus answers in great measure
to the genus Lithosia of Fabricius, and to the Setimes (Setina) of Schrank.”
And a little further, “M. Ochsenheimer, in his Lepidoptera of Europe,
arranges some of my Lithosia, with his Eyprepia, which comprehend many
species of Arctia, and my Callimorphae.”      “The Lithosiae,” Latreille adds,
“are, in general, species of Bombyx, having the form of Tineae, either nar
row or elongated, adorned with pleasing colours, sometimes uniform, some
 times variegated, and marked with dots, maculae, or bands. Their wings
form a sort of mantle. These Lepidoptera remain quiet, during the day,
 on the trunks of trees, or the stems of plants.”
    The species enumerated by Curtis (Brit. Ent. I. 36.) as belonging to this
 genus are eight: namely, L. muscerda, Hübn.; flava, Fab.; aurantia, Haw.;
 ochreola, Hübn. ; helveola, Hübn.; complana, Linn.; griseola, Hübn. ; and
 quadra, Linn. : and he concludes the subject with the following observation:
 “L.   quadra will form a second division in this genus, since the second joint
 of the palpus is as long as the first, and curved upward; Bombyr pulchella
 and rubricollis, Fab., with some others, are included by that author and
 Latreille in the genus Lithosia, which has occasioned the latter to state that
 the palpi are three-jointed, whereas Fabricius has described them as biarti
 culate: after dissecting several specimens of our genus, and examining them
 most carefully, I can discover only two joints; B. pulchella and rubricollis
 having three distinct joints in the palpi, must therefore be constituted into
 a new genus.”

 52                        Dr. Tiarks                on the Longitudes
  957,000 pounds.     Upon examining the experiments of Mr.
  Barlow and of Mr. Tredgold on ash timber, it will be found
  that the modulus of elasticity of the specimens tried by them
  was 1,645,187 and 1,525,500 pounds respectively; so that the
jewibility of Earls-Barton ash, when compared with the wood
 tried by Mr. Barlow and Mr. Tredgold, is nearly as 5 to 3.
  The cohesion of Earls-Barton ash, as deduced from its trans
 verse strength, I found to be little more than 10,000 pounds
 per square inch: but upon trying the cohesion by the direct
 longitudinal force to pull it asunder, obtained 24,700 pounds.    I
    Mr. Barlow gives the cohesion of ash 17,337 pounds, and
 Mr. Tredgold 14, 130 pounds; the mean of these being 15,733
 pounds: from which it appears that Earls-Barton ash is su
 perior to those just referred to in the ratio of 11 to 7.
    The ultimate deflection before fracture took place, according
 to the formula of Mr. Barlow, I found to be about 2% times
 greater than the ultimate deflection of ash in Mr. Barlow's
 tables.
  Now if we estimate the toughness of wood to be in the com
pound proportion of    cohesive strength and
                                       its      ultimate de                                  its

amounts to 7", and would thus leave only 11" of the difference
in longitude to be accounted for by the errors in the data of
the Survey, principally by the errors in the sum of the azi
muths.    I have endeavoured to prove that in the development
of the value of tang , a there is no such term, involving the
square of the excentrictiy, and Mr. Ivory's last paper has not
proved the contrary.   At the same time I have fallen into the
mistake of contending that the formula for tang w is rigorously
correct; while it really contains terms proportional to the
fourth and higher powers of the excentricity.     The mistake
has arisen from my confounding the azimuth of the station ob
served with the azimuth of the geodetical line connecting the
stations at the place of observation.   For the azimuth of the
geodetical line at B we may take that of the point of intersec
tion of the vertical line at D with the horizon of B. Calling
B and D the azimuths of the geodetical line at B and D, it
will be found that nearly B–m = m/– D =

which that singular people were accustomed to subject the bodies
 of their dead, and as vindicating the authenticity, on this point, of
the venerable historians to whom we have hitherto been chiefly in
 debted for our knowledge of the early history of Egypt. The infor
 mation communicated by Messrs. Osburn and George and their coad
jutors, respecting the specimen of Egyptian embalming which they
 have examined, illustrates many important particulars discussed in
 Dr. Granville's paper; while the condition of the mummy so well

lities, significantly termed in Holy Writ “the wisdom of Egypt.”
And this knowledge appears to have been the remains in one branch,
as the mythology was the entire perversion in another, of the higher
wisdom enjoyed by the progenitors of the Egyptians, who had united
their knowledge of nature to the perception “that things in nature
were symbols of things above nature, and of the attributes and glory
of the Godhead”.”

reasons why the secret of deciphering the Sacred Characters em

 of spices, amongst which are myrrh and cassia or cinnamon, the
 use of natron in the conservative process, and finally the wrapping

    The hieroglyphical inscriptions on mummy-cases in general, Mr.
Osburn informs us, are precatory addresses to different divinities on
behalf of the individuals inclosed in them; and as the same mytho
logical blessings would be required for the soul of every deceased
person, these inscriptions principally consist of a series of formulae,
which are repeated under different combinations, and in forms more
or less abbreviated, upon                            all        According

divine honours might be received by the deceased; Anubis and the
goddess Netpe are implored to grant him participation in the nature
of Osiris; and the same goddess is besought that he may receive
sacrifice.    The goddesses Nephthys and Ta<U+017F>net are supplicated to
bestow upon him the ensigns called Bathmi, which are borne by
Kebh-Sniv, one of the ministering spirits of Osiris, and all the other
blessings, or benefits, of a minister of that deity.
   After thus deciphering these inscriptions and the symbols which
they accompany, Mr. Osburn proceeds to explain those which denote
the proper name, and rank, and occupation of the embalmed person.
The researches of Dr. Young, confirmed by those of M. Champol
lion, enable him to do this with considerable facility and certainty.

   The   gray  precipitate   of  platina  being  thus obtained in the form of
a uniform mud or pulp, is now ready for casting, which is effected b
compression in a mould, formed of a brass barrel, six inches and a half
long, and turned rather taper within, so as to facilitate the extraction
of the ingot when formed. The platina is first subjected to partial
compression by the hand with a wooden plug, so as to expel the
greater part of the water.         It is then placed horizontally in an iron
press, constructed so as to give great mechanical advantage to the
power applied to produce compression. The cake of platina is then
to be heated to redness by a charcoal fire, in order to drive off               the                                all

    Although it is usual chiefly to dwell on the names of those
have    enriched the Transactions by their communications, yet some
occur in the list now read, whom it is impossible to pass over with
out notice.
    Mr. Archdeacon Cox, whose name will go down to posterity, as
sociated with those of many illustrious persons whose histories he has
diligently investigated and adorned.
    Major Denham, whose active exertions, perseverance, and untimely
fate, can scarcely be contemplated without a tear.
    The Rev. Alexander Nicoll, Regius Professor of Hebrew in the
University of Oxford,      a man most eminent in the literary pursuit
he had selected, and advanced to the high station of Professor by the
disinterested regard for merit of an individual still living, and who at
the time held the most confidential office in the government of this
country. Much certainly was expected from Mr. Nicoll in the recon
dite learning appropriate to his station; and if the experience of past
diligence and acumen may be taken as an assurance of future active
exertion, these expectations would not have been disappointed. But
he is lost to us at an early age.
    Mr. William Phillips has not, indeed, appeared in the Philosophical
Transactions; but his labours have assisted the inquiries of geolo
gists and mineralogists in every part of the world. In English geo
logy he contributed a joint share towards a work, unfortunately not
yet complete, but confessedly the most luminous and accurate that
has hitherto appeared. And in crystallography, those alone who have
made some progress in that most beautiful yet intricate science, are
capable of appreciating the extent of his merit.
    The first name that presents itself from the Transactions is that of
 Mr. Mills, to whom we are indebted for a geological communication
on the wyn dykes, and on the basalt of Scotland and Ireland, so long
ago as in the year 1790; at a period when that science, the distin
guishing glory perhaps of the nineteenth century, had scarcely ac
 quired a distinct appellation in our language.
    Dr. John Mervin Nooth, elected in 1774, had favoured the Society
 in the preceding year with some theoretical and practical observa
 tions on electricity, one of the sciences then most attractive of general
 curiosity, in consequence of the wonderful discoveries recently made
 by Dr. Franklin; and in 1775, excited by the no less important ex
 periments of Dr. Priestley, he supplied our Transactions with the
 description of an ingeniously contrived apparatus for saturating water
with carbonic acid, or, as that gaseous fluid was then called, with
 fixed air. On the first discovery of carbonic acid as a distinct and
 peculiar substance, followed by an analysis of      its constituent parts,
 great medical virtues were imputed    to   it,much greater than subse
 quent experience has confirmed. Under these first impressions, the
 instrument invented    by  Dr. Nooth was eagerly seized, and might         be
 seen  in most  private houses. The elegant pyramidal form      of   its
                                                                      three
 parts ascending one above the other, and displaying       by  their trans
 parency the whole process    asit  goes on, isstill exhibited  bydruggists
  and  by manufacturers  of  glass. Many gentlemen who now hear
                                                                     .     W1

will share in the surprise which I felt on learning that the inventor of
an apparatus familiar to my childhood, should have lived to be com
memorated in the present year.
    We have next to notice agentleman elected some short time prior
to Dr. Nooth, about fifty-five years ago, known to our Transactions,
indeed, by a single paper on antiquarian philology, but well known
to the Society by the able discharge of the duties attached to one of
its  most important offices for           space       twenty-eight years.

    Another distinguished member of this Society has recently been
taken from us, by one of those accidents, common indeed to old age,
yet of a nature to excite compassion, or feelings perhaps of a stronger
cast.    Dr. George Pearson was elected in June 1791, and he has en
riched our Transactions with ten communications. The first, in the
year of his admission, on Dr. James's antimonial powders. The com
position of this celebrated febrifuge having been long withholden from
the public, notwithstanding the sworn specification of                          inventor,                  its

relates to a black colouring matter occasionally found in the bronchial
glands. But Dr. Pearson has still further claims on our respect
and our regard. For a series of years he continued to diffuse, by his
lectures, a knowledge of the new chemistry, instructing hundreds in
the truths of science, as they became successively developed, in a
manner not calculated to load the memory, but to invigorate the rea
soning powers, in proportion as new facts were communicated and
arranged. And to Dr. Pearson we are again indebted for rendering
familiar in England the nomenclature of chemistry, first adopted in
another country; an adaptation of words to things, of which it may
be truly said,

ledge almost beyond example, there can be found few subjects which
he has not illustrated; and in respect to conclusions which seem to
differ from the deductions of his great predecessors, his arguments
are so fairly stated on either side, that every intelligent reader is
placed in a situation to form his own opinion on those profound and
abstruse points. Mr. Stewart has somewhere quoted—Mertov sari ro

By reverting to the long-neglected controversies of the Nominalists

subtile reasoner, who for centuries past has been remembered (such

        sustained by the death of Dr. Wollaston, there can be but one
 feeling. We trust we may be enabled to dedicate some of our pages

rose in the N.W. in the form of a segment of a circle cut by that
part of the horizon, showed a bright flame-colour about twelve de
grees high, and disappeared at half-past six.        At seven it again ap
peared, brightest about the magnetic North, when seven or eight
light red coruscations or columns of light rose from it perpendicu
larly, nearly due North, to an altitude of twenty degrees; and se
veral small meteors fell in that quarter.      At a quarter before eight
it again   disappeared,  and   reappeared  at ten,  when several columns
of light rose from             its
                         base, and     continued more

   General Observations.    –  This has been a pleasant month, and was
generally mild and dry for the season: but the 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th and
12th were very cold days, with frosty nights, which were brought on by
                                                                                      the

             Meteorological Observations for November 1828.                                                                    79
the induction of a piercing gale from the East. This change was so sud
den, as to cause a difference of eighteen degrees in the maximum tempera
ture of the external air between the 7th and 8th.
   On the 8th the thermometer only rose to 38 degrees; but on the 21st
and 28th it rose to 60 degrees.    The difference in the minimum tempera
ture of the nights of the 11th and 27th is still greater.      -
  The sudden disleafing of the trees after the frosts and two or three heavy
dews was very remarkable;     the moral of which has been generally applied
to November by the poet, thus:
                   “Nocturnal dews, caused by the absent sun,
                     And hoary frosts have sometime since begun
                       To       shower down the fading leaves, which                                  lie
                       Upon recipient earth, and quickly die—
                       An emblem of the finite end of man.”
   The mean temperature                          of
                                 the external air this month            degrees                             is   24
higher than the mean        November for many years past.

Topography          of the Outlet of Lake Ontario, including   the Lake

                            of the

           outlet of Lake Ontario, known as the River St. Law
THE   rence, Iroquois or Cataraqui, is placed at the north-east
end of the lake, and runs N.E. as far as Montreal (202 miles);
with the exception of the small portion by the township of Corn
wall, at the head of Lake St. Francis, and of the forty miles
above Montreal; in both cases the change being to the E.N.E.
At present we are only concerned with the gorge of the lake,
the upper fifty-eight miles of the St. Lawrence, included be
tween the towns of Kingston and Brockville, a space distin
guished from that below by very marked features; as            breadth,   its
the form   of     shores, the number
                    its                          of   its
                                                islands, and      being         its
chiefly occupied by primitive rocks.
   Of the country surrounding the outlet am only personally

and  I  partly know,  that there     little difference
                                           is                        on

The districts         on
                    the north are rendered rugged, unsightly, and
comparatively unproductive                 by
                                     the great prevalence         naked     of

    The points of reference on the north main of the outlet are
very few.      It is thinly inhabited. Eighteen miles N.E. of
Kingston is the village and river of Gananoque: the former
consisting of five or six houses, and a good saw-mill on the
west side of a fall near the mouth of the latter, which is a good

     From Chippewa Point a gradual but considerable contrac
 tion ensues for 33 miles downward; with tolerably regular
 shores.     About three miles, above Brockville, at a spot some
 what crowded with islands, the outlet is only 1500 yards broad,
 and opposite to that town it is exactly a geographical mile
 acroSS.
     It would be useless and tedious to describe in detail the very
 intricate district of waters now under consideration. Its shores
 are of mingled rock and marsh; the former never rising higher
 than 150 feet, and seldom so much. The occasional patches
 of level and productive land are usually in the larger islands.
 The main and islands are broken into innumerable rushy
  coves and inlets; the larger receiving creeks which are bor
  dered by morasses for some distance into the interior.             These
  indents are sometimes large, particularly on the south main
  shore, as Candelles Bay 2+ miles broad, and 1535 yards deep;
  and twenty-one miles above Brockville; Goose Creek Bay
  thirteen miles above that town, and Chippewa Bay a little be
  low the last named bay, and nearly two miles deep.                 These
   are all on the south shore.
      The islands crowded into this space are upwards of seventeen
   hundred in number, as ascertained by the Boundary Com
   mission. They are largest at the upper end, and most nu

   Indian Hut Island, the only one remaining which requires
distinct notice, guards the mouth of Goose Creek Bay. It is
rocky, a mile and two thirds long, and from six hundred to

the eastern outer angle of the bay. It belongs to the United
States.
                      The Geology      of Lake Ontario.
   The situations where the loose transported matters covering
the fixed rocks of Lake Ontario particularly abound, have
been noticed in the topographical part of this paper, and the
inferences they lead to have been stated in the general view of
the detritus of Canada, read before the Geological Society of
London in the winter of 1826–7.
   While the parallel ridge west and south of the lake is com
posed almost wholly of rock, the eminences bordering this
body of water on the north-west are formed of these later de
posits, which also overspread in great thickness the interval
of thirty-seven miles between Lakes Ontario and Simcoe, and
near the latter of which are penetrated for two hundred feet
by the River Holland at Robinson's Mills. At that place, a
hard well-cemented conglomerate of small primitive pebbles
is now forming near the water level.       It was altogether out of
my power to make any very accurate observations on the na
ture and position of the component parts of the highlands of
York and their vicinity alluded to above. I landed at the
highest part of the cliffs six miles east of York, and found the
castellated masses there to be of brown marl, effervescin
smartly on exposure to acids, tolerably firm in           texture,      its                 an

 Country; the primitive marble of Crow Lake and the Ottawa
is plentiful on the north main of Ontario: the ophicalcic rocks,
 and tabular spar in large masses of Gananoque and the river
just mentioned, are occasionally met with. Where the blocks
 of glassy tremolite occurring near Bellville come from, I know
not.   The       tabular spar         I found         at this place, and a few miles
east of Grimsby near the head of the lake.    The ophicalcic
boulder several tons in weight is on the beach in front of the
town of York, a few yards from a minutely blended mass,
weighing about two tons, of petalite, glassy actinolite, tremo
lite, quartz, calcspar, and a little copper-pyrites.
    The first two of these substances only require remark. They
have been described by Dr. Troost” in the following words:
The petalite “occurs in crystalline masses of a grayish white
colour, with a tinge of green. It has a confused lamellar tex
ture: the laminae offer in some directions a radiated texture,
not unlike some varieties of tremolite, approaching even to
fibrous, as observed in the asbestiform actinolite; the fibres
are diverging; the laminae are sometimes scaly and undulated.
The cleavage approaches to a rhomboidal prism of 130°, which
has again a diagonal cleavage.        It breaks with difficulty, offer
ing a rough lamellar and fibrous fracture; the fragments are
angular with a glistening lustre, and in the direction of the
laminae somewhat pearly, more or less brilliant. . It is strongly
translucent on the edges, and strikes fire freely with steel;

XIV.   On the Discordancies in the Results of the Methods for
  determining the Length of the simple Pendulum. By FRANcis
  BAILY, Esq. F.R.S. &c. &c. &c.”
  T is                                       I
        well known to many persons that have, for some time
    past, been engaged in making experiments on the converti
ble pendulum, with a view to satisfy myself of the accuracy of
the generally received determination of the length of the sim
ple pendulum, vibrating seconds, in this latitude. The result
of those experiments has convinced me that we are, at present,
very far from possessing in that instrument a method of de
ducing a standard measure. The pendulum, employed was
one similar to that which has been already described in the
Phil. Mag. for August last, page 137; and is in fact nothing
more than a plain straight bar of brass, about 62 inches long,
2 inches wide, and # of an inch thick; without any moveable
                                                       i<U+017F>:
weights or sliding pieces: and the knife edges are so placed
that the vibrations made on them are synchronous           each
other. The distance between the knife    edges (the determina
tion of which is by far the most troublesome and difficult part
of the process) has been determined from a mean of nearl
one hundred comparisons with Sir George Shuckburgh's
standard scale; which was kindly entrusted to me for that pur
pose, by the Council of the Royal Society, who now possess
that invaluable instrument. This distance is 39-3069 inches:
and the number of synchronous vibrations made on the knife
edges, in a mean solar day, corrected for the arc, for the tem
perature, for the reduction to a vacuum, and for the rate of
the clock, is 86208-70; consequently, the length of the simple
pendulum will be                -
            (*#)'x           89-3060 = 89-1880 inches.
But, Captain Kater makes the length of the simple pendulum
(reduced to the level of the sea) equal to 39:13929 inches.   If
we strike off the last two figures, for the amount of the correc
tion for reducing it to the level of the sea, we shall have, in
round numbers, 39'139 inches as the value of Captain Kater's
measure, determined near the same spot as my own: and it
will be unnecessary to carry our inquiries into the value of
the fourth figure in the decimal, when we disagree so much
in the value of the third figure.
   Knowing the accuracy with which Captain Kater's experi
ments were conducted, and having minutely examined every
step of the process detailed by him in       his
                                              excellent paper on

 the convertible pendulum, I was naturally led to conclude that
I  had inadvertently committed some error, which had escaped
 my repeated examination.            But my suspicions were removed
 by the result of some experiments on a pendulum of another
 kind; and which has presented anomalies still more remark
 able.
    It has been shown by M. Prony, in his Lecons de Méchanique
 Analytique, vol.        page 340, that we may determine the length

 parallel      each other, and

 these elements are sufficient         enable       to in

    It is in this manner that I propose at some future time to
 treat the definitive results which may be obtained by the pen
 dulum here alluded to. The numerical operation, however,
 is so troublesome, the quantities determined by the experi

troduction of a slight error affects so materially the final re
 sult, that I have considered it more satisfactory, in the pre
sent view of the subject, to deduce the length of the simple

pendulum: viz. by considering each pair of synchronous knife

MM.Borda, Bouvard, Mathieu, and himself, on the length of
the pendulum at Paris: which, by adding the known difference
in the number of vibrations between Paris and Greenwich,
will make the length of the simple pendulum, at this latter
place, equal to 39°1379 inches. So that we have here also an
other discordance, amounting to more than 001 of an inch.
I  am aware that there is supposed to be a slight constant dif
ference between the observations at Greenwich and London:
      I
but believe that some recent experiments do not exactly ac
cord with the theory on this point. This will, however, very
shortly be more fully determined.

   Were to construct another convertible pendulum would                                                I

inches; or as nearly so as the artist could effect                   pre                         it.   I
 sume that   Captain    Kater selected the distance somewhere be

pendulum (as I presume it will be) should ever be re-measured
and re-swung with a view to obtain a more correct and per
manent comparison for a standard measure; for, in a national
work, no labour or expense ought to be spared, in order to
obtain the greatest possible accuracy.
  I  ought not to omit mentioning that the two convertible
pendulums (the one of iron, and the other of copper) belong
ing to the Astronomical Society, and now in the care of Cap
tain Foster, in his voyage of experiment and discovery, are
formed on precisely the same plan, as the pendulum alluded to
in the first part of this communication.    had not an oppor               I

teresting to ascertain whether those pendulums indicate ano
malies similar to those which have been the subject of this
communication.

      MEIKLE seems resolutely bent on effecting the
MR.thorough reform, and on weeding out every blemish from
mathematical science.       For my part,      am fully resolved to    I
oppose no obstacle to the accomplishment of so laudable a
project.    On the contrary he may reckon upon it as a thing
not doubtful,    that              I
                         shall approve and adopt every improve
ment he    may   be able to establish on good grounds.
   He is no less bent on giving to what he calls my formula
                                                                      on it,

note,       he
           calls upon his readers                       to
                                        recollect what the formula
is.  On the other hand,         call upon them

proposition enunciated, without any formula, contains the
whole of my doctrine.
   In this Journal for November 1828,         have deduced the           I

the sphere contained by a and the two meridians. This pro
position is rigorously true, and is only a particular case of a
more general theorem demonstrated by Professor Gauss in the
Memoirs of the Royal Society of Göttingen: but it must be
observed that the trilateral figure on the surface of the sphere is
not a spherical triangle, because the line a is not contained in
the plane of any great circle.        And as the line a depends upon
the geodetical lines, which, supposing the latitudes and the dif
ference of longitude to remain unchanged, varies with the ex
centricity, it follows necessarily that the sum of the azimuths
at the extremities of s, is not independent of the excentricity,
but varies from one spheroid to another. The sum of the
azimuths mentioned is not, in any spheroid, exactly equal to
the sum of the angles at the base of a triangle on              i.   surface
 of the  sphere    formed   by  the two   meridians,     and a  great  circle
 which cuts them at the latitudes of the stations.

 and hope the following novel experiment may be favourably
 received by your scientific readers.
                                                                           .
    Experiment 1.-Having placed a table at about ten feet
                  É.
 from a well lighted window, I placed on it a candle in a high
 candlestick.             held a quire of white paper parallel to
 table, and at right angles with the lighted candle: on holding
 this paper rather close to the blaze, two shadows were pro
 duced by means of a piece of coiled paper held immediately
 near the quire; the one next to the candle was a bright orange,
 the other a bright blue. On turning the quire .# paper to
 wards the window, so as to cut off the light of the candle, this
 orange shadow changed to a perfect black; and on turning
  the quire of paper towards the candle, and excluding the light
  of the sun, the blue shadow likewise changed to a perfect black.
  Here    I changed orange and blue colours into black, and vice
                                                           This experiment

  versä,-without any possibility of refraction.
  may be made by                  the paper behind the candle.
     Experiment 2.-The former experiment was made with the
  paper between the candle and the window:                   I now held the
  paper close behind the candle, and perceived two shadows, the

and that a double system of valleys and a particular line of
drainage remained, as evidence of the fact, proper allowance
being made for a contemporaneous or immediately consecutive
diluvian action.
    Fortunately for this theory, the greater part of it had been
already made out by Dr. Buckland in the paper above                                                                    al
luded to *; and a double system of valleys, or the transverse
sections of the chalk escarpments, which                  have ventured to         I
call “river fissures,” made the medium of drainage, had been
observed by Mr. Conybeare.                                    I
                                              may also acknowledge in
this   place,    that   my    observations    upon   Portsdown Hill, as a
chalk    outlier-by-protrusion,        have been in part anticipated by
the latter gentlemant, although he supposes it to originate
in a simple undulation of the surface of the chalk, anterior to
 the aera of deposit of the higher strata.               This is the notion
 apparently also of Mr. Webster, who, in his illustrative map
 in the second volume of the Geological Transactions, has
                        its
                    eastern extremity with the chalk

 why the fissures remain, (to use the expres
 sion of Mr. Scrope,) “crevice-like gorges,”
 instead of opening into broad expansions, like
 the longitudinal valley, produced by the op
 posite more sudden elevation. The curve
 here pointed out may be represented as in the
 margin.
   This curve brings the anticlinal line into
strict relation with those masses composed of
concentric circles mantling round nuclei,
amongst the older formations; and an ideal
section of       it,
               whether longitudinal      trans                  or
verse, will exactly correspond with sections                                 of
such protrusions             so
                      often exhibited”.
   Assuming      therefore
                      it       proved, that the
                                             as
strata above the chalk were continuous ante
rior    the convulsion which threw them, the

 into what has been called the basin shape,                                                :
it  follows of course that the act of denuda
 tion begins with the upper beds, and pro
 ceeds downwards to the lowest that are here
exposed. And that the term denudation ought
not    tobe confined,             as

the South Downs, and its denudation there, inclines me to
believe it to be of great thickness.
    At a moderate computation, therefore*, supposing that no
denuding flood had existed to carry away the materials, we
should have had in the place of what is now the Weald Wal
ley, a mountain far exceeding the highest of our English hills,
and rising to half the height at which Dr. Buckland says relics
of tertiary strata are still to be found in Alpine districts.                    If
to this 4000 feet of elevation above our present sea level, we
add the range of these strata below the German Ocean, we
have much reason to suppose a still greater removal from the
horizontal line. The average depth of the North Sea is less
than 200 feet: how much of it is filled up with diluvium, and
how much by strata which have escaped destruction by sub
 sidence, or a minor elevation, is uncertain; but it is by no
 means impossible that a submergence may exist equal to the
 elevation which we see demonstrated upon the surface. At
 all events here is a valley where a mountain of no mean eleva
 tion once stood, or might have existed still, but for the act of
 another agency; and whether the operation of elevation, frac
 ture and removal, took place under water at a higher or
 lower elevation of this part of the globe than the present, or
 not, is not now material.       Contemplating the removal of
 masses of comparatively recent structure like these, of which
 it is hoped we have proof, it becomes no extravagance to
 suppose that the chalk of England and Ireland have been
 united, and that the lias of both these countries and of the
 west of Scotlandt form parts of the same expansion.
    The modification of the earth's present surface may by
  some be considered as a matter of secondary importance, the
  mode of formation, next to structural arrangement, being
 with them the greatest point of attraction. There are others
 who consider it a matter of such inexplicable confusion, as to
  be out of the reach of a rational theory. To the first it may
 be answered, that        all
                        the parts     scienceof   hinge upon each

     Here is an operation which, singly considered, bespeaks a
uniform and simultaneous action along a line of country of
200 miles extent, with a totality so complete, and a harmony
of parts so consistent, as to amount to direct proof of unity of
cause.     But these appearances not only harmonize with each
other, and with operations which may be proved to be con
temporaneous; they agree also with the universal phaenomena
of structural derangement. Everywhere we observe protru
sion and subsidence, denudation and erosion, going hand in
hand.     In       parts      all
                              the globe we find longitudinal valleys

of their greatest activity: and whilst we allow that intervals
of long repose were necessary for the operations of deposit
and formation, we must also confess that they have given
place to paroxysms of perhaps not immeasurable activity.
   An act like the elevation of the anticlinal line, which
formed the basins of London and Hampshire, or the subsi
dence of these basins, would be alone sufficient to raise a wave
that would drown the habitable parts of half a hemisphere. A
few such actions coming into play contemporaneously, or in
quick succession, are cause sufficient for a deluge. The sa
gacity of a living geologist has shown that such a deluge was
universal; and a little further research only is sufficient to
show, that we need not leave our own planet for secondary
causes adequate to the purpose: to show also, that the flood
which left us the “Reliquiae Diluvianae,” was the flood of
denudation; and that that flood (denudation being in many
cases ruled by disruption and devastation from below) went
and came upon the earth many days.

effect is by no means the necessary consequence of the study of cor
rect Perspective. It is probable that the objectors are prejudiced by the
unpleasing appearance of the illustrations in books of Perspective; but
they should consider them as illustrations only, not as examples. In
these illustrations generally the horizon-line is made higher, and
the line of distance shorter, than the designer of them recommends
in his book; but this is purposely done for the sake of making plain
the thing taught, i. e. making it more visible; for if diagrams were
pictures, the parts described would be too minute and crowded, to be
intelligible.
    “Again; diagrams must necessarily be described by actual lines.
There are no actual lines in nature, therefore the diagram is displeas
ing: besides, (and this is an important ingredient of the difference
between a diagram and a picture,) visible lines have actual thickness
and intensity; and the same must necessarily be extended to the
distance represented; whereas that thickness and intensity ought to
vanish in the true perspective distance. The disgust therefore arises
from the diagram (the representative of the picture), not the picture
drawn according to            rules.   its

Mr. Barlow, the author contends that                 the phaenomena observed are
precisely those which must result from the theory he had himself
adopted ; and that they tend in no way to support the hypothesis of
their being simply the effects of the magnetic power which the iron
receives by induction from the earth.
    The author was also led to suspect the accuracy of another con
clusion which had been drawn by Mr. Barlow, namely, that the
length of the needle has no sensible influence upon the extent of                                                                   its

is but little influenced by the extent of surface. With fibrous sub
stances, such as cloth, the friction diminishes by an increase of
pressure, but is greatly increased by the surfaces remaining for a
certain time in contact: it is greater, catteris paribus, with fine
than with coarse cloths : the resistance is also much increased by an
increase of surface.       With regard to the friction of different woods
against each other, great diversity and irregularity prevail in the re
sults obtained : in general, the soft woods give more resistance than
the hard woods : thus, yellow deal affords the greatest, and red teak
the least friction.      The friction of different metals also varies princi
 pally according to their respective hardness; the soft metals produ
 cing greater friction, under similar circumstances, than those which
 are hard. Within the limits of abrasion, however, the amount of
 friction is nearly the same in                      all
                                             the metals, and may           general       in                   be

 have   in   diminishing friction, varies according                       to

    On reviewing the tertiary beds, the author remarks                      their history                in
three distinct epochs; viz. two                repose, and one  of      violent distur              of

 the interchange     of magnesian and non-magnesian limestones, and
  the violent disturbances which both have undergone in the vicinity
 of Nice, to the same cause which M. Von Buch adduces, viz. the
 proximity of pyroxenic lava. The trap-rocks have not been observed
 very near Nice: there may be such, however, within a short distance
 in depth; and the probability that there are, is strengthened by the
 prevalence of rocks of this class in the mountains of S. Troper and
 l'Estrelles, and the frequency of pebbles both of trap and porphyry
 in the tertiary conglomerates above described.
    The occurrence of dolomite and gypsum in what the author consi
 ders as the oolite formation, and the impracticability of recognizing
 in this formation near Nice any of the individual beds of which it is
 composed in England, are new proofs of the danger of judging of
 large tracts of country by rules derived from the study of detached
 specimens.—The same stratum, in different parts of Europe, assumes
 very different appearances; and extreme nicety of discrimination             in
judiciously applied, is more apt to mislead the geologist than - to           in
 struct him.
    Dec. 5.—The reading of a paper “On the Excavation of Valleys,

 Lyell, Esq. V.P. G.S. F.R.S. &c. and R. I. Murchison, Esq. For. Sec.
 G.S. F.R.S. &c. was begun.
    Dec. 16.-Messrs. Lyell and Murchison's paper, begun at the for
  mer Meeting, was concluded.                             -         -
    The   theory, long   since  enounced,   which ascribes the excavation of
 valleys to the long-continued erosion of streams, has been supposed
 to derive remarkable support from the appearances of the volcanic
 tracts in the interior of France; and the authors, referring especially
 to the works of M. De Monlosier, and the illustrations of that district
recently published by Mr. Scrope, conceive that what they had seen
themselves in Auvergne and the Vivarrais, strongly confirms the views
of these and other preceding writers.
    1. In the commencement of this paper, several peculiarities are
stated in the original form of the lava-currents, or “cheires,” of
Auvergne ; which, if overlooked, might lead to an exaggerated es
timate of the quantity of matter removed by the action of rivers. The
abruptness, especially, of the lateral termination of many of these
currents, is very remarkable, even where the lavas flowed in open
spaces, and where the surface has remained entire and apparently
unaltered since the time of their consolidation.        But the authors still
conceive that the waste exclusively attributable to running water
and     itsdetritus  in  Central France, must            in
                                                    the course of ages have
exerted most
          a       powerful   influence   onthe external form  ofthe country.

filled up with transported matter, and afterwards been excavated a
second time, generally to a depth below their original bottom.
     6. The authors conceive, with the writers already mentioned,
that a satisfactory explanation of these phaenomena may be derived
from the effects of the latest volcanic eruptions of Central France.
 For the more recent lavas appear to have dammed up the channels
of several rivers, and converted ancient valleys into lakes; wherein,
 as at Aidat and Chambon, alluvial matter is continually accumulating
 at present. The modern lava of Montpezat, in the Vivarrais, has
 thus obstructed the course of the Fontaulier, and given origin to a
 lake, since filled with river alluvion and volcanic ashes; and these
 deposits themselves, together with a part of the volcanic barrier,
 have been subsequently cut through by the action of the river and
 the waters of the lake. The early and more copious lava-currents
 of Auvergne must have occasioned larger lakes than those of recent
periods; and these, as has been stated by other authors, seem to
 have been gradually filled up with materials introduced by rivers,     .
 and occasionally by floods, from the sides or craters of volcanoes,
probably during their moments of eruption ; through which accu
 mulations new valleys were excavated by the continued action of
the rivers:—as at Mont-Perrier, to about 100 feet; and at Maurice
on the Allier, to the depth of 400 feet below their original bottoms.
The high antiquity of these alluvial depositions is inferred from the
fact, that their lowest remnants occupy as elevated a position on the
sides of the valleys, as the lava-currents of intermediate age in Au
vergne, and from the compactness and enormous mass of the tra
chytic breccias, which overlie and alternate with the alluvions.
    7. Lastly, since the sand and gravel containing the fossil bones
found on two different sides of the mountain of Perrier are overlaid
by a vast mass of trachytic breccia, it is concluded, that the ele
phant, rhinoceros, hippopotamus, hyaena, tiger, wild cat and other
quadrupeds, whose remains have been recently disinterred, must
have been inhabitants of this district before the most recent cones
and lavas of Auvergne had appeared, or the valleys had been exca
vated to their present depth; and even before the fires of Mont
Dor were extinguished.

the 29th of Novemberlast, for the purpose of a public expression of the
high estimation in which he is held at this day by the lovers of every
branch of Natural History, was eagerly adopted: and the Public
Dinner at Freemasons' Hall was attended by about 130 of the most
distinguished cultivators and patrons of Science; including most of
the officers of the Royal, Linnaean, Geological, Horticultural, and
Zoological Societies, the Rev. the Provost of Eton, and several of the
Professors of the Universities of Oxford, Cambridge, and London.
    Davies Gilbert, Esq. M.P., the much respected President of the
Royal Society, took the Chair, supported by His Grace the Duke of
Somerset, President of the Royal Institution, Lord Astley, and other
persons of distinction.
    In proposing “The Memory of Ray,” the Chairman said that he
felt it to be his duty to express his sincere acknowledgements to the
company for the high honour they had done him in calling him to the
station he then so unworthily filled. He was aware that so gratifying
a compliment had been paid to him, solely on account of his occupying
the chair in which the too great kindness of the Fellows of the Royal
Society had placed him ; but he valued it the more from that re
flection. That Society had been greatly honoured by having such a
distinction conferred upon it; and he spoke the sentiments of every
 member of the Royal Society, when he returned to the company
his sincere thanks on their behalf for this distinction.        To take an
active part on such an occasion must be gratifying to every friend of
science and of virtue: but however much pleasure might be felt in
participating in the proceedings of that day, and doing honour to the
memory of a truly great man, still far more satisfaction must be
derived from a consideration of the good effects which such a meeting
must produce. Men who had done good service to their country,
whether in the field of science or elsewhere, were entitled to its
grateful remembrance; the display of that remembrance was calcu
 lated to incite others to an honourable struggle for similar distinction;
 and he was sure that when these proceedings should become known,
they would tend greatly to promote the cultivation of the science of
 Natural History. On the merits of the illustrious man whose birth
 they had met to commemorate, although any remark from him must
be unnecessary, he could not avoid saying a few words. The state of
 science at the period in which Ray lived must be so well known to
 those present, that it must be useless for him to refer to         it,
                                                                  except to.
 remind them   of  the difficulties with which he had     to  contend. To
 show the extent and importance    of   the labours of Ray,    he
                                                                would men
 tion some    of the principal works which    he    had produced. Among
 them were— Historia Plantarum Generalis        ;     Catalogus Plantarum
circa Cantabrigiam, &c., with Appendices; Methodus Plantarum circa
 Cantabrigiam, &c.; Catalogus Plantarum Angliae           et lnsularum ad

and A Collection of Travels into the Eastern Countries;" A Collection
of English Proverbs and unusual Provincial Words; Dictionarium
Trilingue; An Itinerary through England; Translation of Bishop
Wilkins's real Character; various Sermons and Theological Works.
The work published by Mr. F. Willughby, under the title of Orni
thologiae libri tres, &c. was known to be principally by Ray.                 In
the Philosophical Transactions were printed, among other papers,
On the Manner in which Spiders project their Threads; On the Dis
section of a Porpoise; On the Swimming Bladders of Fish; On the
Effects of Poisonous Roots, and the Virtues of the Leaves of Hem
lock; and Observations (1699) made on the Comet that appeared at
Rome;” and the last of his works which he should mention was
“The Wisdom of God manifested in the Creation.” This had been
very frequently reprinted, and was clearly the prototype of a late ce
lebrated book on the same subject. He had read the work of Ray
with infinite delight, and it was alike an honour to his head and to his
heart. But although his productions were so numerous, it was by
their excellence that they commanded attention.—Ray was the first
who reduced Natural History to a system, and prepared the way for
those more perfect arrangements which have since had so salutary an
influence on           its
                   cultivation.       was     his penetrating genius and in
                                                  It             to
defatigable exertions that the civilized world was indebted for many
most important discoveries.                did not himself always arrive
                                                  If        he                                                   at

                  he       out the   road;   and      was     his pursuing the
                                                                           it         to
course       had commenced, that we owed our present advanced state
             he
    many particulars      Natural History. Haller felt how much

to in
    Ray, and      termed him “the greatest botanist

man."      Ray very early distinguished himself.         While       college                     at
acquired      high fame, and some

authentic records of the elevation of Thera, Therasia, and other
volcanic islands, that the essence and leading features of much that
has been written since, on the theory of elevation and disturbance
by subterranean vapours, have been anticipated by Ray. His re
marks on the Structure of Mountains as containing and affording
access to metallic veins; their influence on climate, and use in col.
lecting clouds for the formation of rain, and production of rivers;
his observations also on the general diffusion of Springs, and their
never-failing supply of water, as derived from rains and dews,  show
much accurate observation, and point out correct conclusions which
have been often repeated, but rarely surpassed by his followers on
these subjects.

dual we must ever esteem, love, and venerate, and whose name the
annals of Philosophy will never cease to record among the first
founders and benefactors of Natural Science.”
    On giving “The University of Cambridge,” the Chairman took
notice of the expulsion of Ray from that University, which harsh act
he was disposed to attribute to the persecuting spirit which raged
without the walls of that learned seminary.             He could say of many
of the present members of Trinity College, that they regret that the
violence of the times had compelled their predecessors to acquiesce
in the retirement of Mr. Ray from his Fellowship, for refusing to
subscribe a declaration altogether unwarrantable.                Oxford had as
much to answer for in regard to her treatment of Mr. Locke.
    The Rev. Professor Henslow returned thanks. He remarked that
the University of Cambridge had, so far as the marble or the canvass
 could make amends, endeavoured to atone for the little, or, he should
 rather say, the great, injustice which Mr. Ray had sustained. The
 bust of that great man was ranged by the side of those of Newton,
 Boyle, Barrow, Dryden, and Willughby; and his portrait was con
 sidered to confer honour on the place in which it was. But Cambridge
 might with justice boast of possessing a far more powerful proof than
 those, of the estimation in which it held the genius and conduct of
 Ray. His spirit still lived there. And although the study of Natural
 History had not yet been brought to that degree of perfection there
 which it might be, he hoped the day was not                 off when   far
                                                                          would               it

 isting in a mineral water or in a fluid of animal origin is discovered
 by a green colour gradually developed by the action of the air.
    The property which coffee possesses of rendering albumen green
 by the action of the air, is derived from the gallic acid which it con
 tains; from which it follows that the reputed green colour of coffee is
 a product, and not an educt or immediate principle of the bean. Gallic
 acid renders albumen green; the effect is gradually produced ; it is
 strongest on the surface of this substance. As albumen contains car
 bonate of soda, it may be supposed that the green colour is derived
 from the action of this alkali; and this appears to be the case, for on
 saturating the alkali of the albumen with vinegar, no green colour is
 produced.—Plants which contain emeta or veratria are devoid of
 gallic acid. When tannin is combined with the alkalies, it appears to
 approach the nature of gallic acid-Ibid.
          NEW EXPERIMENTS ON THE COMBUSTION                                           OF COAL-GAS.

They act similarly with warm and cold water, alcohol, aether, potash,
ammonia, nitric acid, and chlorine; heated in a retort the same effects
are produced, and also by sulphate of alumina, and electricity; the
latter agent has been especially observed as to the effects which it
produces upon madder. . The hot infusion gave crimson-coloured
flocculi at the positive pole instead of yellow ones, and as they were
formed the liquor became colourless. These flocculi were insoluble
both in boiling water and in alcohol; they do not melt by heat, and
at the negative pole they give out hydrogen.
    Tincture of litmus subjected to the action of the battery in two
tubes, communicating with each other, became red at the positive,
and of a deeper blue at the negative pole. The red liquor was acid,
and the blue one alkaline.         By evaporation the red liquid left a sub
stance of a deep red colour, susceptible of being reduced to powder.
 It was rendered blue by the alkalies, and was soluble in aether. By
spontaneous evaporation small particles of a bright red colour were
formed, adhering to the vessel; this substance was less soluble in al
 cohol.
    The blue liquid again subjected to the action of the battery, be
came colourless at the negative pole, and gave red matter at the po
 sitive. The colourless liquor, evaporated and burnt, left potash or soda.
    The red liquid give scrimson precipitates with the persulphate of
 iron and nitrate of silver, and a violet precipitate with the subacetate
 of lead. Tincture of litmus even forms crimson precipitates with ba
 rytes, water, muriate of barytes, subacetate of lead, sulphate of zinc,
 persulphate of iron, nitrate of silver, and sulphate of copper.—Journal

     NEw CLASSIFICATION OF THE COLOURS OF THE RAINBow.
        To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals.
     Gentlemen,_As every improvement, however small, in scientific
classification, is of some importance, it is presumed that the follow
 ing will be thought not unworthy of a place in your miscellany.
  .  I have often  seen the rainbow, when very bright, repeated three
 or four  times,  every    repetition being gradually fainter; each set of
 colours   being  half the width of the preceding (like the repeated
notes of the musical octave on a divided string or line); and suc
 ceeding according to the following classification, which I consider
 as more scientific than the common enumeration.

   Here are three simple colours, red, yellow, and blue; and three
compound colours, orange, green, and purple, each divided into
two species; whereas in the received enumeration, we have a con
fused intermixture of genera and species in the same predicamental
line.
   Dr. W. H. Wollaston, in the Phil. Trans. for 1802, p. 378, infers
from some experiments, that a beam of white light is separable by
refraction, not into three, but four simple colours, viz. red, yellowish
green, blue, and violet; but of these the very term “yellowish
green” betrays           its
                      composition, and                         as

o'clock in the    evening.     It was at right angles with the magnetic
meridian, and appeared to rise gradually towards the zenith, moving
at the rate of about five degrees in ten or twelve minutes. At ten
minutes past six the upper edge of the arch seemed to touch the star

ascended to the star Mizar, in the same constellation;                Benetnasch

   ourselves about the position of the granite and              the killas
 (argillaceous slate, hornblende slate, greenstone); never before
 this time having an opportunity of seeing somuch of the junction
 between these rocks as the romantic cliffs of this county show.

granite near to the hanging or north wall is hard, but nearer
to the south wall it becomes more and more decomposed.
Several strings of granite start from the main vein into the
south wall, and end at a short distance. The north wall of
the granite is formed not by the serpentine, but by a vein of
steatite two feet and a half wide.        The granite of the vein is
fine-grained, and of the same description as in the other gra
nite veins.
    VI. Kennick Cove.—On the eastern shore of the Lizard              di
strict is situated Kennick Cove, near the village of Gwendra.
The prevailing rock is a serpentine of a close texture, of a
dark colour, either reddish-brown or black, containing fine
diallage in large spots; in it occur veins of granite, greenstone,
and steatite. The vein of compact greenstone appears at the
cliffs near (a) fig. 9, and a section of it is represented by fig. 10.
This vein is five feet thick, runs 30 degrees west from north,
dipping to the north-east with an angle varying between
25 and 45 degrees.        In both walls of it are found strings of
steatite, and a string occurs in the hanging wall, one foot wide,
filled with fragments of greenstone cemented by steatite.              A
very fine vein of steatite occurs not very far from this green
stone vein (fig. 11).      It is at the bottom five feet wide, and it
may be distinctly seen that it ends at the height of fifteen feet.
An earthy grayish substance is found forming both walls of the
vein, to the thickness of two inches and a half; it contains a
large portion of asbestus, so that the whole takes a fibrous ap
pearance. The steatite in the vein is of a grayish hue, which
evidently is derived from a great many little gray spots im
bedded in the mass, in the same manner as the spots of mica
in the granite of the veins. This gray steatite is intersected by
many strings of a very white steatite.          In the dark serpentine
forming the country of the vein occur frequently asbestus, cal
careous spar and talc, in little strings.                            -

greenstone (fig. 12), intersected      bystrings and irregular masses
of   granite, occurs near the cliff (e). The granite and green
stone are intimately joined together; the strings and veins            of
granite     donot hang together with the walls          greenstone, but

 runs out from the shore into the sea, consisting only of granite

length, which was kept close to the floor of the room by
weights, at the distance of 10 or 15 feet from each other. As
before, the whole length was illuminated; and the streams of
electric light were as long, but not quite so brilliant, as when
the shorter wires were used.
                                              I
     Being fully satisfied as to the fact, requested a number of
my scientific friends to examine the phaenomenon: in their
presence, the following facts were ascertained. The cushion be
ing insulated by a glass pillar two feet long, the wire attached
 thereto is illuminated at every spark which passes round the
globe, when in contact with the floor of the room: the light
 is always white; it was extended along the whole of any length
 of fine silver wire which we could make use of, and which we
 used to the extent of about 80 feet. If a conducting substance
 be brought within about $ an inch of any part of the wire,
 whenever the wire is illuminated a very pungent and dense
 spark is obtained: if the wire be connected with the gold-leaf
 electrometer, at every illumination of the wire a dense spark
 passes from the leaves to the tin foil; the leaves are scarcely
 separated, nor are they violently agitated; a very trivial undu
 lation alone being observed, although the spark emitted was
 at the least # an inch long.         Next, the wire was insulated
 by being attached to glass rods, placed at sufficient intervals
 from each other. The wire was always negatively electrified;
 and since a star of light appeared at the end of the wire, we
  were certain that the insulation was good; the wire being about
  80 feet long: the illumination took place, as before, at every
  spark which flew round the globe.          g.
                                              presenting the finger
  towards   any  part  of the  wire, a stream of electric light was
  seen between them (the wire being highly negative); but, as
  before, at the moment of a spark, a very dense spark passed
  between the wire and the finger: the effect upon the electro
  meter could not be so well observed as when the uninsulated
  wire was used; for on bringing it sufficiently near to the wire,
  the leaves were permanently open and considerably agitated;
  yet at every spark, one passed from one of the leaves to the
   tinfoil without injuring or agitating the leaf.
     I   do not hazard a conjecture respecting the cause of this
   phaenomenon: however, the electricity seems to be in the same
   condition with that observed by Dr. Priestley, which he deno
   minated the lateral explosion.
      The machine with which these experiments were made, con

   bottle glass;   its
                     diameter  is about      18
                                            inches: the conductor is
 3    feet long, and     6inches     diameter: the spark measures
                                    in
   about  12  inches, when the machine          pretty well excited;

cepting a small number of brilliant cubical crystals, which
seemed to be a portion of sublimed galena.
  c. Three inches of the end of the tube connected with the
trough was nearly filled with sublimed galena, beautifully cry
stallized in cubes of considerable size, and having a very
splendid appearance. . These crystals broke again into other

to heat. A small quantity of ore was deposited in the coldest
part of the tube, near the end projecting from the furnace, in
the form of a fine blueish-gray powder without cohesion. Not
a particle of true metallic lead was produced by the operation.
    Experiment 2–Another tube was coated and arranged ex
actly as in the last experiment. , Nine inches of the portion
nearest the trough were filled with pieces of recently burnt
lime, each about the size of a pea; and when heated to white
ness, 600 grains of galena were introduced into the end of the
tube to which the retort was attached; and after being suffi
ciently heated, it was carried through the highly incandescent
lime in the state of vapour, by a current of steam. During the
process a large quantity of sulphuretted hydrogen gas was
given off, but the water in the trough never became so milky
as in the last experiment.

               Mr. Nixon             on the Curvature              of Spirit-Levels.           175
tubes were about six inches long, nearly half an inch in dia
meter, slightly conical, and their bubbles were estimated to
move the one-fortieth part of an inch for a variation of inclina
tion equal to one second.
    Conceiving that the reversing points of the levels of the
horizon-sector might be more immediately and correctly ascer
tained from scales of equal parts attached to the tubes, than
by determining from measurements on the graduated arcs the
situation of these points relative to the fixed marks drawn on
the surface of the tubes, it became necessary to verify the esti
mated curvature of the levels. In the accomplishment of this
object, the sector afforded singular facilities; but as the mani
pulation of the instrument may not be generally understood,
I   prefer pointing out the method by which the level of the
telescope of a good theodolite may be mounted with a scale,
 and the angular value of                     its
                                  divisions obtained.

quisite degree of accuracy, it will, however, be necessary, as an
error of one minute might be committed in the graduation of
the arc, or in the reading off, to continue the operation of
first depressing the telescope by the same screws of the parallel
plates, and of subsequently elevating it by the tangent-screw
of the vertical arch, noting in the proper column after every
depression or elevation of the telescope the distance of the
ends of the bubble from the zero of the scale, until a sufficient
multiple of the mean angle shall be obtained.                  Lastly, find
the sum of each column, and divide the angle read off the
vertical arch by half their difference, which will give the value
in seconds of one division of the scale. The original scale
may now be taken off, and the one substituted, divided into
equal parts of one second each.               A black-lead pencil being

one of the levels of the sector, the variation of inclination be
ing the same for both levels, it appeared that one division of
the scale of the former, also of forty to the inch, was equal to
1"-480*. (In this and the following experiments, the axis of
the short level was invariably made parallel to that of the
sector level, the line on which the divisions are drawn being
perpendicular in the two levels to their respective axes.         As
neither of the levels might be uniformly curved throughout,
they were rendered strictly parallel in horizontal inclination;
and care was taken never to drive the bubbles completely to
 the extremities of the tubes.     The values quoted are the mean
 of three or four satisfactory  measurements of about 100" each.

 of the brass indices of the sector previously spread over with
 glue, and left to dry. The divisions were now 1".679 each.
    No. IV.-The level being glued to the surface of a maho
 gany.bar, eight inches long by one inch square, fixed to the
 cylinder of the sector, the divisions, after a lapse of a couple
 of days, were found to be 1"'854 each. On repeating the mea

  (with cotton wool) was confined to the ends of the tube.—Value

 little satisfactory explanation of the causes of the variations
 in the curvature of the levels, and one or two might have been
 differently anticipated, they amply serve to prove that the

    phical Society",
 THE        calcareous rock on the coast at Scarborough, which
        Mr. Smith considers as corresponding with the great
 oolite of Bath, is covered by beds of sandstone much marked
 with oxide of iron. Whilst            I was examining these beds in
 1826, my attention was attracted by a mineral+, with which
 they are in many parts veined, of a white colour, but not
bearing, to my eye, the appearance of calcareous spar. Finding
 that this substance had the property of adhering strongly to
                 I
the tongue, conceived it to be probably aluminous, and pre
 sented a specimen under that character to the Yorkshire Phi
 losophical Society, after having ascertained that sulphuric acid
 and potash converted the greater part into alum,               I  have lately
examined it more       accurately,    and find it to differ from any of
the aluminous minerals which have been yet described.
     The mineral when pure is perfectly white, without lustre,
with a conchoidal fracture, easily scratched by the knife, and
polished by the nail; it is highly adhesive to moist surfaces;
when breathed upon, it has a strong earthy smell; when put
into water, it does not become translucent nor fall to pieces,
but gains considerably in weight. The absolute specific gra

    + In the account of these beds prepared by Mr. J. Phillips for his forth
coming publication on the Geology of Yorkshire, the veins here mentioned
are thus described:     “The calcareous and irony strata (great oolite,
Smith) have their long straight intersecting fissures often lined with double
laminae or septa of oxide of iron, between which sometimes occurs a white
compact, soft, smooth substance, which the Rev. W. Vernon has ascer
tained to be a new aluminous mineral; exactly similar septa, and occa
sionally the same aluminous substance occur in the superincumbent vari
able beds of sandstone; and in addition, this bed presents a number of
ochraceous belts or zones parallel to the margins of  §.    blocks, and beauti
fully variegating the blue or white colour of the stone.”

     Ifthis be taken as the more correct    determination,  the sub
 stance may be considered as a silicate of alumina, in which
 the alumina is rather more than five times the weight of the
 silica.   Klaproth and Berthier have analysed two minerals,
 the one called Kollyrite, the other, siliciferous hydrate of alu
 mine, in both of which the alumina is about three times the
 weight of the silica; and there is a mineral called Allophane,
and another called Lenzinite, in which it appears, from the
 analyses of Stromeyer and Dr. John, that the proportions of
these elements are nearly equal, the weight of the alumina in
allophane being somewhat greater than that of the silica. The
atomic weights of alumina and silica are not perfectly settled;
but it is evident that they do not differ widely from each other,
and that the atom of alumina weighs rather more than the
atom of silica. It is probable, therefore, that in the two last
of these minerals, one atom of silica is combined with one
of alumina; that in the minerals analysed by Klaproth and
Berthier, one atom of silica is combined with three atoms of
alumina, and that, in that now described, one atom of silica
is combined with five atoms of alumina. Should this view.
of   its composition prove         correct,
                                   to        be will require sepait                       a

cette différence d'une manière plausible.              On l'a d'abord at
 tribué à l'imperfection des instrumens, et M. Méchain, tout
le premier, était de cet avis. D'autres l'ont cherché dans un
 défaut d'attraction vers la mer, ou dans une attraction plus
forte vers les terres, qui sont au nord de Mont-Jouy, qui y
avaient attiré le fil-à-plomb, ou la liqueur des niveaux, et au
 raient déplacé le vrai zenith. Mais toutes ces explications
n'étaient que des hypothèses impossibles de prouver; par con
 séquent, ce phénomène est toujours resté inexpliqué d'une
 manière satisfaisante.                                                  -

de l'éclipse d'une étoile par une étoile. Le durée de ces
éclipses parait fort longue, et cela s'explique par la lenteur de
le révolution apparente de l'étoile satellite autour de la prin
cipale. Les astronomes modernes ont déjà rencontré les prin
cipales variétés de ces phénomènes; Herschel n'a pu revoir
les compagnes de plusieurs étoiles qu'il avait antérieurement
reconnues positivement doubles; tout récemment encore, on
a fait de vains efforts pour découvrir les satellites de : d'Her
cle et de 8 du Cygne, notées comme multiples depuis long
tems; enfin, d'autres étoiles, telles que d'Orion, qui étaient
simples, sont devenues doubles. Il importe donc de récon
naitre à la quelle de ces deux espèces d'étoiles multiples , de
la Grande Ourse appartient, pour savoir si elle a pu présenter
l'éclipse de sa compagne à Mont-Jouy et à Barcelone.........
Une semblable observation, (continue M. Nicollet) n'a encore
été faite q'une fois, que je sache; et parmi tant d'étoiles qui
auraient pu y donner lieu, le hasard a voulu q'elle tombât

190          Mr. Children's Abstract of the         Characters     of
    vailing character; viz. the remarkable thickness of the
    abdomen of the female moth, deriving the term from the
    two Greek words yaarºp venter, and Taxus crassus. That
    other authors have not thought with Ochsenheimer, as to
    the propriety of creating new genera and new names, is
    pretty evident, from the list of synonyms immediately
    preceding these observations; and in the present instance
    they seem to be right.

198            Mr. Corbaux        on the Laws        of Mortality,
    Wagtail. — The other two species of Wagtail, namely
M. alba and M. Boarula, are both indigenous here; many of
the former, and a few of the latter, remaining the whole year.
   Dr. Heysham in his Catalogue of Cumberland Animals,
published in the year 1796, states that both these species en
tirely left this county in the winter; although he appears to
have had some doubts with respect to M. Boarula, from the fol
lowing observation: “Appears in Cumberland in the spring,
and leaves it in October or November; and in very mild winters,
          I
a few, believe, remain with us the whole year. I saw two on
the 5th of January this year between the bridges.” . For some
years past      I
                have paid considerable attention to the subject,
and   I am satisfied that some of both remain here even during
our most severe winters. In confirmation of which,         have                 I
observed both on the several days mentioned below, and have
added to each the minimum height of the thermometer.

  In concluding these desultory observations, it may not be amiss
to state that the generic and specific names made use of above,
are those adopted by Dr. Fleming in his recent History of
British Animals, which contains one of the best and most na-.

XXXI.         On the Laws      of Mortality, and the Intensity of Human
                    Life.     By Mr. FRANCIs CoRBAUx.**
THE    natural law according to which the waste of human
  life takes place, is the principal regulator of innumerable
transactions.   Researches of scientific men, long before this
subject of consideration had acquired                      its
                                              present and daily
growing importance, were directed        ascertain the reality
                                                     to                                of
such  a  law,    expressing with some degree
                    as                              accuracy the      of
comparative rates        of
                       mortality            at
                                   the successive   stages    our               of
lives. Actual experience—the only guide         those researches in
—was resorted to, but without discrimination, the necessity                            of
which was      at
              first overlooked.  Hence the erroneous and al
most unrestricted supposition, that law      mortality inferred

from observations made in a particular country or even limited
district, and confined to an abridged period of time, might be
applicable to        all
                       species             of
                                      concerns depending               the pro                 on
bable duration          specific
                        of         lives. To      admit,       universal,   any  as
law   of mortality    whatsoever,      under the     present   constitution                                     of
society, would          be      an

                                           less palpable.       On the other

had undergone           material alteration within

 which measures the probability that life will endure another
 year, or else the corresponding quantity of living persons, out
 of which one death (precisely) is to occur during the same                                                         in

 the intensity of life from year to year.          In both sexes, this                                              in
 tensity is less at the birth than at any intermediate period from
 that time, until an advanced age attainable only for the pri
 vileged few ; but it gradually increases, so long as the human
 frame acquires any further development, and whilst nature
 may continue         supply  its additional vigour, provided that no
                                               of

                       ..
duals remaining alive, out of the quantity supposed annually
to be born; and secondly, the absolute quantity of the living,
at each year of age:          quantities constitute the distribution
of the whole comparative population just mentioned.
   Whilst the greater superiority of the selected class neces
sarily produces the greater sum of permanent population, as
arising from any common radix of annual births, that relative
                                                   .
sum, also regulating the average of forthcoming years that
belong to each infant born, differs less, as regards the con
tradistinguished sexes, than it does in case of lives of an         in
ferior quality. If 23 years’ difference in that average takes
place from one sex to the other, respecting a class selected as
perfect, that quantity will extend to 3 years for a second class
to which the life-annuitants may be assimilated; to 33 for a
third class, or that of assurable lives; to 3% for the general po
pulation of such countries as Great Britain or France, and
even to four years for the inferior-    qualities - of lives amongst
                                                                  -
that  general  population.
   The superior intensity, thus measured, of one class of lives
over another, without regard to difference of sex, is mostly
derived from the circumstances that attend early stages of life.
When, on the contrary, infancy is subject to                      con
ditions of existence, no consideration of comparative healthi
ness at subsequent ages, or of remarkable longevity amongst
the survivors, could afford any adequate compensation for the
curtailment resulting, in the population, from a deficiency of
wholesome subsistence, or of proper care towards the mainte
nance of health, during infancy.        In one country or district,
where those advantages are fully enjoyed, though from other
circumstances the rates of mortality should become very ele
vated after the meridian of life is passed, the comparative po
pulation growing out of an equal quantity of annual births,
may be as three to two, with that of another country or district
in which infancy suffered privation and neglect; though from
advantageous circumstances of climate and soil in the latter,
the mortality proceeded at a very slow pace amongst the sur
vivors, and the observation of facts tended to establish there
 at very high rates the expectation of life in old age. This
again gives warning of the caution with which data, merely
local or circumstantial, ought to be admitted, and of the errors
likely to follow an extended application of them.
    Nevertheless, the data now possessed towards constructing
a law of mortality applicable to either sex and of any specific
class, are sufficient for obtaining very satisfactory results; pro
vided they are judiciously employed, and that their compari
son be governed by an attentive consideration of physiological
                                                           principles.

endeavour        deduce some general conclusion from

   In   the Phil. Trans. 1824, Dr. Tiarks gives the difference
of   longitude between Dover and Falmouth, determined by
chronometers, equal                   to
                               25'28":42        time; and the difference

the observatory at Portsmouth, equal to 9' 421.91 in time.
Let us now compare this quantity with the result of geodeti
cal computation.
   The longitude of Dover has already been calculated in this
Journal for September 1828, p. 191; viz.
                                 1° 19 23"-78 east.
           to the Survey*, the distance of Beachy Head from
the meridian of Greenwich is 98.08 fathoms; and the lati
tude being 50° 44'21", the longitude will be found equal to
15'15"02 east: wherefore the difference of longitude between
Dover and Beachy Head is
                                        19 4' 81-76.
If to this we add  1° 27' 5".7, which, by former computations,
is the difference of longitude between Beachy Head and Dun
nose, we shall get the difference of longitude between Dover
and Dunnose; viz.
                                  2° 31' 14/.46.
According to the Survey+, the distances of the observatory at
Portsmouth from the meridian of Dunnose, and from the per
#. ndicular to the meridian, are respectively 3623 and 11083
            The latitude of Dunnose being 50° 37' 5", the
stance between the parallels of the two places will come out
                                                                                                    di
equal to 11081 fathoms; and as a degree of the meridian at
the latitude of Dunnose is 60815 fathoms, we get the difference
of latitude equal to 10' 56", and the latitude of the observa
tory equal to 50° 48'             1".
                               Having now the latitude     the ob                           of

the difference   oflongitude will     found equal  be 38" 45 east             to   5'

                                                    of

 The geodetical calculation         probably very near the truth:
                                              is
 for  if we set aside the two first results which Dr. Tiarks has

 they are   insome degree irregular and different from the rest;
 the difference       longitude between Dover and Portsmouth

as they have been observed, confirm my former argument,
drawn from the perpendicular measurements, in favour of the
spheroid of revolution deduced from the lengths of meridional
arcs. It would be very desirable to add to the instances al
ready noticed, the difference of longitude between Dover and
Falmouth which Dr. Tiarks determined by chronometers;
but I have not made the calculations requisite to find the geo
detical value of the same quantity.
   The measurement of portions of a parallel of latitude lately
made in France and the north of Italy, may be viewed pre
cisely in the same light as the operations relative to Dover

ginning at Marennes near Bourdeaux was carried eastward
          France to Geneva, and then continued in the same
direction to Padua.      By means of the triangles the differences

If  the geodetical and astronomical differences             longitude         of

have been that the earth coincides              figure with the as

   The matter has, however, been viewed differently. The

in   place   of   the geodetical amplitudes, we shall have                                          1741,078

Now the differences between the mean degrees and the degree
on the assumed spheroid, which are considerable, arise solely
from the small differences between the geodetical and the
astronomical amplitudes, or rather, as we are warranted in
saying, from the errors of the astronomical amplitudes.           If
the small intervals of time, namely 1":142 and 1"-219, by which
the geodetical exceed the astronomical amplitudes, may be
ascribed either wholly or in part to errors of observation, it
will be allowed that the lengths, 51 metres and 31 metres,
by which the degree on the assumed spheroid exceeds the
mean degrees answering to the astronomical amplitudes, rest
either on no authority, or on doubtful authority. Very little
stress can therefore be laid on the new compression of the earth
deduced from the combination of the mean degrees, viz.
77886 and 77866 metres, with degrees of the meridian already
known.     It may very well happen that this method of pro
ceeding, instead of bringing us nearer the truth, may lead us
away from         The conclusion that follows directly and na

210       Mr. Phillips          on a new Oride              of Manganese,                &c.
printed in the Phil. Mag, for July and August last, he has
again mentioned, that during solution in sulphuric acid the
peroxide becomes protoxide; and as the result of further
examination,        I
                  readily admit the accuracy of his assertion.
    I employed in my first experiments, to the best of my re
collection, the native oxide of manganese, which occurs, and
frequently in masses of great purity, in Warwickshire; this
has I believe been regarded as the peroxide of the metal. On
repeating my experiments, I soon found, however, that it is not
constituted as the peroxide is usually admitted to be; and in
prosecuting my inquiries,                I
                               discovered that it is a compound
of the metal and oxygen, which has not, as far as my researches
have extended, been hitherto noticed. This mineral is of a
gray colour, the tint of which is not remarkably different from
that of the well-known crystallized peroxide; it          however,                     is,
less brilliant.         much harder than the peroxide, does not

cated the quantity of oxygen gas remaining in the retort.
There were left undissolved 7-8 grains of peroxide of man
ganese and silica; consequently, allowing one grain for the
sulphuret of copper, 1912 of the oxide were decomposed by

   The capacity of the retort was 18 cubic inches, of which
the acid and oxide occupied 5; by deducting 13 from the
contents of the air-jar, amounting to 83°5 cubic inches at 60°,
we have 70-5 of oxygen gas, to which are to be added 5-5
inches left in the retort, giving 76 cubic inches as the whole
of the oxygen gas, yielded by 1912 of the oxide of manga
nese.   On repeating this experiment, I procured 76-7 inches
of oxygen  from 1925 of the oxide; the mean is therefore 39.8
inches = 13.48 grains of oxygen from 100 of the ore. The
peroxide of manganese being composed of 44 metal and 16
oxygen, half of which it loses in becoming protoxide, it is evi
dent that the Warwickshire ore is very differently constituted;
for as 100: 13:48::44: 5'93, which is less than three-fourths
of the oxygenth at should have been obtained from peroxide.

      There are two circumstances in which the Warwickshire
 ore agrees very nearly with manganite, viz. in the weight
 which it loses by exposure to a strong, and a low red heat.
I    have already observed that the first-mentioned oxide loses
  13:26 per cent by a strong heat, which differs only 0-11
 from that lost by manganite according to Dr. Turner: by a
  low red heat, the ore now under consideration loses 10.2 per
  cent; while manganite loses 10:1. There               however, one fact   is,
  which proves that the Warwickshire oxide                  not deutoxide,        is

   The agreement between the experimental results and the
calculated composition seems to me sufficiently near to de
termine the nature of the Warwickshire ore; and it may be
observed, that the atom of oxygen which the water contains
would convert the two atoms of deutoxide into two of per
oxide.                                              -
   As Dr. Turner, in his analysis of manganite, does not ap
pear to have suspected that it loses oxygen at a red heat, it
seems to me extremely probable that the composition of man
ganite is similar to that of the Warwickshire oxide; and con
sequently, about one half of the loss, which is attributed by
Dr. Turner wholly to the expulsion of water, is in fact derived
from the extrication of oxygen.     I   am confirmed in the pro
bability of this view of the subject, by the analyses which
Dr. Turner has given of psilomelane and the manganese oridé
noir barytifere: if we suppose the former to consist of 69-795
red oxide and 6-018 oxygen, instead of 7.364; and the latter
to be composed of 70.967 red oxide and 6'119 oxygen, instead
of 7.260 as stated,—the difficulty which Dr. Turner has ob
served exists in reconciling these oxides with an atomic consti
tution will vanish; and from the near approach to equality of
the atomic weights of oxygen and water, such an error as
I  have proposed to correct might very readily occur. One
circumstance may be observed with respect to the peculiar
oxide which I have now described, viz. that it is the only one
of five oxides of manganese which has not been formed
artificially.

214      Mr. Phillips         on a new Oxide           of Manganese, &c.
   There are some other statements in Dr. Turner's memoir,
on which I shall offer a few observations. He appears to doubt
the existence of a permanent red sulphate of manganese, and
to suppose, when it is obtained, that it soon becomes co
lourless, a precipitate being deposited in it which is the red
oxide. “If the (sulphuric) acid,” he observes, “which re
tains an amethyst tint even when cold, be again heated, the
red colour speedily disappears; because the red oxide, which
is dissolved in small quantity by the sulphuric acid, is then
also converted into the protoxide with the evolution of oxygen
gas. The red colour disappears gradually even without the
aid of heat; for the solution will be found after a few days to
be almost and sometimes quite colourless, when a minute
quantity of red oxide has subsided to the bottom. On apply
ing a very gentle heat the red oxide is redissolved, and the
acid acquires a lively amethyst red colour.       It is easy by
operating in this way, to obtain satisfactory proof, that a mi
nute portion of red oxide suffices to communicate a rich co
lour to a considerable quantity of sulphuric acid. The acid
may be made to retain the red colour, either by diluting it
with water, or by keeping it in contact with undissolved
 oxide.”
     Ihave frequently obtained the red sulphate of manganese,
possessing, not merely an amethyst tint, but a most intense
*
                                    I
and beautiful red; and have kept such a solution for several
 months without         its
                     depositing any oxide, and without keeping
is it  contact with undissolved oxide; and dilution with water
so in  far from preserving the colour                  of
                                          the solution, that
                                                                                     it

I    have examined            the   circumstances         under which this red
sulphate   is produced; and              I        shall take this opportunity         of
stating the method       whichby             it    may  be formed with certainty

small quantity mentioned above, the proportion of deutoxide
held in solution was to that decomposed, only about as 1 to
10.    It is very remarkable, as Dr. Turner has observed, how
small a quantity of oxide gives colour to a large quantity of
solution; thus from what I have stated, it is evident that
about 6 grains of deutoxide impart a colour equal in intensity
to that of port wine, to a pint of solution of sulphate of man
ganese.     The red sulphate is also very easily procured by
moderately heating the artificial deutoxide in sulphuric acid.
It has been already noticed that the deutoxide of manganese
is obtained by merely drying the protoxide precipitated by
potash; the peroxide is also easily procured by decomposing
the muriate of manganese with chloride of lime; the precipi
tate is so extremely bulky, that a vial holding 1000 grains of
water, contained, even when well shaken down, only 60 grains
of   it.     employing chloride

    would have existed a very obvious analogy among them all.

 I determined the atomic weight of barytes.              The muriate of
 barytes of commerce always contains lead.                The reason                                        I
 take to be, that it is manufactured from the carbonate of ba
 rytes of Anglesark, which is probably mixed with some car
 bonate of lead.             I
                          do not recollect whether the chloride of
 barium which I employed was prepared by myself, or pur
 chased.      Supposing, it purchased, it was possible that my
number might have been affected by the lead present, which
 would undoubtedly tend to increase the apparent weight of
 the atom of barytes. To obviate this uncertainty, I purified a
 quantity of muriate of barytes by passing a current of sulphu
 retted hydrogen through            solution.    itswas then crystallizedIt

followed by that of the other materials.   The oxalate of lime is the
only substance entering into the composition of urinary calculi, which
is ever found in the form of distinct and specific crystallization; and
it then forms what is called the mulberry calculus. The author is
led from his observations, to suspect that carbonate of lime, although

tion,  and that the time of the heart's systole is nearly the half of the
whole time of a pulsation; and upon the formula given by Dr. Young
in the Philosophical Transactions for 1808, for estimating the friction
of fluids moving in pipes : in the application of that formula the
mean dimensions of the circulating vessels are assumed as in Dr.
Young's Croonian Lecture, published in 1809. He thus arrives at
the conclusion,-that the motion of the blood becomes uniform at the
26th division of the arteries, reckoned from the aorta ; and that at
this point, the pressure, as measured by the corresponding heights,
is reduced from 90 to 80 inches.
   As there are cases on record of universal venous pulsation, the
author pursues the inquiry into the mechanical conditions, which tend
to favour the production of this effect: and also applies the results
of the analysis to the explanation of the throbbing, or extension of
the pulse into parts where, in a state of health, it is not met with,
which accompanies phlegmonous inflammation.
   “On the mutual action of sulphuric acid and alcohol, and on the
nature of the process by which ether is formed,” by Henry Hennel,
Esq.     Communicated by W. T. Brande, F.R.S.
   The most abundant product resulting from the mutual action of
sulphuric acid and alcohol, without the application of heat, is the
sulphovinic acid : but on distillation, this peculiar product disap
pears, and ether is formed : and it becomes a question what part the
sulphovinic acid plays in this process.      In opposition to the assertion
of Messrs. Dumas and      Boullay,    that this acid is not concerned in the
production of ether, the author contends, that whenever etheris formed,
it is in consequence of the decomposition of the sulphovinic acid. He
obtained ether from this latter fluid by distillation, when neither sul
phuric acid nor alcohol was present. But if a certain quantity of
water has been previously added, the sulphovinic acid is resolved into
alcohol and sulphuric acid, and no ether is obtained: whereas, during
the distillation of ether in the ordinary way, the sulphovinic acid is
reconverted more or less entirely into sulphuric acid.         Hence he       in
fers, that the formation of the sulphovinic acid is a necessary and in
termediate step to the production of ether from alcohol and sulphu
    ric
     acid.          As

society For THE ENccuRAGEMENT OF ARTs, MANUFACTUREs,
                           AND COMMERCE.
     We feel pleasure in giving additional publicity to the following cir
cular, addressed to the Members of the Society of Arts, by the Secre-
tary to that useful Institution.
     The Society of Arts having taken into consideration the advantages
that would probably accrue from occasional meetings for disserta
tions on subjects connected with the Arts and Manufactures of the
country, illustrated by ancient and modern specimens, has determined
to appropriate to this object Seven Evenings during the present Session.
Ancient and modern Pottery and Porcelain have occupied the first two
 evenings; and, the subjects proposed for illustration on the others
are, the Arts of Stereotype Founding and Printing, and of Casting in
 Plaster of Paris, and the manufactures of Glass and of Paper.           The
 preparation of the Essay to be read on each evening has been con
 fided to the Secretary, who will be happy to receive either written or
 verbal communications illustrative of any of the above subjects.
     It is evident that much of the interest and instruction expected
from the proposed meetings, will depend on the abundance and qua
 lity of the specimens by which each subject shall be illustrated. Ap
plications have already been made to several individuals, both in and

 been met is a gratifying proof of the interest taken in the plan, and
 a presumption that other members of the Society will be equally will
 ing to contribute curious and interesting specimens, either directly
 or more remotely connected with the topic of each evening's discus
 sion. The Special Committee of Chairmen, to whom the details of
  the arrangement have been intrusted, request that such members as
  are disposed to contribute information or the loan of specimens, will
 notify the same to the Secretary at their earliest convenience, in order
  that measures may be taken by which, with the least inconvenience
  to them, the Society may in the most advantageous manner avail
  itself of their liberality. The Society will also feel obliged by the loan
  of any articles that will add to the interest of these meetings; cha
  racteristic specimens of natural substances, especially of those that
  form the raw materials of the arts and manufactures of the country,
  tools, instruments, and models of machinery, samples of new and
  beautiful fabrics, fine works of art, books, and prints, will be parti

     SOLUTION of pure arsenic acid, mixed with common sugar
      powdered, becomes in some hours of a reddish colour, then of a
magnificent purple. The experiment succeeds in the cold, and with
out the presence of light. The sugar of fruits and that prepared
from starch produce similar effects.     Sugar of milk gives a reddish
brown   colour, and sugar of manna    (mannite) a brick red; the sugar
of urine and    oil wine produce                         orno
                                       colour. No similar phaenome
mon  is observed         if of
                    the arsenites     arsenious acid be substituted for
arsenic acid. Phosphoric acid, which has much analogy with the
arsenic, does not colour sugar             they may     at    all

 receiver and safety tube are to be adopted, and then heat is to be
applied until the mixture nearly boils; 3 parts of muriatic acid are
now to be gradually added; when the effervescence is over, and the

to prevent any impure matter from distilling over. The product is
impure amylic acid, scarcely coloured; and though it contains no hy
drocyanic acid, it has a strong smell of bitter almonds; to free it
from muriatic acid the liquid is to be saturated with carbonate of lime
filtered, evaporated till a pellicle forms, then allowed to cool and
crystallize, and when the crystals of amylate of lime have been sepa
rated, the mother liquor is to be further concentrated.           The crude

does not precipitate nitrate of silver; then mixing 100 parts of these

                       Discoverty                of   coAL NEAR LEICESTER.
   A report was made in Sept. 1827, by Mr. Francis Forster, mineral
surveyor, on the probable existence of coal in the vicinity of Leices
ter, arising from the supposed extension of the Ashby coal-measures,
under the new-red-sandstone formation, from Ibstock near Ashby,
by way of Bagworth, Desfond, Kirby-Muxloe and Glenfield towards
Birstall;  thus passing within about two miles of Leicester. The opi
nions expressed in this report have since been confirmed in great
measure by the discovery of a seam of coal, by boring near Bagworth.
A detailed extract from the report, accompanied by a sketch of the lo
cality, will be given in our next.

notes relative to the Horticultural Society's barometer. It has been

I subjoin partly from it what refers to the instrument in question.

  Extracts from a letter addressed                to George Rainy, Esq., of Demerara, in
1823, by John Hancock, M.D.
  “With      respect to the new discoveries, as they are termed, towards
the south   pole, I am fully persuaded that Smith's New South Shetland
is no other than the land discovered by Gerrard, a Dutchman, more
than two hundred years ago.        If it be not the same continuous coast,
it doubtless belongs to the same Archipelago or cluster of islands.
    “Smith having made the land far to the eastward and somewhat
northerly, ran down the coast precisely in the direction of Gerard's
land-fall, and to within three or four hundred miles of the same, sup
posing Gerard to have been correct in his reckoning, or in the esti
mate, I should rather say, of his position.
  “I    observed some very long and learned discussions in the Lite
rary Gazette, in Blackwood's Magazine, and other publications of
 1820, respecting the courses sailed by Cook and other navigators in
the Southern Ocean;         thence deducing the reasons why this im
portant discovery had never before been made. Not the slightest
notice or allusion occurs, however, in these publications, with respect
to the land of Gerrard.—I had remarked the omission to Captain
M'Pherson of Perth Estate, and to several gentlemen in this vici
nity, at the time those publications reached us.
   “I   did not, however, believe that the real merits of this case would
have remained so long concealed from the public. It is indeed dif
ficult to account for this silence; for we can hardly conceive that the
 editors of those periodicals could be ignorant of Gerrard's discovery,
 and of the probable identity which I have alluded to, and which is the
more striking and conclusive, from the remarkable coincidence in the
descriptions by which the two navigators have characterized the phy
siognomy of the coast; both expressly comparing               appearance   its                   to
that   ofthe coast     Norway”.

 that both Gerrard and Smith have beheld, not merely the same con

  General Observations.—This month has been generally dry, cold, cloudy,
and windy; and from the 14th   the 25th  was seasonable frosty weather,

25th. In the nights of the 19th, 21st, 22nd, and 24th, the thermometer re
ceded to 24 degrees, and in the night of the 23rd to 21 degrees.                   The icy
efflorescences      were pretty thick on the inside of the glass windows in the
mornings of the 20th, 22nd, 24th, and 25th. The moats and marshes were
firmly frozen by the 21st, and skating was eagerly pursued till the 25th. On
the 23rd the thermometer only rose 31 degrees in the clear unobstructed
sunshine,     being only 3 degrees higher than the maximum temperature
of the external air in the shade; and in the afternoon water froze in rooms
where there were fires; this therefore was a very cold frosty day with a
piercing gale from the N.E., and during the twenty-four hours water in an
exposed tank froze l ; inch deep.             On the same day in London, the ther
mometer was 6 degrees lower than it was here, and water froze rapidly at
noon in apartments with fires.
     At noon of the 25th three currents of wind prevailed, the lower one from
the East, the middle one from the North-west, and the upper one from the
South.       The inosculation of these winds brought down an inch in depth of
snow by 9 P.M., which was immediately succeeded by heavy rain, a sudden
depression of the mercury in the barometer, and a hard shifting gale through
out the night, which broke up the frosty weather. A difference of 124 de
grees in the mean temperature of the atmosphere of any two consecutive
months in the year, is very great, which was the case between the present
month and last December ; and as it occurred in the coldest season of the
year, and with but little difference in the sun's declination, very few per
sons, however cautious they may have been against the effects of such a
change, have escaped what is termed a common cold.
     The mean temperature of this month is 395 degrees colder than the
mean of January for the last 13 years.
     The maximum temperature of the air occurred in the nights of the 13th,
 17th, and 25th, instead of in the days.
     The atmospheric phaenomena that have come within our observations
 this month, are eight gales of wind, or days on which they have prevailed;
 namely, one from the North, four from the North-east, one from the East,
 one from the South-west, and one from the North-west.

 XXXVII.             On   the   Junction of the Granite and the Killas Rocks

                VIII.          Carclaze        Tin Mine        near St. Austle.
      ARCLAZE         tin mine is situated about two miles on the
       north of St. Austle, in the granite, and very near to the
junction of this rock and the killas (figs. 21 & 22).               The
junction is nearly perpendicular, but dipping to the south; the
 killas is decomposed into an earthy and argillaceous mass; but
 the stratification is nevertheless distinct, the strata underlie
 rapidly to the south; therefore the killas is in a position uncon
 formable to the granite. The mine forms a large excavation,
 open to the day, and is said to be 250 fathoms in length, one
 hundred fathoms in breadth, and twenty-one or twenty-two fa
thoms in depth.        The direction of the greatest length of this
remarkable opening is 30 degrees north of west. In the eastern
part of the excavation are several shafts sunk below the bottom
of   it,   bywhich       ore   tin
                                 raised   isthe depth     to
                                                           ten fathoms           of
under the adit.       The   granite    here      light yellowish white
                                                    is         of   a
colour, and extremely decomposed; the felspar                  changed,               is
into  a   white China-clay, and shows the contours              crystals               of
of   the common       size;   schorl occurs    very  frequently    here.
This granite differs from that kind which commonly prevails;
the twin crystals               do
                           not occur            but      in   it;

 composed granite, in which numberless double six-sided quartz
pyramids are imbedded: the contours of the crystals of felspar
may be seen very easily in the greater part of this granite; it
must therefore be a granite decomposed in situ, and not de
posited as an alluvium. The China-stone which is raised on
the western side of Tregonning Hill near Helston, is a granite
in which the decomposition has proceeded no further than to
render the whole mass friable; only one part     -
                                                   of the felspar is-

      IX. St. Michael's Mount.—St. Michael's Mount is a small
 island nearly three hundred feet high, situated in the bay, at a
distance of about three miles from Penzance; the greater part
of it consists of granite; the killas appears only on the northern
 side of the island, and is greenstone where it comes in contact
with the granite. The strata of the killas as well as the junction
 between both rocks dip to the north-east at an angle of 20 de
grees at the eastern side of the island; on the northern side the
strata dip in the same direction at an angle of 45 degrees; on
the western, they underlie very rapidly to the north; but the
junction of both rocks is not parallel to the strata of the killas
here, being nearly perpendicular.       Granite veins run in every
directionthrough the killas in the neighbourhood of the junction
 between both rocks; they start evidently from the main body of
the granite; they do not present any other fact than those veins
hitherto described.     Quartz veins occur very frequently in the
 killas; they both intersect the granite veins, and are intersected
by them. Other quartz veins, of which the mass is that kind
 called milk quartz, are more regular; they are from an inch
to an inch and a half wide, and therefore they may belong to a
different formation from those first mentioned.       Quartz veins
containing mica also occur, and perhaps they may belong to
 those veins of quartz, the description of which shall soon fol
low; but several of them may be said to belong rather to the
#.         veins.  Weins of mica, the crystals of which shoot out
  rom the wall to the interior, occur in the killas as well as in
the granite; they contain a small portion of quartz, and run
generally nearly east and west. . The main body of the granite
forming this hill is of a very light colour, containing much fel
spar, but no twin crystals porphyritically dispersed through
the mass; therefore it has some resemblance to the granite of
Carclaze, Cligga Point, and Tregonning Hill. But it partakes
of the nature of the granite at the two points first mentioned,
still more than by this appearance, by being intersected by
numberless quartz veins, running nearly east and west, dipping
nearly perpendicularly, containing fine crystals of oxide of tin,
wolfram, mica, apatite and topaz; their walls consist of a

to be of the same kind as those of Cligga Point and Car

given the description of granite veins in the killas and in the
serpentine, but these veins also occur in the granite itself;
Mr. Carne mentions them, page 53, loc. cit. The most south
western promontory of the Land's End district, Tol Pedn
Penwith and Cape Barrah, appears to exhibit the most ex
traordinary facts. The granite in the neighbourhood is that
of the common kind, with porphyritic twin crystals offelspar,
with schorl and pinite, as may be seen going down from the

248              Mr. Ewart             on the Phaenomena attending
ticity of the steam was equal to sixty pounds (including the at
mosphere) on the square inch, and, consequently, the interior
temperature about 290° of Fahrenheit, I applied the bulb of
a thermometer close to the opening of the safety-valve, while
the steam issued from it in great quantity, and it stood steadily
at 160°. The engine being in motion, and the steam, after
having passed through the cylinder, escaping to the atmo
sphere by a perpendicular pipe four inches diameter, and five
                       I
feet in height, applied a thermometer to the steam as it issued
from the top of that pipe, and found the temperature to be 212°.
   Finding the temperature of the issuing steam only 160° at
the safety-valve, close to the boiler, and 212° after it had passed
to the distance of five feet from the boiler,            constructed      I
an   apparatus   (fig.           1.)

    fied that the results were correctly stated.
       Various explanations have been proposed of some of the
    phaenomena which       have described. I
       It has been supposed, that the ascent of the mercury in
    figs. 2. & 3, and of the coloured water in fig. 4, is occasioned,
    not by the rarefaction of the fluid in contact with the upper
    ends of these tubes, but by the particles of fluid in the
    tubes (whether these particles be of air, water, or mercury)
    being drawn or sucked out by some kind of lateral action of
    the issuing fluid.   But if there were any action of that kind,
     its effects would have been apparent        the inverted syphon                in
    (fig. 3.); and the mercury     the  leg  next        (in which the

compounds is likewise indicated during the act of pulverizing
the mineral, some portions yielding readily to pressure, and
others giving considerable resistance.       Manganite and the
peroxide are not mixed in any uniform proportion.             The
harder, compact, laminated parts consist chiefly of manganite;
and the peroxide prevails in those portions which are made
up of small crystalline grains, so loosely cohering that they
crumble down under the pressure of the fingers. These por
tions are very soft, and yield a black powder almost as dark
as pure peroxide, and which like it is disposed, when touched,
to soil the fingers. Their specific gravity is 4:844; whereas
the specific gravity of pure peroxide varies, according to my
observation, from 4-819 to 4-94.                                 -
    The analysis of the Warwick ore confirms this view. The
ore indiscriminately reduced to powder, and exposed to a white
heat, loses, as you state, about 13:26 per cent, 5.4 parts of
which are water.       The powder which collects when the ore is
broken into small     fragments   with a hammer, lost in a white
heat 13:13     per cent,  only  497 of which were water. The
water in the softest portions above described amounted to only
2.97 per cent.
    These observations, admitting their accuracy, fully justify
the conviction expressed at the commencement of this letter,
that the Warwickshire ore is not a definite compound of man
ganese and oxygen, but a mixture, variable in different parts,
of manganite and peroxide. That you will find the remarks
accurate I do not entertain the least doubt; for I would not
venture, without being very sure of my facts, to differ from
so experienced and expert a chemist.
    In order to facilitate your inquiry, I send several fragments
of the Warwick ore, some of which are nearly pure manganite,
others are soft and consist chiefly of the peroxide, and in others
both oxides occur together. For the sake of comparison I also
send some fragments of crystals of the Ihlefeld manganite.
    It is worthy of remark, that in the Warwickshire manganese
 the manganite abounds most in the outer portions, while the
peroxide is most abundant in the interior.         There is no ap
pearance, therefore, of the ore having been originally manga
nite, and subsequently converted, in part, into peroxide by a
process of disintegration. To justify that supposition, the re
lative position of the two oxides ought to be precisely the re
 verse.
    II. I now   proceed to show that the doubt which you ex
 press concerning the accuracy of my analysis of manganite, is
 without foundation. You appear to imagine that the quantity
 of water reported in my analyses, was inferred from the loss
                                -                            which

which the ores experienced by exposure to a red heat, and
      I
that was ignorant of the well-known fact, that some of these
oxides lose oxygen as well as water at that temperature. You
must have overlooked a portion of my Essay altogether, other
wise you would not have made the supposition. By referring
to the commencement of the second part of that Essay, you
will find that the water was in every instance ascertained by
heating a known quantity of the ore to redness, and collecting
the aqueous vapour in a tube filled with fragments of the
chloride of calcium. This method is at least as accurate as that
adopted by yourself, and gives results of great uniformity.
The specimen of Ihlefeld manganite which accompanies this
letter, will enable you to correct me if          am in error.    I Of
course the same doubt, as applied to the analysis of psilome
lane and the manganese oridé baritifere, is equally inappro
priate. The difficulty of discovering the atomic nature of these
compounds arises, as                   I
                             have mentioned in my Essay, from
their impurity. The latter is visibly interspersed with parti
 cles of the peroxide; and the former, from           analogy      the its                to
other, and from the intimate manner            which     inassociated      it   is
in  nature with the peroxide,                     is,
                                       believe, equally impure.

£58        Mr. Galbraith on the Determination of the Latitude
new Observatory on the Calton Hill here; and being unprovided
with any very good instruments which could be relied on with a
tolerable degree of confidence, I thought if it were possible by
any means to connect it with the Trigonometrical Survey, my
purpose would be accomplished.          It is obvious, by observing
intersections from a few points or stations in the Survey, well
ascertained, my object would be more accurately performed.
But this would have required time, expense, considerable
trouble, and good instruments. It occurred to me, therefore,
that an extension of the problem above noticed, were the sta
tions judiciously chosen, so as to avoid the indeterminate case,
would answer the objects                I
                                 had in view. Thus, conceiving
the arcs between the stations visible from each other on the
surface of the earth to be straight lines, from which in mode
rate distances they do not much differ; or if great nicety be
required, let them be reduced to such by the usual methods,
and supposing meridians to pass through these points, and
also the place of observation,-then by the principles of sphe
rical trigonometry, the distances of these three points may be
computed, and consequently by the problem of Townley, also
the distances of the same points from the place of observation.
Now by spherical trigonometry the co-latitude and difference
of longitude of the place of observation from               the threeall   of
given positions,         which the latitudes and longitudes are
                             of
known, may         foundbe        by
                             computation.     The results, however,
would       be
            rather more accurate, were      correction for the sphe

posed by Townley,               let
                        the marginal figure
    be
   constructed, and apply the principles                        of
spherical trigonometry; since the lines em

= 167° 2'46".
     6.   It   is now necessary to compute the sides                            LC, MC, and
BC,which will be found to be LC= 17' 57":46, MC=24'56"-84,
and BC = 16'29".70.       Hence LC = 20.66 English miles,
MC =   28-71,  and BC = 18.98.
  7. In the triangle PLM are given the sides PL, PM, and
LM, to find the anglesPLM=97° 58' 24", PML-81°24' 48".
If Napier's           be applied to the triangle LPM, these
                         analogies
will be found to be 97° 58' 34", and 81° 24' 38" respectively.
Also PLM-H BLM + CLB = PLC = 167°2'46", as before.
In like manner PML-H LMC— PMC= 123° 39' 40".
   8. In the triangle LBC are given the sides to find the an
gle LBC = 51° 31' 32"; and consequently, LBC+PBL =
109° 58' 42".                                                                                 -
   9. In the triangle PLC are given the two sides PL, LC,
and the contained angle PLC, to determine PC the co-latitude
 =34° 2' 32"-6, and the latitude = 55°57'27'-4 N. deduced
from the West Lomond.
   10. In the triangle PMC are given the sides PM, MC, and
the contained angle PMC, to deduce PC the co-latitude, and
thence the latitude = 55° 57' 26"-8 obtained from the Isle of
Mav.
     #. In the triangle PBC are given the sides PB, BC, and
the contained angle PBC, to find PC the co-latitude, and thence
the latitude 55°57'28" deduced from North Berwick Law.
The mean of these three is 55°57'27'-4 N.
   12. In the triangle PLC there are given the three sides to
find the angle PLC, the difference of longitude between the
West Lomond and the Calton Hill = 7' 16"-5.             -
   Hence 3° 17' 4"–7' 16".5 = 3° 9' 47".5 W. by West                                              Lo

   13. Again, in the triangle PMC there are given       the sides                  all
to find the angle MPC, the difference         longitude between      of
the Isle    May and the Calton Hill =37' 5".6 W.
                   of
   Hence            2°

   14. Lastly,    the triangle PCB,in the sides are given    find                         to
the angle   CPB,   the difference     longitude between North
                                                        of
Berwick Law and the Calton Hill =27, 42"-4 W. Whence
                                53'-4 W. The mean of these
                                             3°
2°42' 11" +27' 42"-4                     =   9'
                           12m 39°5 W.
                        on to 3°
three gives   9'51"-2                     =

     All the portions with which we are now concerned seem to
 be  contemporaneous;       judging from their mutual conformable

 characteristic minerals at distant intervals (schorl and mag

   The north shore of the St. Lawrence, three miles and a half
above Brockville, and a small group of islands, seven miles
above that town, are principally of fine granular gneiss; but
in both places it becomes porphyritic, and red. It is there
traversed by granitic veins, whose white quartz, red felspar, and
copper-coloured mica, are in crystalline masses, varying from
one to three inches in diameter.      Quartz veins are frequent                                    -

     Iron pyrites, in very large quantity, is common throughout
the distance from Kingston to Brockville.                 Magnetic iron ore
occurs high up the Gananoque River, and on an islet in the
 St. Lawrence, one mile south-west from the mouth of the Ga
nanoque. Plumbago occurs in a creek six miles N.E. of

     Of thecontinuation of the primitive band of the outlet into
the State of New York, what little is known may be summed
up in the following words of Mr. Eaton:                     consists of      “It
mountain   ridges of gneiss,  with intervening  valleys    of transition
sandstone and limestone. The gneiss is more nearly in an ho
rizontal position than is usual for rocks of gneiss in New Eng
land. All these mountain ridges may be called by the general
name, ‘Macomb's Mountains*.’” It is bordered on the south
by transition rocks in the valley of the Mohawk.
   The gneiss “seems to be what Cleaveland calls “the most
recent variety, and often contains but little felspar or mica.
Sometimes it passes into an almost pure quartzose sandstone,
and frequently passes gradually into siliceous limestone#.”
   The geologist who confines himself to the margin and islands
of Lake Ontario, will be much puzzled in the distribution of the
rocks above the primitive.       Excepting                        its

scribed by           Mr. Eaton:—as the Mohawk Valley, the Rivers
                                 º
Genessee and Niagara, and the Excavations at Lockport; and
can so far bear testimony to the fidelity of his observations.
The utility, I may be permitted to remark, of certain changes in
nomenclature introduced by this gentleman, is very question
able.        I
          have seen           to justify the application of the
term “grauwacke” to nearly horizontal and usually shaly and
homogeneous rocks above the salt-formations, and abounding
in organic remains.      Whenever they are not strictly argillo
                                  .
calcareous  slates, they  are sandstones, with a base of clay or
lime. The old words limestone and sandstone seem to me as
proper as the “lime-rocks” and “sand-rocks” of Mr. Eaton.
If by the appellations “geodiferous,” “cornitiferous,” &c. given
to certain strata, pretty uniform in their situation and charac
ters over a great extent of country, it be only intended to
show them to abound in geodes, cherts, &c. they are allowable.

described by him as an aggregate of angular grains of quartzose
sand, cemented by indurated clay, and generally containing
glimmering scales of mica and talc.     A coarse variety called
Rubblestone (common    grauwacke)   is very  hard, and contains
large pebbles and fragments of argillite, slaty grauwacke, &c.
Glimmering scales are rare, or wholly wanting in this variety.
Colour generally gray.—(G.S. p. 33.)
  This is a very prevalent rock in the east part of the State of
New York.    West of the gneiss ranges of the Little Falls, it
runs along northerly from two to three miles S.W. from the Mo
hawk, about the same distance S. of the west branch of Fish
Creek and of the Salmon River, until it meets the S.E. corner
of Lake Ontario. It thus forms a belt from 8 to 10 miles broad,
between the carboniferous limestone, and a stratum called by
our author “millstone grit,” under which it is seen to pass
at Steel and Myer's Creeks, &c.

masses) underlies the Erie Canal for twenty miles east of Utica.

THE
  the
           excellent papers by M. Hansen and Prof. Bessel in
           late Numbers of the Astron. Nachr., have rendered
superfluous the explanation of the use of the transit for deter
mining time and latitude which was intended for this volume;
and the only part which I deem it proper, therefore, to insert
in this place, is the rigorous derivation of the formulae for de
termining the former of these elements.           This subject has al
ready been treated by Prof. Bohnenberger in the Journal of
Astronomy.             I
                    have endeavoured to render the rigorous for
mulae as nearly similar to the approximate ones as possible.
On the supposition of the true figure of the pivots, the line of
vision of a transit will in every position describe a great circle,
if placed at right angles to the axis of rotation. If the instru
ment has what is called an error in collimation (=                the line       c),
of   vision describes     small circle parallel

    M.  DE BLAINVILLE's              Report on the Subject to the Royal
    Academy of Sciences.

       My dear Friend,
I* HAVE

                                         Dr. Foville, of Rouen,
                   been favoured by my friend
                  of his interesting memoir on the Anatomy of
the Brain,  presented  some time since to the French Academy
of Sciences; and likewise with a copy of the report drawn up
by Professor Blainville, one of the examiners, to whom the
memoir was referred by the Academy.
   These papers have not yet been printed in France, but the
Doctor has obligingly consented to their publication in this
                        I
country; and have in consequence made the accompanying
translations, which are now at thy service.
  To those who may be unacquainted with the name of Dr.
                                                               i.
Foville, it affords me pleasure to have this opportunity of
offering my testimony to his talents, and to the steady zeal
with which he has devoted himself to his profession.
   At the Salpetriere and at Bicêtre he long enjoyed uncom
mon advantages for the prosecution of those          of study
which are more particularly connected with the subject of
these papers.
   Some of the anatomical facts which the Doctor has brought
to light were demonstrated to me by himself more than three
years ago.    He has since shown me others equally curious,
which    I
         believe he is now about to make public.

mode in which they may be introduced into the animal ceco
nomy. We see, indeed, that after such an application, a par
ticular phaenomenon is produced, and that a particular change
takes place in a particular faculty. But, first, the phaenomenon
is often a complicated one; and secondly, it is very rarely, if
ever, possible to discover the part or organ which has been
affected.     Hence the difficulty of ascertaining by this method

now proceed to analyse the memoir of Dr. Foville. [Believing
that the Doctor's views will be best understood from his own
explanation of them,        I
                        here insert the translation of his me
moir; and to avoid needless repetition, I suppress that part of
          which merely consists of the epitome of the paper.
Researches on the Anatomy of the Brain, presented to the Royal
  Academy of Sciences of Paris, by Dr. Foville, Er-internal
  Elève of the Civil Hospitals of Paris; Principal Physician
  of the Lunatic Asylum for the Department of the Lower
  Seine, &c.
      Gentlemen,
   During six years in which I was connected with the medical
service of the hospitals of Paris, I had the privilege of being
placed in immediate relation with those whose labours on the
subject of the diseases of the brain have mainly contributed to
the advancement of this branch of science.           I
                                                endeavoured to
profit by the advantages of my position, by imbibing their ob
servations and making myself master of their doctrines.
   For this object it was most essential to have recourse to
that foundation, without which         all
                                    medical theories vacillate
on the brink    annihilation,-on
                of               anatomy,  which has ever been
most     in

                       in                 the structure of the

brain.
  It  istrue that very important observations had been made
respecting the general development       of
                                         the nervous system, and
on   its
       gradual  complication     in
                                 the scale     animals; and that
                                                of
                                            to

We are nevertheless ignorant      ofthe structure        principal
                                                         of   its
parts; and the most widely received opinions with respect                 to
them, are perhaps nothing more than ingenious hypotheses,
which accurate observation may overthrow.
I    saw that     was necessary that
                  it                   I should examine for my
self. The first  object   myof

                         those theories.       In

      as they may be to us, they are altogether the offspring
      of our own imaginings, from the comparatively rude at
      tempts of the earlier methodists, to the Régne Animal of
      Cuvier, or the Horac Entomologicae of W. S. Macleay.
      They are human, not divine systems; and however beau
      f.
      tifully they may illustrate the apparently mutual connec
      tions and gradations in structure or habit amongst the
      countless multitude of beings that constitute the animal
      world, we have only our own assumption that any such
                  and connections really exist;-an assumption,
        owever, far from rash or presumptuous,     but, on the
      contrary, supported by the evident harmonies of nature.
      It is not, therefore, against such systems that we would
      object, but against their abuse; against the wild attempt to
      strain them beyond what their texture can bear; to make
      them, not the faithful guide and assistant to the student,
      but the laboratory note-book of the Great Author of Na
      ture | Such, at least, is the almost blasphemous trash,
      published by a celebrated foreign naturalist, in an other
      wise admirable work,-trash, of which it is difficult to
      say, whether it most deserves our execration, or our con
      tempt! Infinite power, trying experiments' First making

mining. It is a collection of papers or treatises contributed by dif
ferent writers; and if continued, as we presume it is intended it
should be, and the matter selected with judgement, it may form a
valuable record of many interesting facts and observations, which
must be constantly occurring, but which pass unnoticed, and are
buried with those who witness them, for want of a place to register
them for general use and advantage.
    The first paper is by the Editor, and is a proposal for establishing
a School of Mines in Cornwall, with suitable Professors for teaching
the sciences necessary to those who conduct the practical details.
It is rather surprising that in this educating age, and in a country
where Mechanics' Institutes flourish so much, nothing should ever
have been done for those who seem most to require this kind of
assistance; while institutions for this purpose have long ago been
thought to be essential in other countries.
    Two treatises by J. H. Vivian, Esq. F.R.S. follow. The first relates
to the celebrated process of amalgamating silver ores practised at
 Freyberg, in Saxony; and the second, to the modes of smelting sil
ver ores in different parts of Germany. These papers are stated by
 the author to be intended to assist such of his countrymen as may
 be engaged in the mines of America, to whom they will be ex
 tremely interesting, and particularly the latter. The defects of the
 methods at present in use in Mexico for the reduction of the ores
 are becoming daily more apparent, and the necessity of improve
 ment is more and more obvious. There is no practical experience
 on this subject in England; and although a difficult art cannot be
 taught in a treatise of this kind, yet Mr. Vivian has conferred a
 great benefit on those who are interested in the subject, by a con
 cise and luminous account of such processes as are most in esteem
 in the countries where much attention has been given to this branch
 of metallurgy. The paper is illustrated by engravings of a very
 judicious selection of furnaces and apparatus best adapted for
                                                                         -
  the purpose.
     The next paper, by the Editor, describes the arrangements of
 pumps now employed in the largest English mines, and particularly
 points out the use of that construction which, in Cornwall, has ob
 tained the name of plunger. This is in fact a forcing pump, in which
  the column of water is made to ascend by the descent of a solid
  cylinder, working through a stuffing-box into an appropriate barrel
  or case. The advantages of this arrangement are pointed out; and
  the importance of perfect hydraulic machinery is very evident,
  when the quantity of water and the depths from which it is to be
  raised are such as the author mentions in this treatise.
     The next paper is also by Mr. Taylor, and relates to a subject
 very interesting to all engineers, and one  on which some controversy
 has taken    place;—the   duty     of
                                    steam-engines,  and the amount              of
 improvement which has     at  various times taken place     these most
                                                                 in
  important machines.
     This improvement has                              be rapid
                            in of

casioned considerable doubt as to the accuracy of the observations,
or of the methods by which it has been determined.
   Mr. Taylor, as may be expected, defends the statements which
come from a quarter in which he is so much engaged. He has taken
a historical survey of the evidence upon this subject, from a very
early period, and compared the account given by Smeaton of at
mospheric engines as they were in 1765, with others in the time of
Boulton and Watt, and again with those most recently improved.
The result is curious, if it be correct;-that as much power is now
obtained from one bushel of coal, as in the earliest periods was to
be had from seventeen bushels.                                w
  The mode of    estimating   the duty of steam-engines is explained,
and a reference is made to the accounts which have been regularly
published in Cornwall since the year 1813, of which an abstract in
the form of a table is given, showing the average duty reported in
each year of          all
                  the engines working, and the average duty       the                                  of

 count of   some experiments on the Torpedo,”   by Sir Humphry
 Davy, Bart., F.R.S., &c.
    The author, after noticing the peculiarities discovered by Walsh
in the electricity of the torpedo, and the opinion of Cavendish that
it resembles the action of an electrical battery weakly charged, ad
verts to the conjecture of Volta, who considered it as similar to that
 of the galvanic pile. Being on the coast of the Mediterranean in
 1814 and 1815, the author, desirous of ascertaining the justness of
Volta's comparison, passed the shocks given by living torpedos
through the interrupted circuit made by silver wire through water,
but could not perceive the slightest decomposition of that fluid;
the same shocks made to pass through a fine silver wire, less than
one-thousandth of an inch in diameter, did not produce ignition.
Volta, to whom the author communicated the result of these expe
riments, considers the condition of the organs of the torpedo to be
best represented by a pile of which the fluid substance was a very
imperfect conductor, such as honey, and which, though it commu
nicated weak shocks, yet did not decompose water.
    The author also ascertained that the electrical shocks of the tor
pedo, even when powerful, produced no sensible effect on an ex
tremely delicate magnetic electrometer. He explains these nega
tive results, by supposing that the motion of the electricity in the
torpedinal organ is in no measurable time, and wants that conti
nuity of current requisite for the production of magnetici effect.

lenses appears,  from the trials made by the author, to be that of
three to one. The distances between their plane surfaces should in
general be about 1.4 of the shorter focus, but should be varied by
trial till the utmost possible degree of distinctness has been attained.
The lenses must be fixed in their cells with their plane sides next to
the object to be viewed. The exterior cell of the compound mag

  Dec. 11.—“Experiments        to determine       the difference in the lengths
of the seconds pendulum in the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, and
in Mr. Browne's house in London, in which Capt. Kater's experi
ments were made,” by Capt. E. Sabine, of the Royal Artillery, Sec.
R.S.
   The experiments, of which an account is given in this paper, were
made    in compliance with a request of the Council of the Royal
Society, in December 1827, that Capt. Sabine would ascertain
the difference in the number of vibrations of a pendulum at Mr.
Browne's house, and at the Greenwich Observatory. The author gives
a description of the instruments used in the observations; the first
series of which were made in Mr. Browne's house, from the 17th to
the 20th of March inclusive, and gave as the mean result 859738:38
vibrations in a mean solar day. A reduction is here introduced, de
rived from some experiments made on the difference which takes place
in the times of vibration in vacuo, and in the air : the number of
vibrations in the former case being, under the same circumstances as
in the observations, 9.62 per diem less than in the latter. A cor
 responding series made at Greenwich in May, gave as the mean re
sult 85973-93 vibrations, thus indicating an acceleration of 0:55
parts of a vibration per diem. But the differences of latitude and of
height between the two stations would have led us from theory to
expect a total retardation of 0.38 parts of a vibration in the same
time.    From a second set of observations at Greenwich, the diurnal
acceleration appeared to be 0:52 parts of a vibration. Taking the
mean of this and the former result, it appears that the total amount
of the discordance between theory and experiment is 0.91 parts of a
vibration per diem. The stations are conveniently situated for veri<U+017F>y
ing the existence of this anomaly; and            its
                                              magnitude        such      is               as   to

they are insufficient in number and frequency, and, the earlier ones
particularly, in the required accuracy, to enable us to determine
whether the annual decrease has been uniform or otherwise.                                -
    The author having taken much pains to obtain a correct deter
mination of the dip in the Regent's Park in August 1821 (published
in the Philosophical Transactions for 1822), repeated his observa
tions in August 1828, at the expiration of seven years from the
former determination,-an interval which he considered sufficient
to throw light on the rate at which the dip is at present diminishing.
In consequence of the increase of buildings in the Regent's Park,
he was induced to change the place of observation to the Horticul
tural Society's garden at Chiswick: the distance apart is about five
miles, but the direction is as nearly as possible that of the line of
 equal dip.
    The apparatus, modes of observing, and needles employed, are
fully described. The needles were four in number—one of the or
 dinary construction; a second fitted with Professor Meyer's appa
ratus for avoiding the errors arising from the non-coincidence of the
centres of gravity and motion; a third, having a cross of wires at
 tached to the axis, on the well-known plan of Dr. Mitchell; and a
 fourth, devised by Mr. Dollond, the middle of which is a cube per
forated at right angles, so that the axis may be inserted in eight dif
                                                                                  -
ferent ways.
    In addition to his own apparatus and needles, the author obtained
 from the Colonial Department the use of a smaller apparatus, with
 a needle on Professor Meyer's plan, the same which was used by
 Capt. Franklin on his last land expedition.              The observations with
 this apparatus were made by Mr. David Douglas, of the Horticul
tural Society.    The results were as follow :—

   From the observations of 1821 and 1828, the author finds a de

FRIDAY-EVENING PROCEEDINGS AT THE ROYAL INSTITUTION
                 OF GREAT BRITAIN.
    Feb. 27.-Mr. Faraday gave an account of Brard's test of the ac
tion of weather on building materials.              He prefaced his particular
account of the test proposed, by a general view of the actions that
go on in these climates upon the building materials ordinarily in
use.    The actions were considered as of two kinds, chemical and
mechanical; instances of both were referred to and exhibited : the
former were stated to produce more good than harm, but the latter
to be decidedly and seriously injurious. The mechanical actions
are of different kinds, but the action of water and frost are the most
powerful:        all  them are fully met

EFFECTS      OF LIGHT        ON   SOLUTION    OF TARTAR-EMETIC        AND
                            ANTIMONIAL WINE.
     R. JOHN DAVY            states, that when a solution of tartar-emetic
       is exposed   for some weeks to the direct rays of the sun, in a
close  vessel,  it is rendered turbid, and a precipitate forms, which
has the    properties   of peroxide of antimony. In one instance, a
drachm of tartar-emetic, dissolved in four ounces of distilled water,
was exposed to sunshine at Corfu and Malta during twelve months;
the precipitate collected weighed one grain, and consisted of per
oxide as well as protoxide of antimony. The decomposition from
the action of the sun's rays takes place very slowly at first, till the
solution has become turbid, and then the change is greatly accele
rated. This probably is owing to the particles of oxide of antimony
disengaged exerting an influence on the others, similar to what is
witnessed in the experiment of the precipitation from an acid solu
tion of one metal by another.
   It might, perhaps, be expected that antimonial wine would be
more liable to change from exposure to the sun's rays than a solution
of tartar-emetic; but the fact is the reverse. After a year's exposure,
a portion of this wine, prepared according to the London Pharmaco
poeia, had undergone no change; and two different samples of antimo
nial wine, one made with a sweet wine like Malaga, and another with
a dry wine like sherry, which had been many years kept in the Medi
terranean, exposed to dull light, were both as good as when first
prepared. There was a very minute sediment of extractive matter
                                                                        In

colouring and extractive matter, without oxide of antimony.—

NITRATE        of       SILVER As A TEST For vegetABLE                           AND ANIMAL

                                     MATTER.
   Dr. Davy states, that nitrate of silver dissolved in pure water is not
altered by the sun's rays. If the minutest quantity of vegetable or
animal matter is present, the solution is discoloured; and, with com
mon distilled water, the discolouration is strong. To prove that the
cause of the change of colour is the one assigned, it is sufficient to al
low the coloured matter to subside, decant the colourless solution, and
expose it again to sunshine.     However powerful the sun's rays are,
no further effect is produced;   but add more common distilled water,
and the  phaenomenon    will instantly reappear. He believes nitrate of
silver thus used is one of the best tests of the presence in water of
                                               --
very minute portions of vegetable matter; of course, any chloride of
silver that may be formed in consequence of the presence of any
muriates, should be allowed to subside in the dark, and the sub
sidence should be complete before the fluid is decanted and exposed
to light.—Ibid.
         SOLUBILITY AND MELTING POINT                            OF PHOSPHORUS.
   Dr. Davy dissents from the common opinion, that phosphorus is
insoluble in water: a piece of phosphorus immersed for twenty-four
hours in distilled water imparted to         even after   it,

        Meteorological Summary                            for 1828.-Hampshire.                         317
    BARoMETRICAL PREssure.—The mean height of the mercurial
 column of the barometer this year, is 4-125ths of an inch lower than
 it was in the preceding, and 19-1000dths of an inch lower than the
 mean of the last thirteen years.      Both the aggregate of the spaces
 described by the alternate rising and falling of the quicksilver, and
 the number of changes, fall considerably short of their yearly mean
 amount, and indeed of any year since 1815; an indication that the
 elasticity of the atmosphere has been less disturbed by the prevail
 ing winds, &c. notwithstanding that the gales are as many in number
 as have occurred in any year since the boisterous year 1821. In July
 and the first fortnight of August, the mean pressure was lower than
 in any other part of the year.
    TEMPERATURE.--The mean temperature of the external air this
 year is unprecedentedly high, being 2:38 degrees higher than the
mean of the last thirteen years, and 0.48, or nearly half a degree
higher than the mean of the warm year 1822.          By comparing the
 monthly mean temperatures, this remarkable circumstance appears to
 have arisen from the high mean temperature of January, February,
 November and December, as it will be recollected that the winter
 and autumn were uncommonly mild; but in both these seasons the
 atmosphere was very humid.
    The difference between the annual mean temperature of the air
 as taken at 8 A.M. and 8 P.M., is only 3-10ths of a degree.       The
 mean temperature of spring water this year is also higher than it
has been since 1822; as there was no penetrating frost to lessen the
temperature of the ground.
    WIND.—It will be seen by the scale of the winds, that those from
the S.E. and S.W. prevailed much longer than from any other given
point of the compass: their duration this year is without a parallel,
particularly from the former point, which prevailed mostly in the
winter and spring, and from the S.W. in the summer months. The
 S.E. wind is here generally found to be a dry land wind, and       un                               its
 usual prevalence may       some measure account for the high annual
                                   in
mean temperature          the atmosphere. The S.W. wind from the
                              of
Western Ocean         moist, and,
                       is                            on
                                        uniting with the land air, very

                   haze,    rain,  shortens the mercurial column, and
                                   or
lessens   evaporation  considerably.

   RAIN.—Both the rain and evaporation are less than their annual
average amounts for many years past. The only three very wet
months were January, July, and December.             January nearly                 In
seven inches  rain fell here, although there were fifteen days with
                  of
out any that was measurable; and                         it    is    remarkable that nearly two

inches of this unusual amount fell in about ten hours on the first
day of the year.
   The rainy weather in July and the first fortnight of August, ex
cited much anxiety among the agriculturists in general for the fate
of the corn harvest; and although there were many intervals of
strong sunshine, yet much of the wheat was spoiled by the continual
rain, and the consequent floods in the vales and low lands of several
counties.

    General Observations.—This month has been generally calm and cloudy,
with frequent light showers, yet mild for the season. Although it has rained
more or less on fourteen days, the amount that has fallen at the ground is
not an inch in depth.
    In consequence of the prevailing vapours and low haze, the amount of
evaporation is unprecedentedly low; indeed, it is remarkable that the sun
and moon have only appeared a few times during the last two months. The
first three days of the month the weather was fine, and the nights frosty,
since which the thermometer has only receded once to the freezing point,
and for several nights it has not gone lower than 46 degrees.
   The mean temperature of the external air this month, is 2} degrees
higher than the mean of February for the last thirteen years; yet from the
absence of the sun's rays the surface of the ground has received but little
heat, and the spring has therefore been retarded,—a circumstance very
generally favourable to the blooming season.
    In the evening of the 27th, several strong flashes of lightning emanated
from the clouds to the southward, which appeared to have been effected
by two nearly opposite winds that had prevailed several hours.
    The atmospheric and meteoric phaenomena that have come within our
observations this month, are one lunar halo in the evening of the 19th,
two meteors in the evening of the 27th, and two gales of wind, one from
the South, the other from the South-west.

his exact copies of the inscriptions there, that curiosity was
effectually excited, to discover the alphabet in which they were
written, and the language the sounds of which they expressed.
 No external aid was to be expected; the Greek and Latin
writers never mention them; the modern Persians know Perse
polis only as the palace of their fabulous monarch Djemsheed,
and the repository of his countless treasures.                Sir William
 Ouseley, in his Oriental Collections                         (ii.

   I   have already mentioned that Tychsen and Münter had
pointed out a group, which they conceived to stand for king,
but without deciding in what language.                 That such a title
should be found in the inscriptions was d priori highly pro
bable; they are always placed above or beside the two large
figures which are seen on the walls of Persepolis; and every
thing about these figures—their colossal size, compared with
other human figures, the flyflap and umbrella, their sitting pos
ture, while others are standing or bowing—all conspire to
prove this.     Another circumstance led to the same conclusion.
At Nakshi Rustam near Persepolis, and at Kirmanshah, are
figures of the kings of the Sassanian or second Parthian dy
nasty, with inscriptions, which being accompanied by Greek
translations were readily deciphered by M. de Sagy (Mémoire
sur diverses Antiquités de Perse, Paris, 1793), and were found
to consist of the names of the sovereigns and their fathers,
along with the title king of kings, and some other of those
laudatory epithets in which the sovereigns of the East have in
 all  ages delighted.       The Achaemenidae, we know, affected
the title  king        of
                     kings      much as      their successors, and there
                                                    as

year that his precarious usurpation lasted, or that his name
should have remained inscribed among the legitimate mon
archs of Persia. The name of Artaxerxes appeared too long for
the characters of the inscription, and hence Darius and Xerxes
were fixed upon as the most probable.          It was obviously
in favour of this   supposition  that in the group  assigned to
Xerxes, the second letter was the same as the sixth, and the
fourth the same as the seventh.      The final s in Xerxes was
rejected, as being probably a Greek termination, and the r,
as a double letter, resolved into k and sch, and thus the whole
was read Kschharsha or Kschhèrschè".         The correctness of
this ingenious analysis has since received confirmation in a
very remarkable and unexpected manner. When M. St. Martin
 was engaged in the study of what Grotefend had written, it
occurred to him that an alabaster vase in the Royal Library
of Paris, of which an engraving had been published by Caylus
in his Recueil d'Antiquités, vol. v.          30, exhibited    pl.
                                                                inscrip                       an

         in                                         hieroglyphics, and     in
 he   inspected       company with Champollion. His discoveries
                        it   in
were even then sufficiently matured             enable him            to

  must be found, in a language likely to be used in a Persian
 inscription, having this meaning, and beginning with these
 letters.    Many circumstances determined Grotefend to make
  the  attempt   in the Zendic language.           The Zendic is the old
 language of Media, and probably of Bactriana, the original
 seat of the Zoroastrian doctrines.           It derives its name, from
 being that in which is written the oldest part of the Zenda
 vesta, or “living word,” the title which the worshipers of
 fire give to the collection of writings which they attribute to
  Zoroaster. M. Anquetil du Perron had brought these writings
 from Surat to Europe in 1762, and had published a transla
 tion of them, and a short Grammar and Lexicon of the Zendic
 language.      When his work first made               appearance, much             its
prejudice was excited against him from the gasconading tone
in   which his own adventures and merits are spoken                  and the                                  of,

of other groups, because I think them more doubtful; but
I will give here from the latter author a translation of the two

328                         Rev. John Kenrick           on the
it is difficult
             to say what the words are.     Champollion has
found the names of  Cambyses,  (Précis, p. 231, 2nd edition)
Darius, and Artaxerxes, hieroglyphically written on various
Egyptian monuments, but not accompanied, as the name of
Xerxes before mentioned, by a Persian inscription. He has
also found the name of Ramses, the Sesostris of Greek and
Latin writers, written hieroglyphically and in Persepolitan
characters,  on a monument in Syria, near the ancient Berytus.
(Précis, p. 272.)    It will be remembered that the coast of
Syria is one of the places in which Herodotus (ii. 106) de
clares that he had seen the monuments of this king, with an
inscription commemorating the facility with which he had tri
umphed over the unwarlike inhabitants.        I regret that Cham
pollion has mentioned this very curious relic so briefly and
incidentally; if he is right in placing Ramses in the fifteenth
century before the Christian aera, how far back must we carry
the use of the cuneiform character
   It was before observed that the inscriptions at Persepolis and
Murghab, and on the alabaster vase of the king of France's                              li
brary, are triple. Those of the second class have been conjec
tured to be in the Median language, those of the third in some
 Aramaean dialect; but this is mere hypothesis. Whether from
the language in which they are written being less full of vowels
than the Zendic, or from the vowels being suppressed, or from
the occasional use of monograms, they occupy less space than
those of the first class. We see in them too, especially in the
third class, more frequent examples of combination of the
strokes, preparing the way to the Babylonian inscriptions and
                                                             -
that of Tak-kesra, in which it is very common.
   I am far from thinking that the whole of Grotefend's or                              St.
Martin's translation       the inscriptions

                                                 the first class rests
upon    an equally solid foundation; but that they are alphabeti
cal, that they contain the names                   of
                                          Xerxes and Darius with

330 Rev.     John Kenrick             on the ancient     Inscriptions of Persepolis.
     The Persepolitan inscriptions, even in the limited extent
to which they have been deciphered, confirm the veracity of
the Greek historians, attacked on very trifling grounds by some
zealous orientalists.  It may seem strange that any one should
prefer the authority of Ferdousi, a poet of the eleventh century
after Christ, abounding in the wildest fictions, to the testimony
of Herodotus and Thucydides; and, in their persons, to that
of the whole Greek nation, who received their histories as au
thentic; yet such a preference has been given by Mr. Richard
son, who in a Dissertation, prefixed to his Persian Dictionary,
charges the Greeks with exalting Xerxes from a satrap of Asia
 Minor into a king of Persia, in order to magnify their own
glory in defeating him. Even a writer of more sober judge
ment, Sir John Malcolm (History of Persia, i. p. 237.), insi
nuates that vanity led the Greeks to call their invader king of
Persia, because the Isfundear of Persian history, whom he sup
poses to be Xerxes, never ascended the throne. The inscrip
tions of Persepolis furnish a decisive answer to these sugges
tions, which indeed hardly needed such a refutation.
   Although the absolute amount of historical knowledge
gained by this discovery be small,             importance will not
                                                         its                             be

that   ofthe alabaster vase, which commemorates Xerxes; and

the subject       we

 of upwards of forty cuneiform inscriptions near the Lake Van,
 in Armenia.       M. St. Martin had not fully examined them, but
he had found one in the triple characters of Persepolis, con
taining in several places the name of Xerxes (Kschearscha)
 son of Darius, with the titles and qualifications, powerful king,
 king of kings, king of gods, gift of Ormuzd.           The tradition of
 the country at the present hour agrees with the Armenian
history of Moses Chorenensis, in attributing the works, of
which remains are seen around the Lake of Van, to Semi
ramis, who is also believed to have engraved the inscriptions
in question. As almost every great work within the limits of
the Assyrian empire was attributed to Semiramis, this tradi
tion implies no more than that they were of Assyrian origin;
which seems very likely, with the single exception of that in
which Xerxes is mentioned.            It may be worth while to remark
that the Greek authors do not         speak  of any expedition of Semi
ramis to     Armenia;   but Diodorus (ii. 13.) represents her as en
graving an inscription on Mount Bagistan in Media, Xuplois
'ypápºwari, on which Wesseling observes “Assyrias intelligit.”

           spinal marrow is composed of two symmetrical portions,
      in each of which we perceive three distinct bundles or co
lumns; an anterior, a posterior, and a middle. On their ex
terior are two orders of insertion of nerves, and within each
of the lateral halves which are united by a commissure of me
dullary matter, we find a line of cineritious matter.              The size
of the spinal marrow is most considerable at the upper part
of the cervical portion, where it takes the name of medulla ob
longata, and presents several distinct enlargements.              The most
important of these are the corpora pyramidalia, which decus

that we have not been able to see so clear a demonstration in the
brains of some of the mammifera which we have examined”.
   We are thus compelled on this point to renounce the opi
nion of Drs. Gall and Spurzheim, who consider the corpus
callosum as composed of converging fibres, and forming the
commissure of the two hemispheres.                We may assure our
selves of the state of the case by a very simple process.                  It
consists in separating the two hemispheres from above, and
gently passing the finger under the edge which the flat ver
tical surface presents to the corpus callosum, into what has
sometimes been called the ventricle.            We thus readily arrive
at the line of separation between the two upper planes, one of
which passes inwards, and the other vertically upwards, into
the hemisphere.        It appears to us, however, that it is impos
sible to make this separation without some rupture taking
place between the two parts; but this may possibly depend on
strong adhesions occasioned by the disorganization of the mem
brane of separation.       We may likewise easily show these dif
ferent planes by making the vertical section above described, op
posite to the situation of the coronal suture, through the brain
of a young infant. We may even perceive between the two
inferior planes a trace of cineritious matter, pointing out their
separation; and by merely blowing on them at this part, we are
sometimes able to effect their detachment from each other.
    We consider this part of Dr. Foville's paper as worthy of
the utmost attention of the anatomist.          We think that the idea
of regarding the middle plane of the crus cerebri as analogous
to the nerves of the spinal marrow, and as losing itself in the
cineritious matter of the convolutions, is happy, and in harmony
with what we know of that part of the ganglionic nervous
system which is furnished with external apparatus.                It is also
corroborated by the anatomical observations of Dr. Foville.
   It appears to us that the course which this anatomist has
taken is the only one which can lead to any certain results;
since he makes his anatomical and pathological researches
keep pace with each other, and has already             tºm        to syste
matize some     parts  in the  anatomy     of the brain,  in conjunction
with its functions both in the state of health and disease. In
this attempt he has, perhaps, been more successful than any
one who has preceded him.
   But as we know that, this anatomist has already obtained
an insight, perhaps equally interesting, into other important
  * Since this Report was written, I have had the advantage of seeing the
brains of several of these animals examined by Dr. Foville; and with the
precautions which he had then employed, the existence of the three planes
was most readily and satisfactorily shown, although, as Blainville remarks,
this point was at one time not so easily effected.—T. H.

parts of the cerebral portion of the nervous system, and as
this system requires to be studied as a whole, in order to con
firm the particulars which may have been discovered, we shall
confine ourselves to the recommendation, that the Academy
strongly encourage Dr. Foville to pursue his researches
with caution, and to avail himself of the light of comparative
anatomy; and that he be advised not to hasten the publi
cation of any observations, until they appear to himself to be
placed completely beyond doubt, and to be susceptible of the
most rigorous demonstration.       They serve science poorly who
encumber her with       ill-prepared materials, however copious
and   specious   they may   be.—These considerations alone have
diverted us from a conclusion in favour of publishing Dr. Fo
ville's Researches on the Brain, so far as they have been com
municated to us, amongst the collections of the Academy, of
which they appear to us perfectly worthy, on the double ground
of their own interest, and of the good faith with which they
have been brought forward.

is itself very  much the same as the English stratum; but the
sandstones   directly above it differ in containing a large amount

sion.   It is chiefly visible on the south side of the canal. It
appears at Genesee River near Rochester; at Lockport on
the canal, and in the great chasm of the Falls of Niagara. Its
thickness is variable; from Oneida to Palmyra (140 miles) it
is 100 to 250 feet thick, and is fully displayed in this interval.
It contains numerous beds of gypsum, and of limestone with
shells.  As an example of this, Mr. Eaton adduces the neigh
bourhood of Limestone Creek in the township of Manlius. He
here “immediately on the ferriferous formation found this
slate; then a bed of gypsum terminating east and west in the
bank of the canal, being eight to ten perches in length; above
the gypsum the slate is continued to about the thickness of
sixty or seventy feet: then an extensive bed of shell-lime
stone occurs, ten to twelve feet in thickness, and perhaps from
half a mile to a mile in breadth; then the slate again, em
bracing a bed of gypsum of much greater extent than that in
the immediate bank of the canal.       This last-mentioned slate,

                                     I
     with coal and other mines, made, with the assistance of my
brother, Mr. M. Forster, a survey of the country surrounding
Leicester, with a view to ascertain the probability of the ex
istence of coal near that town. As circumstances have since
occurred, which leave me at liberty to publish this Report,
and as the opinions therein contained have also been in a
great measure confirmed by the subsequent discovery of a
seam of coal by boring near Bagworth (as announced in the
New Monthly Magazine for July 1828, and noticed in the
Phil. Mag, and Annals for March last),                   -I

      on the Probability         of finding Coal     near Leicester.        349
la-Zouch and Cole Orton: from some unknown cause, how
 ever, probably from the intervention of a fault or dyke run
ning from Swannington towards Ibstock, and throwing the
strata down to the eastward, the coal-measures are again thrown
in, and are found extending under the new red sandstone at a
pit marked A, near Whitwick, as well as at a pit marked B,
near Ibstock: at both of these places, borings have been al
ready made to the coal; and from the similarity of the strata
 bored through, there is every reason to suppose that the same
measures extend from Whitwick to Ibstock, under the new
red sandstone, with which the surface is covered to the depth
of at least twenty fathoms: the first workable seam of coal
bored to at these two places is four feet six inches in thickness;
at Ibstock it is about thirty-four, and at Whitwick about fifty
                                               -
fathoms beneath the surface.
    Having ascertained the important fact, that the coal-mea
sures, and probably the same coal-measures, extend under the
sandstone from Whitwick to Ibstock, a distance of about three
miles, and having satisfied myself by observations on the run
 of these coal strata in general, and of the strata near Whit
wick, in particular, that they dip towards the transition strata
until they come nearly in contact with them,--I was induced
to consider it extremely probable that the coal-measures might
still continue to follow the transition rocks, and to form a sort
of belt or zone around them, traversing the country in the
direction of Bagworth”, Desford, Kirby-Muxloe, and Glen
field, and crossing the Ashby road at the distance of about
two miles from Leicester. I was led, therefore, to conclude
that a trial for coal might be made with the greatest probabi
lity of success in any part of the dotted line C,D, in the grounds
 adjoining Sharman's Lodge.               I
                                       had arrived at this conclu
 sion, when met at Leicester by the person on whose account
 the survey was made, with whom it seemed to be a deside
 ratum that a trial for coal should be made near Birstall (See
 the sketch).      I
                   preferred the other situation however, as being
 more   eligible  for such trial; because, owing to the distance of
 Birstall from thetransition rocks, there appeared that every rea
 son to supposethat the coal-measures would crop-out at or near
 that place; and consequently any trial for coal there, might pro
 bably be made beyond, or at            all
                                     events too near their basset              or

 however, that       cutting road through

     On commencing the survey, it was discovered that the twelve
  inch telescopic-level,      recently fitted up with extremely fine
  cross-wires, would not, from some imperfection in the screws
  of the stop, retain                its

   Another annoying impediment to accurate bisection, the
consequence of some defect in the tangent screw, or clamp, of
the horizontal circles, requires to be noticed. Occasionally, on
turning the screw in the proper direction to rectify an ap
proximate bisection, the vertical wire of the telescope, after
refusing for some time to obey            action, would       displaced    its                              be

LIV.         Reply to       Mr. J. C. Sowerby's Remarks on “Eageri

     JAcoB GREEN, M.D. Professor of Chemistry in Jefferson's
     Medical College, Philadelphia,                     United States.
                              To Richard Taylor, Esq.
I   Nyour valuable Magazine for July
     remarks made by me, “On the Pressure of the Sea at con
                                                                1828, there appeared some
siderable Depths;” and in the next Number J. de C. Sowerby,
Esq. has favoured us with a kind of criticism on the commu
nication. Now, although the subject is not a very important
one, still no person feels satisfied with having his statements
misrepresented, whether this be done through mere inadvert
ence, or in any other manner;                      I
                                    hope therefore you will allow
me a word in    reply.
                                     I
    The conclusion that drew from my experiments was, “that
at the depth of 230 fathoms, the water enters glass vessels
through the stoppers and coverings which surround them, and
not through the pores of the glass:”—not that the fact, that
water will not penetrate glass at all, as Mr. S. says, has been
so often proved before, but merely that it will not at the depth
of 230 fathoms. Now if Mr. Sowerby had shown us that this
fact had ever been proved before, his remarks would have been
                        I
in point, and should have thought my experiments of no
value. The fact, however, never could have been proved with
out using a glass vessel hermetically sealed; and which, as far
as my knowledge extends, never was done before. Mr. S.
says, “Dr. Green thinks that by proving (as others have done)
that the water would not penetrate glass, he has reduced the
question to very narrow limits.” Mr. S. should certainly have
given us his authorities here; and until they are produced
I  shall consider my experiment as the first to settle the fact”.
   The misrepresentation to which I have alluded       that Mr.                      is,             S.
cites me        concluding that the water enters glass vessels
                  as

the trouble to turn to the passage in your July Number, p. 37,
he will see that I have given       as the opinion of other ex
perimentalists, whose names and works are referred to at the
bottom of the page.      A considerable part of Mr. S.’s short
communication is to show that water will not pass through a
cork in the same manner as mercury through a block of wood,
an opinion which never maintained.    I     can however inform                     I

fitted glass-stoppers will exclude the water.” Now, for the

                        To Mr. Taylor.             -
     Sir,
       Monday morning last (the 23rd instant), at 14° 20'"
ON   sidereal time, I observed a luminous arch of white light
extending itself from the eastern horizon, from the point E.
by S. towards & Ursae Majoris, and to within eight degrees of
the meridian. It was four degrees broad at the horizon, gra
dually increasing to six at the altitude of forty. Its north
edge accurately defined.
  At 14° 24" x Lyrae was seen distinctly shining through
middle.     bifurcated
                  It      the altitude  at 11°, diverging     of                                 to    8° its
in breadth     the  meridian,
                       at      reaching    Ursae Majoris; the  &
northern limb    the direction of Polaris.

   In the northern region there is a bland white light gradually
mellowing off to 20° of altitude.

structed gas-works for lighting Dumfries, in 1825, I had the
burners made on the plan I have described; and experience
has shown that they answer the purpose of requiring less
gas than other burners, and giving at the same time as bril
liant, and perhaps a more beautiful flame. Nor have     from                                                 I

   Dec. 11th.-A paper was read, intitled, “On a method of com
paring the light of the sun with that of the fixed stars.” By William
Hyde Wollaston, M.D. V.P.R.S. &c.
    In the Philosophical Transactions for the year 1767, a suggestion
is thrown out by Mr. Michell, that a comparison between the light
received from the sun and any of the fixed stars might furnish data
for estimating their relative distances; but no such direct comparison
had been attempted.         Dr. Wollaston was led to infer, from some ob
servations which he made in the year 1799, that the direct light of the
sun is about one million times more intense than that of the full
                                                                                                                        of all

the fixed stars taken collectively.           order          compare the light

  Care was taken that the specimens of wood which were the subjects
 of experiment     were sound and dry, and free from any large knots;
 and their correct dimensions were ascertained by an improved kind
 of callipers.    In every specimen two indexes were attached; one a
 few inches from the end fixed in the clamp, and the other at a small
 distance from the attachment of the lever to which the straining
 power was applied; and the length of the bar subjected to torsion
 was estimated by the distance of the points of attachment of the in
dexes. A pivot was fixed at the supported end of the bar, in the line
of   itsaxis. The author gives the following rule for finding the deflec

President.
  The author having shown in the former part of this paper, that the sta
bility of compound vessels (see Phil. Mag. &Annals for April, p.301,) as
far as depends upon their form, is a maximum when the displacement
they produce by immersion in a fluid is equal to half their magnitude,
purposes in the present communication to prove that the same theory
is true of     all
               rectangular vessels, whatever    their dimensions; and                 be
also the following proposition, namely, that when either the length                                                                or
breadth,      or
             the length and depth are given, the maximum        stability                                           of
takes place when the ratio       the depth             of

two. He enters         some length into the mathematical investigation
                                   at

    but if we assume the mutual dependence of the refracting and reflect
   ing forces, then the experiments recorded in this paper will establish
   a variation in the law of the refracting forces of different media. The
   facts may be explained on the undulatory theory of light, by sup
   posing that the density or elasticity of the ether varies near the sur
   face of different bodies,—an hypothesis which has already afforded an
   explanation of the loss of part of an undulation in several of the phae
   nomena of interference; the part lost being, according to Dr. Young,
   a variable fraction depending on the nature of the contiguous media.
      The phaenomena of periodical colours at the confines of media of
   the same or of different refractive powers, are evidently dependent on
   the law of interference; although it may be difficult to point out the
  precise mode in which they are produced.                  In combinations where
  there is much uncompensated refraction, their production is influenced
  by certain changes, such as the formation of a thin and invisible film
  on the surface of the solid, the nature and origin of which the author
  endeavours to investigate, but which he acknowledges he has hitherto
 been unable to discover.           That some unrecognised physical principle

standing the important labours of Humboldt and Bonpland, and
other botanists, who have treated of the plants of the late Spanish
possessions in America. The author has given a general view of the

  Jan. 16.-An Appendix was read to Mr. De la Beche's paper, on the
Geology of Nice, by the Rev. W. Buckland, D.D. &c. &c. &c.
    After bearing testimony to the correctness of the description given
by Mr. De la Beche of the immediate neighbourhood of Nice, the
author communicates his own observations made along the high road
from that city to the Col de Tende, for the distance of about fifty miles.
    The hill on the south of Scarena, twelve miles N.E. of Nice, pre
sents a section of the green-sand formation, with nummulites, turri
lites, and its  other usual fossils, alternately with compact gray-lime
stone destitute   of fossils.   At Mont Brause the same beds       green

deposit near Nice, is the older Alpine limestone; as is the opinion of
M. Risso.   On the authority of that gentleman, Professor Buckland
remarks, that near the source of the War the older Alpine limestone
 contains gypsum, with sulphur and salt springs; and he thinks it
 probable, that the gypsum found near Vinaigre and Requiez, and at
  Cimiez, belongs to this formation, rather than to the younger Alpine
 limestone, to which Mr. De la Beche refers                      similar develope
                                                                                it.    A

 accompanied with gypsum, saccharine dolomite, rauch-wacke, and
 conglomerate.
    The author repeats, what            has advanced elsewhere, that although
                                                     he

in diameter; some few being larger, others much smaller:—their
colour is dark gray; their substance, like indurated clay, of a com
pact earthy texture; and their chemical analysis approaches to that
of album græcum.          Undigested bones and scales of fishes occur abun
dantly in these fecal masses. The scales are referable to the Dapedium
      litum, and other fish that occur in the lias; the bones are those
 of fish, and also of small Ichthyosauri. The interior of these bezoars
 is arranged in spiral folds; their exterior also bears impressions re
 ceived from the convolutions of the intestines of the living animals.
 In many of the entire skeletons of young Ichthyosauri, the bezoars
 are seen within the ribs and near the pelvis : these must probably
 have been included within the animal's body at the moment of his
 death.       The author found, three years ago, a similar ball of faecal
 matter, in the collection of Mr. Mantell, from the strata of Tilgate
  Forest, which abound in bones of Ichthyosauri and other large reptiles;
 and he conjectures that these bezoars exist wherever the remains of
  Plesiosauri are abundant.

  is nearly of the colour and consistence of jet, and very fragile, with
  a bright splintery fracture;                 its

direction or the other, according to particular circumstances; and
also the probable explanation which such phaenomena afforded of the
absorption of fluids by plants, and the ascent of the sap in their
vessels.    It is a fact discovered by M. Dutrochet, that if part of the
caecum of a chicken be tied into a bag, and then attached to the end
of a tube, if the bag and a little of the tube be filled with a solution
of gum, sugar, or several other substances; and if being so filled,
the bag be immersed in water, the water will pass from the out
side to the inside, will increase the quantity of fluid there, and will
raise its level much above the level of the water without.      This de
termination of the fluid from without inwards is called Endosmose.
Some substances cause a contrary current, and then the term Exos
mose is applied.     The effects produced by various substances and in
various ways were illustrated experimentally       at the lecture-table.
M. Dutrochet refers this influence altogether to electricity, and con
siders it as a principal power in causing the ascent of sap in plants. He
admits only another, which is supposed to reside in the leaves at the
upper ends of the vessels, and which may be assimilated to the action
of an air-pump. In pointing out the extent and influence of these phae
nomena in nature, Mr. Burnett stated his opinion, that though power
fully influential in causing the entrance of water into the plant, yet
Endosmose was not by itself, or in conjunction with the action of the
leaves, sufficient to explain the phaenomena of ascent in the vessels;
and he described several experiments in which the influence of both
powers being removed, still the ascent took place.      Thus, when the
root and the leaf were removed from a celery stalk, and the latter
immersed in a coloured solution, the solution still ascended the vessels.
of the plant. Again, when roots were put into strong solutions of
gum and sugar, such as, with reference to the quality of the sap in the
vessels, should have caused the Exosmose or passage of the fluid out
of the vessels, still the natural effect was undisturbed.
   April 3rd.—On this evening Mr. Faraday, in Mr. Wheatstone's
name, concluded the series of experimental investigations and illus
trations which have been brought forward on former occasions in the
theatre of the Institution, On the Resonance, or reciprocated Vibra
tions of Volumes of Air. The details this evening related principally
to the effects produced by the reciprocated vibrations of the volumes
of air in the mouth and the cavities of the ears, when they are nearly
or altogether closed. The important influence of multiple reciprocated
vibrations in affecting the quality of a sound supposed to be simple,
but in reality consisting of several simultaneous accordant sounds,
                                                                    -
was stated, and exemplified by experiment.
   When illustrating the curious effects produced by closing the
cavities of the ears, and causing the volumes of air so insulated to re
ciprocate to the vibrations communicated through their side, amongst
other things' the Microphone of Mr. Wheatstone was described and
shown, and   its       detecting the vibrating condition      any part

   M. Rose remarks, that these proportions are equivalent to 1 atom
of chloride of mercury and 2 atoms of sulphuret of mercury; but
they are not reducible to this composition, employing the numbers
generally adopted in this country.
   This compound, prepared by passing sulphuretted hydrogen into
a solution of permuriate of mercury, remains long suspended, and
forms an emulsion, which filters with great difficulty.       It is better
to boil black sulphuret of mercury, while moist, with permuriate of
mercury; but it must be left for some time that it may filter readily.
The white precipitate dries perfectly well; when exposed in a tube
to heat, it is decomposed, and perchloride of mercury is sublimed; the
sulphuret of mercury is volatilized rather later. That the separation
of these substances may be perfect, it is necessary not to heat them
too quickly; the white precipitate is insoluble even in concentrated
acid, but is rapidly acted upon by aqua regia: when heated in a
tube and exposed to chlorine, chloride of sulphur is first obtained,
and afterwards perchloride of mercury. Caustic alkalies gradually
blacken it; even in the state of carbonates an alkaline chloride is
formed, and the oxygen of the alkali takes the place of the chlorine;
but the oxide of mercury remains in the state of mixture with the
sulphuret.
   Analogous phaenomena occur with the perbromide, periodide,
and perfluoride of mercury: the compound bromide and sulphuret
of mercury was obtained by digesting sulphuret of mercury in a
solution of perbromide; it is of a yellowish white colour: b
heat it is decomposed into bromide of mercury, which volatilizes
first, and sulphuret of mercury, which sublimes afterwards: it
is composed of 1 atom of perbromide, and 2 atoms of sulphuret
 of mercury.
    Periodide of mercury treated with sulphuretted hydrogen gives a
yellow precipitate, which remains suspended, and is easily separated
from the iodide in excess; by heat it is decomposed into periodide
and sulphuret of mercury.
    Perfluoride of mercury similarly treated offers analogous results:
by treating a solution of peroxide of mercury with excess of fluoric
acid, a white precipitate is obtained, which when washed and dried
so as to deprive it of     allwater, becomes yellowish, which colour                 it
loses  on  regaining water:       itdecomposed                by

              HYPOSULPHURIC ACID AND HYPOSULPHATES.
   Dr. Heeren forms the hyposulphuric acid nearly in the mode describ
ed by   MM. Gay-Lussac and Welter, excepting that he separates the
oxide of manganese by sulphuret of barium instead of barytes water.
The excess of sulphuret of barium is separated by carbonic acid, heat
ing and filtering : the solution, when sufficiently concentrated and
cool, gives perfectly pure crystals of hyposulphate of barytes; these
decomposed by sulphuric acid yield free hyposulphuric acid.
    Hyposulphate of potash was prepared by decomposing a hot solu
tion of hyposulphate of lime by carbonate of potash. The crystals are
fine, and resemble those of sulphate of potash.        One part of this salt
is soluble in 1:58 of   boiling  water,  and 26-5 at 60°Fahr. It is inso
luble in alcohol, has a bitter taste, contains no water of crystallization,
and is neither efflorescent nor deliquescent.
    Hyposulphate of soda is in large fine clear quadrangular prisms;
 they are unalterable in the air, and contain 15:54 per cent of water:
 this salt is soluble in 11 part of water at 212°, and 2.1 at the tempe
 rature of 60°. It is insoluble in alcohol:        taste peculiar and bitter.  its

          Meteorological Observations                      for     March 1829.                      399
    General Observations.—The first part of this month was cold and dry,
 and the latter part mostly fine, with seasonable intervening showers. The
 wind having prevailed two-thirds of the period from the N.E. and E., the
frosts were felt rather keen in the early part of the mornings; so that the
 spring was scarcely perceptible till the vernal equinox, on which day, as
well as on the 22nd and 29th, the thermometer rose to 60 degrees in the
shade. Even in the first week of the month the dust in the roads had very
much increased in consequence of the dryness of the N.E. wind, which in
March prevails much longer in proportion than in any other month. A
more favourable seed-time and for other agricultural purposes could not
have happened. The last three winter months have been seasonable and
dry, and only three and a quarter inches of rain have fallen here since the
end of last December.
   In the mornings of the 1st, 15th, 16th, and 25th, the ice on the ground
was more than one-third of an inch thick.
   In the evening of the 12th a large lunar halo appeared, and measured in
perpendicular diameter 45 degrees; it was soon followed by light rain and
snow, the latter slightly covered Portsdown Hill the following morning.
   The whole of the mornings of the 22nd and 28th, coloured solar halos
appeared in beds of cirrostratus; their horizontal diameters measured re
spectively 45° 15', and they were also succeeded by rainy nights.
   The mean temperature of the external air this month is nearly three
quarters of a degree under the mean of March for the last thirteen years;
but this will be advantageous in the end, if the spring should not be un
usually cold and wet, which, from a consideration of the high temperature
of the ground, and the times that the lunar phases will happen, are circum

   The temperature of spring water has not varied the whole of the month.
   The atmospheric and meteoric phaenomena that have come within our
observations this month, are one lunar and two solar halos, two meteors,              -
and four gales   of wind     from the North-east.

LIX.     On the Relations of the Tertiary and Secondary Rocks

THAT        various members of the secondary deposits replete
      with marine remains are found in dislocated positions in
some of the highest regions of the Alps, was long ago noticed
by De Saussure; and the fact has since been confirmed by
many other geologists. The inference derived therefrom, that
such remnants can alone have been placed at these heights by
elevation from beneath the sea, is now considered by the
greater number of observers to be the only philosophical mode
of explaining the phaenomenon.           The object of this memoir is
to determine whether the same causes of elevation were ap
plied at a subsequent period to those newer or tertiary deposits
which now form a belt around the flanks of the Alps. The
solution of this question is called for, because the evidence on
this point has hitherto remained so imperfect, that several na
turalists are still disposed to adhere to the old opinion, that
the forces which gave to the secondary rocks their actual con
figuration, had entirely ceased to act before the deposition of
the tertiary strata. The following sections, which I made last
autumn on the southern flank of the Alps near Bassano, ap
pearing to throw light on this curious and important point, no
apology is requisite for presenting them to the consideration
of geologists; indeed, any details of the structure of distant
groups of the tertiary deposits must be considered of high         in
terest when it is stated, that on the sides of the Alps and

 towards the exterior of the zone, but they become smaller in
  the lower beds: some of these boulders are of primary rock,
 but by far the greater number are referrible to the dolomite
 of the neighbouring Alps; in the higher beds these are packed
 together with little or no cementing matter, whilst in the lower
 they are frequently imbedded in a hard yellow calcareous
  sandstone forming a compact breccia: still lower there are
 beds of incoherent yellow sand with some organic remains;
 and this system may be said to terminate in the escarpments
 north of Asolo, where a fine conglomerate is seen alternating
 with beds of blue marl and yellow sand, both containing shells.
 In the descending series there is no repetition of conglome
 rates, and the upper system has therefore a well marked ter
 mination*. (Plate V. Section, fig. 1.)
     The lower system is ushered in by a chain of conical hills,
 the highest beds of which consist of a thick-bedded yellow
 sandstone charged with green grains, alternating with strong
 beds of calciferous grits, and dipping under the conglomerates
 at angles varying from 25° to 30° S.S.E. These contain many
 organic remains; amongst which are Pectunculi, Pectens,
  Echini, &c. The surfaces of the beds are further remark
 able for the vast quantity of branching stem-shaped bodies
 resembling Alcyonia.           At the base of the escarpment of these
 hills there is a considerable thickness of blue marl, which is
 prolonged for about a mile to the north, forming low undu
 lations, the beds of which are exposed on the banks of several
  streamlets running from west to east. The characteristic shells
  of this marl seemed to be Lucina concentrica (Venus concen
 trica, Brocchi), Lucina mutabilis (Venus mutabilis, Lamarck),
  Echini, &c. North of the small river at Castel Cucco, a com
 pact limestone rises from beneath the marls and attains consi
  derable elevation.       The upper beds have a mamillary surface,
 but    upon    fracture are of a solid madreporic structure and
  bluish colour: below this are strong beds of green slaty cal
  careous grits and yellow sandstone, the latter containing many
  Pectens, &c.
      Succeeding to the above there is a repetition of blue sandy
  incoherent marls, some beds of which are entirely occupied by
  vast quantities of a Turritella highly resembling if not identi
  cal with the T. sinuosa of Bourdeaux; whilst others are filled
  with the following shells: Natica glaucinoides of the London
     * In this respect the order of the strata does not coincide with that
  which Mr. Lyell and myself observed in the valleys of the Bormida, or at the
  Superga near Turin, where powerful conglomerates reappear very low in
  the tertiary series, beneath an enormous development of green slaty mica
   ceous sandstone and shale.

    Then follows a yellowish compact limestone with green
 grains, in strong beds, distinguished by nummulites, oval amyg
 daloidal concretions of green earth, and alternating layers of
 blue marl. The limestone succeeding to this has a semi-brec
 ciated fracture, with a pink and bluish tinge", and is charged
 with nummulites, &c., the whole alternating with yellow
 green micaceous sandstones. The latter repose upon and pass
into a calciferous grit containing lenticulites, operculines, cy
 clolites, and other small multilocular shells, characteristic of
the inferior tertiary formations in the north of Italyf.
    The escarpment of the lowest part of the tertiary deposits
exposed in this section is composed of blue marl, the beds
of which have precisely the same S.S.E. dip as the series of
nummulite limestone, green sandstone, and conglomerate,
previously described; and in a hasty examination the follow
ing corals and shells were collected at this spot:—
    Caryophyllia altavillensis; Fungites (figured by Fortis, Mé
moires, vol. i. p. 147.); Lenticulites complanata (Operculine
of D’Orbigny); Orbitulite (two species); Cyclolites cristata;

Fusus longaevus; Voluta harpula; Cassis diadema; Serpula
spirulaea.
    The Alps rise at        a rapid angle about half a mile north of
the above      escarpment;      the intermediate low space called the
Val d'Urgana, in which flow several torrents from west to
east, emptying themselves into the Piave, is choked up with
the shivery detritus of the impending secondary rocks, and
therefore no junction between the latter and the tertiary is
observable. (Section,
                              º    1.) Possagno, ornamented by the
magnificent new Temple of Canova, stands upon the first
ledges of the scaglia, which rock here rises into the Alps. The
upper beds are of a red colour, with some white and green
blotches, are very slaty, occasionally contain layers of flint,

   * It is in this range of limestone that quarries have recently been opened
at Costa lunga, from which have been extracted the principal columns of
Canova's splendid new Temple at Possagno. It is a mottled marble, very
ornamental, and takes a high polish.       Futurity may decide whether this
tertiary rock of Europe shall prove as durable a building-stone as that of
a similar epoch with which the pyramids of Egypt were constructed.

state of preservation of the shells in these vertical beds is a
distinct proof that the dislocation of strata, even when vertical,
does not, as some geologists have imagined, necessarily pro
duce any derangement or destruction of their organic con
tents.   These strata mount into a steep hill, on the summit of
which is the little church of St. Bovo, at least from six to seven
hundred feet above the river, and where they form an outline
nearly as peaked and grotesque as that of the adjoining dolo
mite, or of any other crystalline rocks; thus showing that ex
ternal form may be entirely due to the inclination of the beds,
without any reference to the structure or age of the rock.
After passing along the edges of a considerable thickness of
blue marly strata, much of which has been swept away by the
river, there occurs a very compact brown and pink-coloured
limestone, containing small multilocular shells and nummu
lites. This limestone is the lowest of the members of the ter
tiary series, and the beds having now become absolutely ver
tical, are seen in contact with the red scaglia with flints or re
presentative of the chalk, without the slightest appearance of
unconformable deposition, the edges of the two formations hav
ing a parallel direction from W. to E., as seen in the vertical
piers on both sides of the river, on the west bank of which
they rise together into a lofty hill. (See Section, fig. 2.)
    The upper beds of the scaglia are red and fissile, precisely
like those described at Possagno, with flints both in layers
and in nodules, and few or no organic remains. The lower
beds are thicker and more compact, and gradually losing the
red colour, they pass into a beautiful white saccharoid mar
ble, a variety of which is largely quarried (and called Bi
ancon di Pove)*.      The vertical edges of this rock are seen
for several hundred feet along the right bank of the Brenta;
when near Campese it seems to pass into a dolomitic lime
stone, the beds of which are also vertical and conformable
                                                                              to

 stematic, and not founded                     on

in different parts of the north of Italy.       Brocchi having de
scribed the whole of these deposits under the head of Sub
apennine”; and thus formations of the age of our London clay
being confounded with those blue marls containing a variety
of recent shells, it now becomes quite essential to state that the
inferior members are essentially different from the superior in
zoological contents; it being in the upper beds only that we find
a large proportion of shells of the present sea. To this lat
ter epoch belong the conglomerate sands and marls of Asolo
and Bassano; and the strata which succeed, offer (amidst the
few specimens which my hurried examination permitted me
to collect), some species resembling those of the Bourdeaux
basin; whilst by far the greater number of the shells enumerated
in the oldest members of marl and limestone, near Possagno
and on the Brenta, are identical in species with those of the
 Calcaire grossier of Paris, and the London clay. The lowest
beds of this formation both in the north of Europe and in Italy
are very similar in containing not only many of the same spe
 cies of mollusca, but also identical species of mummulites, ca
ryophyllia, &c. Nor can it be urged that the multilocular fos
 sils of these inferior strata are also found in the higher tertiary
 deposits of Italy, for the microscopic shells of Sienna figured
 by Soldani differ entirely from those of the Calcaire grossier
 both in family and species.
     Now although we may compare the nummulite rock of Bas
 sano with the Calcaire grossier of the London and Paris basins,
 we cannot extend the comparison to the subjacent strata: for
 unlike certain parts of the Paris basin, where a formation distin
 guished by         its
                  freshwater and terrestrial remains      interposed                    is

LX.    On the Eristence of Salts of Potash in Brine-Springs and
       in Rock-Salt. By E. W. BRAYLEY, Jun., A.L.S.
      HEN     Dr. Marcet commenced his chemical examination
        of specimens of sea-water from various parts of the globe,
the results  of which are given in a paper published in the Phi
losophical Transactions for 1819, the probability that the waters
of the ocean contain potash, “as an ingredient brought down
by rivers from the decay of land-plants,” was suggested to him
by Dr.Wollaston. This suggestion, as is recorded in the same
paper, was verified by Dr.Wollaston himself; who thought it
probable, further, that potash existed in sea-water in the state
of sulphate. The last production of the former chemist, pub
lished in the Phil. Trans. for 1822, (Phil. Mag. vol. lx.) con
sists of some researches on the less obvious contents of sea
water; proving the existence in it of a triple sulphate of potash
and magnesia, and showing also that it contains an additional
proportion of potash, probably in the state of muriate.
   It has not appeared, hitherto, whether any chemist, in con
sequence of these researches, has subjected to experiment any
of the varieties of rock-salt, or of brine from salt-springs, with
the view of ascertaining whether they contain potash.      No in
dication of it is recorded to have been found, in Dr. Henry's
analyses of the Cheshire rock-salt and evaporated brine, or in
Mr. L. Horner's analysis of the brine from the springs of
Droitwich in Worcestershire. In the last Number of the Phil.
Mag, and Annals, however, Dr. Bigsby, in his Sketch of the
Geology of Lake Ontario, has given (at p. 341) the results of
an analysis, by Dr. M'Neven, of New York, of the “dry salt”
from the brine-springs of Salina, a town between Liverpool
and Onondago, near Lake Oneida; from which it appears to
contain no less than 2:525 per cent of sulphate of potash.
These results, Dr. Bigsby has had the goodness to inform me,
were quoted by him from Prof. A. Eaton's Geological Survey
of the District adjoining the Erie Canal, which was published
in 1824; but they appear to have hitherto escaped the atten
tion of chemical writers, as announcing the existence of potash
in mineral salt.
    Neither Dr. Henry nor Mr. Horner had occasion to insti
tute any direct researches for potash in the salt and brine they
examined. Dr. Henry, however, employed several processes
for investigating the presence of alkaline sulphates, varying
them according to the ascertained presence of other salts.
 Operating in this manner, had Dr. Henry possessed, when
making his analyses, the accurate knowledge of the composi
tion of the reagents and standards he employed, which, in com

which, having previously ascertained that neither uncombined
acid nor sulphate of magnesia was present, he considered as
indicating the existence of sulphate of soda in the brine; with
out taking any means of determining whether another alkali
might not be present.      By recomputing the numerical results
he  obtained,  according  to our present knowledge of the con
stitution of the various salts in question, employing Dr. Thom
son's table of equivalents, as given by Mr. R. Phillips in the
Annals of Philosophy, N. S., vol. x. p. 293, this excess of sul
phuric acid may be shown to amount to 3-909 grains in the
quantity of entire salt (resulting from the evaporation to dry
ness of the brine) examined by Mr. Horner.           Now it is at
least quite as probable that this excess of sulphuric acid should
be owing to sulphate of potash as to sulphate of soda; if
indeed it be not assignable with greater probability, to the
presence of the former salt.       This may be seen from the fol
lowing statement.
    On recomputing Mr. Horner's results, it will be found that
 the 431'860 grs. of entire salt analysed, contain, of
                        Chlorine........................   251-235
                        Sulphuric acid ...............           7:457
              Lime ...........................  2'484
              Magnesium....................     0-080
the quantity of soda being merely inferred, as usual.
   The magnesium is evidently in the state of chloride in the
salt: 0.080 of magnesium combine with 0:240 of chlorine,
becoming 0-320 of chloride of magnesium. This leaves 250-995
of chlorine, which unite with 167-305 of - sodium to become
418-300 of chloride of sodium”.
  Again: 2:484 of lime require for their conversion into sulphate
of lime 3’548 of sulphuric acid, forming 6.032 of the sulphate.

  there is a table of the expansion of gaseous matter: in it the
  intervals of temperature are equal, and the expansion pro
  ceeds according to the terms of an arithmetical series, whose
  common difference is 208.         In p. 118 the rule is given for
  reducing the volume at any temperature to the volume at some
  standard temperature: “ Divide the whole quantity by 480;

the sphere of the heavens, for instance, if one hemisphere be
projected on the same plane, the form of the configurations of
the stars is entirely lost, and the map ceases to bear any re
semblance to the appearance presented to the eye. This
would not be the case if the sphere were projected upon six
planes forming the sides of a cube, the eye being supposed at
the centre. The distortion at the corners would be too tri
fling to interfere sensibly with the effect to be produced. The
heavenly sphere would thus be contained in six maps, which
would have the advantage of enabling any one to find any
star or constellation with the greatest readiness.    If the pole
be taken for the centre of the   upper  surface of the cube, and
the maps be divided by meridians and parallels of declination,
the sides of the cube are symmetrical, the parallels of declina
tion are portions of hyperbolas, and the meridians are straight
lines; the upper and lower surfaces are also symmetrical, the
parallels of declination are circles, and  -  the meridians are
straight lines.

   The blue limestone of Catarroque (one to three miles W. of
Kingston, and ten to thirty feet above the lake), with that of
the higher parts of Point Henry and of the terraces among
the primitive rocks ten miles N.E. of Kingston, contain large
masses of red and white calcspar, with octohedral iron pyrites
imbedded or indruses, and of fibrous celestine under similar cir
cumstances.    Sometimes the celestine is by itself in balls from
an ounce to ten pounds in weight, in promiscuously aggre
gated bundles of closely compacted fibres of a beautiful sky
blue colour, of a silky lustre and often pale. Geodes of trihe
dral pyramids of calcspar are not uncommon, with a delicate
network composed of the fibres of celestine running along the
apices of the crystals.   The cliffs and ledges of brown lime
stone on the shores of the outlet on Mr. Law's farm contain
shapeless masses      of white foliated strontian.            have not metI
with this mineral in any other part of the north shore of this
lake. It is plentiful in other forms, in this and more recent
limestones, in different parts of the valley of the St. Lawrence.
The varieties to which             I
                                  have alluded, consist of the large
crystalline brown kind full of shells, found at Stony Island
near Sacket's Harbour, Carlston Island, and at Quinté Port
age.     It is usually in the upper layers. For ten miles west of
the  village   of Bath ( miles W. of Kingston) there are several
naked patches of brecciated limestone, the masses being pale
blue and brown, while the cement is of the same colours, but
much darker. In the woods between Marmora works and
 Lake Ontario this breccia is not at all uncommon in the state
of displaced (but not rolled) fragments.                  situation Its   the        in

 &c. They are tolerably copious; and although weak at the

 tion of the springs of which I have received intelligence; but
I   confess that        I
                   have not hitherto made sufficient inquiries.
     In the centre of the township of Elizabeth's Town, on the
 east of the primitive band crossing the lake of the Thousand
 Islands, there is a spring (Gourlay, vol. i. p. 511); another,
together with gypsum, in Ernest Town on the shores of the lake
(Gourlay, vol. i. p. 483); another in Sophia's Burg on Prince
Edward's Peninsula (Gourlay, vol. i. p. 146). Besides many
smaller salt licks, in front of lot, No. 10, in concession B of
the township of Murray, one and a half to two miles N.W.
from Quinte Portage, there is a saline spring which discharges
as much as a common pump.          It has been penetrated for six
teen feet, and yields about a peck of salt for every seventy gal
lons of water; but it is supposed to be weakened at present by
the stagnant brackish water which surrounds the spring in

patches for a quarter of a mile square.
   There are several salt springs in the township of Percy,
county of Northumberland, at which much salt was made du
ring the war between Great Britain and the United States.
There are several also in the township of Whitby, in the East
Riding of the county of York, issuing from clay and increasing
in strength with the depth from which they are raised. Others
are at Chinkecushë on the River Credit in the township of To
ronto; in the seventh concession of Esquising; and many about
Burlington Bay; and at        Catharine's   St.the west shore          on                       of
the lake; some          of

after.  Nothing but capital, and      little practice,  wanting

dilemma by placing the salt rock above them; but the shreds

occurring in some of the layers is inconceivably great, but they
are too small to allow of the determination of the genus.
   Such are the rocks of the north shore of this lake. We
have seen that their examination is greatly embarrassed, if not
altogether prevented, in the western half of the interval be
tween Kingston and York, by morasses and extensive deposits
of alluvion. The same obstacles, I learned, exist from York to
the head of the lake; so that, discouraged also by the state of
my health at the time I was in that neighbourhood,        did not                I

town.
   The south side of the upper end of the lake, constituting
part of the district of Niagara,            I
                                   have examined carefully.                                I
found the rich and beautiful stripe of low land between the
lake and what is called the “mountain,” to be underlaid by
saliferous sandstone, in extremely thin and soft strata, red,
green and blue, and very argillaceous.      It is visible on the
River Niagara at the Gorge of Queenston, and in the river
bank at the town in great thickness.    Many of the creeks be
tween the Niagara and Burlington Bay have worn their way
down to it; and the brackish waters called “deer-licks” are not
uncommon. I visited one of these, three quarters of a mile
W. by N. from the village of Stoney Creek. It is in a hollow,
and is merely a quantity of muddy brackish water on a bottom
of blue clay, evidently much frequented by animals, from the
trampled state of the herbage and smaller trees around                                    it.

boring has been carried 250 feet below the surface, but with
occasional changes in the strata. What these were I was unable
to learn; Mr.            the proprietor, being absent at the time.
While the water of the creek, only a few feet off, is quite
sweet, that of the spring is very salt, and copious. It is some
times very red.    Fifty gallons make a bushel of salt, which is
very white, and in small and thin irregular tables; 3640 bushels
are made in a year, worth on the spot about 550l. sterling.
   The Parallel Ridge, a mountain overlooking this flat, is com
posed of the same materials as the chasm of the River Niagara,
which have already been declared to be, successively, from be
low, saliferous sandstone, ferriferous sandstone and slate, cal
ciferous slate, and geodiferous limestone rock. I therefore re
fer the reader to my account of that river for any additional
particulars respecting these strata that may occur in that
ridge.

 A"       a late meeting, a paper was read, entitled “Astronomical
         Observations made in the Observatory at Paramatta,” by
  Charles L. Rümker, Esq., communicated by the President.—The
 object of this memoir is the determination of the right ascension of
 two circumpolar stars of the southern hemisphere, by a direct com
 parison with the sun, independent of the transit, and of the solar
 tables.    This comparison is made by deducing the superior and in
 ferior culminations of the stars from an uninterrupted series of equal
 altitude, for the space of a month about the time of the equinox
 This gives the difference of right ascension between the sun and
 stars. Finally, the distance of the sun from the equinoctial point
 is derived from the observed declination of the sun on those days.
 In an appendix, the author subjoins a list of the stars of which he
 ascertained the right ascensions by equal and absolute altitudes.
    April 30.-Two papers were read: the first “On the respiration
 of birds,” by Messrs. Allen and Pepys; the second, “On the spon
 taneous purification of Thames-water,” by John Bostock, M.D.
 F.R.S. &c.
    In the report which the author made of the result of his exami
nation of Thames-water to the commissioners appointed by His
 Majesty to inquire into the supply of water for the metropolis, one
of the specimens, taken near the King's Scholars' Pond sewer, was
described as in a state of extreme impurity.         This water had re
mained in the laboratory unattended to; and after an interval of
some weeks, it was observed to have become clear, while nearly the
whole of the former sediment had risen to the surface, forming a
stratum of half an inch in thickness, and still emitting a very offen
sive odour. In process of time this scum separated into large masses
or flakes, with minute air-bubbles attached to them.          At the end
of two months longer these masses again subsided, leaving the fluid
almost totally free from any visible and extraneous matter. On
analysis, the water was found to contain lime, sulphuric and mu
riatic acids, and magnesia, in much larger quantities than in the
specimens of Thames-water previously examined; the proportion of

one of the chief ornaments. Our own Publications cannot boast
of any of his papers; but he was well acquainted with the
scope of our inquiries, and for several years before his death
always attended to the geological phaenomena of the countries
which he visited in his excursions.                He became a member of
our   Society   in   1812;   was   frequently     upon    our Council, and for
some time one of our Vice-Presidents; and the interest which
he took in our welfare to the last, is fully testified by his recent
liberal donation, -and by the suggestions with which it was accom
panied.

   But though Dr. Wollaston did not publish anything on the more
immediate subjects of our pursuit, his success in the cultivation of
other branches of knowledge has conduced, in no small degree, to
the recent advancement of Geology.                 The discovery of two new
metals was but a part of his contributions to chemical science: and
his application of Chemistry to the examination of very minute
quantities, by means of the simplest apparatus, divested chemical
inquiry of much of              its
                            practical difficulty, and greatly promoted the

 him in private life, he has left, what is still more precious, the ex
 ample of his personal character. It would be difficult to name a
 man who so well combined the qualities of an English gentleman
 and a philosopher; or whose life better deserves the eulogium given
 by the first of our orators to one of our most distinguished public
 characters; for it was marked by a constant wish and endeavour to
 be “useful to mankind”.”
    In adverting to the progress which Geological research has made
 during the past year in this country,                       I
                                               may refer to the Tabular
 List of our Strata, of which Mr. De la Beche has recently pub
lished a second edition+, for one of the most convenient general
 views of the present state of our knowledge respecting them. In
 the following observations I shall adopt the descending order of the
 Series.
    A complete account of the deposits which appear on the coast of
 Suffolk, and other parts of the eastern shores of England, especially
of that which has been denominated CRAG, is still a desideratum
of importance in the history of our strata. The publications of Mr.
Robberds        f
                and Mr. R. C. Taylor § have given some information
                                                                                                           it,
of considerable value upon this tract: but a general account of
combining the local phaenomena with those             analogous deposits of
in  other quarters,     still
                         is         wished for; and from the connexion

      A full
          and elaborate Catalogue of the Fossils of Sussex has been
 contributed by Mr. Mantell; whose labours as a Geologist, amidst
 the duties of an arduous profession, have long been so useful to the
 public, and so honourable to himself-This valuable paper will be
published in the next portion of our Transactions.     Mr. Martin of
 Pulborough in Sussex, another member of the same profession, has
published a detached Memoir, the developement of a paper read
here during the last session*; which, besides an account of the strati
fication in his own neighbourhood, contains much ingenious specu
lation on the phaenomena which seem to have attended the elevation
of the tract beneath the chalk, within the denudation of Sussex,
Hampshire, Surrey, and Kent.
   The accessions to our knowledge respecting the oolitic series,
from the Portland strata down to the new red sandstone, have also
been considerable during the past year. Mr. Lonsdale, I am happy
to say, has presented us with an account of his researches on that
important tract in the centre of England, included between the
chalk near Calne and the vicinity of Bath; the maps relating to
which     I
          had the pleasure of laying before you at the last Anni
versary. This valuable work, one of the most accurate perhaps yet
produced in this country, may be considered as a more advanced
stage of the inquiries respecting the oolitic tracts, begun so ably
by Mr. Smith, and continued in Mr. Conybeare's Outlines: and it
carries on the transverse section of England, from the vicinity of
Bristol; which had already been illustrated by Mr. Conybeare and
Dr. Buckland, in their admirable Memoir published in the first part
of our Second Series.                      -
   The work upon the Coast of Yorkshire, announced by Mr. Phillips
of the York Institution f, will throw light upon a still lower portion
of our Oolites, and elucidate especially that remarkable group of
 strata which includes a series of coal-measures in connection with
 the lower oolite.     It is very much to be desired that all our
 coasts were thus examined and distinctly represented; such illus
tration being valuable, not only in topographical history, but as
 affording the best evidence as to the succession of our strata, and
 the greatest facility to the study of them,- both by foreigners and
                                 -
 our own countrymen.        .
    The complex and important groups which intervene between the
 Oolites and the Transition rocks, have been illustrated during the
past year by Professor Sedgwick,-separately in England, and con
jointly with Mr. Murchison, in the Isle of Arran and the north of
Scotland.
    Mr. Sedgwick's Memoir on the magnesian limestone, and the
lower part of the new red sandstone, in the north of England, is
unquestionably one of the most valuable contributions we have
hitherto received; not only supplying a desideratum of the greatest

and obscure relations of that extensive series of beds which it de
scribes. Nothing is now wanting, but the acquisition of good
maps by the extension of the Ordnance Survey, to complete our
geological acquaintance with the large portion of England de
scribed in this Memoir.
    In Mr. Sedgwick's paper, the new red sandstone is considered as
constituting one great complex formation, between the lias and the
coal-measures,    with two calcareous formations subordinate to it;
one (the muschel-kalkstein,) in the upper part, which has not yet
been discovered in our country; the other (the magnesian lime
stone,) in the lower part, which the author has made especially the
object of his researches.
    But although the Muschel-kalkstein has not yet been observed,
and probably may not exist in any considerable force in Eng
land, it would be premature to assert that                equivalent may its
 not still   bedetected among our strata; and this, with other cir
 cumstances, renders        good monograph

    I
   am here confined, to detail the results of which these memoirs
give an account: the general inferences are, 1. The identity with
the secondary rocks of England, of the strata in the Western-Islands,
and throughout a large portion both of the east and west coasts of
Scotland, is established on the evidence of fossils.-2. A formation
of red sandstone has been observed, on the shores of the Pentland
Firth, which appears to occupy a place between the coal-measures
and the new red conglomerates.—3. A great deposit of sandstone,
with subordinate beds of dark bituminous limestone, occupying, ap
parently, the place of the coal-formation, has been designated,—but
not yet perfectly identified with any formation hitherto described.

    From the situation of the capitals of England and France, at
a distance from primary mountains, the study of the crystalline
formations would there naturally occupy less attention than that
 of the stratified rocks; and with this circumstance, the extra
ordinary interest and novelty of recent zoological discoveries have
concurred, to fix upon the newer strata, not more attention than
 they deserve, but a degree of interest which has perhaps in some
 cases been too exclusive. The naturalist, however, who is in search
of general laws, should exert himself to keep every part of his sub
ject in view; and should never cease to remember, that, as in the
 study of the newer formations Zoology and Botany are his best
allies, so Mineralogy is indispensable to an acquaintance with the
more ancient rocks,—and Chemistry as well as general Physics, to
 the solution of the problems connected with them. Mineralogy
has, from various causes, been of late less vigorously pursued in
England, than a few years ago; and it is probably to the previous
labour which this subject requires, that we are, in part, to ascribe
the comparatively backward state of our knowledge respecting the
primary portions of this country.        But though nothing has within
the last year been published in our Transactions upon these for
mations, they have not been unattended to ; and the Memoirs
already produced, with those which are preparing for your perusal,
 will be found to throw great light upon the relations of our transi
tion and primary rocks.                                       -
    A Memoir by Mr. Phillips, of the York Institution, describes a
 tract which is a branch from the great central mass of the slaty
and primary rocks of Cumberland; and gives in detail the phaeno
mena of a district remarkable for the numerous and striking proofs
 which it exhibits of dislocation,-of such amount, that in one          in
stance strata have been brought into immediate apposition, which
in their original situation were separated by a thickness of more
 than 500 feet.                            -

been already briefly but correctly described by                                Otley*, in a tract

 results of his own researches in that district, the detail of which                                     I

    No. I, the grauwacke of Cumberland, is unquestionably the equi
valent of the upper part of (a) the grauwacke-slate of Somerset,
Devon, and Cornwall.       No. II, the green-slate of Cumberland, has
no representative in Cornwall; but seems to be identical with part
of (No. 3) the Snowdonian formation of Wales. No. III, the clay
slate, and IV, the crystalline schistose rocks, present analogies with
 (c) the metalliferous killas of Cornwall:—and on the whole, the
suite of the transition and primary rocks in Cumberland assists in
bringing together the phaenomena of Wales and Cornwall; and in
connecting the several groups in the distant parts of England, in a
series of similar and probably contemporaneous formations.
    The labours of the Geological Society of Cornwall are continued:
and a work, of which the first volume has been published, by Mr.
John Taylor, one of the principal miners in this country, promises
considerable additions to a department of knowledge comparatively
new to our scientific literature, but intimately connected with our
pursuits. This work is entitled “Records of Mining+;” and it pro
poses to embrace “reports and statements upon particular mines,
and the produce of metals, in various districts; notices on Geological
facts relating to mining ; discoveries of ores and minerals, and de
scriptions of existing processes connected with the treatment of ores,
and the operations of smelting, or other modes of reduction; with
investigations of the methods of working now usually employed in
different countries, and of projected improvements; and descriptions
of machinery or implements destined to the service of the mines.”
The editor justly adds, that many facts relating to these subjects,
continually present themselves to observation,       record     which        all               of                   is

       I  have dwelt the longer upon that portion of our labours which
    refers to England, because the structure of this country is the pri
    mary object of our researches; since it is here, at home, that we
    can best, and in the first instance, acquire the rudiments of our
    subject, and gain that correctness of eye, and of judgment, which
    confers the right, as it were, to examine the geology of other dis
    tricts, and to claim, either from foreigners, or our own countrymen,
    that confidence in our accuracy, without which                attempts        com      all                    at

     A paper, by Mr. Featherstonehaugh, read at one of our latest
 meetings, gives a comparison of the series of strata in the American
 United States, with that of England:—and various Memoirs of Dr.
 Bigsby, some of which have been read before this Society, contain
 a copious statement of facts respecting Canada and a large portion
 of the adjacent country.
    The Memoir of Dr. Richardson, read at one of our meetings,
 and published in the Appendix to the account of Capt. Franklin's
  Second Journey, contains a most valuable series of observations,
 made under great disadvantages, during the advance and return of
 that memorable expedition to the shores of the Polar Sea; in the
 course of which a space of about 5000 miles was for the first time
 surveyed and laid down, the total distance travelled over by the
 party in America being not less than 14000 miles. The great simi
 larity of the rocks, and of their structure and external features, to
 those of Europe;—the uniformity in composition of vast tracts of the
 country;-and the very large proportion of the surface occupied by
 water, especially within a broad calcareous band, that intervenes
 between the rocky mountains and another primary tract which has
 nearly the same direction, are some of the more obvious general
 results that may be collected from the perusal of this important
 Memoir, a full abstract of which will be found in our Proceedings.
 And the whole is rendered still more interesting to us, by the libe
 rality of the collectors, who have placed in the Museum of the So
 ciety a complete series of the specimens described and referred to
by Dr. Richardson.                 -          -
    I have already mentioned to you the contribution of Captain
 King from the southern extremity of America; which demonstrates
the existence there of similar rocks, exhibiting analogous appear
ances, to those of Europe: and we have great reason to expect,
from the number and activity of the British officers and agents, whom
our numerous mining projects have distributed in South America,
considerable additional light on the structure and phaenomena of
that extensive region.
    From Africa we are still without any communication, from any
of the Settlements on its extensive coasts.
    I am happy to say, there is every day new reason to hope for
the extension of geological inquiry in India; where the liberality of
the Company in carrying on the magnificent Trigonometrical Sur
vey has already laid the best foundation for such researches.       A
copy of the portion of the great map which has been already pub
lished has been presented to us by the Directors; and there is
every reason to suppose, that they are as much disposed to favour
Geology, as they have shown themselves to be to advance the pro
gress of astronomy and scientific topography.     We owe, under this
head, considerable obligation to the exertions of our own distin
guished member Mr. Colebrooke, whose activity and varied informa
tion have enabled him to contribute so much, to several departments
of literature and science in connexion with the East.                  -
   The Asiatic Society, also, has recently taken up the extension of

geological inquiry with much interest and zeal; and has opened
an intercourse with India upon this subject, through Sir Alexander
Johnstone, the chairman of their committee of foreign correspon
dence, from whence the best results may be expected. . The at
tention of the Asiatic Society of Calcutta has of late been particu
larly devoted to this department of natural science; and we have, in
the different Settlements, several friends and fellows of this Society,
who have shown their desire to promote our views.
   From Central India, Captain James Franklin has given us a Me
moir on the vicinity of Bundelcund, illustrated with an excellent-
geological map and sections.
   The papers of Dr. Buckland and Mr. Clift, connected with the
splendid collection of fossil remains from the Burmese territory,
with which our Museum has lately been enriched, have been pub
lished in the last part of the Transactions: and the Council has
endeavoured to diffuse the information afforded by this collection,
by causing models of several of the fossils to be prepared, and distri
buted to some of the principal museums of Natural History. The                                                  ...

present, than the fossil organized remains of that country; a
knowledge of which, especially of the remains of animals, will be an
addition of capital importance to our subject, and probably not less
valuable to the Zoologist.     The diluvium, therefore, respecting
which we have at present no information whatever, is deserving of
the greatest attention :-and,-since the existing races of Australian
animals are so widely different from those of every other portion
of the earth, the identity, on the one hand, of these animals with
those occurring in a fossil state, would lead to some very im
portant inferences; while on the other, the agreement of the fossil
remains of Australia with the existing races of other regions, now
disjoined from that country, would give new support to some of the
most popular speculations of our day. With a view to these                                         in
quiries, scarcely anything that can be collected by our fellow-la
bourers in that quarter, will be without interest to their friends in
Europe.                                                     -
   The  popularity which the  study of  ZooLogy  continues to ac
quire in England, opens the brightest hopes in every department
of inquiry connected with that important branch of natural history.
Our papers during the past year have added to the list of fossil
animals two new species of Mastodon, connecting very beautifully
the structure of the teeth in the animals of that genus previously
known, with that of the Elephant. And Mr. Pentland has given an
account of some fossils from Bengal, presented through the kind
mess of Mr. Colebrooke; which include the remains of a new An
thracotherium, and appear to have been situated in a deposit re
sembling some of the tertiary strata of Europe.
   We owe to Mr. Broderip, one of the Secretaries of our Society,
a paper in the Zoological Journal *, describing the Fossil jaw of a
Didelphis, found at Stonesfield, the geological situation of which
had been the subject of some debate; with a statement of the evi

 be  within the oolitic-slate beneath the     Oxford-clay,   probably very
near the site of the forest-marble.

    The author has connected with his paper on the Pterodactyle,
  some observations on a substance analogous to album-graecum, pro
  duced apparently by the Saurian animals, whose remains are de
  posited in the lias; and on a dark colouring matter possessing the
 properties of Sepia and Indian ink, afforded by a fossil which exhibits
  a structure like that of the cuttle-fish. He is still engaged in the
 inquiries connected with these subjects; and has already obtained
 some very curious and unexpected results.
     Mr. R. C. Taylor, one of our Fellows, has prepared a valuable
 list of the fossils hitherto discovered in the British strata”, drawn .
 principally from the works and authority of Mr. Sowerby, to whose
 indefatigable exertions in extending our acquaintance with the
 fossils of England Geology is under most essential obligation. The

And the author states, among other inferences from his Tables, that
the ancient period is characterized by the complex shells, the middle
by bivalves, the upper strata by the simple univalves; while, as we
descend in the series of strata, we recede from the existing forms and
proportions of numbers; 134 complex species out of 237 being
found in the ancient beds, and only 147 out of 1028 in the more
recent. These numbers, it will be observed, are connected with
the system of Linnaeus, and will probably be found to differ con
siderably from an enumeration according to the method of Lamarck:
and the time perhaps is still remote, when any such comparison of
numbers can be expected to come near the truth. The proportion
of the known species to the total number, either of the existing or
the fossil shells, is the result of circumstances in a great measure
accidental,—the industry or success of collectors, and the greater
or less extent to which the contents of the conchiferous strata are
brought to light by human labour, or naturally disclosed: and                                                       all
these sources      inequality must for long time affect the different

that when the wish of the Council to assist in describing and pub
lishing them is generally known, we shall probably never want such
a supply, as will enable us to connect with every future part of our
Transactions some contribution to fossil Botany. Great benefit will
thus be produced, by circulating information at present locked up
and unavailing; and the specimens lent to the Society for illustra
 tion, will be rendered doubly valuable to the proprietors themselves.
    The Botanical paper, in the last part of our Transactions, is that
of Dr. Buckland, on the Cycadeoideae; a new family of fossil plants,
discovered in the isle of Portland, and obtained most probably
from a stratum immediately above the oolitic beds, which contains
 also lignite, with the silicified trunks of dicotyledonous trees.
    On the suggestion of Mr. Brown, these fossils have been con
sidered as belonging to a family very nearly related to, but perhaps
sufficiently distinct from, the recent Cycadeae: and the observations
of this distinguished Botanist, with respect to the stem or caudex of
this family, are illustrated by sections represented in the plates
 which accompany Dr. Buckland's paper.
    The family of Cycadeae consists at present of two genera, Zamia
and Cycas. In certain Zamiae, Mr. Brown states, there is one
narrow vascular circle, divisible into radiating plates, and situated
in the midst of the cellular substance of which the stem is in a great
part composed.        In Cycas revoluta, a second circle is added ex
ternally, at a small distance from the first; and in Cycas circinalis,
 (according to the only section of this plant yet published,) the circles
are more numerous, the outermost being still considerably re
moved from the circumference.
    The fossil stems, which are the immediate subject of Dr. Buck
land's paper, like the recent Cycadeae, are not covered with true
bark, but have a thick case, made up of the basis of decayed leaves,
which externally form rhomboidal compartments, similar to those of
the recent plants. The internal structure in the fossils, so far as
hitherto examined, resembles that of the Cycadeae, except in the
more external position and greater breadth of the circle or circles
visible in the section of the stem; a character whereby, Mr. Brown
is of opinion, this fossil family approaches more nearly, than the
 Cycadeae, to the ordinary structure of dicotyledonous woods; and
 consequently may be considered as supplying, from the fossil world,
 a link, which helps, in some degree, to connect the still distant
structure of the Cycadeae with that of the nearest existing family,
 the Coniferae. ,
    M. Adolphe Brongniart's publications on the History of Fossil
 Vegetables”, though produced in another country, are too im
 portant to our inquiries not to be mentioned here. Some fear,
 perhaps, may be entertained, that his data are not yet sufficiently

extensive to form an adequate base for his deductions; but there
can be no question as to many of his inferences, nor respecting the
impulse which the subject will receive from such an accumulation
of facts as he has brought together. His views contrasting the
climate of the globe at former periods and at the present time,
and his division of the epochs of geological deposition, as deduced
from the study of fossil plants, in comparison with those which mere
geological inquiry points out,-are most ingenious.           Even if re
garded as no more than the conjectures of so acute and indefa
tigable an inquirer, these speculations would be well deserving of
attention; and altogether, his works on Fossil Plants must be con
sidered as constituting one of the most valuable contributions to
this department of Geology that has ever appeared.

   The spirited publications of Mr. Scrope, especially his plates
in illustration of the volcanic district of Central France, have
renewed the attention of geologists in England to that country,
from whence so many luminous views may be obtained on various
points of theory.       By placing the phaenomena before the eye, Mr.
Scrope has enabled his readers more easily to appreciate the merit
of M. De Montlosier's admirable Essay on the Extinct Volcanoes
of Auvergne"; a work published more than thirty years ago, and
containing most correct inductions and forcible reasoning on the
origin of valleys, but almost unknown amongst us, till            doctrines                                  its

 modern publications of Germany: and of those of Italy, which                      in
clude a great number of tracts on topography and physical geogra
phy, full of ingenious speculation and valuable detail, there are but
few indeed with which we are acquainted.             The description of our
own   country  is but a   step  to what    Geology   is yet to become; and
for the generalization    which is wanting    to render it worthy of alliance
with the  higher   departments     of  science,   the study of foreign pro
ductions is not   only   expedient    as an   economy     of labour and time,
but is demanded     by  justice  and truth.
   Messrs. Lyell and Murchison concur with De Montlosier and
 Scrope, in testifying that the valleys in Auvergne and the Vivarrais
have been produced by the streams, in opposition to any more
general or violent agency. They regard some of the deposits of
transported materials in that country, which contain organic re
mains, and are more recent than the tertiary formations, as having
been accumulated in small lakes, caused by the temporary obstruc
tion of rivers, either by lavas, or by land-falls after earthquakes:—
and they did not find upon the surface, even of the most ancient
lava-currents, any trace of that more extensive diluvial action, nor
any remnant of those masses of rock transported from great dis
tances, which have been supposed to be of universal occurrence
over the entire surface of the globe.
   It is not here my province to enter into the discussion of these
interesting questions, nor to pronounce an opinion upon them.
It will be sufficient to have intimated, that much still remains to be
done, even in this department of inquiry, the progress of which has
been of late sovery remarkable: and that as the doctrine of Werner,
which ascribed to volcanic power an almost accidental origin, and
an unimportant office, has long since expired; so the more recent
views, which regard a certain class of causes as having ceased from
acting, will probably give place to an opinion, that the forces from
whence the present appearances have resulted, are in Geology, as
in Astronomy and general Physics, permanently connected with
the constitution, and structure of the Globe.
   Such, Gentlemen, is a brief statement of the product of our
labours during the past year, and of some of the objects which
you may perhaps regard as still deserving your attention.                        If,   on
comparing our subject with some other departments                           of

                                                                  such aid             as

     Jan. 9.—The President read an extract from a letter of Professor
  Encke, dated Berlin, Dec. 7, 1828, in which he stated the places
  of his comet, as resulting from his own observations.
     A paper was next read “On the determination of the distance of
 a comet from the earth,” by J. W. Lubbock, Esq. M.A.S. The
 author in this paper proposes to examine the principle of the various
 methods which have been proposed for the resolution of this pro
 blem,--to bring them under one notation,-and to ascertain from
 which the greatest advantage is to be expected.
    There was also read a paper On the longitudes of Calcutta, Ma
 dras, and Futty Ghur, as determined by lunar transits and eclipses
 of Jupiter's first satellite, by Major J. A. Hodgson, Surveyor-General
 of India, accompanied with the original observations and reductions.
    The last paper read was from Mr. Rumker, the astronomer at the
 Paramatta Observatory, detailing the observations for determining
 the December solstice in 1827, with one of Reichenbach's repeating
circles; and likewise the observations of certain circumpolar stars,
about the same period of time, by means of the mural circle.             In
reducing the observations for the solstice, Mr. Rumker (on account
 of the small zenith distance of the sun) applies a correction dif
ferent from that given by M. Biot in his Astronomie. The result of
his observations makes the mean obliquity of the ecliptic, reduced
to January 1, 1828, equal to 23° 27' 40"-01.
                 COLLECTION        OF MINERALS ON SALE.                     -
    I beg to announce to the cultivators     of mineralogical science, that
the extensive and valuable collection of my late brother William
Phillips is to be disposed of by private contract.
    The collection consists of several thousands of specimens, selected
with great care and judgement, in excellent condition; it contains
most of the mineral substances at present known, and is rich in va
rieties of most of them.       It is perhaps scarcely requisite to observe,
that this collection served as the basis of the late proprietor's well
known work on Mineralogy, and it is accompanied with many of
the original drawings of crystals with which that work is illustrated;
as well as the specimens of Uranite, Ruby Copper, and Oxide of Tin,
of the crystalline forms of which detailed accounts are given in the
Transactions of the Geological Society.           The collection contains
    N. S. Vol. 5. No. 30. June 1829.                    3O              not

not only the latest discovered mineral bodies, but abounds with
specimens from Cornwall, which were not uncommon forty or fifty
years since, but are now more rarely met with.-Particulars and
catalogues may be had of Mr. G. B. Sowerby, 156 Regent-street.
