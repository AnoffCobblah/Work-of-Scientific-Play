tº             sphere when moving slowly, differs as to the numerical mag

       Mr. Heaviside discusses the question of a moving elec
 trified sphere, and while agreeing with the results           I    obtained
some time ago as to the                  force produced by such a
sphere when moving slowly, differs as to the numerical mag
nitude of the energy possessed by the sphere and the forces
acting upon it when placed in a magnetic field. The latter
quantities, however, do not depend merely upon the alterations
caused by the motion of the sphere in the polarization of the
dielectric surrounding the sphere, but also upon the boundary
conditions we adopt and upon the view we take of the motion
close to the sphere of the medium in which the electric dis
placements occur.
    This will be seen in the course of the following investigation,

in which have endeavoured to take into account the motion
of the medium in which the displacements occur.               I  find that,
in order to close the circuits in this     case,  it is    necessary           to
assume effects which, as far as          I know, have not been

    We can deduce an important consequence of the assump
tion, if we consider the case of the aether moving with uniform
velocity between two parallel planes charged, the one with posi
tive, the other with negative electricity.
                                  2.

    If v is the velocity of the aether, h the electric displacement
at right            to the planes, the magnetic force between the
planes will be parallel to a, and equal to —4truh ; or if a is
the surface-density of the electrification on the planes —4twa,
the magnetic force vanishes except between the planes, so that
on crossing the positively electrified surface there is an        in
crease in the magnetic force parallel to w equal to 4trav.      Thus
the charged surface acts like a current sheet of intensity —av,
but —v is the velocity of the plane relatively to the aether; so
that a charged surface moving with velocity v relatively to the
aether must act like a current sheet of intensity ov.
    We will now proceed to apply these results to some special
cases.     Let us suppose that we have a charged sphere moving
along the axis of 2 with the velocity wo, and that it sets the
aether around it in motion in the same way as an incom
pressible fluid is set in motion by a solid sphere of the same
radius

   Thus the lines of magnetic force are circles with their centres
along and their planes at right angles to the axis of z.
                 º
   At a distance from the centre large compared with the
radius of the sphere the magnetic force is the same as that
due to a current eulo, but close to the sphere the relative
motion of the sphere and aether causes it to be larger than this,
and at the           of the sphere it is the same as that due to
a current    # ewo.

   Thus outside the rotating cylinder there is a magnetic force
parallel to the axis of rotation.
  If  we assume that the aether outside the sphere is at rest, we

 20       Messrs. Hutchinson and Wilkes's Comparison      of
 in comparison with the diameter of the tube, Lord Rayleigh
 has calculated that a correction of 82 diameter, additive to
 the true length of the tube, is necessary in order to allow for
 the resistance of the terminal connexions.      Mascart, Nerville
 and   Benoit,   and also Glazebrook and  Fitzpatrick have verified
 this result experimentally.      This quantity is 8L in the above
 formulae.
     In  commencing our experiments in the spring of 1888, our
 first  object was to determine the best methods that had been
 used for the different determinations involved.        About two
 months were spent in standardizing resistances that were to
 be used (the comparisons being made in a constant tempera
 ture vault, using a Fleming bridge) and in testing different
 methods of measurement.
     An attempt to measure the lengths at 0°C. was made, only
 the portion of the tube to be observed by the microscopes
 being scraped clear of ice. It was found that this method
 presented great difficulties; and as an error of 10 per cent. in
 the assumed expansion of glass, in reducing the length of the
 tube from 20° C. to 0° 8. would only cause an error of
 Toºroo in the length, the plan was abandoned.
  º
        e measurement of a column of mercury a little less than
 the  length   of the tube, which was covered with ice except at
          over the ends of the column, was tried repeatedly, both
   y observing the meniscus and by flattening the ends of the
mercury with hard rubber plugs (as suggested by Lord
 Rayleigh) without success. The lenses of the microscopes
would naturally coat rapidly with moisture, and the unoccupied
   arts of the bore of the tube become so wet that minute glo
   ules of mercury would be left behind when the column was
run out to be weighed. . We endeavoured to obviate this by
          º
plugging the ends with soft wooden plugs; but still the
moisture got in, making the meniscus uncertain, and inter
fering          the removal of the column.
    Plate-glass end-pieces, held in place by elastic bands, were
tried, hoping thus to obtain full tubes at 0°; but, owing to
the grinding of the plates against the mouths of the tubes and
the old trouble with wet mercury, these were given up.
    The tubes were at first secured to straight, narrow, well
seasoned boards, and (the end-cups being in place) were put
in watertight rectangular boxes (lined with waxed duck)
about 5 inches wide and 5 inches deep.           Crushed ice was
then    packed    in over them.   Though  observations taken ten
or fifteen minutes apart would apparently agree, it was found
that, owing to the proximity of the board, the mercury would
sometimes not have reached its minimum resistance in four

       the Mercury       Unit with the British Association Unit.                                     21
or four and a half hours.    The boards were therefore replaced
by narrow partition-blocks, scored to allow the tubes to rest
firmly. The tubes were thus raised about three quarters of
an inch from the bottom of the box.
   Most observers have measured the length of the column of
mercury, used in determining the cross section of a tube, at
the temperature of the room (between 10° and 20°C.), and
then used a formula which reduces their observations to 0°C.
As the cubical coefficient of expansion of mercury in glass
is .00016, an error of little more than six tenths of a degree
will make a difference of one part in ten thousand in the final
result.  Since the mercury-column is in a thick-walled glass
tube, simply exposed to the air of the room (generally for a
few hours), the uncertainty of          being         its

   The former value applies to determinations                     1 and 2   of this
tube, the latter to Nos. 3 and 4.
   The    temperature was very constant for the separate
measurements          on each tube and, as it never differed more
than two degrees between corresponding observations, the
average length is taken at the average temperature.
   By comparison with the steel Rogers's standard, whose
length is accurately known, the brass metre bar was found
to equal 100.031 centim. at 25°C.; a result which agrees
perfectly with previous determinations, using 000019 as the
coefficient of linear expansion.                  This would make the bar
correct at 8°7 C.
    Weighing.—Schickert weights and balances were used, the
former being compared with the glass standard kilogramme,
which has been compared with the Berlin standard.
   In order to avoid errors due to moisture and uncertainty as
to temperature, the standard and weights compared were left
standing on the scale-pans for several hours before taking the
weighings, which were made without opening the case of the
balances.        The temperature was kept constant, barometer
readings taken, and the air was kept dry by calcium chloride.
The brass kilogramme (K) was found to equal 1000-001
grammes in vacuo, which agrees well with former determina
tions.    Specific gravity 8:3.

pared at the Cavendish Laboratory.         It is marked as found
correct by Rayleigh at 20°9. By comparison with W. M.
No. 292, we found it correct at 20°8. Temperature-coefficient

    4. Pratt 1 B.A.U.       Resistance 1.02579 at 16°C. Tem
perature-coefficient -00030.
    5. A circular comparator (designed by Professor Rowland),
containing ten 10 B.A.U. coils wound together on a copper
cylinder, which contained water. The coils are protected by
an outer cylinder which leaves a large air-space.         Contacts
are made      by means of      mercury  cups,  arranged  circularly
in an ebonite top. This comparator was used in standardizing
the one-ohm coils and as a shunt. The coils were always kept
standing in water for several hours before being used, and the
temperature of this water was kept perfectly constant through
out the day by having in each vessel a coiled lead pipe, which
was connected by rubber tubing with the pipes of the city
water-supply.
   All resistances were compared both before starting and
after completing this portion of the work, and the two sets of
results agreed.
    The resistance of the rods used to connect the end terminals
to the bridge was calculated for temperature of room, 18°C.,
 •001.257.    By observation —temperature of the room 21°5,
 •001:258. As this temperature never varied much from 22°,
•001:27 was used as the correction in all cases.
    A Fleming bridge was used, and the value of a division of
the bridge-wire by two distinct determinations gave agreeing
 results. The resistances were so combined (except in the case
of the first measurements made) as to require the use of as
 small a portion of the wire as possible.

  When coils were                 connected          in parallel, their terminals
rested solidly on copper disks, about $ inch in diameter, well
amalgamated    and covered with mercury, in boxwood cups.
The rods  connecting these cups to the bridge were short, stout
copper rods, whose calculated resistance was .000156 at 16°C.
This   is,   course, always taken into account.

and the current     reversed, in order to eliminate any small
thermal current.
   Benoit has determined that the resistance of mercury is
decreased by the diffusion of copper amalgam from the ends
of copper connecting rods. Similar experiments, performed
at this laboratory, have demonstrated the fact that, by leaving
the rods dipping in the mercury in the end-pieces for twenty
four hours, the resistance was decreased one part in twenty
four hundred. Therefore, the decrease due to this cause in
our investigations must be inappreciable.
   In the cases of nine fillings, a small thermometer was
placed in the mercury cups immediately after removing the
rods. In no case was the temperature thus obtained greater
than 1% C., and the average of the nine sets of observations
was 0°5 C.      Supposing that 6 centim. of the tube were at
this temperature,   in the worst case the error would be "00003
high ; while, in the other cases, it would be about 00002 high.
   Table  III. (p. 26) gives our final results.
   Owing to the tubes being entirely unprotected, great care
was necessary in handling them.         Tube         was broken in    III.

which were then fitted with perforated rubber stoppers.
These were after this replaced by common corks.

   Taking the mean of tubes               IV. and     W., the variations         of the
other tubes       are very nearly inversely proportional to the
squares of these ratios.
   Combining the results of tubes II., IV., W., WI., in this
way, the final result would be '95341.
   Combining the tubes with weights proportional to their
                 that is proportional to                  the final result would

    It is by means of the two hypotheses named above that for
the first time it has been made possible to calculate the nume
rical values of several thousand observations in these seventeen
widely different fields; and with such success that no con
siderable contradiction between theory and experiment has
arisen. Are we to assume that the view that hydrates exist
in solutions can render such service? So far as am aware I
not a single numerical datum has hitherto been deduced from
this hypothesis.
    I  may be permitted to discuss this last question in a few
words.       In the first place it may be considered indubitable
that it is impossible to determine whether a salt occurs in
solution as hydrate or not by any of the methods for deter
mining the properties enumerated in group A (except perhaps
No. 5). Here we perfectly agree with Prof. Mendelejeff;
his remarks besides are to be found almost word for word in
a memoir of Raoult (Ann. de Chim, et Phys. [6] viii. p. 291).
 From this it follows that the conclusions, drawn by Rüdorff
 and Wüllner, from the lowering of the freezing-point and
 vapour-pressure of solutions, in favour of the existence of
 hydrates in them, are unfounded, as Tammann and others have
 already shown. These inadmissible conclusions of Rüdorff
 and Wüllner were formerly, however, considered as the chief
 proof of the existence of hydrates in salt solutions.
     On the other hand, there are other phenomena belonging
 to the groups B, C, and F which are opposed to this assump
 tion. #. for instance, an electric current is passed through a
 solution of KCl, of which we assume that it exists as the hy
 drate KCl. mH2O, then the ions of this salt are      K.   n H2O, and

32                      Svante Arrhenius on Electrolytic
Cl(m—n)H,O (G. Wiedemann’s hypothesis).                    Now it appears
from Ostwald’s researches that the             velocity  of an ion is the
smaller the more atoms it contains.                  Thus the velocity
(which may be easily determined from the conductivity) for
the potassium ion of a solution of KCl, viz.                  n H2O, must     K.
be smaller the     greater  is the value of n.       But Kohlrausch has
shown that the ion K. n H20 travels at the same rate in solu
tions of         all
                 the potassium salts, therefore the ion             must                K                  be
combined with the same           quantity       water       of salts. This   in   all
holds for all other ions. As soon therefore as both the ions
of    asalt solution are given, then the hydrate              also known      is                           ;
and the composition            this hydrate does not alter with the
                                   of
concentration, which certainly does not agree with Mendele
jeff’s views. There are, besides, other circumstances (Ostwald,

to  assume that KCl         normal solution had decomposed

were brought into contact with water the latter would become
acid from HCl, and the solution alkaline from the KOH

 36                 Svante Arrhenius on Electrolytic
 bability of electrolytic      dissociation could be in any degree
 lessened   by   the possibility  of the phenomena which it explains
 being in the future deducible from other data (e.g. the exist
 ence of known hydrates).          If this were actually to occur, then,
 conversely, the existence of the hydrates could be deduced from
 these phenomena, and thus indirectly from the theory of dis
 sociation, so that new territory would be added to the exten
                 .."
 sive domain already commanded by this hypothesis.
 ;
    A striking example of this is found in the hypothesis itself.
 From his                 generalization of Avogadro's law, van’t
  Hoff had deduced the conditions of equilibrium for several
 electrolytes in one solvent, and       I  had done the same from a
 consideration of the electric conductivity by means of a hypo
 thesis which may be characterized as the imperfectly developed
 dissociation hypothesis.        Immediately after the appearance of
 this paper by van't Hoff the fusion of the two partially over
 lapping theories took place, and it cannot be denied that the
           period of both was reached only after their union, and
 was conditioned by this. Although, therefore, the supporters
 of the dissociation hypothesis cannot homologate the mode of
 deduction of the views of the great Russian chemist, they
 have every reason to wish him the best success in his efforts to
 explain the above-mentioned phenomena.
   Leipzig, May 25, 1889.
    NoTE.—In the last numbers of            the ‘Chemical News,’ and
 of the “Abstracts of the      Proceedings    of the Chemical Society,'
 are reports of a paper by Mr. S. U. Pickering which confirms
                                                I
 in the most decisive manner the views have expressed above.
 Mr. Pickering (Chemical News, May 27, 1889, p. 278) says
 that “on plotting out the first differential of his density
 results, he was surprised to find that it formed an irregularly
 curved figure, and not the rectilineal figure given by Men
 delejeff; and he was still more surprised that, on plotting out
 the values used by Mendelejeff himself, the figure obtained was
 curvilinear like his own, and not rectilinear like Mendele
jeff’s. . . . . . Mendelejeff's statement, therefore, that he had
 proved the hydrate theory by showing that the densities dif
 ferentiated into straight lines meeting at points corresponding
to definite hydrates is erroneous.”          He then proceeded to a
second    differentiation,   but   “owing     to the magnitude of the
 experimental error” did not take the values of ds/dp obtained
directly from his observed results, but instead took “the
smoothed first differential curve” as his point of departure
 (Proc. Chem. Soc May 16, 1889, p. 89).
    In this way Mr. Pickering found that the second derived

                  Dissociation versus Hydration.                 37
function (d’s/dp”) consisted of straight lines.     Mathematically
interpreted, this means that in the ds/dp curve angular points
or sudden changes of curvature occur. If Mr. Pickering had
“smoothed” his curve properly he would evidently have
removed these angular points or sudden changes of curvature,
                                                         #.
for a very small fraction of the “experimental error” would
suffice for this purpose. The result can scarcely be gratifying
to the supporters of the theory of hydration.        Mr.
finds that d’s/dp” is made up of no less than 17 straight lines
corresponding to 16 hydrates.         In other words, the specific
     vity can be represented in the form of 17 equations of the
third degree with 68 arbitrary constants, besides the 16 arbi
trarily chosen points where the curves begin and end
    This really has very much the look of a reductio ad absurdum.
The mode of representation entirely lacks experimental founda
tion, as Mr. Pickering himself tacitly admits in the words
 “owing to the magnitude of the experimental error.” It is
 characteristic also that Mr. Pickering “agrees with Mr.
 Crompton’s conclusion that they (the dºk/dp” curves ; k=con
 ductivity, p = per cent. by weight of sulphuric acid) give a
 rectilineal figure, but he differs from him in some of the
 details as to where the breaks occur’’ (p. 88).           But the
  joints “where the breaks occur” should correspond to definite
   ydrates. The fact is that Mr. Pickering with his multitu
 dinous arbitrary constants can fix the points “where the
 breaks occur" just where he chooses, and so we need not
 wonder that the curve for dºk/dp” can be drawn in such a
 manner “that these breaks agree very closely with those
 shown by his own density-results” (p. 88).
    I
                                   sº.
       will quote in addition a very instructive statement of
 Mr. Crompton’s (Proc. Chem.                  1888, p.127):—“Mr.
 Crompton, replying to Dr. Morley's objection that there did
not seem to be any reason why a limit should be put to the
 differentiation when that had been performed twice, and that
it would be just as reasonable to proceed with a third or
 fourth differentiation and so on, said that a limit to the dif
 ferentiation would necessarily have to be made according to
 the nature of the case under investigation and the discretion
exercised by the investigator.    In the present instance the limit
of differentiation is  clearly indicated by the agreement of the
 results obtained with those   previously arrived at by Mendelejeff
                                       liºn
 by discussing a totally different physical property.”     But now
 that Prof. Mendelejeff’s results are proved to be “erroneous,”
we should perhaps expect that the                       ought to be
 carried a little further.   This, however, is not necessary, as
 most of the physical properties can only be determined with

38         Messrs. Gladstone and Hibbert on the Molecular
such exactness that the second derived function may be repre
sented, within the errors of observation, by a not too small
number of straight lines with practically arbitrary termina
tions. The proof of this is furnished by the fact that Mr.
Pickering has deduced from the specific gravity quite different
hydrates (singular points) from Mendelejeff, and from the
electric conductivity quite different hydrates from Crompton.
     Mr. Pickering  closes as follows: “The conclusion is the
absolute  rejection  of any other than the hydrate theory”
(p. 89). Looked at from the mathematical point of view the
conclusion might well be the “absolute rejection” of the
so-called theory of hydrates, at least in the form defended by
Mr. Pickering.
V.     On the Molecular      Weight of Caoutchouc and other Colloid
     Bodies. By    J.    H. GLADSTONE, Ph.D., F.R.S., and WALTER
     HIBBERT, F.I.C.”
      URING   the last meeting of the British Association at
       Bath, we gave a preliminary account of some attempts
to determine the molecular weights of caoutchouc and a few
other substances by Raoult's method. We have since re
peated most of the experiments and largely extended the
inquiry, and it seems to us that the results have a certain
physical as well as chemical interest.
   It is evident that this method is the only one that offers
much hope of success in dealing with such substances as
caoutchouc, but it is open to question how far the method itself
is to be trusted for giving the correct molecular weight of
compounds of this description.       Our confidence in       how               it,
ever, was strengthened             by
                               the following experiments, made
 on  substances      the same ultimate composition (nGloBIs),
                    of
but    ofknown molecular weight          the gaseous condition.

We also made experiments              one     two closely allied
                                               on         or
bodies containing oxygen.
   The compounds were dissolved                      in
                                           benzene which had                         a
freezing-point      5°25 C., and the experiment was conducted
                   of

           Weight of Caoutchouc and other Colloid Bodies.                  41
    The molecular weight of these known colloids, as determined
by Raoult's method, is very high and confirms the generaliza
tion of Graham.
    Experiments have already been made upon the so-called
carbohydrates by this process by Messrs. H. T. Brown and
G. H. Morris". They found that the sugars had a mole
cular weight agreeing with the received formula, but the
noncrystallizable bodies like soluble starch &c. gave them
results suggestive of specially high molecular weight.
    We may also note that in some recent investigations by
                                                         ...
C. Lüdeking, he found that the addition of colloids to water
makes no practical difference to the boiling-point, and in
every case lowers the vapour-pressure very                             These
results all indicate the same general conclusion.
    Our experiments were extended by making an examination
of solutions of the colloidal hydrates of aluminium and iron.
They were prepared by dialysing solutions of the basic
chlorides, but, as is well known, a small proportion of the
salt must be retained in order to prevent coagulation.                   The
iron solutions contained almost exactly one molecule of
chloride to fifteen molecules of the hydrate. The first
aluminium solution contained one molecule of the chloride to
five or six of the hydrate, the second one of chloride to nearly
ten of the hydrate.

    The figures here given for the molecular weights of the
hydrates are calculated as if the whole depression were due
to the hydrate in solution, but the chloride present must have
exercised a considerable influence, especially in the first
aluminium solution.            If  allowance be made for this, the
molecular     weights   found would be higher than those given in
                 * Chem.  Soc.  Journ. 1888.

the table, and would point to the soluble colloidal hydrates
of iron and aluminium being many multiples of Fe,H,0s,
or Al,H,0s, which would give a molecular weight of only
214 and 157 respectively.           The molecular weights of ferric
and aluminic chlorides, as determined by Raoult's method
(T being 47), are about 114 and 106 respectively.
    All our experiments, therefore, while affording additional
illustrations of the value of Raoult's method, confirm the
belief that the molecule of a colloidal substance is an aggre
gate of a very great number of atoms".

the receivers are   nearly full of water, their balance is such

                     The Electrical Action of   the   Machine.
   An instrument made of only sections I. and IV., with their
rings connected with their receivers, as shown above, will
charge itself; and the difference of potential of the two re
ceivers may be such that sparks ; inch long may occasionally
pass between them, though more usually $ inch is the longest
that can be obtained with a head of water of about 23 feet.
With this arrangement, after every discharge                the potential of
the rings is nearly equalized ; whereas               in the machine with
four sections, I. and IV. keep up the difference of potential
of the rings of II. and        III.
   With respect to the action of the machine, the author,
whilst giving the considerations from which it was constructed,
must leave to the electrician to determine whether they have
anything to do with the true explanation of the phenomena.
The water, at the point where it is divided into drops by the
resistance of the air, is electrified by induction from the rings;
the former being in connexion with the earth through the
unbroken water of the stream, and the action seems similar
to that employed in Sir W. Thomson and Professor Silvanus
Thompson's water-dropping accumulators. That such is the
|.
case appears to follow from the fact that, if the rings are either
         much above or much below the level where the water
  reaks into spray, the machine ceases to work.          When the
rings are at their proper level there is an additional action ;
for the particles that are inductively electrified are split up
into numberless minute particles, some of which are so fine
that they float about in the air and do not fall into the re
ceiver. And it is this breaking up of the water into minute
particles that the author thinks may account in part for the
effect produced ; for when a number of spheres that have been
electrified unite into a mass of less surface, their potential in
the latter state is higher than in the former.
   Another point which the author thinks must be taken into
consideration is the speed with which the particles move
through the ring, as it was only when he experimented with
a fall of some feet instead of inches that he obtained a poten
tial high enough to produce sparks. With a very slow speed
the attraction of the ring is too strong for the water, so that
it at last, as in Sir William Thomson's apparatus, bends
against     it.That the division      the drops into minute spray
                                          of
plays   a part       in
                   the action        of
                                 the machine seems          shownto   be
of bythe fact that  sparks      of
                              the same   length,         in

the water has been divided into finer spray.             At times, even
with half the    delivery   of  water,  the same   length    of spark has
been obtained.
   One experiment the author has made in which the spray
was not obtained by the action of gravity, but by a steam
“atomiser,” as it is called.           The water and steam passed
through a copper wire ring 14" diameter, connected with one
of the receivers of an apparatus made up of sections I. and IV.,
as above.     The nozzle was 3" from the ring and 53" from the
receiver.     Sparks 4" in length were taken freely from the
receiver, which is a better result than has been obtained with
a fall of water of some 23 feet.           What was very observable
in this case was the      very  small amount of water used, a small
teacup-full being passed over in some five or six minutes; and
the author has recorded in his notes that the experiment was
made on a very wet day.

   The electrical surgings obtained while the Hertz oscillator
is working are of just the same character as are noticed when
a Leyden jar is discharging round an extensive circuit; but
whereas from a closed circuit the intensity of the radiation
will vary as the inverse cube of the distance as soon as the
circuit subtends a small angle, the radiation from a linear or
axial oscillator varies in                      its

 concentration of such waves.
    Paraffin was a natural substance to use ; but it is rather
expensive, and has not a very high index. After consider
ing many substances—beeswax, sulphur, &c.—I decided to
try resin, and laid in a stock of that substance. Meanwhile,
to gain experience in casting, and finding that a common
class of pitch could be obtained at an absurdly low price,
I   procured several casks of the commonest pitch also.               I
did not contemplate using this substance at first because
I  feared it would be an imperfect insulator, and there seemed
no use in permitting any dissipation of energy whatever, so
long as one could get perfectly transparent substances.
      n casting a specimen of the pitch, however, it was found
so strongly insulating as nearly to fling off the leaves of a
gold-leaf electroscope it was brought near. It seems, there
fore, an excellent cheap stuff for electrophorus and such like
use, wherever it is not expected to be strictly solid; and it
can hardly help being transparent except to very little waves.
    Meanwhile we had calculated that to receive rays from one
point and convey them to another without aberration, a pair
of plano-hyperbolic lenses were very suitable ; a parallel
beam being transmitted from one lens to the other.                 The
lenses would    naturally  be made    cylindrical,    instead of sphe
rical, to suit the linear form of radiator.

slower than the electric quiverings on, say, a three-inch ball,

   Nothing approaching continuous radiation can be main
tained at this enormous intensity without the expenditure of
great power, a hundred and thirty horse-power if my calcula
tion is right. Under ordinary circumstances of excitation
the intervals of darkness are enormous ; if they could be
dispensed with, some singular effects must occur. To try
and make the radiation more continuous a large induction-coil
excited by an alternating machine of very high frequency,
or by a shrill spring-break, might be tried.      But even if
sparks were made to succeed one another at the rate of 1000
per second, the effect of each would have died out long before
the next one came.     It would be something like plucking a
wooden spring which, after making 3 or 4 vibrations, should
come to rest in about two seconds, and repeating the operation
of plucking regularly once every two days.
            Statement   of Results by Dr. HowARD.
   The apparatus used consisted of (1) an oscillator, or trans
mitter, with exciting coil ; (2) a resonator or receiver, and
(3) two lenses of pitch.    We shall describe these in order.
   The Oscillator or Source of Radiation.—This was made in
two similar halves, each constructed by soldering to one end
of a brass rod, 6 centim. long and ‘95 centim. diameter, a thin
circular copper disk of 4 centim. radius.      To the other end
was soldered a     spherical  brass knob of 1 centim. radius,
highly polished. A small hole was drilled in each rod at a
distance of 1:3 centim. from the knob to allow of the insertion
of connecting wires to the Ruhmkorff coil by which it was
excited. The two disks were cemented to two small wooden
blocks which could be clamped in any position on a vertical
glass rod. By this means the distance between the knobs
could be easily adjusted, and the apparatus could be inclined
when wished.
   The induction-coil was of the usual pattern with hammer
break.    With the current used (supplied by 6 accumulator
cells) it gave a continuous stream of sparks between two
  oints 2-5 centim. apart connected to the secondary terminals.
H.    knobs of the oscillator were usually separated by a space
of from 7 to 1-0 centim. They required cleaning about every
20 minutes owing to burning produced by the spark. This
burning was always greater at one knob than the other;
greatest apparently at the one that mattered least, for if the
primary current was reversed after the oscillator had been
working some time the intensity of     itsradiations immediately
decreased perceptibly.

surfaces turned towards each other, and as nearly as

and remained the same throughout the experiments.                          On
one side of the table close to the edges of the lenses was a
brick wall about 40 centim. thick; and on the other side was
a residue of gangway 54 centim. wide between the lens and a

a striking series of geological facts which demonstrate the much
greater age of the solar system.     A quarter of a century ago Dr.
Croll first pointed out the important  evidence afforded by sub-aerial
denudation as to the   antiquity of the Earth. By that scale and by
other concurrent sources of   testimony  he concludes that the Earth
must have existed in a condition not greatly different from what
now prevails for at least seventy millions of years. That being so,
we are bound to seek a source of vastly greater heat than can be
derived from simple shrinkage of a nebula. Such a source Dr. Croll
finds in his “Impact” theory of solar genesis, and he supports his
theory by many ingenious arguments.           Sir William Thomson
regards it as enormously less probable than the gravitation theory,
on account of the necessary assumption of exact aiming of the col
liding bodies; but the probability of the collision of dark masses is
a question of their numbers, distribution, and of time; and against
the gravitation theory there is the fact that the actual motion
observable in many stars cannot have been derived from that source.
Further, it may be said that the “Impact” theory appears to get
remarkable support from the recent important researches of Dr.
Huggins regarding the constitution of nebulae, the results of which
he communicated to the Royal Society during the past session.

                                  of
Esq., M.A., D.Sc., F.G.S.
      In previous communication the author had contended that
           a

 68                       Geological Society   :—
 many of the schists of the Malvern Hills were of igneous origin.
 Thus, mica-gneiss had been formed from granite, hornblende-gneiss
 from diorite, mica-schist from felsite, and injection-schists from
 veined complexes which had been subjected to compression.           As a
 further instalment towards the elucidation of the genesis of the
 Malvern schists, it was now proposed to discuss the changes which
 the respective minerals of the massive rocks had undergone in the
 process of schist-making.
     The schistosity was usually in zones, striking obliquely across
 the ridge, varying in breadth from a few inches to many yards, and
 separated from each other by very irregular intervals.       Within the
 zones bands of maximum schistosity alternated with seams in
 which the original structure had been less completely obliterated.
 The new structure was connected with a shearing movement, by
 which the rigid mass was often sliced into countless parallel
 laminae or flakes.    In a more advanced stage of alteration, the planes
 of movement were obliterated, and a sound clear gneiss or schist
 was formed. These foliated bands were called “shear-zones.”
    The most important shear-zones were those in which diorite was
 interlaced with granite-vcins.      The following changes were noticed
 in  tracing  the massive rocks into the zones.   The hornblende might
 suffer excessive   corrosion, or it  might  become “reedy” and break
 up along the cleavages into numerous fragments, which were drawn
 away from each other in the direction of foliation, or it might pass
 into chlorite, or chlorite and epidote. The chlorite thus formed
 often passes into biotite, and sometimes the biotite was changed to
 white mica.       Where shearing was excessive, chlorite sometimes
 passed   directly into white mica.
    Soda-lime felspar was altered to epidote or zoisite, and often to
calcite.     A more important result was the production of muscovite
in the   plagioclase.    Much of this felspar was reconstructed in small
clear crystals or granules.      Quartz also was abundantly produced.
 Diorite might thus be converted either into a gneiss with two micas,
or into a gneissoid quartzite.        The granite of the veins- passed
 through the usual changes into muscovite-gneiss.
    Other secondary minerals were actinolite (from augite), sphene
 (from ilmenite), and garnet.
    It was contended that the granite-veins were exogenous, because
they appeared as apophyses from large masses; they had the same
coarse texture in different varieties of diorite, and they produced
contact-effects similar to those of intrusive veins, including the
phenomena of aggregation and enlargement in the minerals of the
encasing rock.
    Foreign minerals were often introduced by infiltration.         Thus,
the hornblende of a diorite was decomposed into chlorite and iron
oxide, which passed for a considerable distance along the shear
planes of an adjacent granite, giving rise to a chlorite-gneiss, and
the chlorite was partially changed to biotite.          Epidote might be
introduced in the same way.
    Both the diorite and the granite of shear-zones tended by loss of
bases to become progressively silicified.     Most of the liberated bases

                 The Northern Slopes of Cader       itri.            69
 could be accounted for.     Analyses showed that there was an inter
 change of alkaline bases, soda going to the granite, and potash to
 the diorite.    Thus, some of the latter contained almost twice as
 much potash as soda.
    The evidence collected seemed to prove that the schist-making
 had taken place subsequently to consolidation;        but it was clear,
 especially where the rock was heavily sheared, that the con
stituents had been redissolved and reconstructed.           Thus, as we
 followed a diorite into the core of a shear-zone, we could see the
gradual disappearance of shear-planes and other mechanical effects,
as well as the progressive results of chemical synthesis.
    The secondary origin of the micas and of part of the felspar was
proved by the fact that they were moulded on decomposition-pro
 ducts, such as chlorite and epidote, and upon fragments of horn
blende crystals, which had been crushed during the shearing, and
carried away from each other. The mineral changes here described
 resulted from contact-action plus mechanical force.
    2. “The Northern Slopes of Cader Idris.”          By Grenville A. J.
Cole, Esq., F.G.S., and A. W. Jennings, Esq., F.L.S.
    From the publication of Mr. Aikin's paper in the Transactions
of the Geological Society in 1829 to the second edition of the Survey
Memoir on North Wales, the relations of the geological and physical
features of Cader Idris have been pointed out in some detail.       The
present paper dealt with the nature of the eruptions that took place
in this area and the characters of their products at successive
stratigraphical   horizons.    The best exposures occur, as is well
 known, upon the northern slopes.
    The lowest evidence of contemporaneous volcanic activity is to be
found at the Penrhyn-gwyn slate-quarry, where a somewhat coarse
bed of tuff, with slate-fragments       and abundant felspar-crystals,
 occurs above an andesitic sheet. Similar slate-tuffs are repeated up
 to the base of the great cliff of Cader Idris, with intervening layers
 of normal clayey sediment.       On the whole, the tuffs and ashes
 become more highly silicated as the upper levels are reached, and
 they terminate on the southern slopes in beds with fragments of
perlitic and devitrified obsidian, such as are found under Craig-y-
Llam. On Mynydd-y-Gader the intrusive dolerites have altered the
ashes into hornstones;      in places, moreover, they have become
jointed into distinct columns.     Fragments of andesitic glass as well
 as  trachyte are recorded.
    The “pisolitic iron-ore” of the Arenig beds appears to have
resulted from the metamorphism of an oolitic limestone, as in the
case of the Cleveland ore described by Mr. Sorby, and that of
 Northampton described by Prof. Judd.            The grains still give
 evidence under crossed nicols of their       having   been built up of
successively deposited concentric      layers.   The calcite so freely
developed in the hollows of the       underlying   rocks may have been
largely derived, during metamorphic action, from the destruction of
 similar thin limestone-seams.       No true lava-flows occur among

70                           Geological Society.
these tuffs and sediments, a fact that implies comparative remoteness
from the volcanic centre; and the important masses of intrusive
matter represented upon the maps are themselves largely composed
of the products of explosive action.  The numerous sheets of ophitic
dolerite, aphanite, and altered andesite, that lie, seemingly inter
bedded, on the northern slopes, were probably intruded when the
associated rocks were already weighed down by much superincum
bent sediment.    A common character of these basic sheets is the
development of small colourless crystals of epidote.
   The most striking mass upon the mountain is the main “felstone”
(eurite) of the wall, which proves to be minutely “granophyric,”
and of very uniform grain throughout.     An analysis by Mr. T. H.
 Holland shows 73 per cent. of silica. This vast intrusive sheet is
regarded as perhaps of no later date than the Llandeilo lavas of
Craig-y-Llam, and as a forerunner of the volcanic conditions that
prevailed in Bala times throughout North Wales.
   The stratigraphical horizons, as shown on published sections,
would throw a great part of the tuffs and ashes described into the
Tremadoc beds, or even lower, in contradiction to the generally
accepted  statement that volcanic activity began in the Arenig times.
While this point can only be settled by detailed mapping on the
basis of the new six-inch survey, the authors incline to the belief
that the eruptions in this area broke out in the Cambrian rather
than the Ordovician period.

surrounding reefs, and the remoter cluster       the Casquets,

Alderney grits, therefore, form part of a series which can be traced
over 30 miles, and which belongs to the Upper Cambrian (of Lap

   Remarks were made on the Jersey conglomerates (Ansted's con

proved), on the resulting evidence that the Jersey rhyolites are not
 Permian, but Cambrian at the latest, on the still earlier age of the
 Guernsey syenites and diorites, and on the antiquity of the
Guernsey gneisses.
   2. “On the Ashprington Wolcanic Series of South Devon.” By
the late Arthur Champernowne, Esq., M.A., F.G.S.
   The author described the general characters of the volcanic rocks
that occupy a considerable area of the country around Ashprington,
near Totnes.   They comprise tuffs and lavas, the latter being some
times amygdaloidal and sometimes flaggy and aphanitic.           The
aphanitic rocks approach in character the porphyritic “schalsteins”
of Nassau.    Some of the rocks are much altered; the felspars are
blurred, as if changing to saussurite, like the felspars in the Lizard
gabbros.    In other cases greenish aphanitic rocks have, by the de
composition of magnetite or ilmenite, become raddled and earthy in
appearance, so as to resemble tuffs. The beds are clearly inter
calated in the Devonian group of rocks, and the term Ashprington
Series is applied to them by the author.     Although this series pro
bably contains some detrital beds, there are no true grits in                                  it.
Stratigraphically  the series appears                       to

“magma”—the former less dense and highly silicated, the latter
basic and rich in magnetic iron-ore. This view was in accordance
with those of Durocher, Prestwich, Fisher, and many other geolo
gists. The composition of this inner magma, and the condition in
which the magnetic iron-ore exists were then discussed, and it was
shown that it probably exists under the form of numerous small
crystals with a polar arrangement.          Each little crystal being itself
a  magnet  and  having    crystallized  out from the magma while this
latter was in a viscous condition, the crystalline grains would
necessarily assume a polar arrangement which would be one of
equilibrium.     Basalt might be taken as the typical rock of this
magma.
   The thickness and depth of the magnetic magma beneath the
surface of the globe were then discussed, and while admitting that
it was impossible to come to any close determination on these points
owing to our ignorance of the relative effects of increasing tempera
ture and pressure, it was assumed tentatively that the outer
surface of the effective magnetic magma might be at an average
depth of about 100 miles, and the thickness about 25 or 30 miles.
The proportion of magnetic iron-ore in basaltic rocks was then
considered, and it was shown that an average of 10 to 15 per cent.
would express these proportions; and assuming similar proportions
to exist in the earth's magnetic magma, we should then have an
effective terrestrial magnet of from 24 to 3 miles in thickness.
The thickness          is,
                    however, probably much greater.

manner in which the phenomena of magnetic intensity, and of the
dip of the needle at different latitudes could be explained on the
hypothesis of an earth's internal magnetic shell, such as here de
scribed, was then pointed out; and the analogy of such a magnetic
shell with a magnetic bar passing through the centre of the earth
was illustrated.
   The author then proceeded to account on geo-dynamical principles
for the secular variation of the magnetic needle, and also to show
how the objections that might be raised to the views here advanced,
on the grounds of the high temperature which must be assumed to
exist at the depth beneath the surface of the magnetic magma,
could be met by considerations of pressure, and on this subject read
a letter which he had received from Sir William Thomson, F.R.S.
   In conclusion, the author stated it was impossible in a short
abstract to go into the details of the subjects here discussed, and
for further information the reader must be referred to the paper
itself.
          NOTES ON METALLIC SPECTRA.                         BY   C.   C.,   HUTCHINS.
   In the work herein described an attempt has been made to deter
mine the wave-length of several metallic lines with something of
the precision with which wave-lengths of solar lines are known and
tabulated.
   It has been repeatedly pointed out that wave-lengths of metallic
lines from the determinations of the best observers are liable to
errors of one part in 3000 or 4000; while Rowland has given us
the position of a long list of solar lines correct to one part in
500,000.      It is too often forgotten that Thalén used a single bisul
phide-of-carbon prism in his researches, and that consequently his
places can in no sense be considered standards of precision for the
more powerful instruments of the present time.
   The spectroscope employed in the present work has a large flat
grating with ruled space 5 by 8 centim.           Upon the margin of this
grating Professor Rowland has written: “Definitions exquisite.”
The collimator and view-telescope are combined in a single lens, an
excellent objective by Wray, 6 inches in diameter, 84 feet focus.
The radius of curvature of the back surface of this lens equals                                    its
focal length,        so

   Results of comparison with Solar Spectrum.—It will be seen by
inspection of the tabulated results that nine out of the eleven lines
of copper are reversed in the sun, and four out of the five of zinc.
The conclusion reached in each of these cases was after repeated
examination, when the conditions were such as to show a clear
space between the components of the E line. The latest available
authority” gives copper among the doubtful elements in a list of
those found in the sun, and on the same list zinc does not appear
at all. The present investigation makes it quite probable that zinc,
and almost completely demonstrates that copper, exists in the solar
atmosphere.—Silliman's    American Journal of Science, June 1889.
 ON    THE INFLUENCE OF SOLAR RADIATION ON THE ELECTRICAL
      PHENOMENA  IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE EARTH.    BY SV.
      ARRHENIUS.
   In earlier researches (Wied. Ann. vol. xxxii. p. 546, and xxxiii.
p. 638) the author has concluded from a series of investigations that
the air, when irradiated by ultra-violet light, conducts like an elec
trolyte. Starting from Peltier's hypothesis of a negative charge of
the earth, the author makes use of this point of view to represent
the electrical phenomena of the atmosphere as consequences of
solar radiation.    The earth's charge, according to the author, is
neither imparted to the molecules of the air as shown by the expe
riments of Nahrwold, nor does the aqueous vapour ascending from
the earth carry electricity with                        it,
                                       for which the experiments                                      of
Kalischer, Magrini, and Blake speak.        The carriers       the elec                     of
tricity    the atmosphere are the solid and liquid particles suspended
          in
in
it     (dust, fog-vesicles); and they obtain their charge from the
earth     by
           conduction, when the air becomes        conductor      conse    a                     in

feeble electrical current     the air.  The author considers that                                     a
proof     of

 It    is
       in   accordance with the assumption            negative charge     of  a                       of

in the morning fog is due to the sun not having as yet acted on
the fog. The author adduces a table of Quetelet, which shows as
the result of many years' observations that the monthly mean of
the strength of atmospheric electricity is the less, the greater is
the monthly mean of the solar radiations measured with the actino
                                 -
meter.
   The author explains in the well-known manner the formation of
the high tensions observed in storms. As the first condition in the
original charge of the drops is the solar radiation, thunderstorms
are in causal connexion with this, and are most frequent in hot
countries in summer, and in the afternoon.      That the maximum
daily occurrence of thunderstorms is somewhat behind that of the
solar radiation is ascribed by the author to the time required for
the charge and for the coalescence of the individual drops. The
other meteorological phenomena which accompany the storms are
considered by the author to be secondary.        The more infrequent
whirlwind storms, which, in contradistinction to the heat-storms,
occur mostly in winter, and at night, and which cannot be explained
on the above principles, were supposed to be brought from more
southern regions.
   The author finds a further support for his theory in the course
of the yearly and of the daily periods of atmospheric electricity.
The yearly period, with         winter maximum and summer mini
                                                its
mum, would directly correspond                             to
                                      the influence mentioned.      The
daily period      more complicated, for
                       is                       exhibits two maxima   it
and two minima.     But this may also       explained,        the influ
                                                                 be                  if   to
ence  ofthe solar radiation the influence be added which must be

            the ascending motion       the negative clouds of   daytime                    at
and the descent     night-time.

XI.  On Achromatic Interference-Bands.   By Lord RAYLEIGH,

  Institution".
                                 Introduction.
       HEN    there is interference of light, the width of the
         resulting bands, measured for example from darkness
to darkness, is usually a function of the colour of the light
employed.     Thus, in the case of Fresnel's well-known inter
ference-experiment, in which light reflected from two slightly
inclined mirrors illuminates a screen, the width of the bands
is proportional to the wave-length of the light. In order that
a considerable number of bands may be visible, it is necessary
that the light be highly homogeneous; otherwise it is impos
sible that the various band-systems can                       fit
                                               one another over the
necessary range.        the light could

lutely homogeneous, there would              limit     be

called the achromatic band.       But the system       bands    not   of               is

   In this experiment the two sources of light which are
regarded as interfering with one another must not be inde
pendent; otherwise there could be no fixed phase-relation.
According to Fresnel’s original arrangement the sources Ol,
O, are virtual images of a single source, obtained by reflexion
in two mirrors. The mirrors may be replaced by a bi-prism.
Or, as in Lloyd's form of the experiment, the second source
may be obtained from the first by reflexion from a mirror
placed at a high degree of obliquity.   The screen upon which
the bands are conceived to be thrown is parallel to OIO, at
distance D.    IfA be the point of the screen equidistant from
Oi, O2, and P a neighbouring point, then approximately

where
                          O10,–b,             AP = u.
Thus, if X be the wave-length, the places where the phases
are accordant are determined by
                                w   = n\D/b,         .         .    .    .    .      .    .   (1)
n being an integer representing the order of the band. The
linear width of the bands (from bright to bright, or from dark
to dark) is thus
                         A = ND/b. . . . . . . . (2)
The degree of homogeneity necessary for the approximate
perfection of the nth band may be found at once from (1) and
(2). For, if du be the change in u corresponding to the
change da, then
                               du/A = n dº/A.                  .    .    .    .     .     .   (3)
Now clearly du must be a small fraction of A, so that dx/A
must be many times smaller than 1/n, if the darkest places
are to be sensibly black.   But the phenomenon will be tole
rably well marked, if the proportional range of wave-length
do not exceed 1/(2n), provided, that                     is,
                                         that the distribution

                                   surfaces.   By this means                                   an

rise to coincident systems          of
                                bands.

 careful consideration. We will suppose in the first place that
 the lights issuing from the various parts of the aperture are
 without permanent phase-relation, as when the slit is backed
 immediately by a flame, or by the incandescent carbon of an
 electric lamp.       Regular interference can then only take place
 between     lights    coming from corresponding parts of the two
 images; and a distinction must be drawn between the two
 ways in which the images may be situated relatively to one
 another.      In Fresnel's experiment, whether carried out with
 mirrors or with bi-prism, the corresponding parts of the
 images are on the same side ; that                 the right          is,

themselves from the mirror, until at last the complete system

        If
         we wish to observe interference under high relative
retardation, we must either limit the light passing the first
slit to be approximately homogeneous, or (after Fizeau and
Foucault) transmit a narrow width of the band-system itself
through a second slit, and subsequently analyse the light into
a spectrum.        In the latter arrangement, which is usually the
more convenient when the original light is white, the bands
seen are of a rather artificial kind.               apart from the hetero   If,

    We have already seen from (3) that in the ordinary arrange
ment, where the source is of white light entering through a
narrow slit, the heterogeneity of the light forbids the visibility
of more than a few bands. The scale of the various band
systems is proportional to A.                But this condition of things,

to render achromatic, and therefore distinct, the first 20 or
30 bands.     As the adjustment improves, a continually larger
number become visible, until at last the whole of the doubly
illuminated field is covered with fine lines.
    In these experiments the light is white, or at least becomes
coloured only towards the outer edge of the field.      By means
of a fine slit in the plane  of the spectrum we may   isolate any
kind of   light, and verify that the band-systems corresponding
to various wave-lengths are truly superposed.
    When the whole spectrum was allowed to pass, the white
and black bands presented so much the appearance of a grating
under the microscope that I was led to attempt to photograph
them, with the view of thus forming a diffraction-grating.
Gelatine plates are too coarse in their texture to be very
                            |.
suitable for this purpose ; but I obtained impressions capable
of giving spectra. Comparison with spectra from standard
gratings showed that the           were at the rate of 1200 to the
inch.    A width of about half an inch (corresponding to
600 lines) was covered, but the definition deteriorated in the
outer half.     A similar deterioration was evident on direct
inspection of the bands, and was due to some imperfection in
the conditions—perhaps to imperfect straightness of the slab.
On one occasion the bands were seen to lose their sharpness
towards the middle of the field, and to recover in the outer
portion.
    With respect to this construction of a grating by photo
graphy of interference-bands, a question may be raised as to
whether we are not virtually copying the lines of the original
grating used to form the spectrum. More may be said in
favour of such a suggestion than may at first appear. For it
would seem that the case would not be essentially altered
if we replaced the real spectrum by a virtual one, abolishing
the focusing lens, and bringing Lloyd's mirror into the
neighbourhood of the grating.        But then the mirror would be
unnecessary, since the symmetrical spectrum upon the other
 side would answer the purpose as well as a reflexion of the
first spectrum.     Indeed, there is no escape from the conclusion
that a grating capable of giving on the two sides similar
spectra of any one order, without spectra of other orders
 or central image, must produce behind                  it,
                                                    without other

 the first.
    Another apparent anomaly may        be noticed.           It

practice that, to reproduce a grating by photography, it is
necessary that the sensitive plate be brought into close contact

advanced, no such limitation would be required.

   In order, then, that a grating may be capable of giving rise
to the ideal system of interference-fringes, and thus impress
itself upon a sensitive plate at any distance behind, the
vibration due to it must be of the form
                           A cos     (pa'      +f)   cos     (kat-u12).                .    .        .    .       (11)
   It does not appear how any actual grating could effect this.
Supposing z=0, we see that the amplitude of the vibration
immediately behind the grating must be a harmonic function
of r, while the phase is independent of        except      regards          ar,                      as

Gratings may act partly                        by

     We can thus hardly regard the interference-bands obtained
from   agrating and Lloyd’s mirror                                as   a   mere reproduction                        of

 90                Lord Rayleigh on Achromatic
 as regards the red and blue rays, the original bands may be
 considered to be already obliterated, but so far as regards the
 central rays, to be still fairly defined.       Under these circum
 stances it is remarkable that so little colour should be apparent
 on direct inspection of the bands.       It would seem that the eye
 is but little sensitive to colours thus presented, perhaps on
 account of its own want of achromatism.
    It is interesting to observe the effect of coloured glasses
 upon the distinctness of the bands.        If the achromatism be in
 the green, a red or orange glass, so far from acting as an aid
 to distinctness, obliterates all the bands after the first few. On
 the other hand, a green glass, absorbing rays for which the
 bands are already confused, confers additional sharpness. With
the aid of a red glass a large number of bands are seen
 distinctly, if the adjustment be made for this part of the
spectrum.
    A still better procedure is to isolate a limited part of the
spectrum by interposed screens.             For this purpose a real
spectrum must be formed, as in the case of the grating above
considered.
    We will now inquire to what degree of approximation
A/b may be made independent of A with the aid of a prism,
taking Cauchy's law of dispersion as a basis. According to it
the value of b for any ray may be regarded as made up of two
parts—one constant, and one varying inversely as X*. We
therefore write
                       X.        X3

XII.     Note on some Photographs                of Lightning and of “Black”
              Electric Sparks.          By A. W. CLAYDEN".
     URING     the thunderstorm on the night of June 6       ex                I
                                       ii.
       posed several plates in the hope of securing photographs
of lightning. Three of these gave results.
   One was exposed to two
not cross the     }.                  not counting such as did
                    of view. These two flashes show compli
cated and beautiful structure. One of them is a multiple flash,
distinctly seen as double by both my wife and myself. An
enlargement of this shows curious flame-like appendages
pointing upwards from every angle. The other flash is a
broad ribbon.     The images of the masonry in the left-hand
corner (which are necessarily slightly out of focus) show
three positions of the camera.        They are sharp, hence the
                                                                              ".
camera did not move     during   the existence of a flash ; and the
directions of those movements which did occur do not in an
way correspond to the movements (if such there were)
would have been required to produce the ribbon-like effect    -
from a linear flash.
   A second plate shows four flashes, and the camera moved
much more than in the first case.       None of these flashes are
ribbons.    Development    showed the plate to be overexposed.
   The third was     exposed   to six flashes ; that is to say,                     I
judged that six of them crossed the field of view. There
were many others between times, which were either in the
clouds or occurred in other parts of the sky.          One flash,                   I
remarked at the time, must be “right down the middle of the
plate.”     Development showed this plate to be very much
overexposed, and the image required careful nursing.             was           I
              |
much surprised to see nothing but one triple flash in the
COrner.      supposed that         I
                               must have mistaken the plate, and
was about to throw it     away,    but on carefully searching for
the above-mentioned vertical flash, I found             image was its
reversed, printing      as
                        a  black flash with    white core.
                                                        a       Sub
sequent observation showed other dark flashes; and the enlarge
ment      part
         of       the plate shows that there are indications
                  of                                                                of
white cores to each of them.
   Now the connexion between this reversal and overexposure
was very striking.     Hence      occurred
                                       it       me that the black
                                                        to
flashes  might     be
                    due      to

                               the individual flashes, but rather
to  the excessive action produced                 by

       Photographs of Lightning and                        “Black” Electric Sparks.                         93
  glare from an illuminated white cloud upon the normal image
   of the flash.
                           I
      To test this endeavoured to obtain the same effect with
  the sparks from a small Wimshurst machine ; but, under the
  conditions in which                 I
                                worked, I could not get a longer spark
  than one inch.
      I  first photographed a series of brilliant sparks, using two
  large Leyden jars. These gave normal images, very dense,
                      of off
  and shaded                   at
                           the margins, although the focus,                                       as
                                                                         shown
  by   the knobs       the machine, was good.
     Next tried less brilliant sparks from the machine with
            I                                                                                               its
  ordinary small jars. These gave similar images, but less dense.
     Then   I  repeated both experiments, and before developing
  the   plates exposed    them       the diffused light from
                                           to                        gas-flame.         a

  normal core. The fainter sparks were completely reversed.
     One plate       bright sparks was exposed
                      of                                    the gas-light,    to                            so
 that different     parts   were acted   upon    for different times. The
 reversal seems          spread inwards
                           to                    the exposureas        diffused              to

     One plate         faint sparks was only half
                      of                                           exposed        of   it                   to

 XIII.      Expansion with Rise of Temperature              of Wires under

            probably well known to the members of the Physical
                   that, at the instance of the British Association
 and with the assistance of a money grant from that body,
 very interesting secular experiments on the elasticity and
 ductility of wires were commenced some years ago in
  Glasgow.        In the tower of the Glasgow University buildings
  certain wires are hung in pairs for comparison.               One of each
  pair carries a heavy load about half the breaking weight of
  the wire; the other carries about one tenth of the breaking
  weight.      Certain marks are put on the wires; and the object
  of the experiment is to find whether the heavily loaded wire
  seems, on comparison with the lightly loaded wire, to go on
  running down incessantly, or whether it comes asymptotically
  to a fixed length for a given temperature, ceasing to ex
  perience further permanent elongation.
      The observations of the last few years show that the
  elongation due to further pulling out has, to say the least,
  become exceedingly small, so small that it is extremely
  difficult to observe it; and at the Aberdeen meeting of the
  British Association        I  pointed out that a great difficulty is
  introduced into the making of deductions from these observa
  one. The experiments point to the conclusion that diffused light acting
  upon a plate can reverse previously impressed images of electric sparks,
  but is powerless to affect any such impressions which may be made after
  wards.     Similar results are obtained whether the source of the diffused
  light is a gas-flame, a lamp, or a series of sparks.    I  do not at present
  offer any theoretical explanation of these facts, but they are in themselves
  sufficient from a meteorological point of view.   “I)ark" flashes of light
  ning have no existence in nature, but are caused by the exposure of the
  plate to an illuminated sky after the passage of the flash. This illumi
  nation may be due to subsequent flashes, the more recent of which will
  give normal images possibly crossing the reversed ones.

but not to the same extent; and neither came back to its
original length. This was of course to be expected. But
it turned out, on repeating the heating and cooling, that the
same    thing occurred again and again ; and it was not till
after about 150 heatings and coolings that the heavily loaded
wire assumed a permanent state, expanding and contracting
by equal amounts with the heating and cooling".                 The lightly
loaded wire took                     its

1888–9 respectively.   Without their patient labour the work would have
been impossible          to   me.

           Temperature          of Wires under Pulling Stress.                    97
to the table, rests in the W. A third foot, rounded, rests on
the other platform, which is plane and polished. On the top
of this little table, which is a square of about 1% centimetre
in the side, there is fastened a perfectly plane parallel Stein
heil mirror; and a telescope with cross wires, looking down
very nearly vertically on the mirror, views, reflected in the
mirror, a half-millimetre scale suitably placed.
    It will be seen at once that if the two wires were to elon
gate equally with rise of temperature, their extremities would
 go down together and almost the only effect (not absolutely
of course) on the scale-reading would be to alter somewhat
the focus.        But if one wire elongates more than the other the
mirror is tilted, and the change in the scale-reading readily
gives the amount of relative displacement of the ends of
the wire.
    The arrangement works in the most satisfactory way, and
 it now only remains for me to state the results.                     must
 remark, however, that it was exceedingly difficult to make an
 exact estimate of the temperature of the tube, even when the
 steam was running strongly through                          it.

XIV. A       Determination        ofthe Value of the B.A. Unit of
     Resistance in Absolute      Measure, by the Method of Lorenz.

     work      was done at the Physical Laboratory of Johns
                University during the spring of 1888. Lord
Rayleigh's modification of Lorenz's original method was used.
In this, as is well known, a measured part of the current
flowing through the inducing coils is balanced by the current
induced by the rotation of the disk.
   The apparatus employed is that designed by Prof. Rowland
for his determination of the ohm undertaken for the United
States Government.    A detailed description of it is contained
in his forthcoming report, so only a few words will be given
to it here. The induction-coils, four in number, were wound
in square channels cut in heavy flanges, which were cast on
the exterior of a hollow brass cylinder open at both ends.
The coils were respectively 30-171, 9:786, 10:545, and 30.775
                                  "...
centim. from the mean plane of the disk, itself placed as
nearly as possible midway           the ends.  The cylinder is
about 66 centim. long, 100 centim. in diameter, and 1 centim.
thick. It is thus the longest ever used in work of this kind.
The flanges and cylinder were cast in one piece, and the
tooling was      all
                 done without removing the casting from the
lathe.    The walls       the channels were left very thick

                                                   the coils.  The

adjoining   room, about 10 metres from the disk. The speed
obtained varied from 26 to 47 revolutions per second, higher
than has usually been used.
   The current was taken from the edge of the disk by three
brushes which bore on it at angular distances of 120° ; each
brush was made of three or four brass strips of different lengths
soldered   together at one end ; each strip in every brush
touched the disk, one brush occupying a length of 2 centim.
or more on the edge. The strips were made of various
lengths in order to avoid systematic vibrations.                   For the
contact at the centre, a conical counterboring was made in
one end of the axle and a brass point was pressed into it con
stantly by a stiff spring.      The counterboring in the axle, the
point, the brushes, and the edge of the disk were                 carefully       all
amalgamated before each observation                particular care was

galvanometer showed the abrupt changes. The spot                       light             of
of  the  galvanometer      was   usually   very  steady,   showing      that
there were       sudden changes. Every hundredth revolution

times; it is kept in the same direction for one minute at a
time, and five galvanometer-readings at equal intervals of
time are taken each minute : this gives, then, twenty-five
galvanometer-readings and occupies five minutes. The set B
is begun as quickly as possible after A. The chronograph
record is started by dropping the pen on the revolving drum
only a few seconds before the first galvanometer-reading, and
an effort is made to use that portion of the record beginning
exactly with the readings; the record is stopped at the instant
of the last reading by lifting the pen. Temperature-readings
are taken before, after, and often during the set. The resist
ance carrying the main current is constantly stirred, and the
others frequently.    After A<U+017F> the temperature of the cylinder
and disk is noted.
   Variety was given to the different experiments by using
different pairs of induction-coils, inner or outer, and by vary
ing the speed and direction of rotation. Sometimes, too, an
experiment was repeated with everything the same, except
that the resistance c would be made up of different coils.

as used by Prof. Rowland are:—

turned off in order to smooth the edge; the diameter was
measured by two observers, and was found to be

terrupted by divers accidents and never completed ; in
No. 19 there is confusion in the notes, making the sign of
the deflexion doubtful ; Nos. 21, 23, and 24 give values of
p from 2 per cent. to 10 per cent. out, due to some error in
the record of resistances used.      This accounts for all the
experiments begun.

                Intermittent Lightning-Flashes.                     107
with whom    I have     since spoken have informed me that they
had observed a similar effect, and that in some instances
flashes, following as nearly as could be seen in the same path,
were separated by an appreciable interval, often of several
seconds duration.        Photographs of lightning have frequently
been obtained showing banded, ribbon, or double flashes;
but, so far as I am aware, these have not been of so decided
a nature as to remove doubts whether the appearances could
not be ascribed to the effects of halation by reflexion from
the back of the negative, or to blurring from the photograph
having been taken through the glass of a window, or to some
other similar cause.        I was therefore anxious to obtain some
decisive evidence of the repetition of the flashes, and as my
friend Mr. G.   J.   Snelus was at my suggestion attempting to
obtain some photographs of the lightning,         Ijoined him, and
he   kindly  placed  his camera and some    plates at my disposal.
    The rain having ceased for the moment,            I
                                                     was able to go
 out on to a balcony and thus get a good view of the storm,
 which had now approached quite close and seemed to surround
 us. The camera was held in the hand and pointed towards
 the north-east, where, about half a mile away, numerous
 brilliant flashes were occurring.      The cap of the camera was
 taken off, and then the camera was moved in a horizontal
 plane about the lens as a centre at the rate of about once to
 and fro in three quarters of a second, until a flash was observed
 in the direction in which it was pointed, when the cap was
 at once replaced. The duration of the exposure of the plate
 was about half a minute.        The camera was of quarter-plate
 size, the plates were Ilford rapid, and the lens, which was a
 rapid rectilinear, was used with full aperture (1/8).
   I   hoped, by having the camera moving, to be able to separate
 the successive components of the flashes, and in this          Iwas
 fortunately successful. In fig. 1 (Pl. IV.) is a reproduction of
        º
 one of the photographs obtained, and on it can be seen two
 triple flashes (I., II., III., and IV., W., W.I.), and one double
 flash (VII. and VIII.).
    During the interval that the plate was exposed the illumina
 tion of the sky from flashes out of the line of view, or behind
 clouds, produced the glare seen in the centre and upper part
 of the
                 ..
                     h, and some faint flashes which were noticed
 were probably         cause of the streaks seen in fig. 2 at 0, p,
 and r.
    A careful examination of the photograph reveals man.
 interesting features. The three successive flashes         II.,
                                                          I.,       III.
 are identical in   form.  If   the negative be  placed over    print
                                                                a
 so   that either    of the three lines on   the  negative lies over

   either of those on the print, the coincidence is seen to be
   exact even to the smallest irregularities.

                                                         Nevertheless, of all
   the branch-flashes which                 out from I. only a small trace
   exists at n in   II., and none whatever in               Sweeping across  III.
   the  photograph     and    connecting     corresponding      points in the
   successive flashes are streaks of light, showing that a very
   considerable residual illumination remains between the dis
                                                  i.
  charges. These streaks are especially well marked between the
  components of the double                 VII., VIII., and are also very
   bright along the path of the head of flash I. They are not
   always present; for in another photograph obtained upon a
   moving plate by Mr. Snelus, in which a flash is reduplicated,
   there is no trace of them, the flashes being quite sharp and
  distinct.    The streaks commence abruptly with one discharge
  and end     abruptly   with another. Their extension to the left
  of I. was probably due to the camera not having quite reached
  the end of         its
                     swing.       Where they are brightest there                                             is     in
 all   cases a  swelling        the part

 V.    and VI.      Dark flashes are frequently met with               photo                          in
  graphs         lightning, and have been usually ascribed

  this explanation applies            the present case, both          account                       on
 of    the appearance which the dark flash presents, and also

XVI.        On the Reflecion and Refraction of Light at the Surface

IN his
   theory     of a Quasi-labile Æther, in the Philosophical
Magazine for March 1889, Prof. Willard Gibbs has shown
that the conditions to be satisfied at the common surface of
two media, whether crystalline or not, are the same for the
Electromagnetic Theory of Light and for the new Labile
AEther theory of Sir William Thomson.      The formulae which
                                                                                                 .
give the intensities and azimuths of the planes of polarization
for the new theory may therefore be deduced from those
for the electromagnetic theory; they may, however, be
obtained in a fairly simple manner from the new theory itself,
and it seems desirable to have them expressed             so to
bring out more clearly the connexion between the two
theoriesf.
   The pressural wave in the new theory disappears from the
equations of motion within the medium ; it has, however,                                                         its

of equality of normal displacement and of surface traction
parallel to Oz cannot be satisfied without some surface action.
The elimination of the terms expressing this surface-action
from these two equations of condition gives us our equation
(16). On the Electric theory, if we suppose a surface dis
tribution of variable density possible, terms would come into
the two surface conditions already mentioned, depending
on this distribution ; we should thus have two equations
corresponding to our (4) and (7), and the elimination of
the surface-density from these would give us an equation
equivalent to (16).

}.n
       by means of these the accuracy of the inferences drawn.
    fact, the theory was proved by the experiments which will
now be described ; and it will be found that these few expe
riments suffice to confirm in the highest degree the view of
Messrs. Heaviside and Poynting.         Analogous experiments,
with similar   results, but with quite different apparatus, have
already been made by Dr. O.                              J.

interest of the theory of lightning-conductors.      Up to what
point the conclusions are just which were drawn by Dr. Lodge
in this direction from his experiments, must depend in the first
place on the velocity with which the alterations of the elec
trical conditions really follow each other in the case of
lightning.
    The apparatus and methods which are here mentioned are
those which            I
                     have described in full in previous memoirs f.
The waves used were such as had in wires a distance of nearly
3 metres between the nodes.
    1.    If a primary conductor acts through space, upon a
secondary conductor, it cannot be doubted that the effect
penetrates the latter from without.             For it can be regarded as
established that the effect is        propagated   in space from point to
   oint, therefore it will be forced to meet first of               the outer               all

126     On the Propagation of Electric Wares through Wires.
moving away from this position towards 8, sparks appeared,
became very brilliant at a distance of 1.5 metre from 2, then
decreased again in intensity, they almost entirely vanished at
3 metres distance from 2, and increased again until the end
9f the tube was reached. We thus find our theory borne out
  y fact. That we obtain a node at the closed end is clear, for
at the metallic contact between the central wire and the sur
face of the tube the electric force between the two must
necessarily vanish. It is different when we cut the central
conductor at this point just near the end, and insert a gap of
several centimetres length.       In this case the wave will be
reflected in a phase  opposite   to that of the previous case, and
we should   expect a ventral   segment  at a. As a matter of fact
we find brilliant sparks in the resonator in this case; and they
rapidly decrease in strength if we move from a towards 8,
they almost entirely vanish at a distance of 1.5 metre, and
become brilliant again at a distance of 3 metres; moreover
they give a second well-marked node at 4-5 metres distance,
that is 0.5 metre from the open end. The nodes and loops
which we have described are situated at fixed distances from
the closed end, and alter only with this distance ; they are,
however, quite independent of the occurrences outside the
tube, for example, of the nodes and loops formed there.        The
phenomena occur in exactly the same way if we allow the
wave to travel through the apparatus in the direction from
the open to the closed end ; their interest                is,
                                                  however, smaller,
 since the mode of transmission of the wave deviates from that
 usually conceived, less            in
                            this case than             in

just been under our consideration.           both ends

are left open with the central wire undivided, and stationary
waves    with nodes and loops are now set                        up

system, there       always found, for every node outside the tube,
                     is
a corresponding node          the interior; which proves that the
                                in
propagation takes place inside and outside with,              any rate     at

and non-conductors should, on this theory, have their names
interchanged.     However, such a paradox only arises because
one does not   specify the kind of conduction or non-conduction
considered.    Undoubtedly metals are non-conductors of elec
tric force, and just for this reason they compel it under certain
circumstances to remain concentrated instead of becoming
dissipated, and thus they become conductors of the apparent
source of these forces, electricity, to which the usual termi
nology has reference.

consists of a frame made of wood. This is divided into two

compartments.        One of these has, above, a slit half an inch
wide that runs from end to end; in this slit a slide moves to

   A slide of a similar kind moves in a slit in the lower part of
the framework; this can be fixed by binding-screws in any
position.     Pulleys are fixed at the ends of this compartment.
   Slips of wood run from end to end at the sides and carry
riding-slides.     These slides have binding-screws and pulleys

 weights.
    #.    octahedron of the second dimetric system, or pyramidal
 system, is produced by increasing the weights above and below.
          .."
    The octahedron of the third system may be easily formed
 by increasing a pair of the horizontal weights.
    The              figures may be easily formed by leaving out
 the diagonals and running the cords from the rings at one
 extremity of the rhombuses through two rings, and then
 through the opposite ring, to be there fixed to a weight.
 The tension-weights, as shown in the figure, will then corre
 spond to the apices of the rhombuses.
    For the oblique systems further changes are necessary.
 The upper slide is moved to the right and the lower to the
 left, or vice versä. . This is attended with elongation of the
vertical axes, and the cords passing through the pulleys above
and below and at the ends are increased, and the slack below
is pulled in to a less extent. The other sides of the octahedron
are less affected.
    In the first place, the lateral rider-slides are allowed to
remain in a position such that the line joining them is per
pendicular to the central vertical longitudinal plane. This
gives the Monoclinic System.
    Secondly, the rider-slides are moved one to the right, the
other to the left, and in this way the Anorthic or Triclinic
System is produced.
    In each case it is desirable to have the slack for each
rhombus at different angles of the octahedron.
    All the possible varieties of the fifth system cannot be pro
duced in this way. . So it is necessary to arrange for the
elevation and depression to the rider-slides in extreme cases.
This is accomplished by means of a large ring which carries
a pulley.
    I  have chosen the octahedron as the simplest figure.
    The cube is formed by the introduction of two horizontal
hoops, one above and one below the level of the horizontal
bars. These by a simple mechanism are made movable; and
if eight pulleys be fixed opposite the eight edges of the octahe
dron, and the edges of the octahedron be drawn out by rings
running on these cords, it will be necessary, then, only to
run cords through rings above and below, and to relax the
horizontal and apical weights in order to produce the cube.
    The modifications caused by truncating or bevelling the
edges or faces can be produced by increasing the number of
the hoops or rings.     For the simplest figures, however, vertical
hoops answer best.      The sliding-rings that are carried by the

cords may with their transverse cords be lowered to the level
of the bar again, and the octahedron again produced.
   The cube and the
and prismatic systems may be easily constructed by running
the cords as follows:—
   Take the cube as

130          Prof. R. J. Anderson   on an Apparatus
kept there by means of      a  small weight. The ratio of the
vertical to the horizontal axes may be easily altered by means
of the weights. The approximation of the lateral pulley gives
rise to the octahedron. The number of the sides may be
increased by increasing the cords and pulleys.
    In order to show other figures two hoops are fitted to the
framework, above and below. The cords of the pyramids
are hooked out, and the cords connected with the hooks
pass over pulleys and are attached to weights.           A cord is
made to go through the rings (hook-rings) above and below.
 By running down the rings and unhooking the weights above
and below, the hexagonal prism is produced.
                                                          º:
    Prisms with more sides can be produced by increasing the
 number of the cords, which correspond to the edges.           The
pyramids surmounting the prism are produced by
 out the cords at the extremities of the prism.      Figures wit
 fewer sides are  produced    by causing the pulleys  to approach.
Forms the result of    bevelling and truncation are   produced  by
 pulling out the cords of the terminal pyramids and running
 other cords through the rings.      The original double six-sided
 prisms are produced by causing the hoops to approach one
 another.
    The ikosahedron is produced by forming the five-faced
 equilateral pyramid above and below, and approaching the
 hoops towards one another, so that the distance between the
 hoops is equal to the perpendicular of one of the triangles.
 Then it is only necessary to rotate the lower hoop though 36°,
 and to connect the obtuse angles of the rhombus.          In this
 way the figure can be produced.
    The relations of the hexagonal to the rhombohedral division
 of the sixth system may be shown in this way. Take the
 double pyramid, hook up each alternate horizontal angle, and
 hook down the others. Adjust suitably the superior and         in
 ferior angles, and the rhombohedron is produced. The cords
 in reality follow the course of the lines in the glass models.
     This method is very interesting in this way, that by a little
 dodging the rhombohedron can be converted into the cube,
 so that the relations between the sixth and other systems are
 rendered more distinctly apparent.
                                       <U+017F>º
    The rhombohedron may be easily changed into the hexa
 hedron by unhooking the weights and pulling in the cord.
 The hoops are shown in the lower part of fig. 3, Pl. II., with
 the rhombohedron attached. The                   prism is figured
 separately for the sake of distinctness.    "
    The ikosahedron may be produced by hooking up and
 down the horizontal cords of the decahedral pyramids.           If

                    Illustrating Crystal Forms.                 131
we begin with the double octahedral pyramids, the rhombic
dodecahedron can be easily produced by hooking up the cor
responding alternate edges above and below, and running cords
through the hooks looped up and those rings still stationary.
    In order to show the effects of uniting and separating forces
the form shown at fig. 2 is useful. The instrument consists of
a frame in which hoops revolve, some on vertical and others
on horizontal axes.      The hoops carry sliding-pulleys as shown
on the   plate.   The cube is easily constructed by running cords
over   eight  pulleys fixed on two rings revolving on a vertical
axis.     Cords are carried through small rings above and
below (fig. 2, a' by c' d'e'
                going
                            f   g’ h").
    Without           into details, it will be easily seen that one
orthogonal hexahedron can be easily changed into another,
and into the corresponding octahedron. The octahedron of
the first system, a b c def, if constructed by running cord
over the pulley B, and the pulley attached to the same ring
below, may be changed into the octahedron of the dimetric
or trimetric system, or of either of the oblique. The latter is
accomplished by causing the hoop to revolve, and for the
 triclinic the vertical hoops come into action. Adjustment
 of the weights leads to an alteration in the axes, and the
 relations of the weights for a special form may be studied.
    It is evident that the dodecahedron and trapezohedron may
 be produced in this instrument as in the first, and that the
 forms due to truncating or bevelling of the sides are obtained
very readily.
    The following are the advantages of the apparatus:—First,
it shows clearly the effect of changes of force in producing
changes of form. The weights can be approximated or sepa
rated, and thus the relations of allied forms may be studied.
The number of weights may be increased, and the change of
form by grouping may in this way be well shown.
        we take an india-rubber tissue ball inflated with air as
an example of an infinite number of forces acting from a
centre, and a piece of stretched cord with a weight attached
as the other extreme limit, many of the intermediate conditions
where strings are made to form the edges of figures may be
easily understood from the arrangements        I  have described.
    It is true that such methods as are here suggested are open
to the objection that mathematical principles of a very im
portant kind are involved.      I   think the same objection may
be made to       any  mechanical contrivance; but so far from
getting rid of a difficulty without explaining     it,

  XX.      On the Use   of the Biquartz in determining the position
         of the Plane of Polarization.       By A. W. WARD".
            biquartz   has been so often used, especially on the
THEContinent,         by investigators on the rotation of the plane
of polarization of light, and with such extremely varying
degrees of accuracy, that it seems of interest to account for
these results mathematically.          Werdet and H. Becquerel ob
tained results which varied       by  less than 4'; while Wertheim,

                                        showing,    the light was circu
larly polarized.       Verdet’s and Becquerel's accurate results
were obtained when rotation was looked for in liquids and
isotropic substances; and the inaccurate results of Wertheim
&c. were obtained when seeking for a rotation in doubly
refracting substances.        In the former case the light remained
plane-polarized, in the latter it became elliptically-polarized,
and the position of the plane of polarization was really that of
one of the axes of the ellipse.         In the present investigation
 we shall then determine with what degree of accuracy the
 biquartz can be used to determine the position of the axes in
 elliptically-polarized light.

light of that colour is circularly-polarized. Hence, however we
alter 6, no change in the intensity of that light will take place.
If this circularly-polarized light comes from a prominent part
of the spectrum,    it will be impossible to note small change in
the tint of    passage   due to the varying presence of other
colours. The difficulty experienced will be precisely similar
to that of fixing the position of the plane of polarization by
means of the yellow tint of passage instead of the violet tint.
  If S is  never so great as #. then, when both halves of the
biquartz are of the same uniform tint, the position of the ana
lyser determines the position of the ellipse; but the uniform
tint will not be that due to excluding the yellow light of the
spectrum, but will contain lights of every colour, but not in
that proportion which constitutes white light. The tint may
be rosy or yellow.

      1. “Notes on the Hornblende Schists and Banded Crystalline
 Rocks of the Lizard.” By Major-Gen. C. A. M'Mahon, F.G.S.
   The Lizard district has been visited by the author on three occa
sions during the years 1887–8–9, and the specimens of the rocks
collected were subjected to microscopic examination.     After sum
marizing the work of previous writers, the author proceeded to
consider the hornblende schists.      He described these rocks and
gave a table showing their constituent minerals.      He noted the
absence of quartz, the presence of pyroxene, and the fact that the
minerals present are those commonly met with in volcanic rocks
either as original minerals or as secondary products, and he con
siders that the microscopic study of the schists confirms the
opinion of some previous writers that the schists had a volcanic
origin and consisted principally of ash-beds.   The absence of free
quartz militates strongly against the supposition that they were
originally sedimentary rocks of an ordinary character, whilst
the fact of their being bedded shows that they are not plutonic.
The author has found no evidence that the foliation of these rocks
is due to dynamic deformation, and gives reasons for supposing that
such was not the case.   The rock seems to have been originally
homogeneous, and           its
                       banding produced      later stage   the       at   a                   by

 140                      Geological Society:—
their mineralogical contents the dark bands consist of diorite and
the white bands of granite.
    The author considers that portions of this group consist, like the
hornblende schists, of converted ash-beds, but that other portions
are composed of intrusive diorites of later date, the quasi-bedded
appearance of both being due to the injection of granite.            He
pointed out that the quasi-banding is very irregular in its cha
racter, that the bands inosculate, bifurcate, and entangle them
selves in complicated meshes inconsistent with the idea of regular
banding, and that they are deflected by the blocks of serpentine
imbedded in the dioritic portions of the granulitic rocks as well
as by the porphyritic crystals of felspar contained in the latter.    In
certain places, as on the foreshore at Kennack Cove, the intrusive
character of the granitic veins is undoubted, as they cut through
 the diorite in all directions, but they graduate into bands of normal
character.       The author considers that the process of injection
was aided by the plasticity of the “granulitic " beds induced
by the neighbourhood of igneous masses; also in the case of sub
marine ash-beds by the planes of sedimentation, and in the case of
intruded sheets of diorite by the foliation parallel to the bedding,
the intrusion of the granite being subsequent to that of the diorite.
   At Pen Woose a foliated granite, the author pointed out, occurs in
association with a non-foliated gabbro and diorite, a fact indicating
in his opinion that the foliation of the granite was produced before
its perfect consolidation.    The granite was the last to appear in the
order of time, and had the foliation of the granite been produced by
pressure after cooling, the gabbro and diorite would also have been
foliated.
   2. “The Upper Jurassic Clays of Lincolnshire.”           By Thomas
Roberts, Esq., M.A., F.G.S.
   In Lincolnshire it has generally been considered that the Oxford
and Kimeridge Clays come in direct sequence, and that the Corallian
group of rocks is not represented. The author, however, endeavoured
to show that there is between the Oxford and Kimeridge a zone of
clay which is of Corallian age.
    Six palaeontological zones were recognized in the Oxford Clay.
The clays which come between the Oxford and Upper Kimeridge
the author divided into the following zones:—
    (1) Black selenitiferous clays.
    (2) Dark clays crowded with Ostrea deltoidea.
    (3) Clays with Ammonites alternans; and (4) clays in which this
          fossil is absent.
    The black selenitiferous Clays (1) are regarded as Corallian,
because
    (a) They come between the Oxford Clay and the basement bed
          of the Kimeridge.
    (b) Out of the 23 species of fossils collected from this zone 22 are
          Corallian.

                 Origin of Morements in the Earth's Crust.                                    141
   (c) Ostrea deltoidea and Gryphaea dilatata occur together in
        these clays, and also in the Corallian, but in no other forma
        tion.
   The zones 2, 3, and 4 are of Lower Kimeridge Clay age. The
lowest zone (2) is very persistent in character, and is met with in
Yorkshire, Cambridgeshire, Oxfordshire, and the south of England.
The remaining zones (3 and 4) are local in their development.
  3.   “Origin of Movements in the Earth's Crust.”                                By James R.
Kilroe, Esq.
  The author is convinced that           a very important factor has been
omitted from the usual         explanation     offered in accounting for the
vast movements which have obtained in the Earth's crust.                       His
acknowledgments are due to Mr. Fisher for the extensive use
made of his valuable work.          He also refers frequently to the views
and   publications    of other writers on terrestrial physics. From a
somewhat      conflicting   mass of figures he concludes that about 20
miles would remain to represent the amount of radial contraction
due to cooling during the period from Archaean                 to Recent times,
corresponding to a circumferential contraction of 120 miles. This
will have to be distributed over widely separate periods, at each of
which there is abundant evidence of lateral compression.
   But he considers that this shrinkage alone will not account for
all  the plication             or

                                         Part    I.
   The author in this, the first part of his paper, described the
Westleton beds of the East Anglian coast.                 He commenced with a
review of the work of previous writers, especially Messrs. Wood and
Harmer, and themembers of H.M. Geological Survey, including Messrs.
H. B. Woodward, Whitaker, and Clement Reid. In discussing this
work, particular attention was paid to the Bure-valley beds, which
were considered as a local fossiliferous condition of the Pebbly Sands;
but the term is not so applicable to these sands as that of the
“Westleton and Mundesley Beds,” which the author proposed in
1881.
    The Westleton        beds    were carefully      described, as seen in coast
sections in East Anglia, proceeding from south to north,                     and the
following classification was adopted:—
                         1. Laminated      clays, sand, and shingle with plant-re

    The Westleton         beds     were found to rest with discordance on
 various underlying beds; in places on the Forest series, elsewhere
 on the Chillesford Clay, whilst occasionally the latter had been

               Tachylyte from Victoria Park, Whiteinch.                                             143
partly   or entirely eroded before the deposition of the Westleton
beds.    In the north, where the present series dies out, they come
in contact with the so-called Weybourn Crag, which the author
supposed to be the equivalent of the Norwich Crag.             A similar
discordance has been noted between the Westleton beds and the
overlying glacial beds, so that the former mark a distinct period,
characterized by a definite fauna, and by particular physical con
ditions.    The Westleton beds being marine, and the Mundesley
beds estuarine and freshwater, the author proposed to use the
double term to indicate the two facies, as has been done in the case
 of other deposits.   But these facies were found to be local, and the
 most  persistent feature of the beds is the presence of a shingle of
precisely the same character over a very wide area.          By means of
 this the Westleton beds can be identified far      beyond   East Anglia,
and where there is no fossil      evidence, and  they  throw considerable
light on important physiographical changes.
   The author described the composition of the shingle, which,
unlike the glacial deposits, contained pebbles of southern origin.
    The paper concluded with a list of fossils, excluding those of the
Forest-bed (the stumps of which, the author considered, were
frequently in the position of growth).           Should the Forest-bed
eventually prove to be newer than the Chillesford beds, it was
 maintained that the former must be included in the Westleton
series, and its flora and fauna added to the list, whilst             the               if,    on
 contrary, the Forest-bed should          proved synchronous with the

   ON   THE KINETICS OF BODIES IN SOLUTION.                  BY W. NERNST.
    INCE Want'Hoff disclosed           the great analogy of the constitution
       of dissolved bodies in dilute solution with the gaseous state, it
becomes possible, as the author shows, to explain diffusion on purely
mechanical principles.        The most essential difference from gaseous
diffusion lies in the much smaller velocity of diffusion of solutions,
which justifies the inference that the solvent offers an enormous
resistance to the moving molecules.
    The author investigates in the first place the diffusion of non
electrolytes.     Here the driving force is solely the alteration of
osmotic pressure p with the locality w. Since p is proportional to
the concentration c (number of g-molecules in 1 cub. centim.), and
thus p = p,q, we get for the quantity of substance in g molecules,
which travels through the section q of a cylinder in the time z:—.
                               s=–º        K    de
K is the force which imparts unit velocity to a molecule in solution.
This law, which is of the same form as the well-known one stated
by Fick, renders it possible to calculate K in absolute measure, as
the author shows by a few examples.
    Still more interesting is the calculation of the diffusion for
solutions of electrolytes; for the coefficient of diffusion may here
be calculated in absolute measure, on the basis of the hypothesis of
dissociation propounded by Arrhenius and others.                 By means of
Ohm’s law, Kohlrausch, as is well known, has calculated from the
galvanic migration of the ions, which is solely due to electrostatic
 forces, the force which imparts to a g-ion in aqueous solution unit
 velocity of migration.       If  now, in the diffusion of an electrolyte
 the  inequality  of osmotic   pressure     were the only driving force, then,
 from the different     mobility    of the positive and the negative ions
 (e.g. H and Cl), free electricity would at once form in the solution.
 This is prevented by the establishment of an electrostatic force, the
 action of which has just the result that the ions in the solution
 are present in equivalent ratios.           From this condition the magni
 tude of that force may be calculated, and retaining the same nomen
 clature as above, we get for the actual quantity of the anion or
  kation diffusing in unit time :—

   For the sake of comparison with experiment, the influence of
temperature on the coefficient of diffusion is taken into account
on the basis of the theory of dissociation: the coefficients 0.026 for
salts and 0.024 for acids and bases represent the alteration of
conductivity with temperature; these numbers are found to agree
very well with the observations of de Heen and Schumeister.
   The coefficients of diffusion reduced to 18° agree very well with
the observations of various experimentalists, as shown in the table
given; and this agreement is an excellent proof of the validity of
the author's consideration.
   From the same point of view the author treats the diffusion of a
mixture of salts, as well as of electrolytes at greater concentration.
He shows further, how in the same way the difference of electrical
potential between solutions of different concentration may be
calculated.  Between two places of a solution in which the osmotic
pressure     isand p, the difference
                  p,                      potential         oflo               is   p   "-"      g   !.

     ON    THE ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE OF INSULATORS AT HIGH

always increases more rapidly than the fluidity,     that, for instance,
with petroleum ether         twelvefold increase

corresponds        only threefold increase

ductivity      those substances exhibits the greatest increase when
              of
their fluidity also increases most strongly with the temperature.
Castor-oil, for instance, conducts 350 times better          132° than                       at
at 20°, while between these two limits            fluidity increases    its                                      by
only 43 times.

 ON   THE RESISTANCE TO DISRUPTIVE DISCHARGE OFFERED BY
        GASES UNDER HIGH PRESSURES.    BY MAX WOLF.
  At   the instance of Prof. Quincke the author attempted to ascer
tain what resistance certain gases offered at high pressure to the
passage of the electrical spark.     In other words, the difference of
potential of two spherical surfaces was determined at the moment
of the discharge, for different gases and at various pressures
greater than one atmosphere.        In this a method was used similar
to that used by Quincke for determining striking distances in insu
lating liquids. It was to be expected that under higher densities
the irregularities in the discharge occurring under smaller pressures
must be less prominent.
   The conclusions arrived at are as follows:—
   (1) The electrical force which produces the disruptive discharge
in various gases between spherical surfaces of 5 centim. radius and
at a distance of 0.1 centim. increases proportionally to the pressure
for pressures between 1 and 9 atmospheres.
   (2) The increase of the electrical force for simpler gases (oxygen,
hydrogen, and air) is inversely proportional to the mean path of
the gas-molecules.
   (3) With carbonic acid the product from the increase in the elec
trical force into the mean path for an increase of pressure for one
atmosphere is considerably smaller (almost one half) that of simple
gaSeS.
   (4) One or more discharges are necessary until the resistance of
a gas  is attained, and the resistance is at first so much the less than
in the later discharges, the higher is the pressure on the gas.-

           THE NATURE OF SOLUTIONS.                  BY S. U. PICKERING.
   On pages 36–38 of this Magazine Prof. Arrhenius publishes a
criticism of my paper on this subject.                    I
                                           venture to think that it

attempts have been made to measure the distribution of lumi
nosity and energy in the spectrum, and to express the same
by means of formulae, yet the experiments are few which have
for their object to obtain an insight into the mechanics of
luminosity. In general, we have contented ourselves with                                                          in

150                          Prof. E. Wiedemann on the
                            General-Production of Light.
   1. According to the newer views of the constitution of
bodies, we assume motions of translation of the molecules
with their centre of gravity; further, rotation and oscillation
round the centres of gravity considered as fixed, not only of
the material parts of the molecules but also of their aether
envelopes.             W. gases the motions of translation of the
centres of gravity produce only feeble emission of light. Sir
G. G. Stokes" has sought in this the explanation of the feeble
continuous spectrum of sodium seen at the same time as the
line-spectrum.                   I
                          have myselff endeavoured to show that
the motions of rotation cannot be the cause of the line- and
band-spectra.       Consequently we must seek the cause of the
production of      light   in gases in the intermolecular            move
ments which occur within the molecule—either of their material
particles or of their aether-envelopes.            We shall endeavour
to show later on that it can only be the vibrations of the
material particles to which the emission of light is due.             With
solid and liquid bodies the emission of light may be due to
the vibrations of the whole molecule about                     position         its                 of
equilibrium            as
                    well               as   to
                                  the intermolecular motions            the                   of
constituent atoms                     of
                             the molecule.       Upon the first depends
the uniform continuous spectrum                                 of   all
                                                      solid bodies when
heated, and upon the last the differences between the light
emitted          by
              different bodies.
   2.  The following theoretical considerations rest upon the
conception        luminosity introduced
                      of                                        by

confused.
I    designate         light the whole complex
                            as                          rays between the

   3.      I
          take as the basis of my investigations the kinetic
theory of gases.        According to this there exists at constant
temperature a perfectly definite relationship between the kinetic
energy of the motion of translation, corresponding to the
temperature, and that of the intermolecular motions, both as
a whole as well as for each kind thereof, and consequently
also between those of the motion of translation and the lumi
nous motion ; otherwise no permanent condition would be
possible.    This relationship may be regarded as the normal
one.
               If,
            for any reason, the normal relationship         disturbed                    is
in any way,       will   ittime again become normal.

phenomena apparently belong                         to photo-luminescence,                  but
really to chemi-luminescence.
  The temperature of luminescence is defined to be the tem
perature at which a body, heated without decomposition,
would give light of a particular wave-length in each case of
exactly the same brightness as it does in consequence of the
processes of luminescence.
   The production of light in the phenomena of luminescence
in gases cannot be explained by assuming that in consequence
of the different velocities of the individual molecules, as
assumed by the kinetic theory of gases, the individual mole
cules possess a very high temperature, and therefore become
luminous.    For at the temperature of ignition, defined by the
great velocity of the motion of translation, most substances
would be decomposed.        Certainly                    all

The like holds good   for solid bodies and for liquids,  only that
here the limits within which the velocities of the molecules
are included are much narrower than with gases.

than those which the eye can perceive.
   Besides these oscillatory internal motions, of other tem
perature than the mean, which produce this luminescence,
yet others may occur, rotatory and others, which are not of a
nature to produce light-waves in the surrounding aether, as
may be the case in the conduction of electricity through
electrolytes.   But of this  I  make here only a preliminary
mention.
             Luminescence   and Kirchhoff's Law.
   8. The production of light may therefore occur in conse
quence of a rise in temperature, as well as in consequence of a
rise in luminescence.   But these two modes must always be
considered separately if we wish to obtain an insight into
the mechanics of luminosity.
   For luminosity resulting from a rise of temperature Kirch
hoff’s Law as to the relationship of emission and absorption
holds good.     Upon this rests the well-known reversal of
the lines of the spectrum.      The light produced by lumi
nescence does not obey the same law, as is shown for example
by the behaviour of fluorescent substances, which emit light
of a refrangibility different from that of the incident light.
In trying whether Kirchhoff's Law holds good or not, we are
often able to distinguish the two phenomena.      (See further
on under 30.)
   To discover the reasons why in glowing bodies Kirchhoff’s
Law of the ratio between emission and absorption holds good,
and why this is not generally the case with luminescent bodies,
let us consider the following circumstances:—
   As we have said, there takes place in a gas a constant ex
change between intermolecular       energy and that due to
motions of translation in  consequence  of the impact of mole
cules (the luminous      energy  forming  a part of the inter
molecular energy), so that a mean condition ensues.        any    If
molecule suffers an increase of intermolecular    energy, e.g.
in consequence of the absorption of incident light, this is
given up again in the next impact or            so,
                                                  and       has
                                                            if   it    a
deficiency  in   intermolecular     energy this       made good.
                                                      is
The emission-coefficient depends upon the ease with which
part  of this intermolecular energy produced           by
                                                      the impacts,
corresponding    to  the luminous energy,       isgiven     againup
in  the form  of  light-vibrations, that    upon the friction be
                                           is
tween the vibrating molecules    of   the body and the surround
ing aether. The absorption depends upon the same quantity,
and thus also upon the structure      ofthe molecule.   But since,

 on the one hand, the coefficient of emission is greater the
 greater the friction, and on the other hand the coefficient of
 absorption equally increases with this; the coefficients of
 absorption and emission must run together; and so for                                                             all

 a part  of which is lost by external radiation on the free path
 between two impacts.
    The two cases require separate consideration, for the mode
 of excitation is essentially different. In incandescence it is
 the reciprocal relationships between the impinging molecules,
 whether of the same, or of different kinds, which produce the
 motions causing light; while in photo- and electro-lumines
 cence these are due to an external motion affecting the
particles.
         The loss in luminous energy may also have various causes.
    Q
A loss of energy ensues in consequence of the issuing light
vibrations; further, in luminescent bodies in consequence of
the impact of two molecules a part of the energy of the lumi
nous motions may be converted into energy of translation and
thus produce a rise of temperature.               Further, within each
molecule     only  those atoms associated in a particular way, the
chromogenic, which we will here call lucigenic, may perform
luminous vibrations together. These motions may in part be
transferred to the neighbouring non-lucigenic atoms, and may
thus suffer diminution.          According to the structure of the
molecules, only a particular kind of vibrations will be checked
in any high degree, whilst others will remain undisturbed—a
process to which numerous analogies are well known in
acoustics.
   We have appropriate examples amongst the phenomena of
     i.
light in the observations on solutions of fluorescein and
eosin in gelatine, which I have previously communicated",
where the gelatine is mixed with solutions of the substances
Fº
and             to dry. In the fluorescent light yielded by these
substances, observed while illuminated, the spectrum appears
almost continuous from red to green. On the other hand, the
                    light observed some time after the illumination
  as ceased,   shows a very dark band in the orange.          The phos
phorescent light was examined in the phosphoroscope de
scribed by me, the arrangement being such that the phospho
rescent light was examined from the same side as that on
which the incident light fellf.          The absorption of the light
excited before the observation was diminished as much as
possible. We must conclude from these observations that in
these bodies the loss of luminous energy for the complex of
rays in the orange is determined, not only by radiation, but
also by an absorption within the molecule itself.

light emitted by a body, and will investigate the two cases:

   B. Let us now turn to the second case. Let the luminous
energy be brought by any cause to a constant, height, and
then at a time t = 0 let the radiating body be left to itself,
after the exciting cause has been removed. We will further
assume that the loss of energy takes place by radiation and
not by absorption.     Further, the luminous energy contained
in a particle shall not receive any further increase during the
radiation, in consequence of processes going on within the
molecule itself, or by the impact of two molecules.

164           Messrs. Bottomley and Tanakadaté on the
quantity of metallic tungsten remains in the alloy, yet the
properties of the substance are in many respects remarkable.
The metal is capable of being polished so as to be almost as
beautiful as silver in appearance, having only a slightly darker
and more steel-like colour; and when it has been polished it
remains absolutely untarnished even in the atmosphere of a
large town, for years at any rate. It has very remarkable
properties as to electric resistance.         It possesses a very high
resistance, while at the same time it has a much lower tempe
rature-variation of electric resistance than any other known
metal or alloy.    It has also, as Sir William Thomson has found,
very excellent elastic qualities.
   Although it was not proposed to use the platinoid with any
metal other than platinum in the investigation on thermal
radiation above referred to, it nevertheless seemed advisable,
when these experiments were being undertaken, to determine
its position with respect        some other metals.

varnish, the greatest care being taken not to varnish any part
of the spider-line.      When the varnish has dried, the mirror
can be lifted   up  by  the spider-line ; caution being used at the
moment of raising the one mirror off the surface of the other,
on account of the vacuum which is liable to be formed at the
moment of separation. The mirror should be allowed to hang
on the fibre inside a glass beaker for twenty-four hours at
least, as the spider-line stretches considerably for some time

vapour formed itself into layers of different temperatures, the
  arts of the flask nearest the surface of the liquid being the
            At a height of 2% inches above the surface of the
liquid the temperature was often found to be as much as 8° or
10° C. cooler than it was just above the surface.      The diffi
culty could, to a certain extent, be overcome by putting a
cloak of fine flexible wire gauze       round the upper partall                                            of
the  flask;  but the greatest watchfulness was needed      avoid                               to
mistakes.

                 to

tromotive forces are given in C.G.S. units, and must be
divided by 10° if it be desired to reduce them to volts. The
differences of temperatures are given in Centigrade degrees.
 The direction of the current in each of the cases represented
 is from platinoid to the second metal of the pair through the
 hot junction.
    Table I. shows, in the way now well known", the multiplier
at any temperature Centigrade which must be used as factor
with the difference of temperatures between the hot and cold
junctions, in order to calculate the electromotive force in
C.G.S. units. The algebraic sign corresponds with that used
by Tait, and now adopted by Everett ('                             u.       and Constants,’
second edition, 1886).

   Combining the results of Table I. with those of Tait, reduced
by Everett, we obtain the thermoelectric distance of platinoid
from lead, taken as zero, at various temperatures Centigrade.
If any one of the wires platinum, aluminium, iron, or copper
used by us were identical with the wire of the same name
used by Professor Tait, we should be able to deduce with
exactness the distance of our platinoid wire from his lead wire.
This, however, was not the case ; and each of the seconda
wires used by us gives us, as it were, a different result. Thus
we have :—

170                         Mr. Charles Tomlinson on
but not in sufficient number to form a sect; and also indiffer
entists, who say that the two former classes quarrel about what
no one understands. Thus Kämtz refers to hail as a phenomenon
“welches sehr haufig Begleiter der Gewitter ist, und dessen
Erklärung sehr schwierig ist.”         Nevertheless his elaborate
treatment of this subject is included in the chapter on Atmo
spheric Electricity'.     Pouillet more emphatically declares:—
“On ne sait rien jusqu’à présent sur les causes qui déterminent
ce phénomène”*.                |...}.
                                   also confirms the remark:—
“Nous ignorons encore quelle est la véritable origine de ce
phénomène” ".
   Yet there is something very enticing in the electrical theory
of hail. Hail often accompanies the thunderstorm ; and the
stones, in falling, have been known to flash with electric light".
It is true that in the last century, when Franklin’s experiments
were exciting delight and enquiry in various parts of Europe,
more burdens were laid on electricity than it was well able to
bear ; and we may perhaps allow a good-natured smile to pass
in reading Father Beccaria's statement that “a more intense
electricity unites the particles of hail more closely than the
more moderate electricity does those of snow” ".             M. de
Morveau also supposes that, evaporation being the immediate
cause of the cooling, and electricity augmenting perceptibly
the evaporation, “le fluide électrique est une cause habituelle
plus ou moins immédiate de la formation de la gréle” ".
   Without referring further to the ideas of the older physicists
as to the formation of hail, I pass on to a meteorologist nearer
our own time, who exerted considerable influence on the science
of meteorology—if such it can even now be called. Professor
Daniell' admits the difficulty of accounting for the phenomena
of hail on account of our imperfect knowledge of the influence
of electricity. As a proof of electrical action, he calls attention
to the behaviour of the electrometer on the approach of hail,
when the electricity will not only be found frequently to change
in intensity, but also to pass from positive to negative, and
vice versa, ten or twelve times in a minute.

   From this action on the electrometer Kämtz was led to
include hail under atmospheric electricity.       Even the small
hail that falls in winter         the Germans name Graupel, and

classeswith the hail, properly so called, that often does do so.
He  regards both kinds as electrical phenomena, only the elec
tricity has more tension in the one case than in the other. But
when a man is on a wrong tack, he is sure to meet with facts
that contradict his hypothesis. In such cases Kämtz's aphorism
will apply to many an observer:-" Man glaubt dennoch was
man gern winscht;” but it does not apply to Kämtz himself,
for he honestly states facts that are against him, and waits for
further light. Thus he has occasionally noticed larger hail
stones in winter than in summer, although there is more moisture
in the air in the latter season than in the former. Smaller hail
is found on the top of the mountain than in the valley below,
just as if the increase in volume took place during the fall.
The inhabitants of mountain districts speak of Graupel, whilst
 those in the valley refer to it as Hagel.
    The advocates of the electric theory of hail had no better
method of accounting for the large masses that fell, consisting
 often of a number of coatings round a nucleus, than by sup
 posing that a small stone gathered to itself clear and opaque
 coatings of ice during                   This idea prevailed long

twigs and leaves.      Nevertheless, hail was known to be of
frequent occurrence in well-wooded localities, also in towns
where lightning-conductors were common. In spite of this,
vast numbers of poles, with or without metal wires, were
erected at great cost in fields and vineyards in various parts
of Europe; and in 1820 an ignorant apothecary recommended
pillars of straw as being excellent paragréles, and they, too,
were extensively adopted. Well may Becquerel denounce the
  aragréle as “cette invention de l'ignorance dont la science et
 e bon sens public ont déjà fait justice " '
   Other methods of guarding against hail have been recom
mended and adopted, such as making fires on the ground on
the approach of a storm, discharging artillery and otherwise
exploding gunpowder; but these methods must be classed
among the inventions of ignorance, although so good an
observer as Matteucci” refers to a village in Italy where the
peasants, acting under the advice of the Curé, place, at
intervals of about 50 feet, heaps of stones and brushwood, and
set fire to the latter when a storm is seen to be approaching.
The plan had only been adopted three years when Matteucci
made his report, and that is too short a time to base any con
clusion on ; but it has been suggested that, while hail does
  reat damage in the outskirts of London, it is less harmful in
the denser part of the metropolis, probably on account of the
vast column of heated air that rises from it altering the local
atmospheric conditions required for the production of large
hail.
   The occurrence of hail in hot weather, often at the hottest
part of the day, sometimes in the form of masses of ice of con
siderable size, apparently from a cloud situate far below the
snow-line, is a problem that has often appealed to the scientific
ingenuity of physicists for solution. As already remarked, the
accompanying electrical displays naturally led to an electrical
theory, of which Muschenbroek” was the original parent.
He was succeeded, amongst others, by Mongez”, Muncke”,
De Luc", Lichtenberg", Lampadius", and lastly by Volta”.

theory.
   This theory has first to account for a reduction of tem
perature sufficient to freeze water on a hot          and then to
explain how the hailstones, so formed, can be held suspended
in the air so as to attain a volume often of several inches

in circumference. The cold is supposed to be produced by a
powerful evaporation, due to the action of the sun on the
upper surface of the cloud; and the evaporation is the more
rapid in proportion as the air above the cloud is rarefied and
electric, for it is admitted that electricity greatly favours eva
             Hence one portion of the cloud, in evaporating,
  owers the temperature of the other portion sufficiently to
produce congelation.
   The nuclei of the hailstones being thus formed, they cannot
attain fresh coatings of clear transparent ice, however low in
temperature they may be, in the short time they are falling to
the earth; but it is in the power of electricity so to sustain
 them, while they are thus being developed in volume and
 weight.

trical states, when the attractions and repulsions are performed
with great celerity, and the hailstones, being equally active,
produce that peculiar noise that precedes a fall of hail”.
   Volta's theory has frequently been discussed, and objected
to on many grounds.           Becquerel points out the mistaken
notion that   vapour  in the act of forming becomes negative,
and while being condensed positive.          When a dense cloud is
acted on by the sun, vapour arises charged with the same
electricity as that of the cloud ; but when, on reaching an
upper and colder region, it becomes condensed, it is said
to assume an opposite kind of electricity.        But the clouds are
not electrified after this    manner,   seeing that electricity is not
set free  by  change  of  state, unaccompanied    by decomposition.
Moreover, the question arises why the two clouds in opposite
states, connected as they are admitted to be by conducting
  articles of vapour, do not immediately neutralize each other.
  he oscillations of the hailstones between the two clouds could
only take place if the clouds were solid planes, as in the expe
riment with the dancing pith figures. Then, again, the snow
flakes which form the nuclei of the hailstones are said to be
formed at the upper surface of the lower cloud, and hence
must form a portion of it; how, then, can they be driven out
of it without breaking up the whole cloud º Even supposing

                                      the Theory
storms, dating from the year 1449 to his own time. One
example will suffice for our present purpose. At
between the 25th and 26th June, 1822, a violent storm of hail
burst over Meissen, and the next morning the farmers had to
mourn the entire loss of their crops of fruit and grain, and
they found hundreds of starlings lying dead in the fields.
     nother objection with respect to the sun is that, if it
promotes evaporation, it also raises the temperature, as was
shown by Bellani", who covered the bulbs of two thermo
                                                            of Hail.

meters with wet linen, and exposed one to the sun and the
other to the shade.      Evaporation was the more rapid in the
sunshine, but the temperature was higher; whereas, according
to the theory, it ought to have been lower, even to freezing.
   The celebrity of Volta's name gained for his theory much
attention, and with some modifications it was more or less
adopted.       Perhaps the most distinguished         physicist, who
quarrelled with        and yet it,

been    performed.     Thus in “Nature, for June 13th last, an
account is   given    of a hailstone that fell at Liverpool on the
2nd of that month at 3.35 p.m., consisting of an opaque
nucleus surrounded by a circle of almost clear ice with fine
circular lines, and that was bounded by a frilled outline of
opaque ice. The writer goes on to say:-‘‘If a hailstone is
formed during electric oscillation from cloud to cloud, and if
it receives opaque ice from one cloud and clear ice from
another, the alternation of layers would be a natural conse
quence.      The violence of the hail scarcely seemed as great
as their size justified, and this suggested that electrostatic
attraction had upheld them against the force of gravitation
down to a moderate height above the ground.”
    Of course it is not meant to deny that in the formation and
fall of hail two or more layers of cloud may exist in opposite
i.
states of electricity.     All that modern theory contends for is
that the   electricity  and the hail are not related as cause and
effect.   The hail-clouds do not often, if ever, assume the well
defined planes described in Volta's theory.

  ifferent from that of other     clouds;  the edges are much rent,
and there are swellings and outgrowths on the surface. On
some occasions the hail-cloud is made up of rounded clustered
masses with long processes shooting downwards almost to the

pullet's egg, but some as large as a turkey’s. There were
two strata of clouds, one over the other, and two winds from
different quarters, both which conditions he considers necessary
for the production of hail.    Early on the morning of July
28th, 1835, the sky was cloudless, but about 10 a.m. the heat
became intense, and at noon almost intolerable.      Thin flakes
of vapour were seen floating at a great distance, the wind
was N. but feeble. At 1 p.m. it had freshened, and white
clouds had descended considerably, and soon after covered a
great part of the horizon.      They were of a greyish tint,
which became darker and darker till nearly black, and at
2 p.m. they covered the whole of Auvergne.            Flashes of
lightning were seen, and      distant low murmuring sound was
                                              a
heard, when a vast cloud advanced from W. to E., pure white
in some places, chiefly at the edges, and deep grey at the
centre: it seemed to advance rapidly under the impulse of a
violent west wind, and it sailed below all the other clouds;
its  borders were festooned and deeply slashed, and pro
tuberances      the shape
                    in        long nipples were suspended from
                                            of
the lower  portion.    At 2.15 the cloud had approached nearer
and the noise became very intense, the edges            the cloud                 of
seemed        to   rapid motion, and hail was apparently within
                    be   in
it.   Soon after this whirlwind kind        motion hail fell, and
                                                              of

fell succeeded one another very slowly, but            once there           all   at
was    an immense    downpour.     After this the distant rolling
sound entirely ceased, and the cloud, freed from          swelling                     its
appendages, was carried away                            by
                                        the wind, and the storm
Was Over.
  It  was from narratives such       the above that meteorologists

temperature        the  upper

178                    Mr. Charles Tomlinson            on
 draw down cold air from above, or draw up warm moist air
 from below, in either case supplying some at least of the con
 ditions for the generation of hail.       The diminution of the
 temperature of the air with the altitude may be roughly stated
 as one degree F. for every 343 feet of ascent, and the point
 ofPºpeº      congelation at and above the equator 14,000 feet;
at 30° 12,000 feet; at 40° 10,000 feet; at 50° 8000 feet ;
 at 60° 6000 feet; at 70° 4000 feet; at 80° 2000 feet, and
after this the point rapidly approaches the earth.
    Prof. Olmsted's theory has been admirably elaborated by
the officers of the United States Coasts Survey, as will
presently be noted. In the meantime a few cases may be
cited to show how the idea gradually became developed into
 the present consistent theory. Thus Mr.                      J.
                                                    C. Martin”, of
 Pulborough in Sussex, writing in 1840, refers to masses of
 ice having fallen five, six, and seven inches in circumference,
and goes on to state that there can be only one way by which
 such masses are suspended in the air long enough to grow to
such a size, and that is by the assistance of a nubilar whirl
wind or waterspout.        He states that he once witnessed an
appearance of this sort between a higher and a lower cloud,
that had a strongly electric aspect before they had resolved
themselves into nimbus.       It was a bent massive column of
dark vapour in rapid rotatory motion, passing from one cloud
to the other, continuing for some minutes, and gradually
disappearing.     The hailstones are described as spheres
flattened at the poles, the result of rotatory motion.         In a
hail-storm which devastated Dublin on April 18th, 1850”,
some observers state that they saw two strata of oppositely
electrical clouds and discharges passing between them, and
that the hailstones were as large as pigeons' eggs, and were
formed of a nucleus of snow or sleet, surrounded by transpa
rent ice ; this was succeeded by an opaque white layer,
followed by a second coating of ice, and, in some examples,
five alternations were counted. The storm is described as a
cyclone, but Mr. Piddington, in quoting         prefers it, call        to   it
tornado.    He also remarks

gravitation.   In a storm described by Luke Howard”, that
occurred at Tottenham on the 19th April, 1809, at 5 p.m., the
icy bullets, some of them a full inch in diameter, were dis
charged almost horizontally, and with such velocity that in
many instances a clean round hole was left in the glass they
pierced, and one large pane had two such perforations, dis
tinctly formed, the glass being otherwise whole. The com
paratively small width of the hail's track is also in favour of
the cyclonic theory, although the length may be considerable.
The great storm that began in the south of France early on
the 13th of July, 1788, extended in a few hours over the
whole kingdom, even as far as Holland. It proceeded in two
parallel zones from S.W. to N.E.; one zone was 175 leagues
in length, and the other 200; the breadth of the western zone
was four leagues, and of the other only two. The zone between
the two was five leagues wide, but no hail fell there, only
heavy rain. There was also rain on the outer boundary of
the two zones.    A thick darkness accompanied the hail, and
spread on both sides. The storm travelled at the rate of
16% leagues an hour in both zones.       Upwards of a thousand
parishes were ravaged by this storm,
   Turning now to Mr. William Ferrel's theory” of the
formation of hail in connexion with a tornado or cyclone, he
calculates in an assumed example that the plane or stratum
of zero temperature is 6428 metres above the base of the
cloud, and in the absence of friction may be supposed to be
brought down to the earth in the centre, where the gyrations
are very rapid.    Below this base aqueous vapour is condensed
into cloud and  rain,  but above it into snow. The rain-drops
below may also be carried up into the snow-region in the ascend
ing currents, and if kept suspended there for a short time they
may become frozen into small hail. They may then be kept
suspended near the base of the snow-cloud, and increase in
size by the rain, which is carried up into this region, coming
into contact with them before it has had time to freeze.       In
this  way   compact   homogeneous    hailstones of ordinary  size
are formed. At the height of nearly 7000 metres the density
of the air in comparison with that at the earth's surface is
0:42, and it is calculated in the assumed example that a
velocity of 20 metres per second in the ascending current will
sustain a hailstone one centimetre in diameter at that altitude.
This is no unusual velocity for ascending currents in tornados.
It is not necessary that the hailstones should remain long in

 then be carried in towards the vortex by the inflowing current

many of them measuring 3% inches in diameter, or nearly a
foot in circumference ; 84 human beings and about 3000 oxen
were killed. At Nainee Tal, a sanatorium in the Lower
Himalayas, the noise of the approaching storm was as if
thousands of bags of walnuts were being emptied in the air.
The hail that first fell was of the size of pigeon's eggs, and
at length became of the size of cricket balls.                   Dr. Buist
describes the largest hailstones that fell in India as from
 10 to 13 inches in circumference, and from 9 to 13 ounces in
weight; the average maxima are from 8 to 10 inches in
circumference, and 2 to 4 ounces in weight, but ordinary hail
exceeds filberts in size.
    In the accompanying Plate (IV.) have collected some re          I
markable figures of hailstones, a number of which (1 to 8) fell
during a storm which                  I
                                witnessed at Leipzig on August 27th,
 1860*.        I was  proceeding      by rail from Cassel to Leipzig;
the   day    was   hot, and the afternoon sultry, the thermometer
marking 22° R. (81}^ F.). About 4 p.m. copper-coloured
clouds appeared in the west, the sky darkened, and about
 6.30, when close to Leipzig, a black cloud, streaked with white
bands, rose up like a pillar; there was a flash of lightning,
and as soon as the thunder had ceased, a rattling noise was
heard, which was succeeded by a shower of large hail. Just
before this         I
                  had quitted the railway-station in a drosky, the
flexible leathern covering of which was drawn down, and
the windows on each side were up. The carriage had not
quitted the station when a fiercely wailing wind twisted the
                                          of its

XXVII.      On Endless Availability; and on a Restriction to the
   Application     of Carnot's Principle.             By CHARLEs W.

            following pages some experiments are described
IN which
       the
              appear    to be in obvious disagreement with the
Second Law of       Thermodynamics.           The first apparatus used
is shown in   fig. 1.    A  piece  of  glass   tube, A, is closed below
by a dialysing membrane, B, tied                          -
over it in the usual manner.             It             Fig. 1.
contains a solution to be dialysed,
and is supported within a beaker, C,
by wedges of cork, D, E.              The
beaker, C, stands on a glass plate,
                  ...;
 F, the whole being covered by a
 bell-jar, G H,           is luted with
 wax round the edge,        KL,   so that
 evaporation from the solution in
 the dialyser is prevented as far as
 possible. The beaker, C, is at first
 empty; and when a certain portion
 of the solution in A has passed into
 it through the membrane B, the process is stopped by taking
 the apparatus to pieces and mixing the solutions. A thermo
 meter measures the rise or fall of temperature which ensues.

 and about 3 of the solution had passed through the dialyser.
 When the experiment had lasted 14 days, about 3 of the
 solution had passed through.         The solutions in A and C were
 then mixed, and the temperature rose 19-2 (Centigrade). B
 next day some crystals had been deposited from the                hiº
 solutions; and had this crystallization taken place under
 adiabatic conditions, there must have been a further elevation
 of temperature. The following are the details of the experi

     Nov. 10.  Crystals, apparently about equal to the original
crystal in A, have been deposited.
   Thus we can perform a complete cycle of changes.        Starting
with saturated solution and   crystals of sodium    sulphate in the
dialyser, at the temperature of surrounding objects, an iso
thermal change first takes place. Next the separated portions
of the solutions are mixed, and may be maintained under
                                     of all
adiabatic conditions till     possible crystallization has taken
place, evaporation being      course excluded. The result                        is
                                                                                      of a

   Experiment III.-The apparatus was arranged as follows:—
A beaker, A (fig. 2), contained saturated solution and crystals
of sodium sulphate, in which some                     Fig. 2.
parchment-paper, C, was partly im
mersed, so as to increase the surface
for evaporation; A was placed within
a larger beaker, B, which was closed
by a glass plate, D, luted on with
soft wax so as to be air-tight. The
apparatus was left in a dark corner,
and after a day or two, dew was seen
to have collected on the sides of
the outer beaker, B.       After six weeks, about half a gram of
water had collected in the beaker.
    Now, undoubtedly the apparatus underwent changes of
temperature; but these would be essentially very slow, so
that the difference of temperature between one part of the
apparatus and another would be extremely small, and this
must have been especially the case between the surface of the
 solution and the adjacent walls of the beaker A, where dew
 had also formed and gradually increased in amount.
    From the continued distillation it seemed probable that the
             .#
vapour-pressure over thoroughly saturated sodium-sulphate
solution is slightly greater than over pure water. It is evident
that the                solution has the smaller latent heat of
vaporization, since evaporation is then always accompanied
 by crystallization.     Hence a water-molecule expends less
 energy in attaining the gaseous state than would be the case
at the surface of pure water.
    Here, again, we can perform a complete cycle of operations.
 The water which has distilled may be collected, and the
 deposited crystal dissolved in          it.fall

   It is scarcely necessary to say that although the nth band
may be rendered achromatic, the system is no more achromatic
than if the prism had been dispensed with.    The width of the
component systems being unaltered, the manner of overlapping
remains as before. The present use of the prism is of course
entirely different from that previously discussed, in which
by a suitable adjustment the system of bands could be
achromatized.

   “The first thing to be noticed is that, when a approaches
the critical angle, cos 2' becomes as small as we please, and
that, consequently, the retardation corresponding to a given
thickness is very much less than at perpendicular incidence.
Hence the glass surfaces need not be so close as usual.
    “A second feature is the increased brilliancy of the light.
But the peculiarity which most demands attention is the
lessened influence of a variation in A upon the phase retarda
tion. A diminution of X of itself increases the retardation
of phase, but since waves of shorter wave-length are more
 refrangible, this effect may be more or less perfectly com
 pensated by the greater obliquity, and consequent diminution
 in the value of cos             a'.

plate, which should be mounted in such a fashion that the
pressure may be varied, and that the whole may be readily
turned in azimuth.     The coloured bands are best seen when
the surfaces are   nearly  parallel and pretty close.   It is best
to commence observations under these conditions.           When
the achromatic azimuth has been found, the interval may be
increased.    If it is desired to see a large number of bands,
a  strip of paper may be interposed between the surfaces along
one edge, so as to form a plate of graduated thickness.
Talbot speaks of from 100 to 200 achromatic bands; but                                          I
do not think any such large number can be even approximately
achromatic.     The composition of the light may be studied
with the aid of a pocket spectroscope, and the appearances
correspond with what has been already described under the
head of interference-bands formed from a prismatic spectrum
in place of the usual line of undecomposed light. As has
been already remarked, the colours of fine bands are difficult
 to appreciate ; and indistinctness is liable to be attributed to
 other causes when really due to insufficient achromatism.
    The use of a wedge-shaped layer of air is convenient in
 order to obtain a simultaneous view of a large number of
 bands; but it must not be overlooked that it involves some
 departure from theoretical simplicity.     The proper develop
 ment of the light due to any thickness requires repeated
 reflexions to and fro within the layer, and at a high degree of
 obliquity this process occupies a considerable width. If the
 band-interval be too small, complications necessarily ensue,
 which are probably connected with the fact that the appearance
 of the bands changes somewhat according to the distance from
 the reflecting combination at which they are observed.

 formed a little beyond the limit of total reflexion.      They are
 broad and richly coloured if the layer of air be thin, but as
 the thickness increases they become finer, and the colour is
 less evident.
    The theoretical condition of constant thickness is better
satisfied if (after Mascart) we place the layer of air in the
focus of a small radiant point (e.g. the electric arc) as formed
by an achromatic lens of wide angle.              In this case the
area concerned may be made so small that the thickness in
operation can scarcely vary, and the ideal Herschel's bands
are seen depicted upon a screen held in the path of the re
flected light. It will of course be understood that bands
may be observed of an intermediate character in the formation
of which both thickness and incidence vary. Herschel's
observations relate to one particular case—that of constant
thickness; Talbot's to the other especially simple case of
constant angle of incidence.
    From our present point of view there         however, one very                  is,

is nearly equal to unity, and the factors cos Á, cos Á', cos &
vary but slowly with the order of the band and also with the
wave-length.    Hence the width of the nth band is approxi
mately proportional to the order, to the square of the wave
length, and to the inverse square of the thickness.
   This series of bands, commencing at the limit of total
reflexion, and gradually increasing in width, are easily
observed with Herschel's apparatus by the aid of a soda
flame. In order to increase the field of view, the flame may
be focussed upon the layer of air by a wide-angled lens. The
eye should be adjusted for distant objects, and the thickness of
the layer should be as uniform as possible. For the latter
purpose the glass surfaces may be pressed against two strips
of rather thin paper, interposed along two opposite edges.
   We have now to consider what happens when the source of
light is white. According to Airy's principle the centre of
the system is to be found where there is coincidence of bands
              hº
of order n, in spite of a variation of X. This is precisely the
question             dealt with in connexion with the other
system of bands, and the answer is embodied in (36). About
the achromatic centre thus determined will the visible bands
be grouped.
   And now the question arises, Are these bands achromatic *
Certainly not.       . Mascart, to whom is due equation (37),
 appears to me to misinterpret it when he concludes that the
bands are approximately achromatic".             At the central band
 n is the same for the various colours.             Consequently the
 widths of the various systems at this place are approximately
 proportional to              A*.

             Effect of a Prism upon Newton’s Rings.
    If Newton's   rings are examined through a prism, some very
remarkable     phenomena     are exhibited, described in his       }}
observation*.
   “When the two object-glasses were laid upon one another,
so as to make the rings of the colours appear, though with my
naked eye    I could not discern above 8 or 9 of these rings, yet
by viewing them through a prism I have seen a far greater
multitude, insomuch that I could number more than 40, besides
many others which were so very small and close together that
I  could not keep my eye steady on them severally so as to
number them, but by their extent I have sometimes estimated
them to be more than a hundred.           And I believe the experi
ment    may        improved     to the discovery of far greater
   º
               be
numbers; for they seem to be really unlimited, though visible
only so far as they can be separated by the refraction, as
I        hereafter explain.
                                      -
   “But it was but one side of these rings—namely, that
towards which the refraction was made—which by that
refraction was rendered distinct ; and the other side became
more confused than when viewed by the naked eye, insomuch
that there I could not discern above 1 or 2, and sometimes
none of those rings, of which I could discern 8 or 9 with my
naked eye. And their segments or arcs, which on the other
side appeared so numerous, for the most                   --

circle. If the refraction was very great,
or the prism very distant from the
object-glasses, the middle part of those       /
arcs became also confused, so as to dis-
appear and constitute an even white

202                    Lord Rayleigh                  on Achromatic
entire spectrum. The formation of the achromatic band,
 or rather central black bar, depends indeed upon precisely
the same principles as the fictitious shifting of the centre of a
system of Fresnel's bands when viewed through a prism.
    In this example the formation of visible rings at unusual
thicknesses is easily understood ; but it gives no explanation
of the increased numbers observed by Newton. The width of
the bands for any colour is proportional to A, as well after the
displacement by the prism as before.         The manner of over
lapping of two systems whose nth bars have been brought
to coincidence is unaltered ; so that the succession of colours
in white light, and the number of perceptible bands, is much
as usual.
    In order that there may be an achromatic system of bands,
it is necessary that the width of the bands near the centre be

width is proportional       to A, the width for the nth order is
a different function    dependent     upon a.      It is with the latter
that we are concerned         when,     by means of the prism, the
nth bars have been brought to coincidence.
   If  the glasses be in contact, as is usually supposed in the
theory of Newton's rings, a = 0; and therefore, by (41),
&c of X*, or the width of the band of the nth order varies as
the square root of the wave-length, instead of as the first
power.     Even in this case the overlapping and subsequent
obliteration of the bands is much retarded by the use of the
prism ; but the full development of the phenomenon demands
that a should be finite.       Let us inquire what is the condition
in order that the width of the band of the nth order may be
stationary, as A varies. By (41) it is necessary that the
variation of A*/(#n N-a) should vanish.             Hence
                      2\(#nX-a)—#n\* = 0,

   The thickness of the plate where the nth band for A is
formed being ºnx, equation (42) may be taken as signifying
that the thickness must be half due to curvature and                        to
imperfect contact at the place of nearest approach.                   If  this
condition be satisfied, the achromatism of the nth band,
effected by the prism, carries with it the achromatism of a
large number of neighbouring bands".
   We will return presently to the consideration of the
spherically curved glasses used by Newton, and to the
explanation of some of the phenomena which he observed ;
but in the meantime it will be convenient to state the theory
of straight bands in a more analytical form.

        following experiment on the measurement of the heat
THEdue to the     reversals of magnetization in soft iron wire
was carried out in the Physical Laboratory of the Glasgow
University during the summer months of 1888. The method
pursued is due to Sir William Thomson, in accordance with
whose instructions the work was undertaken.
   Cotton-covered soft iron wire, of 115 centim. diameter, was
coiled upon a specially prepared wooden groove. The ends of
the wire were insulated from each other; and the bundle was
tied at several places with fine silk thread to keep       shape,                         its
and when the wooden frame was removed the coil of the
wire was left     shape

magnet placed at a definite place.
   The experiment consisted in making three different deter
minations, i.e.:-(1) the strength of the alternating current
from which the magnetizing field is calculated ; (2) the rate
of alternation per second of time ; (3) the rise of temperature

   The alternating current was measured by a deci-ampere
balance for small current, and by Siemens's               for
large current.   The  dynamometer    was  carefully compared
with the ampere-balance, and    constant was 878 ampere per

210            A.         Tanakadaté on                 the   Thermal Effect due
  It  was found, however, in the course of experiment that
when a continuous current was passed through both the rings,
the tendency of the temperature of the thermo-junction at the
wooden ring was to rise above that at the iron ring, principally
due to the difference of thermal diffusivity. But when the
current was made to alternate, this was entirely overmasked
by the heat arising from reversals of magnetization.
   Thus, in order to find how much heat is due to the reversals
of magnetization, a proper amount of allowance must be made
for the heat diffused and radiated. A satisfactory way of
arriving at the rate at which heat is generated in the substance
of iron would be to solve the general equation of the conduction
of heat when part of the conducting medium is generating
heat. Such an equation will be

English text-books, and his references were confined to the now
well-known papers by Rankine” and Clerk-Maxwellt.                It was
at the same meeting that the late Mr. Merrifield and Prof. Henrici
drew the attention of English mathematicians to a work then little
known in this country, Culmann's Calcolo Grafico (1866), in which
Prof. Crofton's constructions had been anticipated, and the methods
applied to a wide range of subjects.     It was at this same meeting
(April 13, 1871) that Prof. Henrici illustrated the subject by a
very simple and ingenious notation, which is now known as Bow's
notation.    In the Appendix to vol. iii. of the London Mathematical
Society's Proceedings (pp. 320-2) Prof. Henrici has given a sketch
of Culmann's work; now, such progress has been made on the
Continent in the interim, this work itself is almost antiquated. In
a Synopsis of Lectures on the Elements of Applied Mechanics f
(p. 76) Prof. Crofton gives a short space to Culmann's method.
We have a short notice of it also in Minchin, and more recently
still in Lock's ‘Elementary Statics.        Now and again we have
seen questions in Cambridge Examination            Papers requiring a
knowledge of the art. To the craft of Engineers, of course, the
method is familiar nowadays, but we give the above notes to show
that it is gradually finding                its
                                 way into more exoteric circles.                                  A

          ON   LEIDENFROST'S PHENOMENON.       BY K. S. KRISTENSEN.
      author proves that the heat conveyed from the heated dish to
THE
  the drop is not sufficient to explain the Leidenfrost phenomenon,
but that the heat transmitted by conduction of the vapour must
also be taken into account.     Taking the temperature of the dish
at 200°, that of the drop  at 100°,  and assuming that each are per
fectly black, and that the conductivity of aqueous vapour is equal
to that of air, the quantities of heat transferred by conduction
and radiation are equal, if the distance between the dish and the
drop is 0.135 centim. As the assumptions for the radiation are
too favourable, the quantity of heat transmitted by conduction cer
tainly preponderates.—Tidsskrift for Physik of Chemie[2]ix. p. 161;

DETERMINATION OF THE CHANGE WHICH THE INTERNAL FRICTION
  OF AIR EXPERIENCES AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES      AND
  UNDER WARIOUS PRESSURES.   BY P. DE HEEN.
   A brass tube 2 cm. wide and 85 cm. long, closed at both ends,
carefully polished on the inside, is placed in an oil-bath, and a
light brass cylinder 8.5 cm. in length is allowed to fall through.
The diameter of the cylinder is about 0.35 mm. smaller than the
clear width of the tube, so that the air on the fall of the cylinder
must pass through an annular capillary slit. To the cylinder is
attached an iron wire, so that it could be held up by an electro
magnet; it was allowed to fall, and the time measured which
elapsed before it struck against the bottom of the tube. Neglecting
any possible friction of the cylinder against the sides of the tube, we
have
                               m   = T.
                                   const.,
where m is the coefficient of internal friction of air. The temperature
was varied from 0° to 300°, the pressure of the air enclosed in the
brass tube varied from 1 to 2280 cm. of mercury. In agreement with
earlier observers with the exception of M. Hirn, the author finds
that at the pressure of the atmosphere the internal friction of the
air increases as the two thirds power of the absolute temperature.
   The variation of friction with the temperature appeared to have
                                                 º
a maximum at 300 mm. pressure.          The dependence of the internal
friction on the temperature between 10 and 78 mm. pressure, as
follows from the author's experiments, may be very well expressed
by the ratio required by Clausius' theory; that                 is,
                                                         proportional           to
the root     the absolute temperature, which above

XXXII.      Viscosity of Solutions.      By R. F. D'ARcy, B.A.,

Th;       following paper gives an account of experiments on
       the determination of the viscosity of solutions, especially
as a means of investigating chemical changes going on in
them.
    The liquids experimented on were (1) solutions of sulphuric
and acetic acids of different concentrations at different tempe
ratures, (2) solutions of chrome alum, (3) solutions of calcium
chloride in water, and ethyl and methyl alcohols.
            Experiments on Sulphuric-acid       Solutions.
    In 1861 Graham communicated a paper to the Royal
Society (“On Liquid Transpiration in relation to Chemical
Composition,” Phil. Trans. 1861) containing the results of
experiments he had made, following up Poiseuille's observa
tion that a solution of alcohol corresponding to C, H,0.3H2O
has maximum viscosity.        One of the most striking observa
tions recorded in this     paper   is that on adding water to sul
phuric acid (which at 20°C. is about twenty-one times more
viscous than water) the viscosity increases, attaining a maxi
mum when the water added is in the proportion of 18 to 98
of acid, that is to say, when the composition of the liquid is

H,SO, . H2O. As more water is added the viscosity decreases
continuously.    All Graham's experiments were made at a
temperature of 20°C.
   In the following experiments, by             at different tem
peratures, it is found that this increase of viscosity on the
addition of water occurs at temperatures below about 65° C. :
at higher temperatures the viscosity diminishes continuously
as the concentration diminishes.
   The apparatus used was very simple.         It consisted of a
bulb, A, which was connected by the tube, B, with a gas-bag
                           T

containing air under pressure, and to a water pressure-gauge,
and by C to the fine tube, D. The capacity of the bulb A
between the two scratches a and b is 15-9 c.c.
   The experiments consisted in observing, by means of a
              the time taken to empty the bulb A of the liquid
under examination through the tube D, the pressure being
measured by means of the water-gauge, and the temperature
by the thermometer, T. The water surrounding the bulb A
and the tube D was kept at a uniform temperature by means
of the stirrer, K.
   No great accuracy was aimed at in these experiments; the
object being to establish in a general manner the alteration of
the relation of viscosity to concentration at different tempera
tures, rather than the accurate determination of the viscosity
of the different solutions  used.
   The acid used contained 2 per cent. of water. It was free
from lead.     Four solutions were used in addition to the undi

By multiplying the numbers in the last column by '027, the
viscosity of the particular solution at the temperature of the
experiment is obtained relatively to that of water at 20°. The
numbers in the fourth column give approximately the effect
of the siphon due to the end of the tube, F, being below the

                       Viscosity of Solutions.                  225
    The results of the experiments recorded in the Tables are
shown graphically in the curves marked fig. 1 (Plate XI.),
the ordinates of points of which are given by the numbers in
the last column (less 75); the abscissae being the temperatures
given in the first column.
   At first the most viscous solution is that denoted by B;
the others follow in the order C, A, D, E. The A curve
crosses that of C at about 37°, and that of B at about 65°, so
that at temperatures higher than this the order of the viscosi
ties of the solutions is the same as that of their concentrations.
    In fig. 2 the coordinates are viscosity and concentration,
expressed by the amount of water added to 100 of H2SO,
and the viscosities of the different solutions, at intervals of ten
degrees, are marked.      Definite curves are not drawn at the
lower temperatures, but the different points corresponding to
the same temperature are joined by straight lines.          If more
solutions had been used curves          might  have been drawn
throughout in this diagram, which would then have been
much more satisfactory.
    These results may be explained as being due to the           in
creasing dissociation of the hydrate H2SO4. H2O as the
temperature rises.     It is noteworthy that these experiments
show, as far as they go, that the viscosity of solutions of sul
phuric acid varies with the concentration and temperature in
the same kind of way as the electrical resistance as determined
by Kohlrausch.
    For subsequent experiments an improved apparatus was
fitted up suitable for liquids less viscous than those previously
used. The capacity of the bulb of the new apparatus was
52.5 cub. centim. The beaker of water, by which the bulb
and capillary tube were kept at the required temperature, was
in these experiments jacketed by being put in a box and sur
rounded with cotton waste.       Two apertures, in opposite sides
of the box, enabled the bulb to be seen. The pressures were
measured by means of a water-gauge, the height of which
was observed by a cathetometer.
               Experiment on Acetic-acid Solutions.
    A similar set of experiments was made on solutions of
 acetic acid, but more solutions were used. The viscosity of
 each was observed at temperatures varying between 20° and
 80°. Some experiments were tried at 100°, but they are not
recorded here since they were vitiated to a great extent,
 owing to the formation of bubbles in the bulb and tube.        The
 experimental    numbers are given in Tables VI. to           XVII.
 From these numbers a set of viscosity-temperature            curves

226                         Mr. R. F. D'Arcy        on the
were drawn, similar to those given in fig. 1 for sulphuric
acid. The curves given in fig. 3 are derived from these just
as those in fig. 2 are obtained from fig. 1.
   These curves show clearly that the hydrate is not com
pletely dissociated in the solutions used at these temperatures,
this is in accordance with the difficulty experienced in sepa
rating water from acetic acid by distillation.

heated to 70° undergoes a change which is easily traced by
the colour changing from violet to green, and that on cooling
the solution remains for a long time green, but gradually

has passed, unnoticed.
          Experiments on Solutions               of Calcium Chloride.
    These were undertaken with a view to investigate the
viscosities of solutions of the same salt in different solvents.
For this purpose viscosities of solutions of calcium chloride *
 [!, I'o, o normal] in water, ethyl alcohol, and methyl
alcohol were determined.                  Considerable trouble was taken
to purify the substances used.                As no obvious relation appears
to exist an account of            only   a few of the experiments is given
in the following Table.                   The noteworthy result of these
experiments is that the increase of viscosity on adding
calcium chloride to either of the alcohols is much greater
than that produced when it is added to water.                      Perhaps the
explanation of this is to be found in the superior dissociating
action of the water.

    1. The Deduction       of the Elementary Theory of Lenses and
                      Mirrors from Ware Principles.
    NTRODUCTOR Y.-The               division of Optics into a “geo
      metrical"    part,   founded upon the treatment of the
subject from the ray point of view, and a “physical” part,
founded upon the treatment of the subject from the wave
point of view, has long seemed illogical.              Experience in
the   teaching   of the science    suggests   that it would be pre
ferable to adopt the wave theory as a common basis, provided
the formulae of lenses and mirrors which form the staple
of geometrical optics are as readily established on wave prin
ciples as on ray principles.        Five years ago the author of
these notes made an attempt to rewrite the elementary part
of geometrical optics on wave principles; and though hitherto
he has published nothing on the subject, he has subjected the
method to the test of experience, and has made it the basis of
his optical lectures year by year. The form finally adopted,
and now for the first time set forth, has been modified from
time to time and simplified.        As a result, whilst the formulae
for second     approximations,    aberration and the like, can be
deduced     with no greater difficulty than in the orthodox
way, the elementary formulae for first approximations are
much more simply deduced, and do not even require the use of
trigonometrical functions.       This is the more striking because,
as   allteachers     the subject know, the very first assumptions
                      of
made       inestablishing   the elementary formulae          spherical      of
mirrors and lenses are that        angles   may                 be
                                                      written instead
of   their sines       tangents. The assumptions made
                          or                                       the               in

Waves march always at right angles to their surfaces; a
change in the form of the surface alters the direction of
march.   The wave-surface is to be considered instead of
the “ray.” The curvature of the surface therefore becomes
the all-important consideration.     All that any lens or mirror
or any system of lenses or mirrors can do to a wave of light
is to imprint a curvature upon the surface of the wave.                                                          If
the wave is initially a plane wave, then the curvature imprinted
upon it by the lens or mirror will result in making it either
march toward a point (a real focus) or march as from a point
                                                                                                               º
(a virtual focus).                    If
                         the wave possesses an initial curvature,
then       all
         that the lens      mirror can     or        imprint another     do    is      to
curvature   upon        surface,   its
                                   the resultant curvature

     If the method of reckoning curvatures by means of the
sagitta required justification, that is afforded by the fact that
the practical method of measuring the curvatures of lenses
and mirrors by the spherometer consists essentially in applying
a micrometer-screw to measure the sagitta of the arc subtended
by a fixed chord, the diameter of the contact circle drawn
through the three feet of the instrument.                In this case, as

is silvered, so that the light passes twice through the lens, and
suffers an intermediate reflexion at the silvered surface.                                                         If

   The quantity of energy E lost per second by radiation
during the constant luminosity of the platinum wire is pro
portional to the product of the resistance w of the wire, and
the square of the intensity of the current i, or, if they are
measured in ohms and amperes,
                             E=0.24 wi",
where 0.24 is the necessary factor of reduction to convert
energies measured in ohms and amperes into gramme-calories
per second".
    In order to determine these quantities a Wheatstone's
bridge (fig. 2) was constructed in the following mannerf:—
   The branch 1 contained a vertical rectangular bar of wood,
2, surrounded by oil, upon which various constant known
resistances were formed, as well as the reflecting galvano
meter gi, serving to measure the strength of the current with
the strong currents which had to be used here. . A thick
copper ring was employed instead of a multiplier, the resist
ance of which and its connexions was k.
   The branch 2 was formed by the platinum wire d to be inves
tigated, whose resistance at temperature t may be called wº.
   The branch 3 contained a large resistance of y nominal
Siemens units, and branch 4 a box of resistance-coils of from
1 to 5000 Siemens units, the accuracy of which had been
previously tested.
   The heating-current entered at the point 1, 3, and was
                                 .
furnished by six large Bunsen cells arranged three in series
(the reason for not employing a Gramme or dynamo is given
further on), and was led              at the point 2,4. A variable
resistance included in the circuit at W permitted the variation
of the strength of the current, and with it the heat produced,
and consequently the luminosity.
   The resistance of the branches 3 and 4 was always so great
in comparison with 1 and 2 that the variations of the current
caused no perceptible variation in the intensity of the current
in 1 and 2. (The resistance of 1 and 2 never exceeded 2
Siemens units, and the resistance in 3 and 4 was not less than
400 Siemens units.)
    The sensitive galvanometer g, serving for the measurement
of the resistances was inserted between the points 1, 2 and 3,4.
By changing the plugs in the box of resistance-coils in
branch 4 the resistance was altered until the galvanometer
remained at rest on opening and closing the key.

means of a voltameter.
    The resistance of the platinum wire at the ordinary tempe
rature of 15° was determined by means of an ordinary Wheat
stone bridge, with one Leclanché cell to furnish the current,

   Within the visible spectrum the like is shown by older
experiments. Thus, M. Violle finds that between 954° and
1775° the intensity for the C-line increases 154 times, for the
D-line 219 times, and for the E-line 307 times. The inten
sity therefore increases the more slowly the less refrangible
the rays are.   Moreover the total radiation contains the infra
red rays, whose increase will be much slower than is shown
by the above numbers. At the same time we see that even
at the highest temperature the radiation in the infra-red
furnishes an overwhelming contribution to the total radiation.
For the extraordinarily rapid increase of the radiation in the
visible part of the spectrum is not sufficient, as the numbers
given above show, to compensate the very much slower
increase in the infra-red.
   Herr H. Schneebeli"    has obtained the same results in expe
riments with Swan lamps. Whilst the total radiation increased
in the proportion of 1 to 4, the optical radiation increased in
the proportion of 0-3 to 24. The Swan lamps are, however,
scarcely so highly exhausted but that one must suppose that
a portion of the             i.
                      of energy is due to convection. Further
H. Schneebeli employed a gramme-machine to furnish the

the   amyl-acetate    lamp in absolute measure, the distance
between the slit and the wire was 44 millim. This is made
up of the distance of the slit from the edge of the glass tube
and the radius of the tube.        The distance of the amyl-acetate

   24. After this determination we may further compare the
brightness of the amyl acetate lamp for the yellow with that
of a gas-flame coloured yellow by sodium, according to the
method of Herr Ebert”, and thus the latter also with the
brightness of the yellow of glowing platinum.
   If, then, we wish to determine the ratio of the radiation of
the sodium flame corresponding only to the yellow sodium
lines and the total energy of radiation of the glowing plati
num, we must first determine the ratio of the latter to the
radiation which reaches a definite portion of the yellow.
   For this purpose we will make use of the results of
Mouton f, by assuming, without doubt correctly, that the
temperature of the platinum wire in our absolute measure
ments is nearly equal to that of the platinum wire in
Mouton's Bourbouze lamp.
   If  this is not exactly the case, and consequently the final
value is not quite accurate, yet        order                its
                                                  magnitude can               of                           in

With     the concentration      chosen   1  cub. centim. of the flame
contains
                       4.8   x 10-7 gr. sodium.
    Let us now calculate the quantity of sodium in a parallelo
piped of unit height and breadth, therefore of the unit of
radiating surface and of the thickness of the flame as depth,
i.e. 2 cub. centim.; it contains in round numbers

                       9-6 x 10-7 gr. sodium.
    This quantity of 9-6 x 10-7 gr. sodium therefore radiates
the quantity of energy per second

     E=000203;                      =0.00308 cm. g. sec. calories.
 The coefficient of total emission     of sodium, i.e. the quantity    of
energy radiated by 1 gr. sodium         in the two yellow lines of the
Bunsen flame amounts to
                     3210 g. calories per second,
from which we obtain upon the assumption (no doubt not
 strictly correct) of equal brightness, 1600 gr. calories per
 second for each line.
    An atom of sodium weighing 1.7 x 10-" gr. emits per
second
                       5.5  x 10-" gr.     calories.
    27. We found before that 1 gr. platinum radiates on the
 whole 2.2 x 10° gr. calories per second, now we find that with
 sodium for the two isolated spectrum lines the same value
 amounts to 3.2 x 10°, which is not so much less.         It is as if the
 energy emitted, which with platinum is distributed through
 out the entire spectrum, were with sodium concentrated in
 the two lines.                                    -

tinum wire to that of the sodium flame was almost the same
as in the previous experiments in which the wire was heated
by a current.        There is no object in giving the particular
values here.
   In exactly the same way experiments were made with solu
tion of strontium chloride, which yields a spectrum of bands,
solutions equivalent to the sodium chloride solution being
scattered in the flame.              The result obtained was that the
total brightness is of the same order as that of the sodium
flame, which also may be inferred from the strong colora
tion of the flame.
   Here, therefore, nearly the same total energy is distributed
over a series of bands.
   32. We will now determine the ratio of the true coefficients
of emission of two sources of light. For this purpose let
us consider the following points:—
                                                        º
   If   we have a narrow spectral line whose boundaries are at
Al and A2, and if we examine this with a spectral-photometer
of small dispersion, it appears in the spectrum of the same
width as the slit.          Let the dispersion         |. so chosen that the
edges of the slit correspond to wave-lengths A and A+A in
the spectrum.         If   then, by means of a spectrophotometer,
we   compare     the  brightness       of the spectrum line A and of a
continuous      spectrum,      then each point in the image of the
                                                                     iº.

continuous       spectrum        each     point    receives    rays

length A are in the two cases i' and              i'   respectively, then the
total intensities      Ji   and J2 in the first and second image
respectively are:—

                                                  • 'A
The quantities i' and i" are proportional to the true coefficients
of emission ; the ratio of the intensities is therefore
                                   A2         A+ A

   In   the simplest case we may assume that i' and i” are con
stants, i.  e. that the spectral lines between A1 and A2, as also
the continuous spectrum between A and A+A, possess every
where the same brightness, then

  We may determine i'/i" directly,           if we observe with a
 spectrophotometer possessing so great a dispersion that the
 line also appears as a continuous band, for then the slit
 appears illuminated by homogeneous light of a width which
 is distinctly smaller than the spectral image of the line, it
 behaves therefore as a portion of a continuous spectrum ;
 instead of Ag-A1 we have A, and that the more accurately
 the greater the dispersion, and the ratio of brightness measured
 in the apparatus is itself i'/i".
    In order to determine the ratio i'<U+017F>" for a sodium flame and
 the amyl-acetate lamp, the following arrangement was made:—
 The spectrum apparatus consisted of two telescopes belonging
 to Herr Ebert and a plane Rowland’s grating.               The colli
 mator was provided with an arrangement for symmetrically
 narrowing down the slit, and had an aperture of 65 millim.
 and a focal length of 1 metre; the observing-telescope an
 aperture of 75 millim. and a focal length of 1 metre.              The
 grating had a divided surface of 46 x 36 millim. and possessed
very good definition. The slit was made very narrow.                 For
 the determination of the maximum of           brightness    a  totally
 reflecting prism was placed before one half of the slit ; the
beam of light from an arc lamp fell upon the uncovered half of
the slit, after having traversed two adjustable Nicols. The
light from the sodium flame or amyl-acetate lamp entered
the apparatus through the totally-reflecting prism.            First the
sodium flame was brought before the prism, the apparatus
adjusted for the greatly expanded sodium lines of the fourth
spectrum by turning the grating, and the spectrum of the
arc lamp weakened by turning one of the Nicols until it
appeared of equal brightness with the sodium lines in that
part of the spectrum.
    Then the sodium flame was replaced by the amyl-acetate
lamp, and adjusted           for
                             the yellow      of the first diffractive
spectrum. Since the light              the electric lamp was much
                                       of
brighter than that    ofthe amyl-acetate     lamp      was weakened
                                                       it
by   clouded glasses    ofknown strength till the two spectra
were  of  equal brightness.        direct comparison

fourth    spectrum  was not     possible,   because        the fourth

spectra of different orders.      This is also confirmed by a
simple experiment.     If an equality of brightness between the
arc-light and the amyl-acetate light had been established in
the first spectrum by the use of clouded glasses, this equality
was also observed in the second and third spectra.
   The comparison in brightness between the arc lamp and
amyl-acetate lamp was made at a point a little distance from
the yellow, on the side of the green, so that it might not be
disturbed by sodium contained in the arc. The results of
experiment are as follows:–The breadth of a sodium line is
                            |.
+ of the distance between       the two lines.     The brightness
diminishes from the centre      rapidly,  then more slowly, and at
the edges more rapidly again.       The measurements were made
at about 4 of the            from the edge after the brightness
of the arc-light had been made equal to that of the sodium flame
by rotation of the Nicol, it had then to be reduced to 34 to be of
the same brightness as the amyl-acetate lamp.
   The brightness of our sodium lamp therefore for rays
situated about 4 of the breadth of a sodium line from                                                  its
edge     is   34
             times greater than that        the amyl-acetate lamp of

           upon the         empirical relations discoverable be
tween the specific refractive energies of selenium and sulphur.
The present state of the data, however, relating to these sub
stances is so far unsatisfactory that we are not furnished with
refractive indices and density taken from the same specimen
at the same temperature.       Thus there is a doubt as to the
      i.
density to be chosen as normal, in consequence of the differ
ence       to the allotropic conditions in which these substances
are found. This difficulty may be to a certain extent eluded
by taking both densities and calculating the specific refractive
energy for both. The result             the case    is,
                                                     selenium and

       On the Density and Refraction of Gaseous Elements.                                                         269
refractive energies of nitrogen, chlorine, and phosphorus are
nearly identical, as also of sulphur and oxygen.        It will also
be observed that in N, Cl, P this log. is double of that of
H, and S and O three times that of half the log. specific re
fractive energy of hydrogen.      In the same way, the log. of the
specific refractive energy of mercury is 8 times, and arsenic
9 times this quantity.
     Ifwe turn to column W. we find that oxygen has nearly
double the refractive energy of hydrogen, mercury 4, arsenic
8, sulphur, but not so closely, 12 times.
   Now          all
             these coincidences arise from observation only, and
are  independent        theory altogether.

   When we turn         the compounds, we again see indications
                                 to
of  the same law.         Thus N.O has log. specific refractive

and half this          is       '09789; this              is   according             toProf. Everett's
data.          Mr. Lupton’s give '09374.                            If       we     multiply these suc
cessively         by   1,   2,      ...
                       and 10, we shall find that almost     the                                            all
logarithms range between these two products, being less than

which,      quite fortuitous, will nevertheless prove

  Note by Prof.        A. W. RücKER, F.R.S.,                on   Mr. Dale's Paper.
     It has   been shown that the volume                of the molecules in unit
 volume of the substance which                 they   form is (u”—1)/(u”--2),
 where u is the refractive index.
     If u is nearly equal to unity (as in the case of the gases)
 this  expression      reduces to 3 (u-1). , Hence if 8 is the density
 of the body, v and m the volume and mass of a molecule and
 n the number of molecules in unit volume,

272             Mr.       J.   C. McConnel on Diffraction-Colours,
For the         substance the right-hand side should be a
                 same
constant, and it has been shown that it nearly fulfils this
condition.
  Mr. Dale now states that for different substances
                                                 logº." = ac,
where c is a constant independent of the nature of the
substance, and a is an integer. This at once leads to the
relation w/m =#ene, which would indicate that the ratios of the
volumes to the masses of the molecules are in geometrical
progression, or, more shortly, the densities of the molecules
are in geometrical progression.
     If,
       then, Mr. Dale's conclusions are correct this would                                                     be

   To pass from the illumination on a screen, due to a single

follow the lines of the previous argument, with, however,
considerable simplification, owing to the orientation of a
sphere being a matter of indifference.    We have to multiply
     by the number n of drops within an angular area equal to

   In   a very interesting  paper (Trans. Roy. Soc. Edinb. July
 1886) Lord Rayleigh has set out a curve representing the
series of colours of thin plates on Maxwell's form of Newton’s
diagram.      Before such a calculation had been made, it would
have been impossible to predict from theory, except in the
very roughest manner, the nature of these colours, though the
exact composition of the light in terms of wave-lengths were
thoroughly known.         The reading of this paper made me
anxious to obtain a more complete theory of the splendid
colours of iridescent clouds, and                          I
                                           have incidentally deter
mined some of the colours of various diffraction-patterns.
This led to the discovery of a serious blunder which                                   I
made in my former paper on iridescent clouds, in supposing
that the central band in the diffraction-pattern of a slit was
colourless.     I was following high authority, for Verdet says
(Leçons d'Optique Physique, § 70), “on aperçoit au centre du
phénomène une bande blanche et brillante, qui est située sur
la direction normale à la fente diffringente.” As soon as
attention is called to the matter, it is obvious that the edge
must be reddish, since the breadth of the band in homogeneous
light is proportional to the wave-length ; and, as a matter of
fact, this red fringe is the finest red of the whole series.     The
centre of the band is a pale though bright blue.            But this
depends on the introduction of the factor A-" in the expression
for the secondary vibration, the necessity for which was not
recognized in Verdet’s time.                        I
                                     do not remember seeing the
coloration of the central band     distinctly  pointed out, though
it is implicitly  contained in a statement of Verdet in the very
section       I
            have quoted.     He says that, when white light is
used, the red bands correspond to the absence of the brightest
part    (i.  the yellow)

correct, for my results show that they correspond                 the          to

Looking at the table below, we see
            (36)=0.48(24) + 1.25(44)–0.02(68);

of (36) is indistinguishable in hue, depth, or brightness from a
mixture of 0.48 of (24) with 1:25 of (44). The position of (36)

to 0.48, 1:25, and –0:02, placed at the three corners (24),

algebraic sum of the corresponding multiples of the three
corner units.      Then if any colour C be composed of the colour
A of                  a, and of the colour B of brightness 8,

     The white obtained by superimposing                                         unit widths at the
ten points is given by

The chief defect of this table is the omission of the red

corner (24). This has been in great measure allowed for by
modifying the coefficients for (20) and (28). At the same
time the white was brought to practical coincidence with the
white of Lord Rayleigh's table.
   On the diagram (Pl. X.) are marked the positions of sixteen
points equidistant in the prismatic spectrum, from 20 to 80 on
Maxwell's scale, with the corresponding wave-lengths. These
lie, for the most part, outside the triangle.   Rood has deter
mined the places in the spectrum which, when diluted with
a   suitable amount of white, match the colours of certain
pigments (“Modern Chromatics,” p. 38).               had no data for             I

At  the central point of the diffraction-pattern   (aëlf-0) the
brightness is a maximum (instead of being zero as in the case
of a thin plate, when W =0), and the colour-factor is A-".
About 250 the curve passes very near white, on the side
towards blue-green.     The colour then becomes yellowish,
gradually improving, till at 450 a very fine orange is at
tained.   And so on through the well-known series. When
the retardation is large the curve approaches nearer and
nearer to white, and, in the case of diffraction, the brightness
diminishes indefinitely.
  Along the diagonals of the pattern, where the colours are
the purest, the factor is

I have determined   two points on the curve, Di in the first red
(ag/f=500), and D, in     the second green (aš/f=810).        The
curve starts from the    point  A-", and afterwards for several
sweeps keeps outside of the thin-plate curve. The first orange
yellow and the second blue of the latter admit of but little
improvement.     But in the first red, which borders the central
spot, the diagonals are far superior to the principal directions.
   We now come to the main object of the present paper, the
colours of iridescent clouds, formed by needles of ice. The
colour-factor is

Comparing this with the factor for thin plates we see that the
greater wave-lengths have an advantage. So the curve                 is,   on
the whole, displaced from the violet and towards the red.

violet components of two colours are 536, 338, '042; 265,
’114, '084 respectively.    The components of white are 2.01,

part of the spectrum where the colour is generally considered
poor. It seems probable that, when nearly swamped with
white light, the colours would assert themselves nearly in pro
portion to their brilliancy. At the worst the brilliancy curves
will be useful for comparing colours of similar hues.
    In Plate X, is given a curve representing the brilliancy of
iridescent ice-clouds in accordance with the expression (6).
Owing to the occurrence of £ in the denominator the bril
liancy is infinite when                        f
                            is zero, and decreases rapidly as #
increases. The ordinates of the latter portion of the curve
are drawn on a scale five times as great as those of the former.
The points where the nearest approach is made to the pure
colours of the spectrum are marked by the letter p. Under
the most favourable circumstances in the clouds, when        the                                 all

0.013".          An atmosphere is defined                       to     be the mass              of air
 traversed by a line drawn vertically upwards from the level
 of the sea. The value depends on two series of observations
 on particularly fine days at South Kensington, when the air
 thicknesses were about 1:3 and 3:3 atmospheres.         Taking the
 colour of the sun outside the     atmosphere   as the point W, the
   oints S5, Slo, Sso, So on the diagram give the colour of sun
  ight which has traversed 5, 10, 20, and 40 atmospheres
respectively.     The first two are yellow inclining to orange,
the third a fine orange, and the fourth redder than red lead.
To the colour of the fourth, wave-lengths less than 529 con
tribute nothing appreciable; and even in the third the violet
sensation is mainly due to wave-length 663.         For an observer
at sea-level the first three thicknesses occur when the
apparent zenith distance of the sun is 784°, 85°, and 873°.
#.     apparent Z.D. 90° the thickness is 35-5 atmospherest.
The additional 4-5 atmospheres can be secured by ascending
a height of 330 feet, while from a height of 3000 feet the
coloration due to 50 atmospheres can be studied. The same
action is exhibited to some extent by clouds near the horizon
and by distant snow mountains.         For example, the Alps seen
from    Berne,  forty  miles away,  look yellowish.    But here the
colour is interfered with by the intervening “blue sky.” In
other words, the particles, which sift the blue waves out of
the light from the snow, send to the observer a by no means
negligible quantity of scattered sunlight.
     t is only when the colour of the sun is white that the sky
is represented by      x-'.             If

    Speaking of thermochemical measurement in this case,
 L., Meyer states “according to               J.
                                       Thomsen's experiments,
 although the action of one acid upon the other, and the action
 of the salts on each other, do not produce any effect capable
 of measurement, still each acid produces a greater or less
 thermic effect with its own salt.”   And in the case of decom
 position of a salt by an acid, he says “the extent of the de
 composition can be determined from the value of the thermic
 effect.” “But for this determination it is necessary to make
 an extensive series of experiments, showing the thermo
 chemical effect of each pair of the substances in question.
 The action of each acid on the base must be separately deter
 mined, then the action of each acid on its own salt, and also
 on the salt of the other acid, and finally the mutual action of
 the two acids.”   “The greatest possible care has to be exer
cised in each individual determination, in order that the result
 may be trustworthy; if due caution is not observed utterly
false results are easily obtained.”    “Secondary thermic re
sults are also   produced   by  the mutual action of the other
bodies.” (“Modern Theories of Chemistry,           pp. 466–468.)
According to        J.
                   Thomsen, the value of the thermal change
attending the reaction of dilute sulphuric upon dilute nitric
acid “is so small that it cannot be accurately determined"
 (‘Principles of Chemistry, p. 435).
  If,   however,          we
                       employ the “voltaic-balance” method
instead   of the thermochemical one, not only the chemical

  It  has already been shown by the voltaic-balance method,
that the action of chemical affinity between substances in
aqueous solution is not limited to small groups of a few dis
similar kinds of molecules, such as those represented in
Tables       to VIII., but extends to large aggregates com

posed of a variety of molecules, the aggregates being appa
rently without limit of magnitude or variety, but subject to
the law of chemical equivalence. The results given in Table
IX. further support        statement. The complex structure
in such cases is usually built up by making each addition
chemically equivalent to the whole of the previously existin
            (see “A Method of Detecting dissolved Chemica
Compounds and their Combining Proportions,” Roy. Soc.

       Each of these two series shows the depression of energy at
   the combining proportion, attending complete chemical union
   of the two substances.        The excess of either ingredient appears
   to exist largely as uncombined mixture.                         e two chief
   causes which appear to determine the magnitudes of voltaic
   energy are, strength of chemical union of the dissolved sub
                                              º
   stances with zinc, and dilution of the definite compound by
   the substance in excess; at the combining proportion the
   latter influence does not exist because there is no substance
   in excess.      In the upper part of each series these two causes
   cooperate, whilst in the lower part they counteract each
   other: in the upper part, the                          substance being in
   excess, enlarges the magnitudes ; in the lower part the weaker
   one is in excess, and diminishes them. The influence of dilu
   tion appears to preponderate over that of chemical union
   generally in each series.           Variation of amount of excess of
   acid has in each series a much greater effect than variation of
   excess of salt.         The following are the curves representing
   the above numbers:—

amount of voltaic energy of the resulting mixture ; and that
these were more or less determined or fixed at that moment,
and were not rendered alike in the different cases by the
subsequent dilution necessary for the voltaic measurement.
 Similar results occurred with a mixture of potassic iodide and
chlorine (Roy. Soc. Proc. vol. xlv. p. 440).                                Probably the
 smaller amounts of voltaic energy of the                          liquids      made from
 the more concentrated original solutions were due to more

the mixture of sodium nitrate and sulphuric acid was much

that variation of degree of dilution did not change the amount

    In taking the mean          I  have ignored the difference in the
weights due to the number of observations, as the other errors
are so much greater than those due to estimating the swing
of the needle incorrectly.
    It will be seen that the series with one discharge is some
what greater than those with a larger number. This may arise
from the uncertainty of the correction for the greater number
                        I
of discharges, and think it is best to weight them inversely
as this number.        As the first series has also nearly twice the
                             I
number of any other, have weighted them as follows:–
                         Weight.            cx 10-9.

Or v=29,815,000,000 cm. per second.
   It  is impossible to estimate the weight of this determination.
It is slightly smaller than the velocity of light, but still
   }.
so near to it that the difference may well be due to errors of
experiment.
             the difference amounts to a little more than half of
one per cent.
   It is seen that there is a systematic falling-off in the value
of the ratio. This is the reason of my delaying the publica
tion for ten years.
   Had the correction, A, for the number of discharges been
omitted, this difference would have vanished ; but the cor
rection seems perfectly certain, and                 I   see no cause for

the  various arms of the bridge, through the galvanometer
from D to C. When p touches R the two surfaces of the
condenser are connected, and the latter discharges itself
.
through D R.            If
                     now the armature be made to vibrate con
tinuously there will be a series of momentary currents through
the galvanometer, and by adjusting the resistance a (c and
d being large, fixed resistances), these interrupted currents
may be exactly counterbalanced by the steady current from
C to D, and the resultant deflexion of the galvanometer is
zero. When this is the case there is a relation between the
          of the condenser, the number of times the latter is
charged and discharged per second, and the resistances in the
                       -T
various arms of the bridge.      Maxwell gives an approximate
value of this relation. Thomson's more complete investigation
gives the following equation                :-

where n is the number of complete oscillations of the armature
p per second; C is the capacity of the condenser in electro
magnetic measure; and the other letters the resistances of the
various arms of the bridge, as shown in fig. 1. In the present
case the values of these resistances were about as follows:—
          a   = 40 to 1900 ohms.                          d = 100,000 ohms.
          b   =    0 nearly.                 g              =      6,000    ,
          c   =   1,570,000 to 2,450,000 ohms.
Owing to the very high values of      c and d as compared with
a,   b,   and g, the above equation may be replaced by the ap
proximate one, C          =    º   *
                                       which is true to within         a   hundredth

by calculation from the geometrical constants of the con

determined by Glazebrook, Oct. 1887, is 9:99416 at 16°5 C.
The other two had been previously carefully compared with
this. The values of the resistances of box A adopted were the
means of three different and closely agreeing determinations,
made at different temperatures. The several coils of box B
were carefully compared with the known resistances of A.
The temperature-coefficients of both boxes were also carefully
determined.

This value is reliable to within one part in five thousand.
   It is proper to add that if these graphite resistances are put
into a circuit where there is a large difference of potential
between their terminals, their resistance is immediately
diminished by heating.      With three Bunsen cells used in
measuring their resistance no heating was perceptible.        In
the determination of capacity there was a difference of
potential between the terminals always less than two volts,
and usually less than one.       When the temperatures were
                                                                           .
maintained constant, the resistance after use was always pre
cisely the same as before.    While, therefore, the use of high
graphite resistances is somewhat restricted where great accuracy
is desired, they still may serve a very useful purpose in man
cases, and are the most convenient and reliable of any
resistance, aside from metal wires, that                  I

                       Arrangement of the Apparatus.
   The vibrators were fixed as near as possible to the condenser
to reduce the capacity of the charging wires to a minimum.
The condenser, galvanometer, and other parts of the apparatus
were insulated with great care, and yet in spite of           pre    all
cautions  leakage   made        its

 of the condenser.

the number 8540.9 is true to within less than a gram.   This
would make the error in r less than .0005 cm.
   These values of the radii are confirmed by the following
direct measurements, made on a dividing-engine,        using
calipers and a standard metre-bar by Bartels and Diederichs,
Göttingen, whose length is accurately known. Three mutually
perpendicular diameters of the shell were found to be

giving r=12.6791, a very close agreement in view of the
difficulty of setting the calipers. More accurate measure

    It is perhaps  somewhat accidental that these values coincide
so closely with the values of the radii found by the first
method. Their importance is not insisted upon further than
as furnishing satisfactory confirmation of the results of the
other and more accurate method.
   It will be seen that in ball A no diameter differs from the
mean by as much as a tenth of a millimetre, and in B the

   The wire was first in contact at m (fig. 3), and the          re
sistance a corresponding to joint capacity of condenser and
charging-system was 1930-0 ohms. The wire was now lifted
very slightly, and 194-0 ohms found to give no deflexion on
closing the key in the galvanometer-circuit.        The wire was
then lowered to make     contact, and the subsequent  observations
in the order of the numbers made. Any leakage increases
the numbers alike in the first two columns, and if constant
does not affect the differences, which give the capacity of the
condenser.     But the leakages are not constant, so that small
differences are thereby introduced ; this accounts in part for
the differences above, though of course small differences are
inevitable if there be no leakage. On June 6 the wooden
base of the condenser was thoroughly wet with a cloth; and
the leakage thereby introduced changed the readings from
1924-0–186.0 to 1933-0–1950, the difference, 1738-0,
remaining unaltered.

   According to Matthiessen and Vogt, the electrical conduc
tivity of the alloys of bismuth is modified by the first heating
and the first cooling.   If \o be the original value, and Aoi the
conductivity after cooling, we have the following results:—

These variations doubtless depend upon permanent changes
in the molecular structure.
   The conductivity of molten bismuth increases as the tem
perature is lowered; it diminishes rapidly when the metal
solidifies, according to the researches of Matteucci and
Matthiessen, and increases again as the solidified mass cools.
If small traces of tin or lead be added to the molten bismuth,
according to Matthiessen, the conductivity at first diminishes,
as in the case of solid metals, and afterwards increases.
    Fr. Weber has found for the specific electrical con
ductivity of bismuth (C. G.S.) 0.838 x 10-"; and L. Lorenz
has given for the same quantity the values
          0-929 x 10-5 at 0°; and 0.630 x 10-5 at 100°.
     M. Leduc’”               that the electrical resistance of
                      has observed
wires made of an    alloy of bismuth and lead increases when
the temperature is raised. He has also observed a difference
     ºl.
between the electrical properties of wires and of thin plates of
commercially pure bismuth, which he attributes to the method
of              and to the very different rates of cooling.
     ore recently f the same physicist has found the following
results with bismuth which had been run into a tube and then
slowly cooled.    When the bismuth is heated for the first
time, say to 100°, it undergoes an annealing the effect of
                                                                              0° 30
which is to diminish                 its
                          initial resistance about     per cent.
During this operation, between the temperatures       and 100°,
the following formula   obtained, which must

according to the formula             :-
              rº-ro (1+0-00375t 4 000008t”),
and the mean coefficient of variation of the resistance between
09 and 100° is then 0-00155.
   For a thin plate of bismuth, Leduc has found that after
annealing the resistance decreases, between 0°
                                                       and 70°,
according to the following formula:-
                      re-ro(1–0.00158t-H 0-00000437t").
And this gives the number –0.001.27 for the coefficient of
variation with the temperature between 0° and 70°. The re
sistance of the metal thus prepared would be much greater
than that given by Matthiessen, perhaps more than double
the value found by him, no doubt because of the difference of
molecular structure of the specimens examined.
   In 1884, Prof. Righi" published a very remarkable paper,
and we will sum up those of his conclusions which bear
directly upon our researches.
   1. The resistance of commercial bismuth increases on heat
ing between certain limits of temperature, and
                                                            decreases
between others (generally it decreases at temperatures near
the ordinary temperature), and, by constructing a curve of
resistance, with the temperatures as abscissae, and
                                                         the specific
resistances as ordinates, we obtain in general a curve in the
form of an M. There is a maximum at a low temperature, then
a minimum, then a second maximum a little below fusing
point, and finally a second minimum after the change
                                                             of state.
   2. The resistance of commercial bismuth varies not only
with the temperature, but also with the manner in which the
piece has been prepared, and with the temper of
                                                       the metal.
   3. Chemically pure bismuth behaves like other metals; it
is not sensibly affected by tempering, and at 0°           resistance   its
compared with that              of
                           mercury     1:15.
                                           is
   4.  The difference between pure and commercial bismuth                     is
        to           tin, which give
                        byof
due       traces                                       to
                                             the latter properties
similar      to
            those     which steel differs from iron.
   5.  On adding        bismuth tin
                           to             increasing amounts, the
                                                in
specific resistance becomes much greater                    up
                                                          maximum,
                                                                 to  a
and then diminishes.
   6. The presence        tin  ofincreasing amounts modifies the
                                     in
curve    of resistance,         in
                            the same manner           temper more
                                                            as   a
and more hard would do.

                   the Electrical Resistance      of Bismuth.            835
 by Prof. Righi can be partly accounted for by the discon
 tinuity of the bismuth wires.
     G. P. Grimaldi" has studied the thermoelectric pro
 Y.         of bismuth, and has confirmed the analogies
    rof. Righi has found between pure bismuth and iron, the
 bismuth containing tin and steel.

     A. von Ettingshausen and W. Nernst f have obtained
 results which are recorded in the following Table, where w is
 the electrical conductivity in absolute measure, and a the co
 efficient of variation of the electrical resistance with the tem
 perature.       The plates denoted by Bi were made of absolutely
 pure bismuth ; the other plates denoted by                  LI to LIV were

     The electrical resistance increases then (between 0° and
 30°) for every alloy, when the temperature is raised; it
 decreases on the contrary for pure bismuth under the same
 conditions.       On increasing the quantity of tin, the coefficient
 of temperature a also increases. The conductivity decreases
 rapidly by the addition of small quantities of tin, and increases
 again afterwards.
     C. L. Webert has found that the resistance of the metal
 under consideration at first decreased up to about 100°, the
coefficient of temperature being –0.0006; and then                       in
creased up to the melting-point.              The position of the mini
 mum, however, is displaced by repeated heatings and coolings
between 80° and 120°.                                 -
    The same physicist has also observed that the electrical
resistance of alloys of bismuth and tin, containing from 10
to 80 per cent. of bismuth, increases between 0° and 120°,
as the temperature is raised.

solution of bismuth was then distributed among  10 glass
beakers holding about 4 litres each. The bismuth was pre
cipitated as oxychloride on addition of water. The precipi
tate was decanted and washed until no trace of HCl could
be found.     Then it was again dissolved in HCl, the bismuth
precipitated as oxychloride, and washed as before. And this
was done twelve times. The precipitate finally obtained was
carefully washed again, then dissolved in HCl. The bismuth
in this solution, to which water had been added, was precipi
tated by the addition of ammonia and ammonium carbonate.
After decantation the precipitate was washed with water,
until    all

                                  Third Method.
   The metal, after having been purified by the preceding
methods, was subjected to electrolysis to take away com
pletely any trace of lead. Prof. Classen, who is at present
engaged in determining the atomic           of bismuth, intends
to describe this electrolytic method in detail.
                      Researches with the Spectrum.
    To produce the bismuth spectrum a large Ruhmkorff’s coil
with a Leyden jar intercalated was used, and the spark ob
tained between rods of the metal. The spectrometer employed
was one of Meyerstein's with a Schroeder direct-vision prism
composed of five separate prisms. The slit was made rather
open so as to give a very bright spectrum.
     With a smaller dispersion, produced by a fine Merz
prism, the spectrum was still more luminous.    It was inter
esting to compare the method of observation which we have
just described with that which consists in sending an elec
 tric discharge between platinum electrodes, in a tube con
 taining a solution of a salt of the metal. This method was
also used, the rest of the apparatus remaining the same.
   It can thus be proved experimentally, and this is of some
importance to chemists, that the first method is much more
sure and eacact than the other.
   On examining the bismuth “Latest Brommsdorff” in the
spectroscope, sodium and copper were found to be present.
The two characteristic lines                }
                                     D, of sodium remained, even
when the surface of the bismuth rods had been well cleaned
by long immersion in nitric acid. The metal contained only
traces of lead.
   The other bismuths contained no copper and no sodium.
The traces of lead, which were found in the bismuths Classen
I., II., III., IV., and the “Latest Brommsdorff,” were all
                               in

of  the spectroscope was placed upon the most visible line                of

                                     Conclusions.
    I have observed         that the electrical resistances of some rods
 were    changed      permanently       after the first heating ; but when
 once the values remain constant they do not change again,
 even after several months.                  Dr. Leduc" has observed a
similar phenomenon.                Rods of the same bismuths, either
slowly cooled or hardened under the same conditions, give
nearly the same values for the resistance at 0° and for the
coefficient of variation with the temperature.                     The methods
of tempering and of slowly cooling remain sensibly the same
for the different specimens. We must not then look to this
cause to explain the great variations which have been ob
served between one bismuth and another.
   The molecular structure, which                I have changed by temper
ing and by compression, makes a great difference in the
electrical properties of impure bismuths.                   On the other hand,
tempering appears to have no action whatever on pure bis
muth ; thus, the electrical resistance at 0° is:—

  for electrolyzed bismuth, slowly cooled               .    .   10’   x 107-99,
  and for the same metal, tempered .                    .    .   10°   x 108-69.
The coefficient of variation with the temperature' and the
influence of magnetism are very nearly the same for these two
specimens.   The coefficient of variation with the temperature
besides is positive.
   In the case of impure bismuths the process of tempering
causes the coefficient K to decrease, and even to become
negative.        The action of compression                  seems      to     be     still
greater.
   As to the absolute values of the electrical resistance at
0°, they increase under the action of tempering and com
pression.
  If  we compare the results furnished by the electrolyzed
bismuth with those given by the other bismuths, we see
that the effect of traces of lead is to produce a dimi
nution in the value of K, and an increase in the value
of Ro. It can also be seen that, in the case of impure metals,
a high value for Ro generally corresponds to a low value
for K.
   With regard to alloys of impure bismuth with lead and
tin, the results prove that these latter metals tend to increase
Ro, and can even in certain cases give a negative value for K.
But the molecular action, and above                 all
                                            the lead, produce                             a
much greater effect than the tin.

     In prefatory “Apology” Mr. Allen explains that the present

         the development         “a little twenty-page pamphlet, bearing

are told,  was that “some said his      theory  was  only what was already
known and     universally  acknowledged;       while others     them said                 of                it
was diametrically opposed          what was already known”—a result

   The “summum genus”                Mr. Allen's theory
                                                 of               dynamical                  of
science   “Power,”
             is         which “Force” and “Energy” are “sorts,”

the former “initiating                or

Here, then, “Force” is used in the ordinary sense of “Attractive
Force,” but “Energy” in a sense wholly different from      usual                                                    its

said      to
           reside.       may   It  remarked that Mr. Grant Allen's new
                                                    be
theory ignores work and momentum wholly. Instances adduced                                                                           in

                        of                           Energy are, that “the        of

known          isonce apparent.
                    at                    Mr. Allen had contemplated the
case      the gun being pointed from above downwards (say from
          of
the “fighting-top”              ship's mast upon boarders
                                          of   a                   deck)                                      on                     he
must have seen himself that the Energy        the shot would have                      of
                           before, but its effect would have been
                             in in
been the same  amount                               as

itself would have been “separative.”
     In
      these and such cases Mr. Allen fails altogether             realize the                              of to

     THE ENERGY OF THERMAL RADIATION AT A WHITE HEAT.
                BY O. TUMLIRZ AND A. KRUG.
   The authors endeavoured to determine the energy which a pla
tinum wire, heated by the current, gives off as light; and, in the
first case, indirectly, by comparing the total quantity of heat im
parted by the wire to a calorimeter with the energy imparted by
the work of the current.                    -
   The difference found did not exceed the magnitude of the pro
bable errors of the two determinations;    by which on the one hand
Joule's law was confirmed    afresh, and on the other hand the loss of
energy by radiation is infinitely small in comparison with the total
loss of heat. The internal conduction in the wire plays an im
portant part. In the course of this set of experiments it was
found that the disintegration of the platinum heated by the current
must have a disturbing influence over           such experiments; all                                    it
makes the surface rough and thus increases the emissive power.
     Inorder     measure directly the energy
                 to                                                of

altering    the extent of the mercury surfaces, but we finally
convinced ourselves that the capillary assumptions made were
of such a nature as to require revision. This would in itself
have involved extensive research, and we did not feel that the
end was likely to prove in any way commensurate with the
labour of reaching it; consequently we are unable to say
whether the potential of the mercury surface does or does not
rise with increased density of hydrogen deposition.             In any
case the small deviation of the value of A observed from its
value, as accounted for by the cell resistance, shows that very
little (if any) hydrogen really reaches the mercury surface.
On the other hand, it is easy to see several reasons why R"
might become smaller sufficiently to account for the effect
observed. It may be worth noting that the possibility of
collecting evidence as to the existence or nonexistence of
polarization when the change of A with flux of time is very
small becomes a question of indirect evidence.
    We did not habitually estimate changes of A of less
magnitude than 0-000045 volt, and consequently what follows
refers only to changes of greater amount than this.             By our
method the obvious test for       polarization   would be a measure
ment of the resistance of the cell at the actual moment when
                                                   experimentally im

  Clark cell remains unpolarized when changes of K are con
  sidered as evidences of polarization.                       In order to exhibit the
  changes actually occurring in K, the following Table has been
  prepared.         To get the value of C, corresponding to any
  observed value of A, the experimental P.D. was taken and
  divided by the external resistance.                      The table shows what the
  cell variations actually are—expressed as if they were all to
  be traced to actual changes of resistance.                           It will be noticed
  that the values of K increase as the current diminishes, show
  ing that what is ordinarily called polarization is less with
    reater currents than with small.                      It is fair, however, to state
  that the variations of P.D. in the latter case were nearer to our
  experimental limit of discrimination, and consequently are to
  be treated as having less weight than those referring to
   greater currents.

  Two days after being set up, the mean E.M.F. of these 13
cells exceeded the mean E.M.F. of the 40 cells by 0.00045
volt.
   Considering that the paste had not been neutralized, the
agreement is closer than might have been expected.
   (3) A cell, generally called the “master cell,” made up in
a glass cylinder about 12 inches high and 1% inch in
diameter. The zinc plate, which was just small enough to
pass down the cylinder, was cut from a sheet of ordinary
commercial zinc, and had been amalgamated before being
placed in the cell. The mercury surface was about three square
inches in area.    This cell was generally used to oppose the
others.
   (4) Two cells set up in glass jars similar to the above, but
shorter and of greater diameter.      Each of these cells exposed
a  mercury    surface of about 12     square   inches, and a zinc
surface of nearly equal amount. As it was expected that
considerable solution of zinc would occur in these cells, the
plates were wrapped up in parchment paper. One of the
cells was called the “large cell,” and the other the “hospital
cell,” as it was actually in tentative use in the hospital during
the progress of the testing, and was    -

Over by hand for comparison.
   The investigation of the peculiarities of these cells was
directed to the elucidation of the following points:—
   1. The discovery of the most probable value of the E.M.F.
of the cell at rest with a view to finding         terminal P.D.       its

   Method
described     Lord Rayleigh (loc. cit.) has been used through

southern aspect, and therefore not subject to any sudden
change of temperature.          Light was admitted through a
sheet of paper   forming   a window in otherwise closed shutters.
The temperature lay between 14° and 16°C. during the
winter months, in which the experiments were made. At the
close advantage was taken of a hot day to repeat the investi
gation at 23°C.
   The galvanometer generally used had a resistance of about
six thousand ohms, and a sensitiveness of about four scale
divisions for 10-" amperes by direct test. This was some
times supplemented by another galvanometer of nearly six
teen thousand ohms resistance, and whose sensitiveness could
be brought up to several scale-divisions for 10-" amperes.
   The smallest change of P.D. usually noted was               ".

pensated by altering the resistance in the compensator by
0-1 ohm corresponding to 0-000045 volt.
    In addition to the apparatus requisite for finding the
terminal P.D. of any cell at rest, resistances were required for
the purpose of short-circuiting the terminals of the cell.       For
this   purpose  a  very  large  box of German-silver resistance
coils was used.     All the coils had been previously compared
 with standards by Carey Foster's method, and were in fact
adjusted by this method in the laboratory.           The corrections
are in no case    large  enough    to  require  taking  into account.
The insulation of the various portions of the apparatus was
carefully attended to by the use of blocks of paraffin and was
very necessary.

   The result to be noted is that the value of A may be said
to have changed in the practical case from 0.005 to 0-003 volt
between 15° and 30°C.-a very small, variation considering
the complexity of the changes which might have taken place ;
consequently we need not fear that any ordinary change of
temperature will introduce any appreciable error except that
arising from the ordinary temperature-coefficient of the cell.
   This experiment gives incidentally the value of the tempera
ture-coefficient for rapid heating over the range comprised
between    21°7 and 30°9 C.       Assuming Lord Rayleigh's
temperature-coefficient for the range of temperature between
15° and 21°7 C., i.e. for temperatures which had been acquired
so slowly as to allow the zinc-sulphate solution to reach    its
proper concentration with complete certainty, we have the
following:—

366         Messrs. Threlfall and Pollock on the Clark Cell
     Lord Rayleigh's formula is
                       E = 1.435        [1–0-00077 (t–15°)],
whence it follows that (calling the mean E.M.F. of the 40
cells at 15° C. =1.43500 volt) at 17°C., the temperature of
comparison, the mean E.M.F of the 40 cells is 1:43.279 volt;
and hence the E.M.F. of the master cell, as it was 0-00077
volt greater than the mean of the 40 cells, = 1.43356 volt.
At 21°5 C. the E.M.F. of the master cell (using Lord
Rayleigh's coefficient) = 1:42859 volt.
   At the time of the experiments on the large cell the
temperature of the laboratory was 21°5 C. and E.M.F. large
cell–E.M.F master cell= +0.000405 volt; therefore E.M.F.
of large cell = 1:428995 volts at a temperature of 21°5 C.
Thirty-seven minutes after having been put in the bath the
E.M.F. of the large cell was steady at 34°-2 C. and E.M.F.
large cell —E.M.F. master cell = –0.006885 volt, the master
cell being still at 21°5 C.  Hence the fall of E.M.F. of the
large cell for a rise of 12°7 C. was 000729 volt, and                                                  its
actual E.M.F. was 1.4217 volt.
   Hence taking our standard temperature        21°5 C., and                 at
using Lord Rayleigh's formula with the - constant appropriate
to 21°5 C., we have
                       1.4217     =    1,42900        (1–Kx 12.7%,
whence K=0.000402 between 21° and 34°           say, and for                 C.

   There     isreason why this value, deduced from
                   no                                  some                                 a
what rapid change                 of
                       temperature, should agree with the
value obtained           by
                  Lord Rayleigh     cases where the tempera
                                                          in
ture varied much more   slowly  and was considerably lower.

that no one would work below 7°C. if it could be avoided ;
consequently we take these as our limits.
    We have already found that perturbations of the P.D. of
the cell itself may introduce an error in that quantity to the
extent say of 0.2 per cent. (the greatest we got by combining
the most aberrant observations of different days was 0.14
per cent.).
    On the strength of the experiment above 30°C. and the
experience with the small cells from 14° to 23°C., we assume
that no change in A will occur otherwise than that dependent
on the ordinary coefficient. This is not strictly legitimate
for lower temperatures, but it is difficult to obtain them much
lower here.
    We know that we shall have two causes at work tending to
 change our current value ; these will be in the same direction.
    The E.M.F. will tend to diminish with increased tempera
ture, and the resistance of the wire will increase.
    The cell-resistance change is of course included in varia
 tions of A, and these we have shown to be negligible for

about 0.022 per cent. per degree, and the change of E.M.F.

0-0088 volt.      Consequently the error arising from this

Sº,        time about the year 1845. I visited the Tower of

that the vaults below the chapel were used             gunpowder              as   a

knobbed conductors as effectually answering the purpose of
“conveying away the lightning safely, without that tendency
to increase or invite it,” that belongs to points.        Wilson pub
lished a  long  defence of his view of the      matter,  and was ably
answered    by   Nairne and      Henley.     Franklin admitted that
“points drew electricity at a greater distance in the gradual
silent way; but knobs will draw at the greatest distance a
stroke.”
   Wilson found many supporters of his views, and the time
of the Society was long occupied with discussions as to the
respective merits of sharp and blunt conductors.            Some even
adopted the idea, which has survived even to our own time,
that lightning-rods attracted the lightning to the building
they were intended to protect, and thus occasioned loss instead
of protection. This idea was started by the Abbé Nollet, who
was for some time an electrical authority in France.              In his
Mémoire sur        effets les  Tonnerre   du expressed his opinion
                                                                 he                                       in

down without doing any damage, just as the rain passes down
the water-pipe.       By “properly arranged" is meant a conduc
tor so fitted up that at whatever part of the building or ship
the lightning may happen to strike, it shall be conducted safely
to the earth or the sea. The French at one time had a theory
that a lightning-rod protected a surrounding space equal to a
circle the radius of which has twice the length of the light
ning-rod. But in the presence of such cases as the above,
and others that might be cited, the radius of protection theory
has been abandoned by competent observers.
    But to return to our narrative. The continued opposition
of Wilson and his party embarrassed the Board of Ordnance,
and   its members again applied           the Royal Society for advice.

    It has often been asserted that the suggestion thus put into

 Pringle's friend and biographer, has been frequently cited                                                        in

we know of the King's conduct in this matter is so much in
harmony with his character, that the truth of the anecdote is
at least probable, seeing that the President apparently acted
on the suggestion of the King, and resigned at the next
anniversary meeting of the Society, while the Fellows passed
a strong resolution in his favour.      From a scientific point of
view he was certainly better qualified for the office of Presi
dent than his courtly successor, Sir Joseph Banks".            Pringle
died in 1782, and Condorcet delivered his Eloge, which was
based on the Memoir by Dr. Kippis.
        I
     have ventured to revive this interesting episode in the
scientific history of the lightning-conductor from the fact that
even now it is a matter of discussion as to the best method
of protecting various structures, especially powder-magazines,
from the effects of lightning. The scientific journals and the
newspapers frequently contain accounts of what are called
the “vagaries,” and “eccentricities,” and “caprices" of
lightning, just as if the whole subject consisted of a series of
unsolved problems.        Writers describe what they have seen
and then ask for   explanations.    Trees are struck and shattered,
and the bark and     splinters scattered in      directions, and yet              all

    The following case, which has been reported to me from
 Dresden, and has not, so far as I know, been noticed in any
 English journal, has produced the usual bewilderment.                        On
 the 15th May last the valley of the Upper Elbe was assailed
 by a violent storm which about midnight burst upon the town
 and fortress of Königstein.              Flash followed flash, stroke
 followed stroke, the thunder was incessant, and rain fell in
torrents.       Suddenly towards one o’clock A.M. a thunder-clap
louder than any before was heard, and it was found that the
powder-magazine A had been struck by lightning and
contents exploded. The magazine contained,                        addition     in                    to its
stores  of  gunpowder,      upwards            of

    The question now naturally arises, whether this powder-mag
azine was protected            by
                             means        properly arranged conductors.
                                              of
The    military    authorities state that the magazine had three
lightning-conductors,        which had been examined only                    few               a
days before the accident, and were reported                       good order.
                                                                    to    be   in
The theory       isthat the roof together with the conductors was
first carried    off, and that the lightning then fired the powder.
But   in  the account furnished           me, to     stated
                                                        it   is      fortunate

after such an explosion would throw much, if any, light upon
the cause of the accident. As to the inspection of the conduc
tors shortly before the explosion, it is necessary to see the report,
if any were made, and also to know whether the inspectors
were competent to undertake the task.
    In the case of the Purfleet magazines, Franklin's arrangement
of the protecting conductors was judicious, but the magazines
themselves were faulty in construction.               The five magazines
were    placed  side   by  side with  interspaces    of about 57 feet.                       If
an accident had happened to any one, the others would probably
have shared      up  fate.    The barrels       gunpowder were piled

 crane was worked, thus forming broken conductors within
the building.       These iron bars were, however, removed               the            at

stances,e.g. the           calcium-sulphide  combinations, agrees with
the experimental           results as to the diminution of brightness.
At the same time           it was determined how much of the absorbed
energy was again        radiated as light.
      13almain's luminous paint was employed as the phos
 phorescent substance ; it was formed into a plate by mixing
 the powder with aqueous gelatine, and drying the mixture on
 glass plates provided with a paper border.             In this way very
 fine    homogeneous      thin films were      obtained,      which phos
phoresced well.
    The following experimental arrangement was made.                    The
 rays coming from a Schuckert's arc lamp, L (Plate                  fig. 4),     III.
 fell upon the slit, S, of a spectroscope; the collimator-lens,
C, rendered them parallel; then they traversed a prism, P,
and an achromatic lens, A, of 1 metre focal length, which
threw a real spectrum upon a second slit, Si (the observing
telescope was turned to one side).           From this spectrum the
slit S, admitted the strongly active portion of the ultra-violet
rays, which fell then upon a plate, B, of Balmain's paint
supported on a glass plate, G, at an angle of 45° to the direc
tion of the rays. From the phosphorescent light emitted in
all   directions    cone        of
                               rays was allowed           pass through

do not correspond to a simple emission of the luminous mo–
tions previously present in the body.             We cannot therefore
employ experiments with Balmain's paint or similar sub
stances for the determination of our quantity b.
    If we endeavour to explain these phenomena we may make
the following assumptions.
    The incident light brings about chemical changes in the
phosphorescent body, which afterwards undergoes the same
changes in the reverse order, and thus gives rise to an evolu
tion of light.      The chemically altered substance immediately
on the surface would transmit those rays which were absorbed
by the original modification, and thus deeper layers of the
substance would become accessible to the action ; exactly as,
for example, in mercuric iodide the yellow modification is
transparent to other rays than the red modification, and rice
versa. Analogous cases occur with the different modifications
of phosphorus and selenium.
    }. reference to chemical changes, it seems probable that
sulphide of calcium &c. may exist in two modifications A and
B, one stable, the other unstable". The modification A is
transformed into the modification B by the absorption of certain
rays, which are gradually given out again as light whilst the
substance changes back again into the modification                A;   the
greater the number of molecules of B in the unit volume, the
greater the number which pass back again into the modifica
                                                             º
tion A in the unit time.
    Since the brightness of the phosphorescence increases with
the intensity or duration of illumination, the number of mole
cules of A which have been transformed into B must have
been greater, and consequently more molecules of B afterwards
are retransformed into A with evolution of light. The de
crease in brightness in the same series of experiments must
therefore take place at first rapidly, and afterwards more and
more slowly, since the number of molecules of B present
becomes continually less.          Since the substances
already during illumination, the retransformation must take
place even during the illumination.                                        ;
   With a steady constant illumination, a limiting condition
must be reached in which the number of molecules of the
condition B, which change back into the condition A, is equal
to the number of molecules of B freshly formed. As long as
the duration of illumination is less than that required to bring
   * It  is not impossible, but probable, that Balmain's luminous paint
consists   of a mixture of substances of which each exists in two modifica
tions.   Our theories remain then the same.

about the limiting condition, an increase in the duration pro
duces an increase in the number of transformed molecules.
The evolution of light dependent upon the transformation of
molecules B into molecules A will therefore last longer.
   We have thus an exactly analogous case to dissociation
under the influence of heat, which appears to come to an end
at a definite condition of equilibrium, the condition of which
is that the number of molecules decomposed is equal to the
number of molecules formed.      As an increase and decrease of
incident  light act upon   phosphorescent  substances, so a rise
and fall in temperature act in this case.    We may therefore
apply the conclusions which hold good in the phenomena of
dissociation to our case.
               ..
    The results of experiment agree with these theoretical
conclusions, and in the first case the way in which the expe
rimental results run.
  If  c is the            of the modification B in the unit of
volume, the equation holds good,
                        —i-c"

where i is the brightness, and a and c are constants. c gives
the brightness produced by the transformation of the quantity
1 in the unit time, whilst a, cateris paribus, determines the
rapidity of the transformation.
   By integration we obtain wa Ce “, where C is an inte
gration-constant, which is proportional to the initial intensity.
It is itself dependent upon the number of molecules of A which
are, upon the whole, transformed into B at the time         then          t-0;
                        — i =c               —acCe-“;
                                 #=
the brightness must therefore vary according to an exponen
tial function, which is nearly the case.
   The quantity acC denotes the brightness existing at the
time t-0.     For two different series of experiments only the
constant C changes, and assumes perhaps the values C, and C.
The ratio of the intensities i, and                  is,
                                          any equal times    at                  t,   is

constant.

fication, and carry them on to the molecules associated with
them.

with such molecular transformations, such as the tribolumi
nescence of the ketones prepared            by Prof. Krafft", e. g.

                                      Mechanics        of Luminosity.                                             385
    In  order to find the total emitted brightness falling upon
the   photometer,     a curve was drawn with the times as abscissae,
and the observed brightnesses 10° sin” a as ordinates. The
energy emitted during the time of illumination of a second
may be neglected. The area enclosed by the curve, the com
mencing coordinate, and axis of abscissae, divided by 10°, gives
the total brightness radiated.         In this way it was shown that
when the total evolution of light was compressed into 1
second, and whilst it remained constant, it would amount to
1:7 referred to the comparison lamp.             The question now was
to determine the total brightness excited from the observed
brightness which corresponded to the energy of the rays
emitted in a definite direction, viz. towards the telescope,
which indeed corresponds to the energy of the rays emitted in
all directions.

   The luminous energy forms here also in the first case only
a small fraction of the total energy, in the second case one
much larger.     It is indeed not impossible that in solid bodies
the motions of translation of the centre of gravity, which
here consist in vibrations about the position of equilibrium
of the molecule, give rise to the production of light-vibrations.                                       .
That the centre of gravity cannot be greatly displaced from
of its
    mean position       equilibrium follows from the occurrence

XLVII.       The Constitution of the Aromatic Nucleus.        By S. A.
   SworN, B.A., Assoc. R.C.Sc.I., late Brakenbury              Scholar
   of Balliol College, Oxford.*
            of the most important developments of theoretical
ONº.chemistry       in recent times has been the view that sym
metry plays an important part in the aggregation of those
atoms which, when combined together, form the fundamental
molecular units of organic chemistry.           Van't Hoff, in the case
of the derivatives of marsh-gas, has brought forward views
which have received much, and for the most part favourable,
criticism. On the other hand the views of R. Meyer (Ber.
xv. p. 1823) and of     J. Thomsen (Ber. xix. p. 2944), who have
each   proposed   a  symmetrical   formula for benzene, have been
less favourably    received.
   It is a remarkable fact that closed chains consisting of six
carbon atoms (never five or seven atoms) are produced by
the action of dehydrating agents upon such bodies as acetone,
and by other condensations.           Observations on the specific
volumes of aromatic compounds further show that these
closed chains are characterized by a compactness of molecular

                        of the Aromatic Nucleus.                    403
structure unknown in other compounds. This view is sup
ported by the fact that the heat of combustion of benzene is
much less than that of dipropargyl.              The persistency with
which the aromatic nucleus holds           together throughout a long
series of chemical      changes  leads us to the same conclusion.
.
    These considerations led the author to suppose that six
carbon atoms have attained to their most stable condition of
equilibrium only when they have taken up the most sym
metrical positions in space, viz. those at the points of a
regular octahedron. Two such symbols have been proposed.
That of Meyer is a modification of Ladenburg's prism
formula. That of Thomsen is an adaptation of the diagonal
            of Claus, and a special case of Koerner's glyptic
SVy m DOI.
    The symbols of Thomsen and Meyer are complementary to
each other.        The ortho-linkages of the one and the meta
linkages of the other together form a complete octahedron.

  The two symbols above given are the only octahedral sym
bols which will account for the relationships of the benzene
substitution derivatives.   Moreover, these relationships can
be explained only on the assumption that the properties of the
derivatives in question are dependent both upon the positions
in space of the carbon atoms and upon the nature of the
atomic interactions.

The symbol of Kekulé should give rise to four isomeric sub
stitution derivatives when the introduced radicals are similar,
and to five when they are dissimilar (Wroblewsky Ber. xv.
p. 1023). The researches of Wroblewsky on the toluidines

one meta-toluidine exist.   (See also Lobry de Bruyn,    C. S.                              J.
1885, abstracts, p. 972.)  Kekulé has given an explanation of
the non-existence of two isomeric ortho-derivatives, which
 is,however, very unsatisfactory. We shall not discuss this
point, because there are    many others which are

atoms. From this inequality it follows that the valencies of
the carbon atom a, and similarly of any other of the six
carbon atoms, will be unsymmetrically directed. The direc

determined, not by the symmetry of the whole molecule about

                    I.   Arguments   for Para-linkage.
   (1) Anthracene consists of three symmetrically conjugated
aromatic nuclei.  This view was formerly held, but had to be
given up by the supporters of Kekulé's theory when Anschutz
and Eltzbacher, in achieving the synthesis of anthracene,
showed that the central carbon atoms are directly linked to
one another (Ber. xvi. p. 623).       It is now asserted that
anthracene consists merely of two benzene rings united by a
paraffinoid residue            (CH-CH)".Several considerations
show that the central nucleus is truly aromatic.         In the
first place Ramsay has shown that anthracene has, like
benzene, naphthalene, and phenanthrene, an abnormally low
molecular volume (J. C. S. 1881, p. 64).       Hartley has also
shown that the absorption of the ultra-violet rays observed in
benzene is much increased in the case of anthracene as well
as in those of naphthalene and phenanthrene.       By means of
oxidation the two central    methenyl  groups   become severed
and converted into carbonyl groupings.        The body so pro
duced is closely related to the quinones and                 its
                                                       diketonic
constitution has been well ascertained. The       carbonyls   can
 be reduced and the methenyls reunited.       Such well-marked
                                   paraffinoid but
                                       in of
reactions are characteristic not                              of
                                                       aromatic
bodies. No instance      knownis  which    “paraffinoid”

    408                     Mr. S. A. Sworn         on the Constitution
    linkage can be broken and again set up in such a manner.
    The formation of anthracene from benzene and acetylene
    tetrabromide does not prove that the paraffinoid residue
    (C.H.)" exists as such in the anthracene molecule, any more
-   than Berthelot's synthesis of benzene from acetylene shows
    that there are three such residues in benzene. The aggrega
    tion of other atoms to this residue causes it to assume the
    most stable configuration, viz. that of two para-carbon
    atoms in the aromatic nucleus.
       A direct proof of the aromatic nature of the central ring in
                                               jº,
    anthracene is wanting.       The sulphonic radical, when intro
    duced    by   the direct action of sulphuric acid, invariably
    attaches itself to one of the external nuclei.  The naphthalene
    derivatives, which we might expect to be the immediate pro
    ducts of the oxidation of                   are at once further
    oxidized (Beilstein, Handb. der org. Chemie,                                  ii.   p.
                                                                                                   be It

derivatives.  This     objection was legitimate and perhaps
necessary, so long    as our chemical formulae were
only convenient modes of representing atomic inter
actions.    We are told that instead of para-link
ages there are linkages directed from the carbon
atoms towards the centre of the molecule, thus:–
   Not a shadow of experimental evidence is brought forward
to show that the valencies are of such a nature. It is difficult
to conceive what function such valencies have.                If
                                                             valency
means the direction    along  which the attractive force between
two atoms can be exerted, rather than a vague notion of
prongs sticking out from the atoms, it is hardly legitimate to
suppose that a carbon atom can attract or be attracted by an
empty point in space.      We shall not discuss the relation of
such  a  view  to  the  “theory   of open affinities,” which is not
only in conflict with the facts of isomerism generally, but was
disproved by work on the isomers of propylene.                It has
been stated that these valencies, being directed towards the
centre, are in a sense protected.              If
                                          this is the case, and the
para-carbon atoms are not directly combined, it will be found
difficult to represent the constitution of pyrene, unless the
fundamental basis of modern organic chemistry—the tetra
 valency of the carbon atom—be given up. The formula
would consist of two distinct parts.           These parts should
exist as molecular entities   (C,  and  C1, Hio), thus:—
    Such a supposition is not only
unwarranted, but opposed to all
that we know of pyrene.             the   If
symbol merely represents, as is
sometimes said, the idea that a

Whatever may be the view entertained of this question, it is
nevertheless true that the results of Baeyer’s work are incon

the obvious conclusion, from the reduction in one stage of the
dibromide of the A” dihydro-acid to terephthalic acid—viz.
that terephthalic contains para- or meta-linkages—would
involve him in serious inconsistency.        It seems to me that in
 º
this respect he is illogical.     Experiment justifies the belief
that double, and not para-linkages, are set up in the interme
diate compounds; but we are not thereby warranted in the
assumption that para-linkages are not formed in the end reac

Nov. 1888).      This chemist has derived it from six regular
tetrahedra.    It appears to me that Marsh's representation is
inconsistent with the stability of the benzene nucleus, because
the ortho-linkages closely resemble those characteristic of
olefinoid compounds, which are admittedly a source of mo
lecular weakness.      Each consists of two valency-channels
meeting at an angle (ride supra, p. 404).

and Streatfeild (Phil. Mag. 1887, xxiii. p. 513;      J. C. S. 1887,

 para-linkage in benzene.

aniline.        ether.           intermediate       body.                    (lactam form).
              The formation of this body from y-oxyquinaldine necessi
         tates the change of the “lactim’’ into the “ lactam form.”
         This change can be satisfactorily explained only on the
         assumption that in y-oxyquinaldine the nitrogen atom is
         directly combined with the para- or y-carbon atom.
              These researches, together with those of Ruhemann on
         citrazinic acid (J.C. S. 1887, p. 403), and of Graebe and Caro
         on acridine (Ber. xiii. p. 99), afford evidence of para-linkage
         in the pyridine nucleus.
              Finally,   I would   point out that arguments in favour of one
         para-linkage       in benzene are equally strong in favour of three,
         for in no other way can the necessary symmetry of the mole
         cule be maintained.          Such a deduction would not be strictly
         logical in the case of the pyridine compounds, but the only
         alternative ormula—viz. one with olefinoid linkages,

a  simple  means of     standardizing     a working    current-measurer.

introduce an error of more than about 5 per cent. The error

                            which was of course not very great.

The error arising from partly neglecting the torsion of the
silk fibre was           investigated and found to be without
influence: the fibre was seven inches long.
   The divided scale was one of Elliott's scales, in which 360
divisions correspond to 229 millimetres.      The distance from
the mirror to the scale was 1095-7 scale-divisions, or about
seven hundred millimetres.        The problem of finding the form
of the curve into which it is necessary to bend the scale of
equal parts so as to read direct currents was solved by Mr.
Adair ; as we could find no previous record of this solution,               I
will give it here.

This is insoluble in general terms: but if the range of 6 is

    With   these numerical results the curve was laid out on
millimetre   paper,  a template was cut to the curve, and the
wooden back of the scale-holder was brought up to the tem
plate. The scale itself was carefully pinned to the wood at
short intervals along                its

  As the galvanometer was very dead-beat no calibration
experiment need take longer than 20 seconds, so that this is
without effect.
     In
      order to use the instrument the cell is coupled up in
series with a platinoid resistance of 1417 legal ohms; the
galvanometer-coil being itself 2:02 ohms, the cell about 5-5
ohms. Consequently the current used in testing is

     HE best form of Clark cell hitherto made is that of
       Lord Rayleigh, described in the “Philosophical Trans

                On an Improved Standard Clark Cell.                       421
old,  I  found that the zinc had been removed from the rod at
the surface of the liquid and had been deposited again upon
the rod at the surface of the mercury salt, in a solid frill round
the zinc. The copper wire in this cell became entirely de
tached, partly because of the expansion upward of the marine
glue, which brought a severe strain upon the wire.
   The local action then increases the zinc sulphate in the cell at
the expense of the mercury sulphate and amalgamates the zinc
rod.     I  have become convinced by some experiments extend
ing over several weeks that this substitution process goes on
only when the zinc is in contact with the solid mercury salt.
The mercurous sulphate is only slightly soluble in a saturated
solution of zinc sulphate.          I therefore prevent local action by
keeping the zinc and the mercury salt out of contact. The
same device operates to raise the E.M.F. about 0.4 per cent.

THEcharacter of the preceding volume. Commencing with Cheno
cholic Acid, the work concludes with an article on Indigo which ter
minates on page 700. The list of contributors contains the names
of some authors who contributed to the first volume together with
several new writers; the list is a sufficient guarantee that the editors
have secured the collaboration of some of the highest authorities
on the special subjects treated of. Among the longer articles are
those by Dr. Schunck on Chlorophyll, by Dr. McGowan on Cho
lesterine, on Chromium by Mr. Muir, and on Cinchona bark by
Mr. David Howard. The article on Chemical, Classification by
Mr. Muir occupies over 20 pages and is followed by a very useful
bibliographical list. The same author contributes the articles on

                  Bernthsen's Organic Chemistry.
A    Teet-Book     of Organic Chemistry.                      By A. BERNTHSEN,           Ph.D.,
    formerly  Professor of Chemistry in the University of Heidelberg.
    Translated by GEORGE McGowan, Ph.D.        Blackie and Son.
THE author of this excellent little volume of about 500 pages has
long been familiar to working chemists in this country for his bril
liant investigations in synthetical organic chemistry, and especially
for his well-known researches into the colouring-matters of the
Methylene Blue series. It will be instructive to British manu
facturing chemists to learn that Prof. Bernthsen, after having held
a Professorship in a German University, has now become Director
of the Scientific Department of the world-famed “Badische Anilin
und Soda-Fabrik” at Ludwigshafen on the Rhine.          Such an in
timate relationship between pure science and              applications  its               as   is

 ON   THE LEAKAGE OF NEGATIVE ELECTRICITY CAUSED BY SUN
         AND DAYLIGHT.  BY T. ELSTER AND H. GEITEL.
   In reference to the theory of atmospheric electricity propounded
by Arrhenius *, we have recently made a series of experiments
to ascertain whether sun- and daylight have the property of
gradually withdrawing the charge from negatively electrified bodies.
M. Hoort alone has established such an action, while all other
observers, so far as we know, have not been able to discover
any. We have therefore been greatly surprised to find that not
only sun- but also ordinary diffused daylight can under suitable
                                                                  -
conditions rapidly discharge a negatively electrified body.
   A zinc dish, 20 centim. in diameter, is exposed in the open on
an insulating support in such a manner that it is not acted on by
negative electricity, and is put in conducting communication with
a quadrant-electrometer or an Exner's electroscope, and further is
so arranged that the dish can be put in the dark or light at pleasure.
The following phenomena can then be observed, which, it is true, are
already known from experiments on ultra-violet light. The dry dish
  olished with emery completely loses a negative charge of 300 volts
in 60 seconds: an equally high positive charge is retained. The
loss of the negative charge ceases as soon as the dish is put in an
entirely dark room; it is considerably enfeebled if the sun's rays
pass previously through a glass plate.    A decided collapse of the
leaves of the electroscope takes place when the dish is merely
exposed to the blue light of the sky.
     f the dish is filled with hot or cold water the action is com
pletely extinguished; a moist cloth stretched over it acts in like
manner.
    By being illuminated the finely polished plate acquired a sponta
neous charge of +2.5 volts, which by blowning on the plate could
be still further increased.
    The experiments are much simpler when the metals to be
illumined are directly fixed in the form of wire to the knob of an
Exner's electroscope.            If
                                freshly polished wires are used—alumi
nium, magnesium, or zinc–a permanent negative electrification in
the sunlight in the open is not at            possible. all      completely
                                                                     It   is
discharged      less than five seconds. Magnesium and aluminium
                 in
wires act here more energetically than zinc ones. There                  per    is  a
ceptible collapse        of

      The results of               researches on the phosphorescence
                             a long series            of
 of   the alkaline earths are summed up by the authors as follows:—
    (1) The strongly luminous lime-phosphorescents are mixtures of
 three essential constituents; sulphide of calcium, the active metal,
 and a third body which, when present alone in calcium sulphide, is
 not active. It is very probable that perfectly pure calcium sulphide
 does not phosphoresce.
   (2) The bands which occur in the spectra of the lime-phospho
rescents show that the active metals are manganese, copper,
bismuth, and a fourth metal which is not known.           To each of
these metals a band corresponds which is invariable in position.
   Extremely small quantities of the metal are active. The inten
sity of the phosphorescence at first increases with its quantity, and
then decreases to zero. The quantities which exhibit the maximum
action are very small.
   (3) The additions used by us as the third constituent are colour
less salts, and            all

phosphorescents are prepared.     Hence they coat the surface      the                                 of

    The bars used in these experiments to determine the form
 of f(v) were about 26 or 27 centim. long and 1.9 centim.
diameter. They were nickel-plated, so as to give them the
same smooth even surface.          At the extremities of a diameter
in the middle of the    length   of the bars, two small holes, about
 ‘7 millim. diameter and 2.5 millim. deep, were bored, and
into them an iron and a German-silver wire respectively were
soldered. The other ends of these wires dipped into mercury
cups, in the circuit of an aperiodic Wiedemann's galvano
meter. The mercury-cups being provided with thermometers,
the arrangement formed a thermo-circuit, and from the de
 flexion of the galvanometer and the temperature of the
 mercury-cups the temperature of the bar at any time could
 be found.     The deflexion was read off by means of a tele
 scope and scale situated 2.5 metres from the galvanometer.
 The correction of the extreme deflexion for the assumption
 tan 20=2 tan 6 is less than 3 per cent. and is neglected.
 The bars were at first suspended horizontally in the room by
 means of two threads, and the temperature of the air observed by
 means of a thermometer situated vertically under the bar and
 protected from radiation by a small paper screen. On account of
 the air-currents in the room, and the “lag” of the thermometer
 indications behind the actual temperatures of the air, the
 cooling was ultimately carried out in a water-jacket 55 centim.
 diameter and 75 centim. long. The change of temperature of
 the jacket was then slow and regular, and the correction for
 this change could easily be applied.           The bars were heated
in an air-bath surrounded by water at 100° C. for three or
 four hours, and at the end of that time the temperatures of

                               where           is an arbitrary constant.
The constants of this equation, determined from observations
at times 0, 10, 20 minutes, are in one experiment
                   a=.0277,        b=-0047,        A=-0187;
and at 40, 50, 60 minutes, in the same experiment,
                   a=-0221,        b=-0165,        A=.0284.
A   similar variation was found in other cases, so that the
cooling is not well represented by making f(v) a quadratic
function of v.         -
   Ceasing to consider integral powers of v, we write
                              f(v)=v(a+bv"),
where m is some + quantity.                    This gives as integral,
                            v-" +    b.

we deduce as probable form f(v) = v", where n > 1.
  The equation (2) therefore takes the form :—

  softened at the     highest     temperature,  so that the character of
  the surface would change somewhat during the cooling.
      The much larger square nickel-plated bars used by Mitchell
  in his repetition of Forbes's experiments on conductivity give
  for the cooling experiment n = 1.26 (see p. 441). This increase
  of n may be due to change of form of section, or to change
  in dimensions, as both these circumstances affect the stream
  lines" produced in the air by the presence of the heated bars.
  It seems probable, however, that the only part of the loss of
  heat which is altered by alteration of the nature  -

  is that   part  due to radiation.
      From these facts we conclude that the loss of heat from an
  element of surface of heated bar, due to the effects of radia
  tion, conduction, and convection into the surrounding air, is
  proportional to the nth power of the excess of temperature
  of that element above that of the surrounding air.
      The fundamental equation for the state of heat along such
  a bar becomes then :—

      It is evident from this equation what a great effect the outer
  conductivity has on the nature of the solution of the problem
   of motion of heat in a bar. The solution in terms of expo
   nentials for the steady state used by Despretzf, Wiedemann
   and Franzf, and others is replaced by a power of the tempe
   rature, and the solution for the “steady periodic" state first
   given by Ångström's no longer holds. The above solutions
   neglect also variations of k, and we proceed to consider the
   effect of this.

    A. K. Miller and Ladenburg have each shown his deduction
to be faulty (J. C. S. 1887, p. 209).           (Without a single ex
ception the facts quoted by these chemists can be as well
explained by the symbol of Claus as by that of Kekulé.)

    But this is not the only conceivable way in which the
reaction may occur.         A hexamethylene ring may be formed
by the dissolution of one para- and two meta-linkages, the
atoms being supposed to open out into a hexagonal ring
(vide supra, p. 405).       It is perhaps improbable that a stable
                  (corresponding to ortho-linkage in Thomsen's
symbol) would be severed in favour of a much weaker
para-linkage.       The fact, however, remains that the additive
compounds can be so derived. . The hexamethylene ring so
obtained will differ from that derived from Thomsen's sym
bol in this respect—that the order of the six atoms will not
be the same.       This is evident from the following diagrams:—

    Naphthalene as thus constituted (II.) could hardly be said
 to consist of two aromatic nuclei.   That it does consist of two
 such nuclei is evident from the fact that, like benzene, it has
 an abnormally low molecular volume, and gives substitution
 products by direct nitration and sulphonation.      Moreover, in
 the formation of these derivatives the action appears to follow
 as closely as possible the laws of substitution which hold for
 benzene derivatives.     Hartley found the absorption of the
 ultra-violet rays characteristic of benzene to be even greater
 in the cases of naphthalene, anthracene, and phenanthrene.
    The same difficulties hold with regard to the other conju
 gated bodies.    Unless ortho-linkage is set up it is difficult to
 account for the ascertained constitution of phenanthrene,
 more especially                 its
                      formation from stilbene.

         (3) It is generally admitted that closed chains of more than
     six atoms do not exist.           If this be so, it is difficult to account
     for the constitution of fluorene on Ladenburg's theory, as it
     is then necessary to assume the existence of a closed chain of
     seven carbon atoms.            In the formulation of this body from
     Thomsen's      symbol    this  ring   consists of five carbon atoms only.
     The relationship of fluorene to phenanthrene, through diphe
    nylene ketone and diphenic acid, proves it to be a di-ortho
     compound.         The argument is evident from the following

        In   this connexion     I   may quote the following passage from
    Watts’      “Dictionary    of  Chemistry’     (new edition, i. p. 300):—
    “Ortho-compounds readily give rise to products of condensa
    tion in which the side chains may be supposed to be joined in
    the form of a ring ; this tendency is observed to some extent
    in the para-series but not at all in the meta-series.”
        (4) The analogies between the ortho- and para-derivatives
    of benzene        as opposed       to the   meta- have been cited by
    Koerner      (J. C. S. 1876,    i. p.        and by Lellmann (Ber. xvii.
                                          2#)L2

p. 2720) in favour of ortho- and para-linkage.     It must be
confessed that these arguments depend upon hypothetical
views as to the cause of such analogies, and are therefore not
very conclusive.     Stuart has similarly brought forward the
results of his experiments  on the benzolmalonic acids (J. C. S.
1886, p. 357) in support of Kekulé’s formula—a formula
which is at variance with so many facts.

   The preceding discussion affects merely the nature of
the atomic linkage, and shows that the diagonal symbol of
Claus is alone consistent with              the facts. The argument
                                                           all
is not merely based                    on
                              hypothetical analogies between ben
zene and pyridine derivatives.        The independent consideration
of   these  groups        bodies  clearly
                                 of         shows that they must                                  be
formulated             on
                   the same   type.

                  of
 by the three other valencies which unite that carbon atom                                   to   its
ortho- and para-neighbours.                               If,
                                         for example, we assume that
this valency       equally inclined

evident that, whilst the meta- and ortho-carbon atoms are
equidistant, the meta-hydrogen atoms (or rather their mean
positions) would         closer together than the ortho-.

hydrogen atoms, give            symbol which would indicate the

existence of two isomeric mono-substitution derivatives.

            experiments which form the subject of this paper
THEwere begun almost immediately                  after my arrival in New
South Wales, in June 1886, and have been continued at
intervals ever since.         The original object was to measure

accurately the resistance of certain gums produced by trees
   rowing in the Colony. The only gum thoroughly examined
              up to now, is that produced by the “grass tree”
(Xanthorrhoea hastilis).          This gum, in spite of many attempts
to improve it by various methods of purification and                    ".
mixing with other substances, turns out to be useless as an
insulator, having in fact no higher resistance than, say,
 ordinary samples of resin, that is about 4.1 x 10” megohms
per cubic centimetre.          Besides this, the gum in question is
 faulty in other ways.            It is of the nature of shellac, but
 cannot    compete    with the shellac as ordinarily supplied either
 in price or   purity.     In addition it has the two fatal defects of
 being partly soluble in water and of decomposing before it

         it in this latter respect; while the texture of the material

 Benzoic acid appears to be given off in large quantities
 during the process.           In spite of many attempts            I  have
 hitherto failed to obtain any                             quantity of the
 fig-tree gums which are said to be produced in large quantity
 in the northern parts of the Colony.                This paper therefore
 will be devoted to a         description     of the method adopted in
  º
 measuring these resistances,            a method         which ultimately
 reached a considerable degree of perfection; partly on ac
 count of the modifications introduced in the construction of
 high-resistance galvanometers, and partly on account of the
              property of Clark cells.            The method has since
   een empioyed for other measurements, as will be shown
 later on.
    I  do not wish to claim any superiority for the galvanometer

                             have long been of the opinion

considerable improvement for delicate work by simply pushing
the ordinary conditions of sensitiveness nearer to their limit.
                  GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF METHOD.
              Measurement of Resistance                             of Gums.
   The substance to be tested forms a layer of very exactly
estimable dimensions between two plates of conducting
material. The experiment consists in obtaining equal de
flexions of a sensitive galvanometer—(1)    when a known
fraction of the E.M.F. of a Clark cell is allowed to act
through a megohm in the galvanometer circuit; and (2) when
the E.M.F. of a known number of compared Clark cells is
allowed to act through the resistance to be measured.
   The apparatus, therefore, consists of the plates with the
substance to be investigated, the galvanometer, the standard
cells, and a megohm.
                    The Resistance-plate                 Arrangement.
   This consists of two brass plates accurately rectangular and
scraped flat on one surface. The dimensions of the plates used                                I
were—length 15.2 centimetres, breadth 12.7 centim., thick
ness 1-6 centim.    These rather exact numbers were obtained
by filing.  The measurements were made (2) by beam com
passes, (8) by the dividing-engine.  Neither the corrections
which had to be introduced for temperature nor the com
parison of the dividing-engine scale and the beam compasses
with the standard metre are given, as no absolute measure
ments of pure substances have been made.    Several measure
ments of each plate were made by both methods. The surfaces
                                          i.
were made flat by scraping, and this process was continued
till the contact was sufficiently perfect for one plate to lift the
other when laid on                  it,

    Finally, the steady pins are taken out of the plates and the
gum is ready to be measured.
    In order to measure the resistance of good insulation by
means of this arrangement, it is clear that it will be ad
vantageous to have a galvanometer of the highest degree of
sensitiveness.    This is desirable both because the thicker the
insulating layer the less will be the experimental error in the
determination of its thickness; and the smaller the electro
motive force required the less will be the difficulty of estimat
ing it exactly, as will be shown in the proper place.      I  there
fore  attempted   to obtain sensitiveness  by  pushing the ordinary
conditions further than is usually done.          My first experi
ments were on a galvanometer of about 9000 ohms' resistance,
made by the Cambridge Scientific Instrument Company.              It
was soon very evident that when the current reached the value
of about 10-7 ampere, the torsion of the suspension became
important.     My first modification was to increase the length
of the fibre to about 12 inches ; this led to considerable
difficulty of adjustment, but increased the sensitiveness about
fifty-fold.   It then became clear that the next step must be
to   get the  magnets   more perfectly astatic and to reduce the
weight of the mirror.       The reducing of the weight of the
mirror turned out to be more difficult than           Ianticipated;
however, it was finally arrived at, and at the same time the
astaticism was made more perfect.       Some experiments showed
that it was very difficult to get two sets of steel bars of the
kind ordinarily employed         even reasonably astatic.       The
difficulty lies partly in the magnetizing and partly in obtain
ing exactly equal quantities of steel in the two systems of
magnets. In fact it is necessary that the steel bars be mag
netized in situ, otherwise they can hardly be perfectly
arranged and are sure to demagnetize each other more or
less.    Now when the two magnet systems are only separated
by a bit of aluminium, say three inches long, it is impossible
to thoroughly magnetize one system without demagnetizing
the other more or less. Consequently it is necessary to set
up an arrangement so that both systems can be magnetized
at once.     The following is a description of the arrangement
                                                     º
adopted :—It consists of two small electromagnets with
extremely soft cores, and movable pole-pieces most carefully
worked so as to   fit the ends of   the cores.    Every precaution
was taken    to    make the    electromagnets   as         alike as

                 of High Specific   Resistances.                 459
carrying the wire were also made as much alike as possible,
and the same number of turns of wire were put on each
bobbin by means of a revolution-counter. The winding was
quite uniform, No. 18 B.W.G. wire being used.  As a check
the resistances of the bobbins were measured,     when it
fortunately happened that two were about one half per cent.
higher than the other two, and so they were paired. The
wire, it need hardly be added, was wound on to the four
coils under a constant strain.      The two electromagnets
were then mounted on a permanent stand—one being kept
steadily in a fixed position, and the other being capable of
sliding parallel to a line drawn perpendicular to the lines
joining the centres of the poles of each magnet. The pole
pieces were bevelled off from the top side ; but the area of
the ends remained large compared with the size of the mag
nets to be magnetized.       The condition as to equality of
quantity and quality of steel in the galvanometer magnets
was next considered. After some reflexion          I
                                               decided that the
most  probable  way  of securing equality  would be to discard
bar-magnets entirely and use disk-magnets.             I
                                                      therefore
 procured a small piece of sheet steel about as thick as
 ordinary thin writing-paper, and had a die constructed so as
to stamp small disks from this sheet.     The sheet was fairly
hard, and it was found that the disks “stamped” better when
 the sheet was taken in its natural state than when it was
softened. A considerable number of disks were stamped out
of the sheet, and these were then laid on a bit of flat iron and
raised together to a bright red heat; they were then plunged
together into a jar of cold water.       On examination they all
seemed to be     glass-hard,  and some of them remained flat.
The four flattest ones were chosen and prepared for mounting.
A bit of aluminium wire was cut to the right length and
beaten out flat at each end. The disks were then cemented
with shellac varnish, one on each side of each flattened end
of the aluminium wire. The wire was thus much more ac
curately the centre of rotation of the magnetic system than is
generally the case. Attempts were then made to get a good
light mirror. About three ounces of small microscope cover
slips were examined by aid of the reflected image of the bars
of a window, and from these about twenty were selected
and silvered by the Rochelle salt process.     They looked very
good, but on mounting for trial without strain they        all
                                                           turned
out disappointing.       finally made use  of  small portion     of
                                                                      to a

larger mirror that had got broken. This was cemented             on
the flat surfaceof   one of  the steel disks and was found not
to   besensibly distorted.    After trying very many cements,     I

as has been pointed out by several observers, there is danger
of rapid variation of the magnetization ; but it was thought
better to risk this than to force it by artificial “ageing” by
heating or otherwise. As will be seen hereafter, the magnets
were never exposed even during the experiments to
but the smallest electromagnetic forces, and the controlling
magnet was weakened and introduced from high above the
galvanometer, and only lowered sufficiently just to make                                                     its

to use, for it was hardly possible to distinguish the motion
due to the electromagnetic forces from the never-ceasing
motion due to air-currents. Though the instrument was well
protected by a           case, and this generally supplemented by
a wooden    box,       #.
                       I
                     never succeeded in eliminating the effect of
air-currents, though it must be added                     I
                                                 never succeeded well
enough with it in other respects to make it worth while to
apply the “subjective” method of mirror observation. In
any case it seems to be essential to have a means of adjusting
the coils to the magnets as well as the magnets to the coils;
but the adjustments are very tiresome even with the facilities
which in the later forms of this instrument              had for making I
them. My coils had not quite so much wire as those of the
Messrs. Gray because         used  I         all
                                          had and could get

                      the authors quoted. The authors also state
that the wire was approximately uniformly                      distributed
throughout their coils, though            my case this was found im
                                               in
possible, keeping the external dimensions quite constant, and
therefore there was          slight difference between the coils,
                                  a
which, however, was compensated for                       by
                                                  their arrangement                                  in
the instrument.         do not think that the diminution of the
                        I
number     ofturns had much effect, because the diameter                the                 of
coils had reached 5-8 centim.          Feeling that my non-success
was probably           to   be
                        traced      my inferior skill

                                  of                  inches   3 diameter          in
and about       25
                 inches long. The pole-pieces were very broad
and thick. The magnetization of the steel was                                 ºnearly

After remagnetizing      the magnets with about half as much

B therefore was improved; A and C remaining about the
same.     The deviations were probably produced by the un
avoidable shaking and jarring in mounting the magnets,
though this was done with considerable care.
   These magnets were next observed with respect to their
behaviour with one of the coils. Coil “No. 3’’ was selected
for this purpose. It was placed on the table, and above it
hung a specially fine spring-coil of wire forming part of a
Jolly's balance. The magnets were hung from the end of
this spring by a loop of silk, and could be adjusted to pene
trate the coil to a greater or less extent.              In general five
positions were taken :—
   Position 1. Magnet-end flush with the upper windings of
                   the coil.
       ,,    2. Magnet-end at 4 of the length of the hole
                   through the coil.
       ,,       Magnet-end       at the centre of the coil.
       ,     3.
             4. Magnet-end at # of the length of the hole
                   through the coil.
       ,,    5. Magnet-end       flush with the bottom of the coil.
Three Leclanché cells were allowed to run for four hours
through the coil before the experiment began. The coil had
a resistance of 3130 ohms.
   First, a series of observations was taken by observing on
the glass scale the equilibrium position of the magnet with
the current direct and reversed.              The magnet was then
lowered to position 2, and so on ; then it was reversed and
the experiments repeated.         Two complete sets each way were
made for each    magnet,   i. e.  forty  observations of distance and
forty reversals of current. The experiment was a very pretty
one, and   I never remember to have seen any apparatus work
better. The following set is given as a sample from the note
book. The numbers, of course, have no significance except
with respect to the actual coil and magnet taken.

                             established.
    The distance from the galvanometer-mirror to the scale was
155 centimetres; and the light-spot was very good, showing
the wire image as sharply as the lines on the scale.               The
scale itself was divided into millimetres.        In the final test the
period of vibration of the magnet system was 80 seconds, and
the resistance out of the Bridge-box was 100 ohms. The

    Employing the method of vibrations and neglecting the
correction for the extremely small log. decrement, the battery
being of course reversed and several experiments made, it was
found that the double deflexion amounted to 5 scale-divisions
 (millims.). Hence the deflexion corresponding to 1:26 x 10-7
amperes is 2.5 divisions.            I
                              Now do not think that, bearing in
mind the    lengthy   period of the system, it would be possible to
read to more than 5 division.           The difficulty comes in in
 eliminating air-currents; as far as the scale went I could read
                                                              §.
certainly 2 division, so there is no advantage to be gained in
having the scale further, or even so far away.                     may
 i.
therefore    say that five times the least measurable deflexion is
         by 1'26 x 10-7 amperes, or that the least measurable
   eflexion itself is given by 2.5 × 10-" amperes. This,         I may
 mention, is only to be obtained when the magnets are
judiciously kept from swinging by an extra controlling
 magnet, worked carefully from a distance till the vibrations
 get small, so as to jam against the side of the coil.            Some
 fine quartz threads were also prepared by Boys' method, but
 no appreciable improvement introduced by their use could be
 detected. This may, however, have been on account of their
 thickness; for they could be seen, with a little practice, in a
 good light, and when laid on a bit of black silk.          I therefore
 came to the conclusion that neither I nor my instrument
                        i.
 maker (who is fairly good) could hope to compete in such
 delicate work with         Messrs. Gray, who, using this type of
 galvanometer, attained a sensitiveness of one half millimetre
 division with a current of about 10-" amperes, and that with
 a scale fairly close to the instrument, and with a manageable
 period of vibration.
                                        I
     In consequence of this failure determined to use the four
 coils constructed for the Gray galvanometer, for an expe

466             Prof. R. Threlfall           on the Measurement
riment in which they were employed in the usual manner.
They were therefore roughly mounted, and provided with an
astatic combination of the kind previously described.        The
results were so encouraging that dº same methods were pur
sued further.     In the final form the suspension was a quartz
fibre, 85 centim. long, suspended in a carefully chosen glass
tube. With such long suspensions the tube must be very
 straight, and the arrangement for raising and lowering the
suspended parts must           i.
                              very good. After trying several
arrangements for this, I adopted a pointed piston working
into the tube and passing through a stuffing-box.      The coils
were of course anything but suited, as far as shape goes, for
their present arrangement; however, they did what was
requisite, though    Ihave no doubt that coils might be made
to increase the sensitiveness tenfold.
    The mirror was in this case suspended midway between the
magnets, and, for want of a better, was so thin that it got a
little pulled out of shape by the paint which was used to fasten
it to the aluminium wire. This fortunately turned out to be
an advantage in some respects, for the vertical wire and the
paint on the back of the mirror, by a happy accident, made
the figure of the mirror practically that of a portion of a
cylinder with a vertical axis; consequently, using a very good
lens of 40 inches' focus, a good image of the light-spot was
obtained at a distance of three metres.     It became evident at
once that the two real difficulties in securing sensitiveness
lay in preventing air-currents and in adjusting the controlling
magnet.
     he first was finally attained by making the instrument
practically air-tight; and, by means of a diaphragm, stopping
down the beam of light to very nearly the size of the mirror
—in this case of about 1 centimetre diameter. During the
measurement of the resistance of an impure sample of sulphur
this protection against air-currents was found to be insufficient,
and the galvanometer was further protected by enclosing it
in a cardboard box.       If  it ever becomes necessary to make an
instrument to be sensitive          to,

   The arrangement for adjusting the distance of the control
ling magnet was arrived at after several trials. It consisted
of an apparatus sliding and clamping on the brass tube, with
a nut and screw for fine adjustment.               It was intended to use
a worm-wheel and screw for the adjustment in a horizontal
plane; but this was found after a little practice to be un
necessary, although it would be convenient.
   The details of this arrangement for raising and lowering
the magnets will be understood from the drawing of the gal
vanometer for medical purposes on Pl. XIV. figs. 1 and 2, see
p. 416, supra. Many experiments were made in order to decide
the relative merits of quartz and silk fibres.               At first it was
thought that silk did as well; but after a time a great deal of
trouble with the zero was traced to the silk, and attempts were
made to use finer quartz threads.            In this, owing to the skill
acquired by Mr. Pollock,         was    finally I successful. As        have                               I
had about a year's experience in drawing quartz threads, I add
the following notes on the process in hope that they may
prove of use to others. The difficulty is to get a large enough
bit of quartz fused onto a suitable handle. The best way of
managing this is first to heat a                               it bit

IV.     On   Measurements     of  the   Resistance   of Imperfectly
   Purified   Sulphur.     By Prof. RICHARD THRELFALL, and
   ARTHUR     Pollock,   Esq.”

THEsensitiveness of 5 scale-divisionsbeen
                                              for 10-" amperes, the
measurement of the resistance of the sample of sulphur in
question became a tolerably easy matter. The sulphur had
been supplied by Messrs. Hopkin and Williams as “precipi
tated, washed.”       It looked clean when melted ; but on
examination turned out to have the following substances
existing as impurities: —
                         Calcium sulphate.
                         Ferric oxide.
                         Organic matter.
Dr.   Helms, Demonstrator of Chemistry in the University of
Sydney, was kind enough to investigate a sample of this
sulphur with a view to discovering whether it contained
selenium or tellurium. The result offiis.examination of about
two hundred grammes of the substance was, that neither of
these substances was present in quantity large enough to be
detected. The examination was carried out by means of the
oxidation and sulphurous acid method; and also by the
cyanide method. We desire to express our thanks to Dr.
   elms. The importance of this result, so far as our work is
                                                         º
concerned, lies in the fact that it shows that pure sulphur
can probably be obtained from the sample at hand by means
of distillation.    The following measurements refer to the
unpurified sample; the only substance existing in any con
siderable quantity was calcium sulphate.            The           Was
probably rather more pure than ordinary “roll” or flour
sulphur.     The general arrangement of the apparatus will be
clear from the following diagram (p. 470).
   By means of the key K, a current can be sent in either
direction through the resistance R and the galvanometer G.
The source of this current is a suitable number of small
Clark cells SC. The E.M.F.'s of these cells and of the large
one LC were watched during the experiments with the aid of
an auxiliary galvanometºr and balance arrangement not
shown in the diagram.       The key K, allowed the upper metal

plate of the resistance arrangement to be put in communica
tion with the last cell so as to charge up without allowing the
current to rush through the galvanometer.       After charging,
the connexions were altered so as to allow the current due
to the leak through the sulphur to pass through the gal
vanometer. The E.M.F. of the small cells was not changed
by this amount of leaking, and the fall of the large cell was
measured at the time in the usual manner. The experiment
consisted in taking plugs out of the box S till the gal
vanometer gave the same deflexion whether the current was
sent through it by the number of cells through the sulphur,
or by the adjustable fraction of the E.M.F. of the large cell
through a megohm.        The sum of the resistances of S and R
was always 10,000 legal ohms.         The arrangement of the
observations was such that they interlocked in time.
   The absolute value of the result, therefore, depends chiefly
on the value of the megohm.        Respecting this standard       I
wrote to Messrs. Elliott to inquire what degree of reliance
could be placed on  it, and was informed   in  reply that    had
                                                             it
been tested  againsta  standard inblocks  of100,000   ohms each,
and was right within the variation produced       by one degree
of  temperature.     The wire was    ofGerman-silver.     As the
present results are interesting only with respect            to
                                                              the
method, and the resistances     of the  sample,  under   varying
E.M.F.'s, the absolute value      of the megohm        is   com

  *  Lord Rayleigh has kindly pointed out to us that by a mistake in our method
of reduction   we have slightly underestimated         this value.    The result will be that

has already done, the ratios of the amounts of light emitted
by a given quantity of fluorescent substance to that absorbed
by it; since it is obviously upon these that the fluorescibility
depends.    From theoretical considerations Stokes" showed
that in such solutions this quantity first increases with
the dilution and then finally becomes constant. Lommel,
on the contrary, in one of his numerous works on the theory
of fluorescence, has maintained that the fluorescibility, his
factor a, continually increases with increasing dilution f.
A decisive answer to this question can only be obtained by
actual measurement of the quantities involved in                                            it.

478         -    B. Walter   on the Relation between
solutions, on the contrary, a number of colours disappeared
by absorption in the liquid which gave no such light; and
indeed the production of fluorescence took place over eractly the
same range of ware-lengths as in the most concentrated of the
perfect solutions, while the absorption eartended much further.
    It follows clearly that in transition solutions also it is only
the single molecules which produce the fluorescence, and that
the portion of light absorbed by these solutions which does
not reappear as fluorescent light is taken up by the groups of
molecules. The fluorescibility of a transition solution must
therefore decrease with increasing concentration for three
reasons:—(1) because the number of single fluorescing mole
cules is constantly getting reduced ; (2) because the groups
of molecules take up an ever-increasing proportion of that
light which can          uce fluorescence ; and (3) because the
                    |.
groups of molecules exert a constantly increasing absorbent
action upon the fluorescent light which is formed by the
single molecules still remaining. This can be studied ex
tremely well by observing the shrinking up of the band of
light at the less-refrangible end in the case of the spectrum of
fluorescent light, so that this alone affords a means of dis
tinguishing at a single glance a perfect from a transition
                       -
solution.
    Stated more exactly, the three laws deducible from the
above phenomena are the following:—
    (1) In transition solutions there are present at the same
time both groups of molecules and single molecules; and as
the dilution increases the latter multiply at the expense of the
former.
    (2) Only single molecules can give rise to fluorescent light,
not groups of molecules.
    (3) The range of absorption by single molecules extends
 between quite definite wave-lengths; groups of molecules on
 the other hand absorb as a rule the neighbouring parts of the
 spectrum as well.
    The latter phenomenon was most striking in the case of
 fluorescein and Magdala red ; for while the absorption spec
 trum of a very thick layer of a perfect solution ended quite
 suddenly in the red with a sharp boundary, the absorption of
 a transition solution, even when the absorbing layer con
 tained altogether less material, stretched beyond this boundary
 and was gradually lost on the other side of it (between it and
 the ultra-red). In the case of eosine no such difference was
 found, so that in this compound the group absorbs hardly
 any more rays than the single molecule.
    These ideas were supported by another series of phenomena.

           Fluorescence             and Arrangement of Molecules.                                     479
The fluorescent light of transition solutions of fluorescein and
eosine increases in intensity considerably as their temperature
is raised, doubtless because warm water decomposes the
groups of molecules of these substances more easily than cold
water.      In Magdala red the contrast is still greater; cold
water cannot decompose                 groups its  molecules       of all, but              at
warm water effects the            decomposition     fairly   easily.     That
these phenomena cannot               ascribedbe        increased freedom

one cannot refrain from bringing     into connexion with what
                                                           it
has already  been stated with considerable certainty concern
ing the differences    groupingin  molecules.            of
     inally, concerning the non-fluorescent group-solutions                                               of
fluorescein,     was noted that they
                    it                     possessed    surface    all                       a
colour, which became stronger with increasing concentration
but whose quality remained exactly the same even the solid                    :
body itself—of course not commercial acid fluorescein, but
ammonium fluorescein—possessed the same surface colour.
It   isseen from this that fluorescein          group-solutions      in      its
must still possess     stationary molecular condition, which
                               a

that the resultant curve rapidly approaches the Laplacian
 form, the discontinuities being continually of a remoter order.
Thus with two errors (fig. 8) the curve meets the axis of
errors and has only discontinuities of direction; with three
errors there are discontinuities of curvature, and so on. The
curve produced by combining n errors of this type will have
contacts of the (n–2)th order with the axis of errors; and
the resultant of two curves with contacts of the mth and nth
orders respectively has contacts of the (n + m +2)th order;
for contacts of the mth and nth orders would be produced by
combining m +2 and n +2 errors respectively.
    To illustrate these principles, consider the error introduced
into the indications of a balance by the friction of             knife                               its
edges; and        simplify the case, suppose that the balance

 two ways in which an adjustment may be made.                   Suppose
 we are measuring the positions of spectrum-lines by bringing
 a wire into coincidence with them, and                           paral
 lactic and instrumental errors, let us confine our attention to
 errors of judgment in adjusting the cross-wire.           First     the                                let

490               Mr. W. G. Gregory on a Method of
                       AA
single observations the curve                 of error   would      perhaps        be
something like fig. 14.
                                       Fig.   14.
    14.As a final example, suppose we are trying to place a
small round body in a given position in a plane. Here the
law of error will depend on our manner of testing the adjust
ment; whether we merely look up and down and from side
to side to get two (very nearly independent) judgments of
the corresponding coordinates, or whether we examine the
object from every point of view to make sure that no error
can be detected.    The case may be illustrated mechanically
by supposing two pendulums supported one on gimbals, the
other after the manner of Foucault's pendulum ; appropriate
laws of friction being assumed.  The law of error will further
depend on whether we follow the method of § 12 or of § 13.
    Ifwe were trying to drive a billiard ball from one given
position so as to make it come to rest in another given
position (without rebounds), the errors of direction and of
distance would, if small, be very nearly independent; the
latter coordinate being probably subject to much greater
variation.
  We are led, then, to the following conclusions:—The law
of error in a set of observations depends on the nature of each
special case ; and what may be called the probable law of
error is determined by our knowledge of the conditions.
The combination of three or more sources of error of com
parable importance gives in general a law of frequency not
seriously differing from that of Laplace; so that the method
of least squares will be practically the most advantageous,
except where a single source of error with a very different
law is predominant above      the rest.all

most unfavourable moment, i. e. when it is stationary.      The
impulse can be considerably delayed by including in the battery
circuit a solenoid into which a solid iron core is inserted
more or less till the best result is obtained. This adjustment,
however, varies with the amplitude of vibration and the                                          al
terations of the contact. The whole matter was discussed in
a paper read before the Physical Society on June 26th, 1886,
by Prof. S. P. Thompson", who then suggested the employment
of two similar forks which drove one another and settled down
to a difference of phase of a quarter of a period.   Each fork,
therefore, received an impulse when moving at its greatest
velocity in the middle of      stroke.      its

of cotton-covered iron bonnet-wire wound in                                       the form      of an
anchor-ring having a mean diameter of 6 cms. and thickness
1 cm.    Round this is wound the secondary coil of about 160
turns of no. 22 silk-covered copper wire, forming a single layer
completely round, and outside this the primary of about 190
turns of similar wire. A condenser C of 4 microfarads ca
pacity was connected across the mercury-break K to diminish
the sparking.     One small accumulator B sufficed to work
the fork vigorously, the mean current consumed being about
2 amperes.    By increasing the number of turns of wire, much
less current would be required, but there would be a limit,
since the lag must not be so great as to interfere with the
proper timing of the impulses.
   An alternative method, using far less current but requiring
two contacts, is shown in fig. 2.

it.   The currents         charge and discharge are both taken

Pleasley and Teversall Collieries, Derbyshire.” By J. C. B. Hendy,
Esq.
   The “Top Hard” Seam of the district is being worked in these
collieries at a depth of 500 yards, where it has an average thickness
of 5 feet, with a band of cannel in the middle. In the working it was
found that the coal began to thicken, until it became double the
usual size, the cannel also increasing in the “Top Seam,” but in
the Lower Seam running out altogether.
   This double thickness of coal continued till the “wash out"
was reached, when both coal and shaly roof disappeared, the space
being replaced by sandstone similar to that of the beds overlying
the shale. The clay floor of the Lower Seam had not been much
interfered with, and this was followed for 60 yards, when the
doubly thick seam was again met with, and on being followed
gradually assumed                  its
                        normal thickness.

first body itself is greater than that of the second.
   From these determinations we get at a rigorous definition of
the temperature of luminescence itself.
   The temperature of luminescence for any kind of radiation or
other intramolecular motion is that temperature to which a non
luminescent body must be brought, so that this motion may be
equivalent to that of the luminescent body. It is clear that the
second law of the mechanical theory of heat, which is based on
Clausius' principle, cannot be applied in the form <U+017F>º                               in                           QT-0

    ON  THE MAXIMUM GALVANIC POLAIRIZATION OF PLATINUM
       ELECTRODES     IN SULPHURIC ACID.        BY CARL FROMME.
   In   a former    communication    I made experiments      on the   de
termination of the maximum galvanic polarization of platinum
electrodes in sulphuric acid of varying strengths.        The electrodes
had a surface either of 1 square centim. (large electrodes) or of
0.008 square centim. (small electrodes).        If the kathode was small
it always blackened, in consequence of the formation of platinum
black, but if it was large no change in the colour -of the surface
was observed.
    The following experiments        on platinized platinum electrodes
show the influence exerted        by an  initial strong platinization of
the anode or the kathode on the maximum value of the galvanic
polarization in sulphuric acid of varying strengths.
   The following are the principal results of the author's researches:—
   (1) A bright platinum foil when used as a kathode in dilute sul
 phuric acid becomes coated with platinum black, which with
sulphuric acid of less than 3 per cent. can depress the polarization
0-9 volt.    Strictly speaking, therefore, it is impossible to determine
the maximum polarization in very dilute acid for a bright kathode.
   (2) A copious electrolytic deposit of platinum black on the kath
ode from chloride of platinum does not diminish the polarization
more strongly, so long as the concentration of the sulphuric acid
is small.    But in more concentrated acid (more than 3 per cent.)
it is of greater action than the feeble spontaneous platinization.
   (3) The decrease which the polarization experiences in consequence
of covering the kathode with a thick layer of platinum black is
greatest, as much as 0-9 volt, in the most dilute acids, and in the
most concentrated (of 50 to 65 per cent.) it is only 0.1 volt.
   (4) The platinization of the anodes, on the other hand, dimi
nishes the polarization in the more concentrated acids more strongly
than in the dilute, in such a way that while in the latter the polar
ization of bright electrodes decreases somewhat more in consequence
of platinizing the kathode, in acid of about 60 per cent, the plat
inization of the anode has a very considerably greater influence
(as much as seven times as great).
   (5) The polarization of a voltameter with bright electrodes varies
with the concentration in a very complicated manner.             Maxima
and minima are often very near each other.           High values near or
even more than 3 volts are found with a small as well as with a great
degree of concentration.

496               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
    (6) But if the kathode is platinized the maxima and minima
disappear almost entirely, and the polarization, which at first is
only 2:1 volts, rises with increasing concentration pretty regularly              -
to 2-8 to 2-9 volts, with a concentration of 65 per cent.
    (7)   If,   the other hand, the anode
