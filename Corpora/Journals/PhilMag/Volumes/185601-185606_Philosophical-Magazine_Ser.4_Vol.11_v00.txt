alteration would make the author's meaning more clear.              Certain

and by it find that have failed to convey to your mind (and
therefore, perhaps, to the minds of others) my true meaning;
so that what you think to be my view, is in some very important
points absolutely the reverse.         You will not wonder that          am                                           I
anxious to set    myself   right in such a matter with one who holds
your high position in science.          For that purpose I must refer
to the pages of the Philosophical Magazine; for though                   am                                           I
not a   judge  of the strictness of the     translation,    have no other                          I
means of access and reference to your paper.
   At the bottom of page 402, the paper says that Faraday has
endeavoured to establish the notion that “induction is not pro
duced by the action of electricity across space, but that an electric
body acts only on the contiguous particles of an insulating me
dium,” &c. If you refer again to my papers, you will find that in
the very beginning of that on induction (1165.) I have especially
limited the cases to those of ordinary induction, i.e. cases where
matter is present; at (1215.) this expression is repeated; and
again in vol.       Exp. Res.   ii. 267. Instead          p.

   At         p.
           403, Phil.  Mag,    your  paper  says, “It follows from other
experiments made                           by
                           Faraday (1218.), that the induction would

whether it is the anterior or posterior surface which is negatively
charged, may be solved, though not by the indifferent approach
of either side of the plate to a gold-leaf electrometer; for with
either side, indications of negative electricity will be obtained;
and if the excited surface be in both cases at equal distances from
the electrometer plate, the action will be greater (because of
specific inductive capacity) when the body of the shell-lac plate
intervenes between the cap and the excited surface than when
air only is interposed.

induction between P and the flame could be destroyed by the
convection dependent on the latter where air only intervened
between it and towards P; but as the air in the direction of the

 The shell-lac   plate  was therefore    placed  before the charged body
 P,  and the flame moved about before                             its

besides that,               if an
                       uninsulated wire was brought towards the cap
or gold-leaf, the charged posterior surface was discharged with a
spark, and the electrometer and shell-lac were left perfectly un
charged.      It is but a very small step to coat the posterior sur
face with tinfoil beforehand, and then all the experiments can be
repeated, using contact with an uninsulated body instead of the
flame.    Another step led to the coating of the anterior surface;
the induction within the shell-lac between these surfaces and
perpendicular to them being precisely of the same kind as if
 these coatings were away. If S, or the inducteous body, be
made one that cannot at a distance communicate a charge to the
posterior coating, being, for instance, an uninsulated metal ball
 or plate, then each of these coatings has for the time a polar
 condition like that represented by np in the first diagram of
 this letter, i. e. their anterior surfaces have negative charge, and
 their posterior surfaces positive charge, when a positive inductric
 body P is employed, and so long as the induction continues.

through the sulphur and secure the resulting charge.        By the
use of a finger key these contacts can be made in the fiftieth part
of a second, and by a little mechanical arrangement even much
quicker; yet as far as I can find, the coated sulphur surface is as
fully charged in this brief period as if the induction had been
sustained for a minute or an hour. How are we to conceive
that any degree of conduction of the sulphur consistent with the
prolonged insulation which can follow, can have concurred to this
brief and complete act                  7
*The      foregoing results appear to me to be crucial in their cha
racter, and to leave no question open as to the possibility of the
action of interposed insulating matter being of the same nature
as the action of interposed conducting matter in cases of induc
tion.      Iwould go further into them in explanation and illustra
tion of my own views, and of the truthfulness of specific inductive
                    I
capacity, if thought it necessary; but I should have little more
to do than repeat what is already said (and that many years ago)
in the Eleventh Series of the Experimental Researches, and so

 -  The effect you mention at the bottom of page 404 and top of
405, Phil. Mag., is to me a very natural result of the high specific
inductive capacity of shell-lac.          In one place you say, in relation
to   it, that “no reason can         assigned   why small piece

     In replying to the letter with which you have honoured me,                                               I
 must at first claim your greatest indulgence for my English.                                                 I
 mean not the errors which are easily corrected, but the improper
 choice of words, which in theoretical controversies is of conse
 quence, and which                  I
                         have no hope to avoid.     Before I enter into
the discussion of your remarks concerning my paper on induc
tion, it may not be improper to say a word upon the old theory
of static electricity.
   It appears to me, that a theory of a branch of the experimental
sciences should be deemed good, and not be abandoned, so long
as it is sufficient to account for       facts known         all
                                                            applying                       by                 a
simple principle,         paradoxical
                                   be     not, and     long
                                                              or or
                                    it                            comes              so         as  it
not     incontradiction with    itself,    the  theory        congenial                    of   a
branch. The old theory         light has been abandoned, not because
                                             of
 its principle            of

endued with the greatest velocity and many perplexing proper
ties, was highly paradoxical, but because         was found incompe        it

I                                    I
    thought it the more, as saw no other way to account for
this fact according to your theory. When the rubbed shell-lac
cylinder is replaced by an electrified metallic globe, and a suffi
ciently large metallic plate is placed at some distance above the
globe, the carrier receives only a weak charge from the centre of
the upper surface of the plate (which is not in sight of the globe),
and an increasing charge if it is raised. If the plate is insulated,
the carrier must not be applied to the plate, but the charge                 in
creasing with the elevation of the carrier above the centre, and
the maximum of it in a certain height, is still remarked. Hence
I   conjectured that you would consider the action of a metallic
intermediate plate between an inductric and an inducteous body
as screening the latter from the induction in straight lines of the
former%; and        I  was confirmed in my conjecture by § 1681t,
where you say “that the electric power is limited and exclusive.”
Surely you will find this conjecture not to be an unfounded one,
if you call to mind that the philosophers who have adopted your
views on induction have made the same.                   Melloni has believed
to screen his    electroscopes     from the induction of a conductor by
the  interposition    of a metallic plate between both; and De la Rive
relates with the same meaning the experiments with your differ
ential-inductometer in his Traité d’Electricité, vol. i. p. 131 (of
which an English edition exists, which                I have not seen).      He
says, “Si on interpose une lame métallique soit isolée, soit
mieux encore, communiquant avec le sol, entre A (the positively
electrified inductric plate) et B (the inducteous, which has been
touched before), aussitót B donne des signes d'électriciténégative
très forte, qui proviennent de ce que l’induction cessant d'agir
sur elle, etc. Ainsi, mettre un disque métallique entre A et B,
cela revient a remplacer B par un autre disque plus rapproché de
A qu'il ne l’était, et par conséquent le soustraire à l’induction
 de  A.”                                                                        -
    The metallic intermediate plate, insulated or not, is here said
to have withdrawn a body from the induction; it is regarded as
a screen which intercepts the electric induction; as an opake
body intercepts the light...           I  am extremely gratified that you
partake not of this view, but            I                         I
                                            must confess that cannot see
how to     account,    by  the manner exposed in your letter, for the
results which       I  have obtained with intermediate conducting
plates.     Let P be the originally electrified globe, N the unin

by induction with negative and positive electricity, but you differ
from me in respect to the explication of the experiment, in
respect, as you say, to the manner by which the disc has been
electrified, and the part which the flame has acted in the final
result.    As to the first point, a mistake must have happened,
                        I
inasmuch as have nowhere mentioned my view on the manner
by which the conducting and non-conducting bodies are excited
by induction.                     I
                     fear that the word “distribution,” whereby
the German word “Anordnung” (which signifies “arrange
ment”) has been translated, has caused the mistake.          It is said
(p. 412), “there is no essential difference between the actions
of conducting and non-conducting bodies, but inasmuch as the
distribution of electricity upon them,” &c.; and further, “in
conducting bodies the distribution of electricity,” &c. (ibidem).
My meaning is this: It is admitted that each intermediate plate,
be it of conducting or of non-conducting matter, is by induc
tion instantaneously provided with both electricities, which are
arranged in a certain manner upon both faces of the plate.
 Upon a conducting plate                              I
                               can specify by examination in every
 case the arrangement of the electricities, and thereby account
for the action of this plate upon a body in          vicinity and                              its                      in

The shell-lac disc was moved only once from above to below be
tween the positively electrified conductor of a machine and a
spirit-flame; the anterior face of it was laid with sliding contact”
on the knob of a gold-leaf electroscope; the disc was with
drawn and the electricity in the electroscope examined. Always
negative electricity was found, weaker or stronger; the strongest,
when the centre of the large disc had touched the knob, and it
was carefully breathed upon, whereof the reason is obvious.                                                                       I
have imputed to the flame the essential part of destroying the
positive electricity of the posterior face. You have observed the
fact that the posterior face is negatively excited, and you have
hence drawn some consequences concerning the mode of induc
tion on the plate which      cannot admit.           I
                                              The fact of the pos
terior face being negatively electrified appears to me a very
complicated one, and resulting from one of the two following
causes, perhaps from both :—First, the flame is inducteously
excited by the originally electrified body and imparts    negative                                           its
electricity     the posterior surface; secondly, the negatively
                         to
electrified anterior face       the disc acts    of
                                                induction upon the                     by

 be doubted that the superior face was negatively excited, the
 inferior face was found also negative.            On the contrary, had the
 shell-lac disc lain upon an uninsulated metallic disc during the
 rubbing, and after that the negative electricity of the supe
 rior face was destroyed by the application of a flame (or the
 touching with a metallic plate, as instantly will be seen), the
 inferior face was found to be positive.               After destroying this
 positive electricity, the superior face was again negative, and
 thus continuing, alternately one face could be made positive, the
 other negative.      This experiment gave me the means to obtain
 easily an electrophorus with a positively excited cake.                For that
 purpose the cake was laid on its uninsulated metallic mould,
 strongly rubbed with fur and inverted in the mould, so that the
 not-rubbed face was uppermost.              When this cake was covered

 Duº           the change of bismuth from the fluid to the solid
      º,
        state of aggregation, it often happens that the surface of
 the apparently  solidified mass is broken through in one or more
 places by the liquid metal underneath, which soon solidifies
 in          forms. This phaenomenon is generally accepted as a
 sure proof that bismuth at         moment      solidification expe
                                                          its                  of

                a          expansion.    Marx, indeed, has deter
mined the expansion from the magnitude            the globules thus               of
forced through the metallic crust, and found that they amount
 to 33rd      the entire mass. The above proof

      On the Deportment   of Bismuth during Solidification.     19
in raw bismuth,   a portion  of the silver accompanies the metal
protruded during solidification.
    3. To the metals already mentioned lead may be added as an
associate of commercial bismuth.     50 grammes of pure bismuth
melted with 2 per cent. of lead gave out no spheres on solidifica
tion; this immediately took place when 2 per cent. of sulphur
was added to the mixture. The spheres protruded to the amount
of 20 per cent. ; when melted and cooled they showed an even
surface, and mere traces only of sulphur and lead were to be
found in them.
   4. From a mixture of 80 per cent. bismuth, containing some
silver, and 20 per cent. sulphide of bismuth, some large metallic
globules were protruded during solidification. These were found
to contain 99.69 per cent. of bismuth, and 0.11 per cent. of
silver. Sulphur could not be detected in the globules, although
the original mass contained almost 4 per cent. of the substance.
   5. Chemically pure bismuth, which, when melted by itself
yielded no spheres, was melted with 5 per cent. of tersulphide of
bismuth (containing therefore nearly 1 per cent, sulphur); at the
moment of solidification bismuth spheres free from sulphur made
their appearance.
   These experiments show that the phaenomenon of globules
making their appearance on solidification, is not exhibited by
pure bismuth, but only by such as contains foreign ingredients.
Of the latter sulphur appears to be the chief cause of the phaeno
menon; at least   I have never observed it when the bismuth was
rendered   impure by the heavier metals alone; but always when,
together with such, sulphur was present, or when it alone was
the cause of impurity. These experiments show further that the
protruded metal possesses a high degree of purity; it may,      in
deed, be regarded as almost chemically pure.
   These effects may be simply explained in the following manner.
The binary compounds of bismuth with the foreign substances,
particularly the sulphide of bismuth, solidify sooner than the
bismuth itself; and inasmuch as those compounds, without doubt,
expand [contract?] by solidification, a portion of the still liquid
bismuth must be squeezed out of the mass. That this displaced
metal possesses a high degree of purity naturally follows from
the fact, that the foreign ingredients being already solidified
cannot accompany the protruded globules.
   Perhaps the deportment here described might be taken ad
vantage of to effect a preliminary purification of the raw metal,
particularly where an opportunity exists of working on a large
scale.   The quantity squeezed out during one solidification
amounted in weight to from 2-5 to 3 per cent. of the total quantity
of the metal made use   of.   Inthe foregoing experiments I   have

not found a great divergence from this result, although with
regard to the quality and quantity of the foreign substances                                                     in

   The expansion of pure bismuth by solidification      have not                                  I

experiments here communicated, that it is far less than inaccu
rate experiments have hitherto induced us to estimate                                                 it.

    The above analyses are of very characteristic limestones, but
others occur whose composition is intermediate between them;

that the rock has been originally an organic deposit, and that

some parts being not yet oxidized, but others converted into
yellow folia by the oxidation of the protoxides of iron and

    In this the amount of crystals of dolomite or brown-spar so
much exceeds what would occur if the carbonates of magnesia,
iron, and manganese were combined with equal equivalents of
that of lime, that       I   conclude that the crystals must either be
more highly calcareous, or part of them pure calcareous spar.
This is certainly the case in a limestone from near Plymouth
 (Eburton, Plymouth No. 1), consisting of alternate folia of un
altered organic clay and dark-coloured material, which, when
examined by the microscope, is seen to be composed of rhombic

26                  Mr. H. C. Sorby             on Slaty Cleavage,
 crystals with portions of peroxidized brown-spar, and on chemical
 analysis is found to be chiefly carbonate of lime with a little
 magnesia and the oxides of iron and manganese.            These crystals
 have been    developed   in  bands,   apparently  along  such planes of
 stratification as gave lines of     facility for the change to occur;
 and hence      I
                should call it an organic clay, foliated along the
 planes of stratification with crystals of highly calcareous brown
 spar.    I have not yet seen any limestone, in the district under
 consideration,    in which chemical changes have so occurred in
 relation to the cleavage, that it may be said to be foliated with
 dolomitic crystals in the true plane of cleavage, independent of
 stratification, in a similar manner to what has taken place with
 respect to some other minerals in other localities; but perhaps
 such might be found by a more careful examination.
    These physical and chemical analyses will,                 I
                                                         trust, suffice to
 show the nature of the limestones under          consideration, in their
 unaltered condition, and when metamorphosed by subsequent
 chemical changes.       Since corals decay more readily than such
tissue as that of    encrimites,            I
                                     conclude that the greater part of
the organic clay has been derived from them, and that the De
vonian limestones were formed chiefly from the decay of corals,
 next to which come encrimites; whilst the proportion of other
 organisms is only small.         The deposits have afterwards been
indurated by crystallization, and the infiltration of calcareous
 spar; and in some cases metamorphosed by other chemical
changes.      Then, on elevation and exposure to the oxygen of the
atmosphere, another set of changes took place, chiefly the conver
 sion of pyrites, and the protoxides of iron and manganese, into
higher oxides; a process not yet completed.
    The actual constitution of the rocks being now described,                        I
proceed to consider the phaenomena of their slaty cleavage.             In
this communication            I
                           must forbear to enter into the facts on a
large scale, seen in the field, for that alone would be a long
subject.                      I                       I
             However, must state that am convinced that there
is the most complete proof of rocks possessing cleavage having
been so acted on by mechanical forces that they have been very
considerably     compressed in a direction perpendicular to the
cleavage, and elongated to a certain extent in the line of the
dip; as proved by the change in the thickness of the same bed
when bent into contortions, and by various other facts described
by Mr. Daniel Sharpe and myself (Quart. Journ. of Geol. Soc.

the space included within 5° on each side of positions inclined at
0°, 10°, 20°, &c. to the line of pressure, so that they were uni

change       of structure to any crystalline action.                        The particles are
not crystals, but are clearly proved, by their structure and form,
to be fragments of organic bodies.                         If
                                               the cleavage was due to
.
the mechanical cause      just  described,  their position is most easily
accounted     for; but             I
                           leave the   explanation   of the fact, on the
supposition of the instrumentality of crystalline forces, to those
who advocate that view of the subject. The same is the case
with the grains of quartz sand, in such limestones as contain
them. For instance, in Ilfracombe No. 5, of which the physical
analysis is given above, and in which the cleavage is perpen
          to the stratification, as seen in a section cut perpendicular
to the cleavage and stratification, the grains of sand are often
two or three times as long as broad, and even in some cases five
times; but in place of the longer axes lying in the plane of stra
tification, they are chiefly inclined at low angles to the cleavage.
I  may here remark that there is no difficulty in distinguishing
grains of sand from small crystals of quartz, such as are met with
in some cherty limestones, and that there is no doubt of them
being sand in this, and that their arrangement is due to the
cause I have just described.
   When organic clays, with or without larger fragments, have
undergone consolidation, it very frequently happens that the
crystallization of the granules began in various parts, and forced
away the bituminous and other impurities into detached, more
or less spherical spaces, which afterwards crystallized in much
finer grains. On this account they now appear in sections as
darker patches, giving the rock a kind of oolitic structure, though
quite distinct from the more genuine oolitic grains, visible to the
naked eye. These are in many cases due to crystallization taking
place from certain centres, and this being therefore the reverse
kind of process, I call them positive segregational oolites, whilst
the others may be called negative. When the limestone has no
cleavage, these negative, segregational, oolitic grains, though
often of irregular form, are usually more or less equiaxed, and
not very much longer in one direction than in another, and the
longer axes have no particular arrangement. This           however,                is,
very far from being the case      such     have cleavage.

scribe similar facts with  respect  to other   organic  bodies,  but
these appear to me so very clear and decisive that          think it          I
unnecessary.     In most cleaved limestones this compression of
the solid  organic fragments is only slight, and merely their posi
tion is altered; apparently on account of the materials by which
they are surrounded having given way more readily than their
own tissue; but yet it may be clearly seen that, other circum
stances being the same, the amount of their compression is in
proportion to the perfection of the cleavage.
    Not only are the organic fragments thus compressed, but also
crystals of calcareous spar and dolomite. In uncleaved lime
stones detached perfect rhombic crystals are often seen; and in
some highly cleaved there are such forms as would result from
the breaking up and compression of similar crystals. Moreover,
in uncleaved limestones the calcareous crystals, filling the cavities
in organic bodies or derived from the crystallization of organic
clay, have their crystalline cleavage planes almost invariably
 straight; whilst in cleaved limestones they are often very con
 siderably bent; and this is so particularly the case in the very
highly cleaved specimen from Kingskerswell, that there is scarcely
 any calcareous spar that has straight cleavage planes, and much
 of it is so broken up and bent that it is only by comparing in
termediate examples that the true nature of the structure can be
ascertained.   This then clearly proves that the compressing force
acted so  intensely and so gradually as to change the molecular
                                                                         it,

layers of different mineral composition to be formed in such a
manner as to produce a cleavage, without there being any cry
stalline polarity.    Such an alternation along planes analogous to
slaty cleavage, as well as that similar to stratification, does indeed
occur to a certain extent in some rocks, so far metamorphosed as
to have become foliated, as I described in a paper at the late
meeting of the British Association at Glasgow, on the older rocks
of the Scottish Highlands.        However, when not thus metamor
phosed and foliated, unaltered cleavage is seen by the microscope
to be a fracture through homogeneous rock, independent of any
such alternation of layers of different mineral composition; and
             I
therefore conclude that this cleavage-foliation no more proves
simple slaty cleavage to be the result of crystallime agencies,
than does stratification-foliation indicate that they gave rise to
stratification.
    Summing up now the general facts contained in this paper,         I
show that, other circumstances being the same, the cleavage of
the limestones varies directly as the amount of mechanical com
pression to which they have been subjected; and that the effect
of this is such as would necessarily change the structure of un
cleaved into that which occurs in those that are cleaved.         Also,
that cleaved limestones possess no crystalline polarity; and that,
in place of crystallization producing slaty cleavage, it has a con
trary tendency, and when perfect and complete obliterates it
altogether.      Though inorganic deposits do not present us with
such decisive facts, yet    I am persuaded that their slaty cleavage
may be satisfactorily explained on similar principles, and that
they agree, not only with what may be seen with high powers
of the microscope, but with the structure of mountain masses.
Can    I  therefore hesitate to conclude that slaty cleavage is the
result of mechanical and not of crystalline forces?

      HE    following series of experiments, an abstract of which
         has already appeared in the Proceedings of the Royal
 Society (Nov. 25, 1852), form a continuation of an inquiry          in

 in the living animal may not be accompanied with the manifes

 a former seriest, that the organic process of secretion in the

88       Mr. H. F. Baxter       on the manifestation     of Current    Force
living animal was attended with the manifestation of current
force, we were naturally led to suppose that the kindred actions,
such as lacteal absorption and nutrition, might also be accom
panied with the manifestation of the same power: the solution
 of this question is the object of the present paper.
     To avoid unnecessary repetition, we shall refer to our second
 paper* for the purpose of showing the mode in which the expe
 riments were conducted; in that paper also will be found the

 precautions necessary to be observed, and some experimental
 arguments for the purpose of meeting certain objections that
 might be raised to              experiments, and as they are applicable
 on the present occasion we need only refer to them. We may
 just add, that our object is not merely to ascertain under what
 circumstances an effect might be produced upon the needle of
 the galvanometer when the electrodes are brought into contact
 with different parts of the living body, but to point out the con
 newion between certain organic actions in the living animal and
 the consequent effect upon the needlet.

 made to increase by making and breaking contact at the mer
  curial cups.
     Another portion of the intestines was tried with similar results,
     The lacteals contained a milk-white fluid.                 We may just
 remark, that similar results were obtained when the mucous
  membrane and the blood flowing from the same part were formed
  into a circuit, as shown in our former series of experiments.

     t The prejudices which exist in reference to electro-physiological pursuits
  are somewhat surprising.     We remember being assailed with the following
  remark:—if you place one electrode in contact with the axilla, and the
  other in contact with the mouth, you may obtain an effect upon the needle,
 and consequently these results prove nothing.      It may scarcely be credited
 that the following objections have been urged:—the time has not yet arrived
 for the prosecution of these inquiries; physiologists have no business to
 use the galvanometer;    it is necessary in these researches to use a delicate
  galvanometer. We should not have noticed these objections, had they not
  been made in influential quarters.

   From these   experiments,             we
                                  feel ourselves                       justified    in   drawing

time; and—
    2nd. That this effect occurs during the organic process                                       of
lacteal absorption.
      may
     It        urged that these experiments prove too much that
                  be                                                                      :
not  only      do
             we obtain      effect upon the needle when the elec
                                    an
trodes are brought into contact with the mucous surface and the
chyle, but also when the mucous surface and the blood are formed
into  acircuit,        or

argument, however, cannot       adduced  be  disproving the suppo

sition that the chyle and the intestinal contents may          op                       be   in
posite electric states. We have the positive fact, that the needle

                   in Lacteal Absorption and Nutrition.                       41
indicates them to be in opposite electric states; we cannot refer
these effects to the combination of the chyle with the intestinal
fluid to account for the direction of the current, and assume that
the chyle is acid; it may, however, be urged that the blood is
positive to the intestinal secretions, as we have already shown in
our former series of experiments, and that the effects are due in
these experiments to the electric condition of the blood being
conducted by the mesentery.             We do not deny that the effects
may be partly due to these circumstances; but if they were en
tirely due to them, how is it that no effect ensued when the chyle
 and the blood were formed into a circuit 2 would not this indi
 cate that they are both in the same electric state 7
      We do not think it necessary to bring forward any physio
 logical reasons to point out the analogy between the two organic
 actions, secretion and lacteal absorption, as we prefer allowing
 our conclusions to rest upon the eagerimental evidence we have
 now adduced, rather than on any à priori argument, except for
 the purpose of confirming our deductions.
    § 2. On the     manifestation of Current Force during nutrition in
                   the Muscular and Nervous Tissues*.
      The researches of Matteucci establish this important fact, that
 when the inner and external surfaces of a muscle in a live animal
 are formed into a circuit, current force is produced; and the                in
 ference which Matteucci draws from this fact is the following,
 that this current depends upon the vital action of nutrition. He
  also states, “we must never forget the analogy between the mus
  cular electromotor element and the Voltanian element: the zinc

   of Du Bois    Reymond's researches. As we do not wish to enter into the
   dispute which has arisen between Matteucci and Du Bois Reymond, and
   with our present knowledge of the researches of the latter experimentalist,
   we are anxious that the experiments should appear as originally presented
   to the Royal Society. Those who wish for further information in reference
   to this controversy, we must refer to the original papers of these two authors,

   the Philosophical Magazine for September 1855, entitled, “On the Force

    Before we proceed with our experiments we must refer to those
 of Du Bois Reymond. Du Bois Reymond's experiments confirm
 those of Matteucci, but the former appears to have been the first
 to show that similar effects were obtained when the longitudinal
 and transverse sections of a nerve were formed into a circuit, to
 those when the same parts were formed into a circuit with the
 muscular fibre.

    The skin covering the inner part of the thigh was reflected,
 and the abdomen laid open; one electrode in contact with the
 external surface of the muscles of the thigh, the other with the
 blood flowing from the iliac vein; the latter negative 3°, but the
 effect did not continue : the former electrode was inserted into
 the substance of the muscles; no effect.
    The muscles at the back part of the thigh were divided; one
 electrode in contact with the divided, the other with the external
 surface; no decisive result.

                                    Concluding      Remarks.
  As these inquiries have met with a degree of opposition which
we can only refer to the strong prejudices which exist in refer
ence to electro-physiological pursuits, since no attempt that we
are aware of has been made to refute either the conclusions or
the experiments by eagerimental evidence, we nevertheless feel
compelled to reply to one or two objections which have been
raised, more especially in reference to our latter experiments. It
has been stated that our experiments do not confirm those of Du
Bois Reymond, and that it is necessary in these researches to
 use a delicate galvanometer.     Let us first notice the former ob
jection, as it will be a means of refuting the latter.
    These experiments, as we have already stated, were undertaken
previous to the knowledge of Du Bois Reymond's researches.
The facts which Du Bois Reymond has elicited, and which we
wish to draw attention to, are those in reference to the law of
 the muscular current and to that of the nervous current ; the
former confirming the experiments of Matteucci, the latter being
those which Du Bois Reymond appears to have been the first to
elucidate.    Our experiments, as far as we can see, not only con
firm those of Matteucci, but also tend to confirm those of Du
Bois Reymond.         Our object, however, was to ascertain the
 origin of the current (muscular current) in Matteucci's experi
ment; and the question                  is,
                                Do not our experiments tend also                              to

mond himself always been able to obtain it              Has he not been
compelled to suppose that there exists a layer, which he calls the
para-electronomic layer, beneath the tendon capable of counter
acting the current, which, when it does occur, soon subsides’
What evidence have we of the existence of this layer beyond that
of its enabling us to account for the non-appearance of the
assumed current 7 And here, in conclusion, we cannot refrain
from quoting some remarks we formerly made, and which appear
to us to be applicable on the present occasion. In alluding to
the possibility of effects occurring with different galvanometers,
we stated, “We do not deny, but think it highly probable, that
with delicate galvanometers some effect might occur.          Assuming
that a slight effect were obtained, it would then become a ques
tion whether the effects were not due to the changes which occur
at the electrodes, rather than at the points of nutrition or secre
tion. The physical philosopher has an undoubted right to call
upon the physiologist to point out the anion and cation in his
circuit, or some adequate cause for the current.         The fact     the                                         is,
vagueness associated with the term current has misled physiolo

   The tide-gauge was erected at the inner angle of the harbour
in a very sheltered position.
   Its zero was referred to the copper bolt driven vertically into
one of the facing-stones of the pier, not far from the light-house.
                                                                 -
It was found to be 17°59 feet below this bolt.
   The twelve tidal stations just described were established be
tween September 1850 and January 1851, and were each visited
twice during the observations.
   The time was found at each station by means of a vertical
gnomon, with a meridian line, the observation of which at mid
day, with the aid of a table of the equation of time furnished to
           i.
each observer, gave the local time with considerable accuracy.
   The tide-gauge consisted of a wooden case, from 20 to 28 feet
in length,         in a vertical position and closed at the bottom,
excepting a few holes, guarded by copper gauze.      The bottom of
the case was  placed  4 or 5 feet below low-water    mark,  and the
oscillations of the water outside were scarcely sensible within the
case. To the top of the case was attached a box containing a
drum, over which was passed a silk cord, terminating at one
extremity in a wooden float resting on the water, and at the other
extremity in a small leaden counterpoise.       The motion of the
water inside the case was communicated by this cord to the drum,
which was connected by wheel-work of a very simple character
with the index-hand of a dial, marked into sixteen feet, each
divided into tenths.
   These dials and the annexed wheelwork were made by Mr.
Dobbin, of Wicklow Street, Dublin, and worked remarkably well
during the whole time of being used.      In addition to the index
hand traversing the dial, two other hands were placed on a separate
axle, which were pushed in opposite directions by a projection
placed on the index-hand, thus registering without observation
the maximum and minimum heights of the tide. To obtain this
registry it was only necessary to visit the dial twice during each
lunar day, either at half-flood or half-ebb; and after a few days'
practice, no difficulty was experienced by the observers in record
ing  all the high and low waters, with   a very slight expenditure
of time.
   The greatest care was taken    tosecure accurate determinations
of the exact position   ofthe zero marked outside the case, with
reference  tothe Ordnance and other bench-marks, the zero         of
the dial being made      correspond with the zero outside.

54          The Rev. S. Haughton on the Solar and Lunar
 diurnal tide are the most perfect that have been ever made on
so large a scale and for such a length of time.
    Having thus eliminated the diurnal tide from the observed
heights,    I
            constructed the diurnal tide at high and low water
following the moon’s southing, by points, on paper ruled into
divisions of tenths of an inch ; on the scale of heights, of an inch
to the foot; and of time, of five lunar days to the inch. After
joining the points, a curve was drawn in the usual way, which
represented geometrically the actual results of observation. These
curves were then compared with other curves constructed from
theory in the following manner.
   From whatever theory of tides we set out, whether Equilibrium
theory, Laplace’s dynamical theory, or Mr. Airy's theory of canal
waves, we arrive at the result that the diurnal tide is proportional
to the product of the sine and cosine of the declination of the
luminary; and the most general form of diurnal tide may be
deduced from this supposition, combined with the well-known
fact that the tide does not accompany, but follows the southing
of the luminary; and with the hypothesis of the hydrodynamical
theories, that the position of the luminary corresponding to any
tide is not      its
                actual position, but the position   had       period      it      at

have, by equation (5),

   From the foregoing Tables, it will be seen that there is an ex
cellent general agreement between the observations and the tides
calculated from the constants, and that these may therefore be
relied on as very close approximations to the constants of the
diurnal tide at Bunown.

         MY
I
                 DEAR          SIR,                                      Glasgow College, Dec. 24, 1855.
        HAVE  been prevented until to-day, by a pressure of business,
     from replying to the letter you addressed to me in the
Number of the Philosophical Magazine published at the begin
ning of this month.
   You ask me the question, “Supposing a cylinder of bismuth
to be placed within a helix, and surrounded by an electric cur
rent of sufficient intensity; can you say, with certainty, what the
action of either end of that cylinder would be on an external
fragment of bismuth presented to it?”
                           I
   In answer, say that the fragment of bismuth will be repelled
from either end of the bar provided the helix be infinitely long,
or long enough to exercise no sensible direct magnetic action in
the locality of the bismuth fragment.     can only say this with the         I
same kind of confidence that                                 I
                                  can say the different parts of the
earth’s atmosphere attract one another. The confidence amounts
in my own mind to a feeling of certainty.      In every case in which

of the reactions concerned.     This explanation      believe  can                   I            I

of water upon the neutral sulphate of methyle.
   Now as the sulphomethylate of methyle, obtained by the
mutual action of iodide of methyle and sulphomethylate of silver,
is not to be distinguished from the sulphate of methyle procured
by the distillation of a mixture of methylic alcohol and sulphuric
acid, we have a special reason, besides the general reasons                                           uni

   Because of the identity in odour of sulphate of methyle and
sulphomethylates undergoing decomposition, am the more               I                            in
clined to believe that sulphate of methyle is produced by the
action of boiling water upon certain sulphomethylates, or in their
spontaneous metamorphosis; although, indeed, in the first case
it can exist at any one time in minute quantity only, on account
of    its
        almost immediate re-solution into methylic alcohol and
sulphomethylic acid.
   Of the truth       these ideas, which theory
                           of                      first suggested,  at

quantity of crude sulphate of methyle may be distilled off. This
liquid, as also the body obtained by the action of sulphuric acid
upon methylic alcohol, when placed in water is slowly decom
posed at ordinary temperatures, almost instantaneously at 100°C.
The chief products of this reaction are methylic alcohol and
B-sulphomethylick acid.        The acid produced differs from ordi
nary sulphomethylic acid. For if the acid solution obtained by                          f
treating sulphate of methyle with water be saturated with car
bonate of baryta, a beautiful baryta salt may be obtained from
it by evaporation, or by precipitation with strong alcohol; the
aqueous solution of this salt is not decomposable by ebullition,
and the substance itself agrees in                                 all

  A   brief account may now be given of the metamorphoses of
the sulphomethylate of aethyle. Just as the product obtained
by acting upon methylate of sodium with iodide of aethyle is not
to be distinguished from the aethylate of methyle procured by the
decomposition of aethylate of sodium by means of iodide of me
thyle, so sulphomethylate of aethyle is apparently identical with
sulphaethylate of methyle, and yields the same products of de
composition when submitted to the action of water. To deter
                                                   I
mine the nature of this reaction, kept sulphomethylate of aethyle
together with water in a closed vessel in a warm place. When
the    oilhad entirely disappeared, and the liquid had lost                                          its
original odour, the more volatile portion was distilled off from                                     a
water-bath:       highly acid liquid remained

   The more important conclusions to which my experiments have
led me are these:—
   I. That by the action of water upon sulphate

£8-sulphomethylic acid is produced.
   II. That in the action of water upon sulphomethylate of baryta,
sulphate of methyle is formed, and that then the decomposition
proceeds according to (I.).
     III.
        That sulphomethylate of aethyle yields, by the action of
water, methylic and aethylic alcohols, as well as 3-sulphomethylic
and parathionic acids.

  “Notes on British Foraminifera.”                    By   J.   Gwyn Jeffreys, Esq.,
F.R.S.
    Having, during a great many years, directed my attention to the
recent Foraminifera which inhabit our own shores, I venture to offer
a few observations on this curious group, as Dr. Carpenter, who has
favoured the Society with an interesting and valuable memoir on
the subject, seems not to have had many opportunities of studying
the animals in the recent state.
    Rather more than twenty years ago I communicated to the Lin
naean Society a paper on the subject, containing a diagnosis and
figures of all the species. This paper was read and ordered to be
printed in the Transactions of that Society; but it was withdrawn
by me before publication, in consequence of my being dissatisfied
with D'Orbigny's theory (which I had erroneously adopted), that
the animals belonged to the Cephalopoda; and my subsequent ob
servations were confirmed by the theory of Dujardin. I have since
placed    allmy drawings and specimens             the disposal

to constitute the entire mass, and not merely a part of the animal.
I am inclined to think they are only desiccated portions of the ani
mal, separated from each other in consequence of the absence of any
 muscular or nervous structure.              It may also be questionable if the
 term “ova” is        rightly  applicable    to an animal which has no distinct
 organs of any kind.          Possibly the fry may pass through a metamor
 phosis, as in the case of the Medusa.
     Most of the Foraminifera are free, or only adhere by their pseudo
 podia to foreign substances.            Such are the Lagena of Walker, Nodo
 saria, Vorticialis and Teatularia, and the Miliola of Lamarck.                     The
 latter has    some,   although    a very  limited,   power   of  locomotion;     which
 is effected by exserting its pseudopodia to their full length, attach
 ing itself by them to a piece of seaweed, and then contracting them
 like india-rubber, so as to draw the shell along with them. Some
 of the acephalous mollusks do the same by means of their byssus.

                         of
philosophers Lenz and Jacobi had, however, stated that the mag
netism developed was, catteris paribus, proportional       the diameter                     to
of the bar. The discrepancy between the above results        considered                            is

by the author to be owing rather to the different circumstances
under which the experiments were tried than to any inaccuracies in
the experiments themselves.       Further, it appeared to him that in
any case of induction by electric currents, careful distinction should
be made between the several effects, which, compounded together,
constitute the total magnetic action.          Especially should a distinc
tion be made between the      magnetism       existing   under the inductive
influence of the current and that permanently developed so as to
remain after the electrical circuit is broken, and therefore the first
efforts of the author were directed to ascertain the laws which regu
late this permanent effect, or, as he thinks it may be conveniently
termed, the magnetic set.
    In his experiments the magnetism of any bar was ascertained, by
placing it vertically with its lower end near a delicately suspended
magnetic needle. This was a piece of sewing-needle ºths of an
inch long, furnished with an index of fine drawn glass tube tra
versing over a graduated circle six inches in diameter.            It was sus
pended by a filament of silk. The tangent of the deflection of the
needle was found to be the exact measure of the attraction of a bar.
In working with this instrument, it was found that the resistance of
the air prevented the needle from swinging even once beyond the
point of equilibrium to which it always arrived in less than ten
seconds. This resistance of the air, so useful for bringing the
needle rapidly to a state of rest, rendered it necessary to keep the
 entire instrument at a uniform temperature, for the slightest local
application of heat produced currents of air within the glass case of
sufficient strength to occasion considerable deflections.             The cir
cumstance    points  to the  possibility  of  constructing    a new and very
sensitive thermometer which     might    be  useful,   particularly  in experi
ments on the conduction of heat.                     -
    The method of experimenting consisted in observing,-1st. the
 magnetic attraction of any bar when a current circulated through
its spiral; 2nd. the attraction still subsisting after the circuit was
 broken; 3rd. the attraction of the other pole of the needle on the
 reversal of the current; and 4th. the attraction remaining after
this reverse current was cut off.          The sum of the 1st and 3rd
observations   gives  the total  change     in the magnetism of a bar by
the reversal of the current.    The sum of the 2nd and 4th gives the
total  permanent   change  of magnetism,      or the magnetic set.
    The experiments were made with iron bars of the several dia
 meters,  #,  #3, #, 4, #, and one inch, the length being in each
 case one  yard;  and also with iron bars #, +, + and one inch diame
ter, of the length of two yards.         In all the bars of small diameter
 up to # of an inch, the magnetic set obtained by the use of feeble
 currents was found to be proportional to the square of the current
 employed in producing them.            This law was found to subsist
 through a long series of electric intensities; but when the current
 was increased to a certain amount, the set, as observed in the bars
 of # and # of an inch diameter, increased in a much higher ratio,
 so as to vary, in some instances, with the 4th and 6th powers of

the current.  The point at which this phenomenon takes place is
called the magnetic breaking point.  A further increase of the cur
rent was attended with a rapid decrease of this ratio as the satura
tion of the bar was approached.
   The total change of magnetic condition by reversal of the cur
rent, minus the magnetic set, is found to be nearly proportional to
the intensity of the current.
   Results of exactly similar character were obtained by the use of
an electro-magnet, consisting of a bar of hard steel # of an inch in
diameter and 7# inches long.
   In conclusion, the author points out the striking and instructive
analogy which exists between the above phaenomena and those of
the set of materials as exhibited by Professor Hodgkinson, who, in
his admirable researches, has proved that the set, or permanent
change of figure, in any beam is proportional to the square of -  the
pressure to which it has been exposed.

   2. “On the discovery, by Mr. Robert Slimon, of Uppermost Silu
rian rocks and fossils near Lesmahago in the South of Scotland, with
observations on the relations of those strata to the overlying Palaeo
zoic rocks of that part of Lanarkshire.”    By Sir Roderick I. Mur
chison,          V.P.G.S. &c.
  The principal object of the author is to direct the attention of
geologists to the recent discovery of the uppermost Silurian rocks of
Scotland, in which country their presence was unknown. This
important discovery was made by Mr. Robert Slimon of Lesmahago,
who in the western part of that extensive parish of Lanarkshire
detected very remarkable and large fossil crustaceans, the exhibi
tion of which at the Glasgow meeting of the British Association
induced Sir R. Murchison to visit the tract in question, accompanied
by Professor Ramsay.
   The descending order of the strata is well seen on the banks of
the Nethaw river, Logan water, and other small streams; all tributaries
of the Clyde. There the lower carboniferous rocks, composed of
several bands of Productus and Encrinite limestone, frequent seams
of coal and layers of ironstone, including the celebrated “black band,”
are underlaid by the Old Red Sandstone, as largely exposed between
Lanark and Lesmahago. Towards                                its
                                            lower part the Old Red                                      is

North America the Eurypterus occupies the same geological horizon
as in Russia and the British Isles; and it is to be remembered
that large crustaceans of this group of Eurypteridae have nowhere
been found in rocks of older date than the Upper Silurian.
    3. “Description of the Crustaceans from the Uppermost Silurian
 rocks near Lesmahago.”          By John W. Salter, Esq., F.G.S.
    The large Crustacea referred to in the last paper were described
 by Mr. Salter.      They belong to the family Eurypteridae of Bur
 meister, and bear the closest relation to Eurypterus.           They also
 present many analogies with the Pterygotus, particularly in the
 presence of a scale-like sculpturing on the body-rings, a character
now known to be present in Eurypterus, and probably common to
 the whole family.             º
    They are elongate crustaceans, with a comparatively short cara
pace, bearing the large sessile eyes on the margin (and not on the
surface, as in Eurypterus), with ten or eleven body-rings unpro
vided with any appendages, and with a caudal joint either pointed
or deeply bilobed. There are a pair of limbs adapted for swimming,
a pair of maxillae with serrated edges, and an anterior pair of long
appendages with dilated bases, in                        all
                                          probability antennae (Eurypterus
has two   pairs  developed).      From the strap-shaped       ligulate form       or
of   the swimming-feet,      the name   Himantopterus     proposed     con   is             in

   The following communications were read:—
    1. “On the Tilestones, or Downton Sandstones, in the neigh
bourhood of Kington, and their contents.”          By R. W. Banks, Esq.
Communicated by Sir R. I. Murchison, V.P.G.S.
    In the Bradnor Quarry near Kington, on the borders of Radnor
shire and Herefordshire, the Tilestones and Downton Sandstone are
 seen to overlie the Ludlow rock in the following descending order:
—l. thin tilestone; 2. wall-stone, 12 feet thick, unfossiliferous;
3. mudstone, 3 to 6 inches, coloured grey by the intermixture of
vegetable matter, and containing fragments of Pterygotus, and other
crustacean remains, together with fossils allied to Cephalaspis Lyellii
 and C. Lewisii (Agas.); 4. Downton sandstone, 3 to 4 feet, with
Lingula cornea, Trochus helicites, Pterygotus, and Cephalaspis-like
fossils as above; 5, another grey mudstone, similar in character and
contents to No. 3; 6. yellow sandstone and flagstone, 4 feet, with
the Cephalaspis-like fossils, Pterygotus, Leptocheles, and Trochus
 helicites; 7. Ludlow rock.       Another section in the neighbourhood
exhibits thin   shaly  beds of tilestone,  with Lingula cornea, underlaid
by layers of flattened Orthonota amygdalina and Trochus helicites,
 which rest on the equivalent of the Ludlow bone-bed, here about
 2 or 3 inches thick, and containing Orthoceras gregarium, O. politum,
 Goniophora cymbaformis, Orthonota amygdalina, Orbicula rugata,
Holopella, Chonetes lata, Cornulites serpularius, Cucullella antiqua,
Modiolopsis lavis, Rhynchonella, Bellerophon carinatus, Leptocheles,
 Onchus tenuistriatus, Sphagodus, and Serpulites.
    The organic remains of these tilestone, sandstone, and mudstone
beds were illustrated by numerous highly finished drawings by the
 author; and these, together with his descriptive notes, indicated
the existence of one or more hitherto unknown or little understood
forms of Crustacean life, probably of the Eurypteridae group, and
elucidated several important characters in the carapace and append
 ages of the Pterygotus;     with regard to which genus, Mr. Banks
finds reason to differ from the generally received opinion that it was
allied to Limulus and the Poecilopods.
    Mr. Banks's specimens of the fossils resembling Cephalaspis Lyellii
 and C. Lewisii offer considerable evidence towards invalidating the
 Ichthyic relationship of these fossils, and placing them amongst the
 Crustacea.
    In conclusion—from the absence of the numerous Mollusca cha
racteristic of the Ludlow rocks, and from the presence of Crustacea
that have not been found in the Ludlow beds, and especially the
abundance of the Pterygotus, so characteristic of the Middle Old
Red of Scotland,-the       author is inclined to separate these Downton
or Tilestone beds from the Upper Ludlow Rocks, and class them (as
 Sir Roderick Murchison, previously to his later remarks on the sub
ject, originally arranged them) as the bottom-beds of the Old Red
 Sandstone.

          Mr. D. Sharpe     on the last Elevation   of the Alps.       85
    2. “On the last Elevation of the Alps, with notices of the Heights
 at which the Sea has left traces of its action on their sides.” By
 Daniel Sharpe, Esq., F.R.S. & F.G.S.
    The object of this paper is to show that after the Alps had
assumed their present form, the whole region was submerged below
the sea, and stood 9000 feet lower than at present; and that it then
rose out of the sea by a succession of unequal steps, separated by
long intervals of time, during which the waves produced impressions
on the sides of the Alps which are still visible.       These effects are
traced out under three heads: 1st. The erosion of the sides of the
mountains, producing rounded forms which extend up to definite
lines, above which the mountains rise into rugged peaks, in striking
contrast with the smoother forms below.         This change of form had
been observed     by Hugi,   who referred it to different composition of
the   rocks;  by  Agassiz  and Desor, who seeing that Hugi's view was
incorrect, explained it by the action of moving ice, to which they
arbitrarily assigned a definite upper limit; and lastly by Prof.        J.
Forbes, who has pointed out similar phaenomena in Norway at 1500
or 2000 feet elevation. Mr. Sharpe shows that throughout Switzer
land these lines of erosion occur at three definite levels of 4800,
 7500, and 9000 English feet above the sea, and he argues that no
action but that of water could have produced a uniformity of level
over so large an area, and that it required a long period of time to
have formed such deep indentations of the mountain sides.
    2nd. The sudden change of steepness which occurs at the head of
every Alpine valley is assumed to be due to the excavating action of
water, standing for a long period at that height: and a table is given
of the elevation above the sea of the heads of between forty and
fifty valleys, at various altitudes, which shows a correspondence of
level between valleys on the opposite sides of the Alps, and between
the excavation of several valleys and the lines of erosion at 4800 and
 7500 feet; while the ice and snow in the higher valleys prevent a
comparison with the highest line at 9000 feet.
    3rd. The terraces of alluvium in the valleys are considered, in
accordance with the opinion of Mr. Darwin, Mr. Yates, and others,
to have been formed by detritus carried down into water standing at
the level of the head of the terrace. The elevation of many of these
terraces is given, and a correspondence is shown of the height above
the sea of terraces in valleys which have no connexion with one
 another, and of terraces in some valleys with the heads of other
                                                         e
 valleys.
    All these effects might be produced by a sea surrounding the
 Alps, and cannot be otherwise explained; and the level of this sea
 being assumed to have been constant, the Alps must have been rising
 out of the waters while these operations were going on. The period
 of this, their last elevation, is stated to have been after the Tertiary
 epoch; and a great part of the vast accumulations of sand, gravel,
 and rounded blocks which are seen in the valleys of the Alps and
 covering the lowlands of Switzerland are considered to have been

   86               Intelligence  and Miscellaneous   Articles.
   formed by the waves beating against the mountains during their
   elevation.
      Lastly, referring to the angular erratic blocks on the sides of the
   Jura, &c., the author points out that he removes the only serious
   difficulty opposed to the views of those who have supposed them to
   have been transported by floating ice, by showing that the levels at
   which those blocks are found were below the sea for a long period
   at the epoch of their removal.

  TWO PROCESSES BY WHICH THE PHAENOMENON                       OF  COLOURED
      RINGS    MAY    BE PRODUCED WITH GREAT           INTENSITY.       BY M.
      CARRiº R.E.
                 a drop of a solution of bitumen of Judea in a mixture of
   WHEN     benzine    and oil of naphtha is let fall upon the surface of
  some water in a vessel, a very brilliant luminous phaenomenon is
  seen to be immediately produced.         The bituminous liquid extends
 regularly in a thin film on the surface of the water, and thus pro
 duces very bright colours.        The colour furnished by the film changes
 every moment for a minute or two, because a portion of the benzine
 and oil of naphtha evaporates, and the thickness of the film dimi
 nishes.     But in a little time the film itself is completely solidified,
 from the oxidizing action of the air.
     This delicate solid film may be easily fixed upon paper. Thus,
 supposing that it has been produced in a tub at the bottom of which
 there is a socket with a stop-cock, and which also contains a stool,
 upon which, immersed in the water, rests the leaf of paper to be
 coloured; the film having been formed above the paper, all that is
 necessary to fix it on the paper is to open the stop-cock.
    To obtain a regular coloration of the paper by means of the bitu
 minous film, it is very important that the latter should be very co
herent.      I increased its cohesion by introducing a certain amount of
 caoutchouc into the solution of bitumen of Judea.
    I also obtain the phaenomenon of coloured rings with great bril
liancy by exposing to the air hot and freshly-filtered common ink, in
which sugar is the principal adhesive matter. This process may serve
for the study of the phaenomenon of coloured rings.           In fact, as the
thickness of the film which forms at thesurface of the inkonly increases
very slowly, we may very easily and exactly determine the order in
which the different tints produced by a homogeneous film succeed
each other in proportion as its thickness augments.          I have also suc
ceeded in fixing on paper the film produced by ink; but as in this
case the cohesion of the pellicle is very slight, I have only succeeded
by taking the following precautions:—
    1. I do not deposit the film upon the paper until it has acquired
a  great  thickness.

1.           subjects in physics have been so much experimented
    Fºw upon as the efflux of water from apertures made either in
the bottom or in the sides of vessels.         A glance at these nume
rous researches is sufficient to show that their object is for the
most part a practical one,—the determination of the coefficients
of efflux. Few have hitherto attempted to discover the physical
conditions which give rise to the remarkable forms of water-jets
issuing from differently formed apertures.            This is the more
remarkable, seeing that the phaenomena in question are of daily
occurrence; and we might have expected that the desire of un
derstanding these phaenomena would have, before this, suggested
experiments calculated to explain them. Whilst the mysterious
phaenomena of electricity and the delicate phaenomena of optics
have been examined on every side and reduced to simple prin
ciples, the phaenomena attendant upon the efflux of liquids
not only lack explanation, but have not been even accurately
observed.
   2. The remarkable forms of liquid jets have often been de
scribed, particularly in the second half of the foregoing century
by Michelotti, who, however, mentions them but briefly in his
Sperimenti idraulici.      Eitelwein has added to the German trans
                              º
lation of this  work,   by Prof. Zimmermann (Berlin, 1808), several
faithful drawings of these jets, without, however, entering upon
their cause.     George Bidone has published the most complete

investigation on this subject.          In his memoir entitled “Expe
riments upon the forms and directions of Jets and Currents of
Water*,” the forms of fifty jets issuing from different openings
are described.        The same author gives an explanation of the
production of their peculiar forms, which, however, has already
been pronounced, and                     I
                              think justly           insufficient         so,
                                                                        Poncelet                     by
 and Lesbrost.        Bidone asserts that one            the most interesting   of
of  these phaenomena depends upon                illusion.         an
                                                               Some observers
 have asserted that peculiar spiral-shaped intersecting lines are
 visible      on
               the surfaces      jets.      With respect

 Bidone says that the modes and ventral segments which may                                                          be

                   on

                          is           Since the eye only momentarily
 perceives the continual changes thus produced                     the positions          in

 water crossed one another and passed from one side                    the jet                      of
 the other.          It remarkable that Bidone has overlooked the
                             is
 conditions under which spiral-shaped lines are produced; never
 theless, without knowing these conditions,                      impossible          it   is                        to
 comprehend       the complicated phaenomena which jets                    liquid                         of

 forms      jets

                                used an apparatus consisting of a
zinc vessel  containing about a cubic foot of water, in the bottom
of which a glass tube, 15 millims. in interior diameter and 1 m3
long, was fixed perpendicularly.     At the lower extremity of this
tube was a    cock, and to this was affixed a brass tube with two
branches inclined to each other at an angle of 30°, and provided
with long tubes of vulcanized india-rubber.       These tubes had
also an interior diameter of 15   millims, and were provided with
brass tubes of the same interior diameter and 0m-25 long, to
the anterior ends of which caps were attached whose thin walls
were pierced to form the efflux orifices.     These tubes were so
disposed upon a fixed frame, that any required direction could
be given to the water-jets issuing from them.     Fig 1, Plate                                                          I.,   is

jets, and is no longer plane, but somewhat curved; neither is it
 circular, but extended for the most part in that direction in which
it would be cut by a plane passing through the axes of both jets.
 Such a surface is shown in fig. 3, Plate I.
    Savart does not appear to have observed this phaenomenon,
 but only that which manifests itself when two jets of different
 diameters and parallel axes meet one another”.      Neither has he
occupied himself with the phaenomena which are observable when
the axes of the two jets are inclined to one another.
    7. As it will often be necessary in what follows to distinguish
the case when the axes of the jets are in the same plane from
that when jets, whose axes do not intersect, encounter one an
           I
 other, will, for the sake.of brevity, call the encounter of two
jets whose axes cut one another a central encounter, no matter
whether they are parallel or inclined to one another.
                 Eageriments with Jets of equal diameters.
     8.   In the following   experiments,    wherein the jets were always
inclined towards each other, jets of different diameters were also
employed; nevertheless, the phaenomena attending the encounter
of two jets issuing with equal velocities from two equal orifices
shall be first described.  When the axes of two such jets, ab and
a,b, fig. 4, lay in the same plane, that is to say, when a central
encounter took place, a water surface was produced perpendicular
to the plane passing through both axes; and if both jets had the
same velocity at the place of meeting, the surface bisected the
angle made by the jets.
   This surface, however, was not equally distributed around the
place of meeting, but was elongated principally in the direction
of the motion of the jets. Fig. 4 shows the form of the surface
when horizontal jets were employed.
   9. The more acute the angle made by the jets, the smaller is
the part bg of the surface within this angle. For instance, when
the apertures from which the jets issued had a diameter of 3 mil
lims, and the axes formed a right angle, the surface extended
itself within the angle abal, so as to form the part bg, fig. 4.
When the angle between the jets, however, amounted to 60°,
the surface within the angle abat, as shown in fig. 5, no longer
existed, neither was it observable when the angle was smaller.
   The breadth cd of the surface cdf figs. 4 and 5, also diminished
with the magnitude of the angle made by the jets ab and a,b.
The angle being constant, the breadth of this surface diminished
with the velocity of the water in the jets.
   10. When the jets encountered each other at an angle, and

when their axes were not in the same plane, the phaenomena
were different according as the axes were more or less distant
from each other. When they were so far apart that their edges
only encountered each other, and when the angle which they
formed was not greater than 60° or 70°, each jet, after contact,
continued        its
                path, although both deviated from their original
directions and approached each other,                                     so

made thicker and thereby smaller; the edges approach one an

separate journeys.        But the    edgesifencounter one another cen

                                        of            the same plane, and    in

produced between them remains,                consequence    in   cohesion,                     of
connected with both jets.         The latter would pursue their paths,
and continue             to
                     recede further from each other         they were not             if

                   Prof. Magnus's Hydraulic Researches.                                      97
prevented by their connexion  with this surface.                            The continual
                                               the jets from
contraction of the intermediate surface deflects
their direction, but the former thereby becomesthinner and is
ultimately ruptured. The jets then continue to move onwards
in the same direction as the one they had when they separated
from the surface.
   22. If the force with which the jets move is not sufficient to
rupture the surface, either because the angle between them or
their velocity is too small, or because only a small portion of
them pursues the same path, the greater having served to form
the water surface, the jets are continually brought nearer to one
another by the force of cohesion, and the water surface appears
unbroken, as shown by bede, in fig. 7.
   But inasmuch as the axes of the jets before contact were not
in one plane, they do not meet one another now ; that which
was before on one side, e. g. the right or above, lies on the other
side, the left or below, at the next contact.         For if we imagine
a  plane  parallel to the axes of both    jets  immediately   before con
tact and equally distant from both, the force with which the
homologous points of both jets seek to approach one another
may be divided into two equal parts, of which the one acts in the
above plane, the other perpendicular to                       it.
                                                       The latter causes
the two corresponding points          the jets of this plane in  approach      to
one   another,  and therefore moves both            opposite  in
                                                               directions.
 Hence the jets arrive       the above plane, but
                                 in                       consequence  in                     of
their inertia they pass beyond

                 one side      theofplane   now lies      the other, and
                                                                       on
vice versá.    This  process      repeated,
                                        is    and thus the closed sur
faces bcd and deef, fig.          8,
                               are produced.

                                         form the water surface.      The
 greater part continues           its
                              path, and consequently remains almost
 entirely    the plane which parallel

contact, fig.      7.
   For the same reason, the second and third water surfaces, when
they exist, also remain nearly parallel        this plane.

that the water surface will form a greater angle with this plane
the smaller the masses of the jets in comparison to that of the
water forming the surface, until the angle finally becomes a
right angle.      It is equally manifest that the water surface makes
a small    angle    with that plane if the mass of the jets prepon
derate, and that if the jets only meet at their edges, the angle
almost vanishes.
    The same process which takes place at the first meeting of the
jets repeats itself when they pass over each other for the second
time, and there partially encounter.             But because those parts of
the  jets which meet at this second          place  are in the same propor
tion to the entire diameter of the jet as at the first encounter,

the second surface,                       makes the same angle with the
first, beca,       this does with the surface parallel

                                                 it         follows:—Let              is      as

sooner than the rest.       The interior strata have therefore already
formed      asurface before the next strata encounter.             But the
place  in which the succeeding strata encounter              evidently not                    is
in  the surface resulting from the preceding strata, but more

thereby the surface produced from the whole strata becomes con
cave on the side of the jet with the greater velocity.

 Such disturbing influences are unavoidable, and hence the liquid
after some time commences a rotation, which, beginning in the
lowest strata, is soon communicated to the whole mass.                 In
consequence of this rotation, a funnel-shaped cavity is formed,
which at first is only seen on the surface, but soon draws itself
downwards to the aperture.

    If it be      assumed that the axis about which the rotation takes
place goes through the centre of the aperture, the water particles
which are in the one half of this aperture will be moved by the
rotation in an opposite direction to those in the other half. In
consequence of this rotation, the particles, after they have left
the aperture, do not fall vertically, but deviate from the vertical;
those in the one half deviate towards the one side, and those in
the other towards the opposite side.      Hence the edges of the jet
are not in a plane, and encounter either not at all, or at any rate
not centrally.    Hence the jet assumes, as remarked above, the
spiral shape, fig. 16 a and b.
   58. If the rotation in the vessel be very violent, the two edges
deviate, soon after the liquid has left the vessel, so strongly in
opposite directions, that the water mass between them separates,
and both edges continue their way as two separate jets, moving
often at a considerable angle to each other.
     59. The         with which the rotation of the liquid in the
                    ease
vessel occurs, or rather the difficulty of avoiding it without using
the tranquilizer, is the reason why the jet in            regular form,          its

108    Mr. Spiller's Analyses of a Babylonian Cylinder and Amulet.
                    The Babylonian “Cylinder.”
   The general form of this is cylindrical, slightly diminishing
in diameter towards the middle, with a hole drilled through the
centre lengthwise, for the purpose, no doubt, either of stringing
them, or supporting them on a central rod, after the manner of
the cotton-reels in a spinning-machine.     Their external surfaces
are beautifully polished, and around the cylinders are very
finely-executed intaglio engravings of human figures or deities,
together with the arrow-headed characters, which, in the case of
the cylinder analysed, had been almost entirely erased. The great
hardness of the materials of the cylinders must have necessitated
the possession by the Assyrians of well-tempered engraving in
struments. Such tools have been found, and were, in fact, in
the course of transmission to this country, together with nume
rous other antiquities intended for the French Government, but
were unfortunately lost by the overturning of a barge in the
rapids of the river Euphrates. These gravers were of hardened
steel, and described as well fitted for their purpose.
   The “cylinder” from which a portion was broken off for
analysis weighed 338-91 grains, measured in length 1:19 inch;
the diameter at either extremity was 6 inch, but lessening
towards the middle of the cylinder, as before stated; the bore of
the longitudinal drill hole was 125 inch. This, as well as an
other cylinder of very similar appearance and specific gravity,
was found to attract strongly the magnetic needle; in this respect,
and in the character of the fracture, it bore a close resemblance
to the native varieties of magnetic oxide of iron, but the chemical
analysis was required to confirm this supposition.
                            The Amulet,
   The cylinders were accompanied by an amulet or charm, the
weight of which was 12792 grains; it had the form of an elon
gated, tolerably regular ellipsoid, measuring 1-5 inch in length
by 34 inch greatest width; near one extremity was a transverse
perforation very sharply drilled. This specimen had the colour
and general appearance of haematite, and did not exert any visible
action on a delicately suspended magnetic needle.       Its fracture
was minutely crystalline, and very compact.
   In elucidation of the subjoined tabulated results, it is only
necessary to state that the iron was estimated by a standard
solution of bichromate of potash, a process which a considerable
experience in the analysis of iron ores has shown to give very
accurate results; the iron and manganese were separated by
boiling with an alkaline acetate; the phosphoric acid by a modi
fication of the method proposed by Fresenius. Besides the con

stituents enumerated, they were both tested for chromium and
zinc ; the oxide of the former metal, being isomorphous with
sesquioxide of iron, might possibly have been present as in the
mineral chrome iron.     Zinc also is known to occur in Frank
linite, a mineral of the magnetic oxide type, in which part or the
whole of the protoxide of iron is replaced by the corresponding
oxide of zinc.   Neither of these metals, however, were found to
be present.

110     On a Method of exhibiting fine Galvanometric          Experiments.
such as the experiments with the nerve current, and the negative
variation of the muscular current in the living human body, to a
numerous audience in the theatre of the Royal Institution.
   The means made use of readily suggest themselves.           They
consist in furnishing the magnetic  system   with a  reflecting sur
face, by which a bundle of parallel rays are reflected and thrown
upon a screen, the motions of the luminous image being observed
instead of those of the needle itself. When the light is suffi
ciently intense, the moving image can of course be shown to any
number of hearers, and it is also manifest that an almost un
limited sensibility is attainable by this method. Helmholtz and
I  had already conversed on this subject; indeed he informed me
by letter, that he had successfully applied the method several
years ago in repeating my experiments.        He made use of a gal
vanometer of    tangents   devised by  himself, which is essentially
the same as that since     empirically  found  by Gaugain, and the
principle of which has been developed by Bravais. A reflecting
 steel disc supplies, according to Weber's suggestion, the place of
the bar-magnet and mirror originally suggested by Poggendorff.
Making use of sunlight, Helmholtz thus succeeded in showing
the principal phaenomena of the muscular current.
    I  had placed at my disposal a multiplying galvanometer of
28,780 coils, constructed by Sauerwald of Berlin, according to
my directions, for my friend Dr. Bence Jones.       For this instru
ment    I obtained from the same artist an astatic system of thicker
needles than ordinary, united together by a piece of brass, instead
of the tortoise-shell which      Igenerally use. A prolongation of
the uniting piece above the upper needle carries an extremely
light ring of brass, at the upper point of which is the eye made
use of to suspend the system.        Within the ring moves upon a
horizontal axis a   mirror, fixed in a brass setting of extreme light
ness.    The  mirror, which  I   owe to the kindness of M. Schieck,
consists of a small round glass cover, made use of for microscopic
purposes, silvered at one side, and possessing a diameter of 19.5
millims.     Two simple cocoon fibres are sufficient to sustain the
whole securely. The ring, in which the mirror may be inclined
towards the horizon, can itself be turned round the prolongation
of the brass joining piece; so that it is thus in our power, by
properly deflecting the system, to reflect the incident beam of
light in any required direction. It     is, however,     to remarked,
                                                              be
that when the inclination of the mirror towards the horizon
augments, the sensibility   of  the arrangement diminishes.
   As  light-source,  an electric lamp from Duboscq         Paris, also
belonging      Dr. Bence Jones, was made use       of.    It in
                                                            was fed by
            of to
a battery      forty cells of   Grove, and our friend Prof. Tyndall
had the kindness    to undertake the regulation    of  the light, and

the direction of the ray upon the mirror.   At first a diaphragm
was placed before the converging lens of the lamp, so that the
light struck the mirror alone, for feared that the warming ofI
the      air
        about the galvanometer might produce currents, and thus
disturb the needle.     was found, however, that this precaution

                      that the full luminous sheaf might    per

And since the maximum value                                 of   the solar tide       is   0.23 feet, we
have,    by   equation (5),

By equation (4), we have

Also, since the maximum value                                          of   the solar tide    is    0.25 feet, we
have

   From the Diurnal Tables, the solar and lunar diurnal tides at
Donaghadee were calculated separately, and found to give the
following results:—

  Adding the first two                    of       each     of    the preceding,
             Range                                              high water =0-80

but since     the moon’s hour-angle
                m   is                   Donaghadee time,                   in                           at
high water, and   10h 40", we obtain, finally,

  By equation (4), we have
      max. value         of   2M sin              2p=      w/(0.80)*-i- (0-81)*=1-139             ft.;

Also, since the maximum value                                   of   the solar tide    is   0.28 ft., we
have,     by   equation          5,
                         max. value                of   2S sin 20 =0.56 ft.,
and

that researches in magnecrystallic action have established, namely,
that the self-same arrangement of particles influences the para
magnetic and diamagnetic forces in the self-same way, intensifying
both in the same direction.      Let us suppose, then, that the
sphere of carbonate                                                Fig. 2.
of iron is suspended
as in fig. 2, the line
ab being the axis of
the crystal. I have
already shown that
this line is that in

induction is most             in

greater leverage possessed by the force acting on the more distant
parts. When the shape of the poles is such that the diminution
of the force with the increase of distance is too speedy for the
above condition to be fulfilled, the phaenomena no longer exhibit
themselves.    It is plain that the diminution of the force as we
recede from a pointed pole must be more speedy than when we
recede from a magnetized surface, and hence it is that Mr. Fa
raday finds that “conical poles are not good.”       It is also essen
tial that the length of the lever which supports the magnecry
stallic body shall bear a sensible ratio to the distance between the
two points of application of the magnetic force.         the lever be         If
long, recession will take place in cases where, with a shorter
lever, approach would be observed.
   It is well known that a piece of soft iron is attracted most
strongly by the angles and corners of a magnet, and hence it is
inferred that the magnetic force emanating from these edges and
corners is more intense than that issuing from the central parts
of the polar surfaces.    Such experiments, however, when nar
rowly criticised, do not justify the inference drawn from them.
They simply show that the difference between attraction and
repulsion, on which the final attraction depends, is greater at
the edges than elsewhere; but they do not enable us to infer
the absolute strength of either the attraction or the repulsion,
or in other words, of the force of magnetization.          The fact
really       is,

  excited substances are less intense, the difference of these forces,
  owing to the speedier diminution of the force with the distance,
  is greater than in the centre of the field. It is therefore an error
  to infer, that, because the attraction of the mass is greater at
  the edges and corners than in the centre of the field, the mag
  netizing force of the former must therefore be more intense than
  that of the latter*.

  magnetic polarity: the experiment was made with a view of
  proving that “the magnecrystallic force is a force acting at a
   distance.” “The crystal,” writes Mr. Faraday, “is moved by
  the magnet at a distance, and the crystal can also move the mag
  net at a distance.          To produce the latter result,              converted a           I

ance far inferior to what                     I
                             am going to tell you.
    The fact that the resinous Boletus principle, after having been
removed from the mushroom (by the means of alcohol), is not
able to colour itself spontaneously in the atmospheric air, whilst
it seems to have that power so long as it happens to be deposited
 in the parenchyma of the Boletus, led me to suspect that there
 exists in the Boletus luridus, besides the guaiacum-like sub
 stance, another matter, endowed with the property of exalting
 the chemical power of common oxygen, and causing that element
in       its
         condition

of the Agaricus sanguineus, &c., and charged with Ö, gives
up that oxygen to guaiacum, and the latter transfers it to the
resinous matter of the Boletus luridus; thus the different organic

It   was seen  in brilliant shining lamellae on boiling out the me
teorites with hydrochloric acid.
     The chief mass consists of two kinds of silicates, of which one
 is decomposed and gelatinized by hydrochloric acid, and the
 other is not decomposed.
     A microscopic examination showed that most of the minerals
 which occur in rounded particles on the dark mass of the me
  teorite are silicates undecomposable by acids, while the mass of
  the stone is chiefly made up of decomposable constituents. Ex
  clusive of the determination of the quantity of hydrogen evolved
  on treating the meteorite with acid, three kinds of analysis were
  made.     One by fusing the meteorite with carbonate of soda,
  from which the quantity of silica was found to be 41-62 per cent.
  A second was made with hydrofluoric acid, in which the quan
  tity of silica estimated from the difference was 43-94 per cent.
  This excess of 2:32 of silica is explained partly from the unequal
  mixedness of the meteorite, partly from the unavoidable loss in
   so many constituents, which of course fell on the difference, and
   partly from the phosphorus, sulphur, and oxide of chromium,
   the quantities of which were too small to be determined with any
   degree of accuracy.      In this manner, by the usual methods, the
   meteorites were found to contain in 100 parts the following

     An experiment was made to separate the two kinds of silicates.
 The finely-powdered meteorite was heated for a long time with
 strong hydrochloric acid.       The residue was well washed out, and
boiled repeatedly with carbonate of soda. The insoluble residue
amounted to 30°48 per cent.           (In a second experiment, where
the mass was not boiled so long with carbonate of soda, 36 per
cent. was obtained.)

       From these results, it does not appear to us that any conclu
 sion can be drawn as to the composition of the meteorites.                  The
 more so, when we consider that even the insoluble part may con
 tain compounds which are partially decomposed by the continued
 action of the acid, and afterwards by the alkali.                  If the quan
 tities of oxygen in the magnesia and iron, the two predominating
 bases in the insoluble part, be compared with that of the silica,
 it is almost in the proportion of 1:3. We might suppose from
 this that the chief constituent of the insoluble part is a mineral
 of the formula                M            •
                                          SiO3;

 and that the soluble part, which is so rich in magnesia, has for
 its chief constituent a mineral of a formula similar to olivine,
 3MgO, SiO4.
       But it is most probable that the mineral constituents are
 themselves mixtures, as Rammelsberg assumes to be the case
 with many similar meteorites.           The chief mass of the meteorites
 of Mezö-madaras would then be composed of a mixture of oli
 vine, augite, and labradorite, containing besides, nickeliferous
 iron, iron pyrites, graphite, and          a  small quantity of chrome
  IrOn Ore.

From which it may be inferred reciprocally, that, in the act of
crystallization, a very remarkable concentration of matter to a
maximum of density takes place in these substances.
   All these minerals are silicates: it was therefore natural to
inquire whether the same effect would show itself with crystal
lized silica or quartz.                                      -

   Thus, then, there are substances which, contrary to sulphur,
quartz, and the silicates, have only a very feeble tendency, or
none at all, to assume, even momentarily, the vitreous state.
   It might be demanded, to which of the two categories does
alumina belong.     Natural corundum in small colourless crystals
gave me a density of 4022; the same crystals, fused with the gas
blowpipe of M. Gaudin, had a density of 3.992,-an insensible
difference.  There is not, therefore, a glass of corundum, as there
                                                                                                           of its
is of  quartz,  and this physical property of alumina, as                                         all
chemical properties, directly attaches aluminium       the group                  to
metallic bodies.

 It is now communicated to the Royal Society, although only in an
 incomplete form, as   it may serve to indicate some important practi
 cal applications of the theory, especially in estimating the dimen
 sions of telegraph wires and cables required for long distances; and
 the author reserves a more complete development and illustration of
 the mathematical parts of the investigation for a paper on the conduc
 tion of Electricity and Heat through solids, which he intends to lay
 before the Royal Society on another occasion.

along a submarine telegraph-wire, shows how the question recently
raised as to the practicability of sending distinct signals along such a
length as the 2000 or 3000 miles of wire that would be required for
America, may be answered.        The general investigation will show

  June 21, 1855.-The Lord Wrottesley, President, in the Chair.
   The following communication was read:—
   Discussion of the observed Deviations of the Compass in several
Ships, Wood-built and Iron-built; with General Tables for facili
tating the examination of Compass-deviations.”            By G. B. Airy,
Esq., F.R.S., Astronomer Royal.
   The author refers, in the first place, to his paper in the Philoso
phical Transactions for 1839, on the Disturbance of the Compass
in Iron Ships, for a theory of the forces produced by the transient
induced magnetism of iron. Using the term “polar-magnet-devia
tion” to express a deviation similar to that which would be pro
duced by a magnetized steel bar partaking of the movements of the
ship; and using the term “quadrantal deviation” for a deviation
following the law of the sine of double the azimuth, and thus
having, if “positive,” the signs + — + — in the four successive
quadrants of azimuth, or, if “negative,” the signs — --— + in the
four successive quadrants: then it appears that the deviation pro
duced by the transient induced magnetism of a ship will consist of
two parts; of which one will be a “polar-magnet-deviation,” such
as would be produced by a magnetized steel bar whose axis is par
allel to the keel of the ship, and whose absolute intensity is propor
tional to the terrestrial vertical force at the place; and the other
will be a “quadrantal deviation,” which, in angular deviation, will
be absolutely the same in all magnetic latitudes and with all mag
nitudes of terrestrial magnetic force, and will usually be “posi
tive.” Now combining these forces with the force of the “sub
permanent magnetism” of a ship, which in its nature is essentially
similar to the magnetism of a steel bar, and would therefore, if
isolated, produce “polar-magnet-deviation;” and remarking that
the combination of two polar-magnet-forces will produce a third
polar-magnet-force,       the resulting deviations of which will be
“polar-magnet-deviations;” it is evident that the analysis of the
observed deviations of the compass in any given instance will con
sistin resolving them into two systems, one of which follows the laws
of “polar-magnet-deviation,”      and the otherisa “quadrantaldeviation.”
   The    practical  solution of this problem, without the assistance
of  tables,  is troublesome.     In order to diminish the difficulty, the
author has      prepared   a Table of polar-magnet-deviations,     for the
whole circumference as regards azimuths, and for all values of
 “modulus” or proportion of the disturbing force to the earth's
horizontal force, up to 0-8.
   To discover the elements of “polar-magnet-deviation,” that                 is,
the neutral point and the modulus,         in  any given case,it    neces
                                                                   is
sary   so    combine the observations that the “quadrantal deviation”
            to
 shall  be  eliminated.     Simple rules are given for this; and the pro
       ofinvestigating the elements, with the assistance       the Tables,
                                                           to of
cess
is illustrated by exhibiting the work from beginning            end,    in    an
actual instance.
     When the elements are found, the Tabular Polar-Magnet-Devia
tions are    to   be formed from those elements;   and the excess       of   the

162                                                 Royal Society.
 Observed Deviations over these Tabular Deviations ought to consist
 simply of Quadrantal Deviation and Errors of Observations.
    From the neutral point and the modulus, with the absolute mea
 sure of the terrestrial horizontal force, it is easy to form the abso
 lute measures of the apparent permanent forces of the ship, in the
 directions of “headward” and “starboard” respectively. The star
board force (on the assumption of general symmetry) can arise from
nothing but subpermanent magnetism; the headward force will con
 sist of subpermanent magnetism added algebraically to a multiple of
 the terrestrial vertical force, the multiplier being an unknown con
 stant different for each different ship.
    The process is then applied by the author to four wood-built sail
 ing ships, two wood-built steamers, and five iron-built steamers,
 whose compass-deviations have been observed at twenty-nine sta
 tions in all.    The results are as follows:—
    1. In all   cases, the principal part of the deviation follows the law
of  polar-magnet-deviation.
    2. When the polar-magnet-deviation is computed accurately from
 the Table, and subtracted from the observed deviation, the residual
quantity in            all
                   cases follows very closely the law          quadrantal devia        of
 tion, leaving very little                          be
                                      accounted for by errors
                                            to                        observation.                of

 the tide and stranding surface-waves in an estuary, as determined
 by the structure of sand-beds, and the relations between them and
 the physical geography of the limiting shores. The direction and
 character of the currents being known, the physical geography of the
 area also might be inferred within certain limits. After this were
 explained the various structures produced by currents in strata
 formed under their influence, from which the direction, velocity,
 character, and depth of the currents can be ascertained.          This
 was followed by an account of the directions and other peculiari
 ties of the currents indicated in the various sandy and other strata
 of the tertiary formations at numerous localities in the district
 under consideration.       From thence the author obtains data from
 which   many   peculiarities  in the physical geography of the coast
 lines of the    tertiary land and sea in the area now occupied by
 Hampshire and the Isle of Wight can be deduced. The chief of
 these characters are, that during the tertiary period there was
 formed a wide estuary of a large river, running from the west
 towards the east; that the land from which the river came must
 have been to the north, the west, and south-west, whilst the estuary
opened into a tidal sea towards the east; and that at the western
 part of the Isle of Wight area there existed a considerable shoal.
 This explains why the section of the tertiary deposits at Alum Bay
 is so very different to that at Whitecliff; where there was no shoal,
 but a tidal channel too deep to be affected by the action of the waves
 of the surface.
    2. “On the probable Permian character of the Red Sandstone of
 the South of Scotland.” By E. W. Binney, Esq., F.G.S.; in a letter
to Sir C. Lyell, F.G.S.
    During a late visit to the South of Scotland, the author came to the
 conclusion that the red sandstones of Canobie on the Esk, Lockerbie,
 Corncockle Muir, Dumfries, Thornhill, Sanquhar, and Mauchline,
 as well as those of the West of Scotland generally, with the exception
 of the Annan beds, containing tracks of the Labyrinthodon, will have
to be classed as Permian instead of Triassic. The Permian beds of
 the north-west of England, as described lately by the author in the
 Manchester Memoirs, consist of 1. red and variegated marls (gyp
siferous in the north, and calciferous in the south of the district),
 300 feet thick; 2. magnesian limestone, 10 feet; 3. conglomerate,
 350 feet; 4. lower new red sandstone, 500 feet. The conglomerate of
the above list is represented, according to the author, by the breccia
of the South of Scotland underlying red sandstones. The con
glomerate or breccia consists of a cement, similar throughout the
whole region, and of fragments of rocks which vary in their cha
racter according to the localities; the imbedded fragments having
been in every case derived from the local rocks.
    The circumstance of the large tract of the South-west of Scotland
hitherto mapped as Trias proving to be Permian will be of great
importance to the ironstone and coal districts of the vicinity; since
in some instances these latter deposits will probably be followed
beneath it.

  ON THE CAUSE OF THE PHOSPHORESCENCE OF THE AGARIC OF
                     THE OLIVE.        B.Y. M. FABRE.
     HE   phosphorescence   of living plants   is a very rare phaenomenon;
      it has been proved   principally   in some species of the great class
of Fungi. The Agaric of the olive (Agaricus olearius) has been espe
cially indicated as possessing this property; it has been the subject
of the researches of Prof. Delille, and more recently of M. Tulasne;
the latter, however, in his important memoir upon this subject, in
dicates some gaps to be filled up, especially in regard to physico
chemical experiments, and the positive proof of the cause of the
luminous phaenomenon exhibited by this Agaric. This has been the
object of M. Fabre's experiments.
   After ascertaining, like the observers who had preceded him, that
this phaenomenon occurs in the Agaric when living and perfectly
healthy, and more especially in the lamellae which clothe the lower
                    its
               pileus,     proves, contrary        Delille's assertions, that

XXI.  Remarks on the Estimation of Sulphur in Iron, and on the
  Solubility of Sulphate of Baryta in Nitric Acid.  By E. CHAM
  BERs Nicholson and DAVID S.        PRICE,  Ph.D.”
                    usually employed for estimating the amount of
THEsulphur
      method
           in       a metallic substance, is to act upon it either
with nitric acid or aqua regia, and then to precipitate the sul
phuric acid with a solution of a salt of baryta. By pursuing
this plan for the determination of sulphur in cast iron, the solu
tion obtained by oxidizing 10 grammes of the metal with nitric
acid was evaporated to dryness for the purpose of rendering the
silicic acid insoluble, the residue then digested with dilute hydro
chloric acid until free from iron, and the sulphuric acid in the
solution thus obtained precipitated with chloride of barium. The
quantity of sulphur found by this method will be seen by the
Table, column 1, far to exceed that afterwards arrived at by
adopting another process.       This process consisted in dissolving
the same    weight  of iron in hydrochloric acid, and passing the
gases evolved through a solution of acetate of lead slightly aci
dified with acetic acid. The precipitate of sulphide of lead thus
produced was collected on a filter, washed, dried, and the per
centage of sulphur calculated from the weight obtained (see
column 2). The residue from the iron, consisting of graphite
and silicic acid, was collected on a filter, dried, and then fused
with a mixture of nitre and carbonate of soda, in order to ascer
tain if all  the sulphur had been eliminated         hydrosulphuric
                                                        as
acid. The fused mass was dissolved           water, the solution aci
                                             in
dified with hydrochloric acid, and then evaporated        dryness
                                                              to       to
separate silicic acid. To the solution obtained          by

residue with water, and after filtration to separate the silica, the
 addition of chloride of barium produced in no instance more
than the faintest indications of the presence of sulphuric acid.
    The per-centages indicated in column 2 may be regarded as
correct, as we have verified them by the employment of perfectly
pure nitric acid, and by adopting the precautions to which we
shall immediately allude.

    The cause of the error by the former process we found to be
owing to the presence of sulphuric acid in the acids employed,
which we failed to detect by the ordinary method of testing for
this impurity, namely by dilution of the acids with a large volume
of water before adding a solution of a baryta salt.
    By evaporating the acids nearly to dryness in a platinum dish
and then adding water, the sulphuric acid or sulphate with which
they were contaminated was recognized.                    The fact of the solu
bility of sulphate of baryta in mineral acids was not known at
the time when we made the above examinations, which was in the
autumn of 1853*.             It is not our intention now to dwell upon the
subject of the amount of sulphur in different varieties of pig-iron,
and the manner in which the property of the iron is affected by
it. This we reserve for a future communication.
    From what has already been stated, it will be seen that errors
                      ãº.
of two kinds may arise when nitric acid is employed: one where
evaporation to                    is necessary, when, if the acid contain
sulphuric acid, an excess of sulphur will be obtained; the other
where precipitation is proceeded with in very acid solutions, in
which case a loss will result from the solubility of sulphate of
baryta in the acid. To prevent this latter source of error, it is
necessary either to expel the excess of acid by evaporation, or to
neutralize it with an alkali previously to precipitating with a
baryta solution. With these precautions sulphur can be cor
rectly estimated by oxidation with nitric acid.
   The following Table contains the results of some experiments
   * By  an abstract of a paper in No. 16 of the Proceedings of the Royal
Society, Professor Calvert has, we see, been engaged in experiments on
the solubility of the sulphate of baryta.

&c., possess considerable deodorizing properties, and may in cer
tain cases be usefully employed for sanitary purposes, but are
quite unfit to be used in making manures from animal excreta,
because they either decompose some of the most valuable con
stituents of those matters, or are injurious to vegetation.
   The most important substances which have yet been proposed,
both for deodorizing and the manufacture of mamures from pu
trescent matters, are peat and peat-charcoal.
   The deodorizing property of vegetable charcoal, from whatever
source, has long been known; that of uncharred peat was first
clearly ascertained by my father, Professor Davy, who at the
scientific meetings and lectures of the Royal Dublin Society, and
subsequently in a pamphlet, called public attention to          and                                        it;
his statements have since received the most ample confirmation
from various sources.      Peat, therefore,     its charred     un              in                          or
charred state, may      used      deodorizer for sanitary purposes,

uncharred peat was broken into pieces and placed           similar                              in    a

                       may observe, on mixing the urine with the
charcoal a very strong odour of ammonia was immediately dis
engaged, and the continued evolution of ammonia from the mix
ture for several days was readily detected by moistened turmeric
paper; whereas in the case of the peat, no odour of ammonia was
perceptible on making the mixture, nor could the disengagement
of the slightest portion of it from the mixture be detected by
means of turmeric paper when examined from day to day.
   Having previously determined by experiment how much am
monia was contained in a given quantity of the ammoniacal
urine; after the mixtures had been exposed to the air for four
days,      I
         divided each into two equal parts, and ascertained how
much ammonia was present in one part of each, containing three
fluid drachms of the urine.
   The following are the quantities of ammonia furnished by the
same amount               of the urine alone, and when mixed with peat and
peat-charcoal,            and treated in the manner described.

   These results show, that when the urine was mixed with peat
charcoal and exposed to the air for only four days, it lost 0.714
part of a grain of ammonia, which is more than three-fourths of
the entire quantity contained in the urine; whereas in the case
of the peat, instead of there being any loss of ammonia, there
was a slight excess over that existing in the urine alone, which
is easily explained by the fact that peat itself always contains a
minute quantity of ammonia.
   In these experiments, the quantities of ammonia were ascer
tained by boiling the urine and the mixtures for some time in a
retort with a strong solution of caustic potash, and collecting
the evolved ammonia in a given quantity of diluted sulphuric
acid of known strength, and determining            amount       Peli   its                by

ing some diluted sulphuric acid of known strength over each
mixture, finally covered the whole with a bell-glass; the mercury
serving to exclude the air. Having left the mixtures thus covered
for five days, I removed the bell-glasses and examined, by Peli
got's method, the acid contained in each evaporating dish.                                                 I
could not detect any ammonia in that placed over the peat, show
ing that none had been evolved, and that the peat had completely
retained and fixed, as it were, the volatile carbonate of ammonia
existing in the urine. On the other hand, in the case of the
peat-charcoal, the acid indicated the absorption of 0.288 part of
a grain of ammonia, or considerably more than one-fifth of the
entire quantity existing in the urine of the mixture which had
been evolved.
     I repeated  this last experiment, mixing 500 grains of peat and
 of peat-charcoal with 1 fluid ounce of the same ammoniacal
urine, and employing a similar arrangement as in the last, with
the exception of using diluted muriatic instead of sulphuric acid
for absorbing the evolved ammonia.              After the mixtures had
been left for sixteen days, I removed the bell-glasses, and found
that the mixture with peat-charcoal had a slight urinous smell,
and was still evolving ammonia, which was apparent both
by    itsodour and         its
                           action                  on

it was found that the mixture with peat-charcoal was still evol
ving ammonia.
   These experiments show that peat-charcoal (contrary to the
many statements which have been made by                 advocates) has                 its
very little power    absorbing and retaining the ammonia
                                of                                  ex                                 of

owing (at least    part)       peat containing some substance which

it contained ammonia, was quite neutral          test-papers, showing       to
evidently that the ammonia                              of
                                    the carbonate had combined with
some other acid to form         neutral salt. The evolution of am

                       to     decomposing      of   certain extent the  to       a
fixed salts     ammonia, as, for example, the sulphate, phosphate,

converting them also into the volatile carbonate which          readily                           is
evolved.     This latter  property  would seem          depend      the              to                on
alkaline and earthy carbonates formed during the process
charring; for when the charcoal was boiled for some time                                                at so

red heat, the power       possessed   it                         of

of   ammonia, though not completely removed, was, however,
greatly diminished, which clearly shows          connexion with those       its
substances.      Peat,    the other hand, does not possess this pro
                                      on
perty in  the slightest degree. These facts prove the great su
periority    ofpeat over peat-charcoal for agricultural purposes
regards the important substance ammonia; for                the use                          by              of as

   The foregoing results and statements,      regards peat-charcoal,    as
are  contrary    what  might
                        to      have been  anticipated   from the ex
periments        of
              De Saussure and other chemists, who have shown
that charcoal possesses the power       absorbing different gaseous
                                                                  of

experiments were very different from those in the experiments
described in this communication.

researches on this subject, when he ascertained that charcoal

the volume of ammoniacal gas absorbed by equal weights of the
peat-charcoal and dried peat ought, by calculation, to be in the
ratio of about 23°4 to 33°2.
   These results show that the absorbent power of peat-charcoal
for ammoniacal gas, even in the dry state, is very much overrated,
and is much less than that of dried peat, whether estimated by
bulk or weight, and is far less than that of peat in     ordinary                             its
state   of   dryness.

which is depicted in fig. 17 a, as seen by an observer who stands
in the prolongation of ay.
   From the aperture wy, yny' the water falls down in four arms
which cross themselves, yep, ye, yiel, &c., of which each has a
strong edge.      By the encounter of these four edges, every two
form a   surface,  rpg.  Since, however, the encounter is central,
each surface bisects the angle formed by the edges by which
they were made. The four surfaces formed in this manner have,
hence, the position, fig. 17, marked by the dotted lines pp. They
are at right angles to each other, and bisect the angles of the
cross yy, yºy'.    The edges ye stretch between them down to g.
In the horizontal line going through this point, that is at p, the
surfaces epq have their greatest breadth.     Below this part they
again assume thick edges, by whose encounter new surfaces, zv,
are produced. Since the edges pq and p<U+017F>, &c. also encounter
centrally, the new surfaces zv, &c. bisect again the angle which
the edges pq, &c. form with each other, and are hence again
at right angles to each other, and have the same situation as the
arms ye, ye<U+017F>,           yuem    of the cross.
   I have      seldom          succeeded in obtaining more than two such
systems     of surfaces under each other; perhaps because the efflux
orifice was not sufficiently 9ecurately made; for the smallest
difference in the dimensions of the individual arms ay or wy,
deranges the symmetry of the surfaces rpg and their edges. The
formation of a third and fourth system of surfaces is likewise
rendered more difficult, from reasons similar to those to be
afterwards mentioned in § 83.
    62.   If
           any of the before-mentioned disturbances occur in the
efflux, the edges no longer encounter centrally, and the jet
assumes a spiral form.        There are, however, few cases in which
such a spiral form is regular, for it is seldom that the disturb
ances act symmetrically on                    all

   The water which falls from the three arms ay, ay!, wyll forms,
as in a former case, §61, thick edges, ye, yiell, which encounter
centrally.   Thereby result the two surfaces rpg and rip<U+017F>, which
bisect the angle made by the edgesyeand yell, as well as that by the
edges yiel and yep, and which have the position ap and app fig. 18.
But by the central encounter of the edges ye and ye, a third surface,
wzv, is formed, which bisects the angle of these edges, or is at right
angles to yayi, and consequently falls in the prolongation of the
planezyle<U+017F>. It extends itself only towardsthesidewa, and isscarcely
perceptible on the other side, where it is met by the edge yiel.
The edges of the surfaces rpg and ripa, form by their encounter
a new surface mn, which falls in the same plane with wav. There
are formed, however, by the encounter of the surfaces rpg, rpg,
with the surface wav, two new surfaces, hik and hik. A secon
system of surfaces is not perceptible in this jet, because by the
encounter of surfaces of unequal mass the motion is too irregular,
and hence the connexion between the particles of water is too
much disturbed.
                     Jets from a square orifice.
   64. When the water issues from a square orifice, and when
no hindrance, rotation, or other disturbing motion is present in
the vessel, a jet is obtained whose form is similar to that shown
in fig. 19, when viewed from a position perpendicularly opposite
one of the sides of the square.
   Below the place of greatest contraction, ooo, four surfaces, opq,
&c., are seen whose productions pass perpendicularly through
the centres of the sides of the aperture. Below this system of
surfaces is a second and similar one, which also contains four
surfaces, uvu, &c. These latter bisect the angles of the first
system, and consequently coincide in direction with the diagonals
of the square aperture.    To understand this better, 2,8,7,8 repre
sent the horizontal sections of the jet at those places where the
dotted lines act, 88, yy), 88, cut the jet.        Below the second
there is a third system of surfaces, which again is similarly
situated to the first ; and below that a fourth, whose surfaces
are parallel with the second, and so on.      I  have often observed
nine such sharply-defined surfaces below each other, and below
these a considerable number which were not so sharply defined.
After what has been said before, § 61, about the origin of such
surfaces from a cruciform aperture, no further explanation is
needed to show how the second system of surfaces is produced
from the first, and from the second the following ones.         But it
is not so easy to explain how the first system of surfaces is
formed, or how the peculiar form is produced, which the jet
shows previous to the commencement of the first system.          I will
endeavour to explain the origin of this form,

   65. The parts of the liquid arrive at the orifice in very differ
ent ways.   The motion of each particle, and we will first consider
that of a particle at the edge of the aperture, can be divided into
a vertical and a horizontal component, and this latter can be
again divided into two directions, of which the one is normal to
the perimeter               of the aperture, and the other at right angles to
                                                                             -
the normal.
   It  is of course impossible to determine the magnitude of the
motion of such a particle in different directions during the efflux,
as also the relation of these motions for the whole of the particles
which simultaneously pass over the edge of the aperture, since
they may have attained the edge in very different ways.                        But
before the liquid begins to issue, the whole of the particles at
the bottom are under the same pressure.                 All those at the edge
of the   aperture    move,   when the latter has been opened, with equal
velocity over the edge, since it is assumed that up to then no
motion has occurred in the vessel.               Hence they            begin their        all
paths     inthe direction                of
                                    the normal with      equal     velocity.   But

easily pressed to the side, because there are fewer particles near
them whose inertia they have to overcome.       Hence they oppose
less resistance to a force   acting at  right angles  from without
than the less projecting parts.
   For the same reason, at those parts where the radius of cur
vature is negative, the resistance to a force acting at right angles
from without is greatest when the radius of curvature is least.
In a square aperture, the particles falling from the corners of the
squares experience a less resistance in a horizontal direction than
those descending from the sides. The particles of water coming
from the projecting places experience a less resistance in passing
from the edge of the aperture to the cross section underneath,
and from this to a second, and so on, than the others. On account
of this smaller resistance, the motion of the particles coming
from the projecting parts of the orifice is more horizontal; and
these particles reach the deeper cross section of the jet with less
inclination than those from the less projecting parts, and con
sequently produce a greater pressure against the liquid in the
deeper cross section.
    67. In the same manner, the cohesion or attracting force
which takes place between the particles of the liquid acts                                          so,

                                   the cross sections which are
not circular, there results          motion   a                by

from d move in almost a horizontal direction, dy, towards the jet
issuing from the circular part of the aperture, and in consequence
of the pressure which they exert, the concave surface gk is formed.
    69. Similar phaenomena to those with the aperture just men
tioned are seen with all angular orifices, and especially with a
square one.     The masses of water coming from the corners press
stronger against the interior of the jet than those coming from
the sides, and hence the former have the same relation to the
latter as single jets which move towards each other. By the
 encounter of these jets is produced the first system of surfaces,
 and from that all following ones in the same manner as with the
 cruciform aperture, § 61, fig. 17.
    70. That the peculiar action which the parts of water coming
 from the prominent places of the orifice exert is chiefly depend
 ent on the less resistance which the horizontal part of their
 motion experiences from the mass of water contained in the jet,
 is evident from the fact, that when the efflux is so arranged that
 the parts of the liquid can only move in a vertical direction, this
 action is no longer exerted.    By using an aperture in a thick
 wall instead of a thin one, the particles have, on leaving the
 orifice, only a vertical motion. Hence the form of the jet can
 only be changed by cohesion, and not by an inequality of resist
 ance.    But the changes produced by cohesion alone are far less
 than those produced by resistance and cohesion together.
     71. If the water be allowed to issue from a tube 25 millims.
 long, and which has a square section as large as the aperture in
 the thin wall, and if care be taken that the tube is completely
 wetted and full, the jet assumes a circular section just on leaving
the tube, and has neither the ventral segments nor any of the
phaenomena which are presented by the jet issuing from a thin
orifice.
   The case is similar when, instead of the aperture, fig. 20, a
tube is used whose section is equal to this aperture. The jet
assumes then a section which is almost circular.   Immediately
below the  aperture  it appears broader, which arises from the
fact that the particles issuing at d, fig. 20, although only acted
upon by cohesion, are yet pressed by it towards the interior of the
jet with a much greater force than are the other particles. The
jet once broader, contracts again, is again broader, and thus
these ventral segments are repeated several times.
    72. By this, the difference of the efflux from a thin or thick
wall is rendered clear.    In using the latter, or a tube, and when
 all the parts move vertically, cohesion alone acts, and produces
                          If,   onthe other hand, the aperture
                                                                  in be

                  form.
 made  in a thin wall, the particles of the liquid move not only
 the vessel   in  more
                   a     or less horizontal direction, but maintain

 184                       Prof. Magnus's Hydraulic Researches.
this direction in passing through the orifice, and thus the                                                  re
sistance experienced by the particles coming from the prominent
corners, produces that greater change of form already described.
   73. The peculiar form of the upper part, a yoozz, fig. 19, of
the jet from a square aperture is also explained by the influence
of pressure, as above elucidated (§§ 65 to 68).
   The particles of water coming from the corners of the square
exert a greater pressure on the sections immediately beneath the
 aperture than the others; hence the corners are blunted, as is
 seen in the section a.        In passing from this to the following
 section, the blunt corners exert a greater pressure than the sides
 of the square.      For this reason the corners become more and
 more blunt in the lower sections, and the sides of the square
 become smaller.        Hence on the jet are formed the triangular
 surfaces wyo, fig. 19, which are sometimes vertical; but some
 times, when a greater pressure is exerted by the blunt corners
 on the interior of the jet, appear pressed outwards, so that the
point ois more prominent than the side of the aperture above                                                 it.

    The aspect of such a continuous jet, 2m-5 long, is very
  beautiful.    It appears like a perfectly turned solid mass of the
 whitest   glass,  for there is not the slightest motion perceptible.
    77. That in a jet issuing from a circular orifice there are no
 dilatations perceptible in the immediate neighbourhood of the
 orifice, is evident from the explanation just given of the form of
 jets issuing from a quadratic or polygonal aperture.               For since

 far smaller than the first, and by many it appears to have been
 quite neglected, for they considered the jet to be cylindrical after
 experiencing the first contraction; at least Bossut says”, “at
 the point of contraction the jet assumes a prismatic form and
 retains it for a short distance.”   It scarcely needs mention, how
 difficult it is to determine where the part which we consider as
  cylindrical begins, and how little we are in a position to measure
 its diameter with accuracy. We cannot, therefore, in a strict

 whose    magnitude      is far greater than that of the drops.
    94. The greater the force with which the falling body meets
 the water, the greater is the cavity, and hence the bubble result

 inches' height into the water, very small air-bubbles are obtained;
these are much larger when the bodies fall from the height of a
few feet.

 height of many feet, the air-bubbles produced go only to a very
 small depth, at most a few inches below the surface.                     Even                                       if,

194                   Prof. Magnus's Hydraulic Researches.
depends on the strength of the spiral winding of the jet, as well
as on the pressure with which it acts on the liquid.
   109.     If
           an aperture of 3 millims. diameter in a thin wall be
so used that the pressure under which the water issues can be
increased at pleasure to the pressure of a column of water 2"5
high, then if the jet under a small pressure meets the surface at
the distance of a few centimetres from the orifice, no bubbles
penetrate into the water, even if it be set in motion or rotation
in any other manner; but if the pressure is increased, the jet
changes, the spiral-shaped cavity is formed, and air-bubbles
penetrate into the liquid.                   If
                                the rotation of the water be then
prevented by means of the tranquilizer, no air-bubbles penetrate,
even under the application of a pressure of 2m-5.       But if the
efflux aperture be changed for a wider one, for instance of 9 mil
lims. diameter, the jet sets the water in such a whirlpool-shaped
motion that the tranquilizer has no effect, and it is impossible to
prevent the penetration of air-bubbles.
    110.    If
            the water be met by the jet when it is no longer con
tinuous, air always penetrates; but since the place where the jet
ceases to be continuous depends on the vibrations communicated
to the vessel from which it flows (§ 86), and since such vibra
tions may be produced by the most insignificant circumstances,                                       2
it may easily occur, that, while everything seems unchanged,
air-bubbles suddenly penetrate.                   I
                                     will mention an experiment
very easy to perform, but which is very surprising.
     Ill.If from a vessel of moderate size (that used was about
0m 3 in diameter and height, and stood upon a not very firm
frame) a jet be allowed to flow through an orifice 3 millims. in
diameter, and if it be caught in a glass held in the hand, the
bubbles are first seen, if the glass is gradually lowered, where
the jet ceases to be continuous.         If the glass be held at a some
what    higher   place  where no air-bubbles penetrate, and          when              if,

                       the first glass.           If

   112. Besides the cases already mentioned, in which air pene
trates with the jet into the water, there is one case essentially
different from these; for if the water in the vessel from which
the jet issues begins to rotate, which easily happens when no
tranquilizer is employed, there is formed after some time a fun
nel-shaped cavity.    This often draws itself downwards, not
only to the efflux orifice, but even, when this is not too small,
beyond the orifice into the jet, which hence assumes a peculiar
appearance.      If it issues from a circular orifice, and is without
dilatations, the air often draws itself down in                   changing                        it,

C*M*N*,       and Gerhardt represented them as C*H M*N9, and
the radical   hydromellone   as C*H*N9.
   The latter view is quite incorrect. After a careful study, the
author had found that in the formation of mellonide of potassium
the materials, sulphur and dried ferrocyanide of potassium,
united to form sulphocyanide of iron, and that the mellonide of
potassium resulted from the decomposition of this body at a
very high temperature.        The formation, under these circum
stances, of a hydrogen compound from materials which were free
from it was impossible. Further, in the analysis of hydrogen
compounds, there is always an excess of water found, but in                                    all

   Henneberg found that mellonide of potassium treated by
strong potash gave cyameluric acid, for which he proposed two
formulas, one of which contained an equivalent of hydrogen.
Gerhardt assumed this formula to be correct, and found in the
production of cyameluric acid an objection to Liebig’s formula
for mellone. The analyses which Liebig made, gave in no case
more than one-third the quantity of water which an equivalent of
hydrogen in the radical requires. The formula of the hydrated
acid is C*N7 0° Hº, and of

 200          Bolley on the Molecular Properties of Zinc.
     Bolleygives, in  a paper “On the Molecular properties of Zinc,”
 a résumé    of less known observations on the physical properties
 of that metal by other chemists, in addition to experiments of
 his own. Zinc is generally stated to have a crystalline lamellar
 structure, but the author had found that this was only the case
 with zinc which had been heated to almost a red heat, and then
 cooled; while that which had been simply melted and then
  cooled, had always a small granular structure.      The differences
  in the observations on the spec. grav. of zinc are greater than in
  any other metal; they vary from 686 to 7.2. Bolley ascertained
  by actual observation on various specimens, that there existed
  hollow spaces in the interior of the zinc, which were amply suf
  ficient to account for these variations. He cast small cylinders
  of zinc about 10 grms. in weight, using every precaution to
  prevent air being enclosed.     These pieces were divided and sub
   divided, and the spec. grav. taken, in small pieces until well
   agreeing results were obtained. It was found, the smaller the
   pieces, the higher was the specific gravity.   He found that zinc
  which had been heated to melting, and then quickly cooled, had
   a specific gravity of 7-178, and when slowly cooled 7-145; that
  which had been heated to redness and quickly cooled, of 7-109,
  and slowly cooled, 7-120. Zinc which had been simply melted
  was comparatively malleable, while that which had been heated
  to redness was not at all so. The ease with which commercial
  zinc dissolves is ascribed to the presence in it of foreign metals.
   But even in pure zinc there are differences in the solubility,
  which arise from the temperatures to which it has been heated.
  Pure zinc was heated to melting, one part poured in cold water,
  and another poured on a warm plate. Another specimen of the
  same zinc was heated to redness, and cooled by the same method.
  It  was found that the latter was far more easily dissolved in   di
  lute acids than the former. He concludes that zinc melted at
  as low a temperature as possible is distinguished by—1. gra
  nular fracture; 2. probable higher specific gravity; 3. greater
 malleability; 4. less solubility in dilute acids; while that melted
  at a higher temperature has-l. crystalline lamellar fracture;
 2. probable less specific gravity; 3. greater brittleness; and 4.
                                                                 -
 far greater solubility in dilute acids.
      Bolley suggests that zinc is dimorphous.    He finds a support
 for this idea in the fact that the atomic volume of zinc is very
 near that of platinum, iridium and palladium, three metals
 which are dimorphous.
     In the October Number of the same Journal Schlossberger
has two papers on Physiological Chemistry.       An investigation of
the uterine milk of the Ruminantia showed him that it contains

no fibrine or sugar, but a considerable quantity of albumen.
The ash was composed of phosphoric acid, lime and the alkalies,
with traces of chlorine and oxide of iron. The secretion was
found to be the same in the foetus of six and of twenty weeks'
age.   The nourishment of the foetus is far poorer in respiratory
elements than the nourishment of the new-born animal, but on
the other hand, it is richer in plastic elements.
   The stomach of the foetus was found to contain a liquid con
sisting mostly of liquid mucous matter (Scherer), but in which was
no albumen, while the amniotic liquid contained much albumen.
The stomach of the foetus has the property of turning milk sour.
   The same chemist instituted experiments as to whether milk
becomes sour by remaining a length of time in the lacteal glands.
The experiments were made on a woman, and on a cow.             He
found that in a normal state of health it did not become sour,
even on standing several days.
    Wöhler found that picric acid, treated with protoxide of iron,
gave a new acid which he named nitrohaematic acid.       Pugh has
found that this acid is identical with picramic acid, produced by
the action of sulphuretted hydrogen on picric acid.
   De Luna made some experiments on the possibility of substi

   When malanilide is boiled with concentrated solution of potash,
a remarkable change takes place. The greaterpart of it is taken up
by the potash, and at the same time a slimy body is formed which
floats on the surface.    On the addition of water, the substance,
which is   partially dissolved in the potash, is separated out as a
white insoluble    powder.    By repeated washing with water this
is obtained free from potash, and may then be crystallized from
alcohol. The form, analysis and properties of this body prove
it to be tartanilide, C*H*NO”. This only differs from malani
lide by containing one atom more of oxygen, but the change
produced by the potash is not so simple as the formation of the
slimy body shows.
   The solution of the malanile is slightly evaporated, and any
dissolved malanilide is separated by filtration.   It is then puri
fied by treatment with animal charcoal and crystallization. It
crystallizes easily, and in forms which vary with the concentra
tion of the solution.     It melts at 170° C. When boiled with
aqueous ammonia it is changed into malanilic acid, which forms
with the ammonia a heavy crystalline salt. The acid is separated
by treating the ammonia salt with baryta water, and carefully
decomposing the baryta salt formed with sulphuric acid. The
 slightest excess of sulphuric acid reconverts it into malanile.
It crystallizes in small grains, expels carbonic acid from salts,           its
forming with the bases salts which are mostly soluble.          for             Its

in alcohol and water, as also in chloroform and aether. It is a
product of decomposition of paranitramiline, as Arppe found by
direct experiment.    A pure specimen prepared in the above
manner from paranitraniline gave analytical results which led
to the formula C1°                 Arppe has named it nithialine.
                                H*N*S*O4.
   With mone of the bases formed by Zinin’s process does this
substance, or any analogous one, seem to be produced, except
with paramitraniline, as direct experiment showed.
   Hlasiwetz gives a preliminary account of two new bodies
which he has obtained from phloretine.         This body is boiled
with  strong   potash,  the solution evaporated,  and the excess of
potash removed by carbonic acid.                          If

evaporated and treated with alcohol, the potash salt of a new acid
is obtained, which he has named phloretic acid.     It is easily puri
fied, possessing a great tendency to crystallize. . It expels CO%

   Buchner recommends for the purification of sulphuric acid from
arsenic, the addition of common salt. The hydrochloric acid
evolved unites with any arsenious acid present to form terchloride
of arsenic, which is easily expelled at a gentle heat.
XXVI.    On the Determination of Bismuth by Weight and by
       Volume.  By R. WEST PEARson of Manchester*.
Th;       method at present employed for the determination of
       bismuth, consists in treating the solution of the metal with
sulphuretted hydrogen, filtering off the precipitated sulphide of
bismuth, which, after washing with water, is decomposed by
digestion with nitric acid.    Nitrate of bismuth is thus formed
and sulphur liberated. The sulphur is removed by filtration;
the oxide of bismuth is then precipitated from its solution as
carbonate of bismuth: upon the first addition of alkaline car
bonate a considerable quantity of the precipitate produced is
redissolved.    A. Stromeyert states that the precipitate by car
bonate of alkali is somewhat soluble in excess, but precipitated
by caustic alkali.    According to L. Laugieri, the precipitate is
completely soluble in carbonate of ammonia, partly so in car
bonate of soda, and insoluble in carbonate of potash.    According
to Berzelius Š,  however, oxide of bismuth is not soluble in car
bonate of ammonia unless phosphoric acid or arsenic acid is pre
sent.    Rose|| directs, that to obtain that portion of bismuth
which remains in solution after exposure to heat and air, it is
necessary to repeat the operations just indicated, i. e. precipitate
as sulphide of bismuth, obtain in solution as nitrate, precipitate
as carbonate of bismuth, and expose at a warm temperature to
the atmosphere for several hours; after which convert the car
bonate by ignition into oxide of bismuth, in which state weigh.
This method, it is evident, is open to a serious objection in the
great amount of time consumed in            its
                                       execution.         also in  It   is
applicable  to solutions containing lead          or
                                            cadmium.     Hydro
chloric acid and soluble chlorides must also be absent from the
solution.

   For the volumetric determination of bismuth no method has
hitherto been proposed.     To supply the desideratum which thus
exists in analysis, viz. a neat, expeditious, and accurate method
for the determination of bismuth, I began a series of experi
ments, and in the present communication          have to describe a          I
method which           I
                  find to yield satisfactory results.   It is based
upon the fact that chromic acid, when in liquid contact with
bismuth, combines in constant proportions to form an insoluble
compound, definite in composition, which is produced under                                                       all
circumstances.    The value of this reaction        the basis for                 as                             a

   The characteristic colour of chromic acid is possessed in a
remarkable degree by the chromates of potash.           Thompson
states that one part of chromate of  potash  may be  recognized in
40,000 parts of water.    I found that bichromate of potash, when
diluted 70,000 times, may be detected by       yellow colour.                      its

    The bismuth was estimated by volume.
                    Estimation   of Bismuth     by Volume.
    The mode of procedure in estimating bismuth by volume
analysis is exactly the same as in the now common methods of
volumetric determinations. A graduated solution of bichromate
of potash is added to a colourless solution of bismuth until the
metallic oxide in solution is converted into insoluble chromate
of bismuth.        By observing the effect of continued addition of
the bichromate salt, it is easy to note the rise of a deep yellow
colour in the supernatant liquid.             This indicates an excess of
bichromate of potash, and of course the saturation of the liquid.
    Preparation of standard solutions.—Bichromate of potash, the
agent to be employed, as met with in commerce, is usually con
taminated with sulphate of potash and chloride of potassium.
The removal of these and other impurities may be effected by
repeated crystallization of the bichromate salt.
    7-135 grainsofpure crystallized bichromateofpotashareweighed
off and dissolved in 1000 grains of water in a large graduated test
mixer or other convenient vessel. To avoid subsequent repetition,
I  shall call this solution the “bichrome test,” and to distinguish
from similar ones affix the letter A–bichrome test A. A second
solution, one-tenth the strength of bichrome test A, is prepared
in like manner. 7135 grain of bichromate of potash dissolved in
1000 grains of water will furnish a solution of such a strength;
I  call this solution the “bichrome test B.” A “bichrometestC,”
one-tenth strength of solution B, is prepared by dissolving '07135
grain of bichromate in 1000 grains of water.              These solutions,
A, B, and C, will contain chromic acid in 100 grains; equal in
 solution A to 1 grain of metallic bismuth, in solution B to 0-1
grain of bismuth, and in solution C chromic acid equal to "01
 grain of bismuth.        On the correctness of these solutions of
 course depends the value of any results that may be obtained by
 their use.
    In my own experiments          I make use of a white glass flask
 capable of holding about 2000 grains of liquid.            As it is neces
 sary to keep the solution hot during the experiment,               I use a
 clasp of iron plate with wooden handles; the flask having a
 rim, it can be slipt round the neck at pleasure.
     It  may be as well to notice        the decomposition which takes
 place on the addition       of  bichromate of potash to a solution of
                                                               -

bismuth.          When bismuth is in solution as nitrate, it may be
expressed        thus:–
    2BiQ3, NO3            x KO,2OrO3=(2BiQ8 CrO3)x KO,                                     NO3       x NO”.
   The chromate of bismuth is of a rich yellow colour.               In
warm solutions it is deposited almost instantly.       On the addition
of one or two drops of bichromate only, the precipitate diffuses
itself throughout the mixture, imparting a yellow milkiness to
the whole fluid.      Further addition of the bichrome test causes
the  aggregation   of the precipitate; and on the experiment ap
proaching completion, it coagulates speedily, leaving the super
 matant liquor perfectly free from any floating particles, in this
 way affording facility for observing the effect of continued addition
 of the bichrome test.       At the conclusion of the experiment,
 chromate of bismuth will cease to precipitate, and any further
 addition of bichrome test will remain in solution, and may be
 detected by              its
                   characteristic colour. An experiment such                                                  as
 just described will occupy about ten minutes.

 210      Mr. R. W.   Pearson on the Determination   of Bismuth    .
 required in excess to indicate the complete precipitation of the
 bismuth.     The bichrome test necessary to effect this object will
 vary in amount, being greater as the volume of the liquid ope
 rated upon increases.      The amount of bichromate in excess is
 calculated as being in combination with the bismuth, therefore
 the results obtained by this method are a little too high.        The
 intensity of colour so peculiar to bichromate of potash reduces
 the required excess to an infinitely low figure, however. By rever
 sing the course of procedure, i. e. adding a solution of bismuth
 to a solution of bichromate of potash, a contrary result naturally
 occurs.    In the latter case we add a few drops of bismuth solu
 tion in excess to ensure the complete precipitation; consequently
 since the excess so added, as in the preceding case, is calculated
 as being combined with chromic acid, it follows that the quan
 tity of bismuth deduced will be a little too low. We may get as
 accurate results as it is probably possible to obtain by combining
 the two methods in the following manner:—
     Method I.-1000 grains of the solution in which bismuth is to
 be estimated are poured into a flask, heated to ebullition, and small
 portions at a time of a graduated solution of bichromate of pot
 ash added from a burette until a precipitate ceases to form and
 the supernatant liquid is coloured by an excess of the bichrome
test.    Suppose 250 grains of bichrome test B have been required
 to effect this object.
     Method II.--To the ascertained volume of bichromate of pot
 ash, which we have supposed to be 250 grains, a graduated solu
tion of nitrate of bismuth is added vice versä until the colour of
the liquid entirely disappears.     The number of measures used is
read off.    Suppose 1025 grains of the solution of bismuth have
been added, then the true quantity is as follows:—
     There have been used for—
   I.  1000 grs. of solution of bismuth, 250 grs. of bichrome test B.
II.    1025         ---        ©--       250         ---        ---
       2025                              500
     Since 100 grains of bichrome test B represents 0-1 grain of
bismuth, the 500 grains used indicate 1 x 5 =0.5 grain of me
tallic bismuth as the quantity contained in 2025 grains of the
solution of bismuth.
    The following is an equally simple and sometimes more con
venient modification:—
    Method   III.-As    in the preceding cases, the bichrome test is
added to a solution of bismuth of unknown strength until an
excess of the precipitant remains in solution.      A standard solu
tion of bismuth is now added to the same solution from which
the bismuth has been precipitated, until the colour of the super

                              by Weight and by Volume.                                                211

requisite data for correction.

laws of the dynamical theory of heat to this kind of agency was
made, and certain universal relations precisely analogous to the
thermo-elastic properties of fluids established in the previous
treatment of the first division of the subject, were established
between the thermo-electric properties of non-crystalline metals.
The object of the present communication is to extend the theory
to the phaenomena of thermo-electricity in crystalline metals;
but as recent experimental researches on air have pointed out an
absolute thermometric scale+, the use of which in expressing the
    * That is a scale defined without reference to effects experienced by any
particular kind of matter.            Such a scale, founded on general thermo
dynamic relations of heat and matter, and requiring reference to a particular
thermometric substance only for defining the unit or degree, was, so far as
I  know, first proposed in a communication to the Cambridge Philosophical
Society (Proceedings, May 1848, or Philosophical Magazine,                             October
1848). The particular thermometric assumption there suggested was, that
a thermo-dynamic           engine working to perfection, according to Carnot's
criterion, would give the same work from the same quantity of heat, with
 its source and refrigerator differing              one degree by      temperature       of any
part      the scale; the fixed points being taken the same                                               as         0° in

§§ 102–106. Initial       eramination    of Thermo-dynamic circum
     stances regarding    Electric Currents in Linear Conductors.
    102. Peltier's admirable discovery, that an electric current in
a  metallic circuit of antimony and bismuth produces cold where
it passes from bismuth to antimony, and heat where it passes
from antimony to bismuth, shows how an evolution of mecha
nical effect, by means of thermo-electric currents, involves
transference of heat from a body at a higher temperature to a
body at a lower         temperature,    and how a reverse thermal
effect may be produced, by thermo-electric means, from the ex
penditure of work.       For if a galvanic engine be kept in motion
doing work, by a thermo-electric battery of bismuth and anti
mony, the current by means of which this is effected passing, as
it does, from bismuth to antimony through the hot junctions,
 and from antimony to bismuth through the cold junctions, must
cause absorption of heat in each of the former, and evolution of
heat in each of the latter; and to sustain the difference of tem
perature required for the excitation of the electromotive force,
even were there no propagation of heat by conduction through
the battery, it would be necessary continually, during the exist
 ence of the current, to supply heat from a source to the hot
junctions, and to draw off heat from the cold junctions by a
refrigerator —Or, if work be spent to turn the engine faster
than the rate at which its inductive reaction balances the elec
 tromotive force of the battery, there will be a reverse current
 sent through the circuit, producing absorption of heat at the
 cold junctions, and evolution of heat at the hot junctions, and
consequently    effecting   the transference of some heat from the
refrigerator to the source.
    103. We see, then, that in Peltier's phaenomenon we have a
 reversible thermal agency of exactly the kind supposed in the
 second law of the dynamical theory of heat.           Before, however,
we can apply either this or the first law, we must consider other
thermal actions which are involved in the circumstances of a
thermo-electric current ; and with reference to the second law,
we shall have to examine whether there are any such of an
 essentially irreversible kind.
    104. It is to be remarked, in the first place, that a current
 cannot pass through a homogeneous conductor without genera
 ting heat in overcoming resistance.        This effect, which we shall
 call the frictional   generation    of heat, has been discovered by
 Joule to be produced at a rate proportional to the square of the

220               Prof. Thomson on the Dynamical Theory of Heat.
 strength of the current; and, taking place equally with the
 current in one direction or in the contrary, is obviously of an
 irreversible kind. Any other thermal action that can take place
 must depend on the heterogeneousness of the circuit, and must
 be of a kind reversible with the current.
     105. Now if in an unbroken circuit with an engine driven by
 a thermo-electric current, the strength of the current be infi
 nitely small, compared with what it would be were the engine
 held at rest, or, which is the same, if the engine be kept at some
  such speed that                  its
                           inductive electromotive force may fall short
  of,   ormay exceed,            by

the upper plate by a glass handle: the leaves collapse in pro
portion as it is raised and again diverge as it is depressed.     It
should be recollected that the plates are electrified by the same
electricity, and are always metallically connected by the fine wire,
in which respect this differs from ordinary induction experi
ments.     It may be said that here the mechanical force is given
by the hand; but this is only in part, the repellent effect of
electricity does part of the work and would be therefore ex
pended; it is analogically as though a man were to add his
force to the piston-rod of a steam-engine, which would not pre
vent the loss of heat by the dilating steam.              I

quantities, but unfortunately I have no time for such inquiry,
and must leave it to others more happily circumstanced.

THE“Experimental  Researches on the Movement                  of Atmospheric
Air in Tubes.”   By   W. D.    Chowne,       M.D.
IN the year 1847, the author of this paper made numerous expe
riments for the purpose of ascertaining what are the conditions under
which atmospheric air is placed with regard to motion or rest, when
within a vertical tube having one extremity communicating within
the interior of a building, and the other in the open atmosphere.
   The paper now submitted to the Royal Society contains the results
of investigations undertaken in the year 1853 and continued to the
present time, to ascertain whether the ordinary state of atmospheric
air contained in a vertical cylindrical tube, open at both ends, and
placed in the still atmosphere of a closed room, is one of rest or of
motion; and if of motion, to investigate the influences of certain
changes in the condition of the atmosphere which either produce,
promote, retard, or arrest the movement.
   He demonstrates, by a series of experiments, that when a tube,
open at both ends, is placed in a vertical position, every precaution

     Similar comparative observations, with the hygrometer placed at
the upper aperture of the tube (fig. 2), yielded similar results.
     In these experiments the lower extremity of the vertical tube was
bent thrice at right angles*, for convenience in making the obser
vations, and it appeared desirable to ascertain what influence the
long branch of the siphon-like tube had in the production of the cur
rent.      For this purpose the long vertical tube (fig. 3) was made
 moveable at A, so that the apparatus could be alternately converted
 into a siphon with equal limbs 4 inches in length (fig. 4), or one
 with a short leg of 4 inches, and a long one of 96 inches (fig. 3).
 In twelve observations, when the long leg was inserted, the mean
 depression of the hygrometer was 2°5 Fahr.; when the limbs were
 of equal length, 2°25 Fahr.
     Considering it possible that the current of air existing in the tube
  might have sufficient force to move a light body delicately suspended
  in  itstrack,        an
                    elbow,    (fig. 5), was inserted into the upper orifice

  at a small angle towards the upper orifice of the tube, demonstrating
  the existence of a feeble current of air through the apparatus.
     The preceding experiment having proved the existence of a cur
  rent of air within the tube, of sufficient force to move a light body,
  the author next proceeded to ascertain the velocity of the current
  by means of an anemometer, in the form of a horizontal fly-disc, D,
  suspended within the lower orifice of a tube (fig. 6), bent twice at right
  angles below.     The revolving disc was made of a circular piece of
  stout writing-paper, cut into twenty-four equal segments, from the
  circumference to near the centre, each of the segments being after
  wards inclined at an angle of twenty-five degrees”, like the vanes of a
  windmill; so that when properly suspended, a current of air entering
  the lower orifice of the tube would cause the disc to revolve from
  right to left. The disc was suspended in the same manner as the
  needle of the mariner's compass, and by the same means.
     When the apparatus was arranged, the door of the room closed,
  and the atmosphere in a quiescent state, it was found that a con
  stant regular rotation of the disc was established, and kept up by
  the upward current of air through the apparatus, and continued so
  long as the atmosphere of the room was quiet; but that agitations
  of the surrounding air either rendered the rotation uncertain, or
  reversed it.
     Having thus ascertained that the current of air within the vertical
  tube possessed sufficient force to cause the rotation of a lightly           Y r"
  suspended fly-disc, the question arose, what influence elongation or
                                                         Fig. 9.
 shortening of the tube would exert on the velocity of the current.
 For this purpose three tubes (figs. 7, 8, 9) of precisely similar con
 struction, but with long limbs of 12, 24, and 48 inches respectively,
 were fitted as before with fly-discs, D, D, D, and placed near each
 other in the centre of the room.
    In nineteen observations, the number of revolutions in the tube,
with a long limb of 12 inches, varied from 0.75 to 4.5 per minute;
- * A nearer approach to an angle of 45 would have crippled the paper, so that
it would not have preserved the horizontal position.

in that with a long limb of 24 inches, from 1-5 to 9-0, and in that
with the long limb of 48 inches, from 375 to 140 per minute.
The gross number of revolutions in the three tubes, in the nineteen
observations, were respectively 51.25, 111:25, and 199:75; and the
mean revolutions per minute, 2-697, 5'855, 10.513, which, allow
ing for errors of observation, yield the ratios 1, 2, 4 nearly; so that
it may be said that the velocity of the revolutions is in a direct ratio
to the lengths of the vertical tubes.
   The influence of the conoidal form of the tube being suggested
by Dr. Roget as worthy of investigation, a tube (fig. 10), 96 inches
long by 3 inches diameter below and 6 inches above, was fitted to
a rectangular tube containing the rotating disc D. Another tube
(fig. 11) of the same length, 3 inches in diameter throughout, was

placed near the conical tube as a term of comparison.     The revolu
tions of the disc in the conical tube were more rapid than in that of
uniform diameter, in the proportion of 8-8 to 3-0. When the posi
tion of the cone was reversed (fig. 12), and the entrance and exit
orifices were equal, the revolutions still continued
                                            -        more rapid than
in the tube of uniform diameter.
   To determine the influence of the area of the tube on the velocity
of the current, four tubes (figs. 13, 14, 15, 16), 96 inches in length
in the long, and 4 inches in the short branch, but varying in dia
meter, were placed in the room near each other and simultaneously
observed.
   In a tube of 3 inches uniform diameter (fig. 13), the revolutions
were 3.0 per minute; in one of 5 inches (fig. 15) 9:15, and in one
of 6.75 inches (fig. 16) 13:15; their respective areas being 7.065,
15708, and 21.205.         In the conical tube (fig. 14) on         its

would seem, then, that the velocity has relation rather to the mean
area of the tube than to that of the entrance and exit orifices, as the
latter were the same in the tube of 3 inches uniform diameter, and
in the conical tube on its base, while the revolutions of the disc
were 3.0 per minute in the former, and 8.8 per minute in the latter.

and 48 inches, employed in a previous experiment, were placed near
each other, and three bushels of quicklime were spread in shallow
vessels on the floor and other parts of the room. Before the lime was
placed, the disc in the 12-inch tube was revolving at the rate of 0.75
per minute; that in the 24-inch tube at 2.0; and that in the 48-inch
tube at 4.0 per minute. At the end of fifty minutes the rotation had
ceased in the 12-inch tube, and was reduced to 1-75, and 3-5 in the
24- and 48-inch tubes. After seventy minutes, rotation had ceased
in the 24-inch tube, and was reduced to 3.75 in the 48-inch tube.
Finally, after ninety minutes, the rotations in the 48-inch tube were
reduced to 2.75 per minute.

and reintroduction of the quicklime in a second and third series of

explanation of them may be better treated by those who are more
accustomed to deal with similar researches.

   1. “Description of a fossil cranium of the Musk-buffalo (Bu
balus moschatus,    Owen; Bos Pallasii, DeKay; Ovibos Pallasii,
H. Smith and    Bl.), from the Gravel at Maidenhead, Berks.” -By
Prof. Owen,   F.G.S.
   This specimen was discovered by the Rev. Mr. Kingsley and
Mr. J. Lubbock in a gravel-pit close to the engine-house at the
Maidenhead station last summer, and is the first example of the
subgenus Bubalus yet recognized as fossil in Britain. It consists
of the cranial part of the skull, with the horn-cores, nearly perfect.
The Professor, in describing this fossil, first offered his reasons for
regarding the so-called “Musk-ox” as having been unnecessarily
separated from the Buffaloes, and then gave an account of the few
fossil skulls of the Musk-buffalo yet known, viz. those figured by
Pallas, Ozeretskowsky, and Cuvier. A comparison was then made
of the fossil remains with recent crania; and, although the skulls
somewhat differ in a few points, especially in the relative curvatures
of the horn-cores, yet the author was led to conclude that, as far as
the materials for comparison at his command would serve, the dif
ferences between the fossil and recent Musk-buffaloes are not of
specific value; that the Bubalus moschatus of the Arctic regions,
with      its
          now restricted range,     the slightly modified descendant
                                       is                                               of

                of

the Thames is occupied with a mass of ochreous gravel, from 5 to
15 feet thick, and varying from 2 or 3 miles to 8 or 9 miles in
width.    This gravel is composed of subangular chalk-flints, derived
from the chalk of the adjacent district, together with flint-pebbles
derived from the tertiary strata, and pebbles of quartz and
old rocks derived from the conglomerates of the New Red Sand
stone. There are also a few fragments of Oolitic rocks and of the
Lower Greensand. Land-shells and bones of land-animals have
been found in this gravel at several detached localities, as at Brent
ford, Kingston, London, &c. The date of the deposition of the
mammaliferous gravel                        is,

  The first part  this paper described the granites
                                  of                    the south                                              of
east     Ireland, which are reducible
             of                             three types, depending         to                                                       on
their chemical and   mineralogical  composition.    The granite    the                                                     of
first type, which Mr.  Haughton    proposed     call “Potash-granite,”            to
is found            in
              the main granitic chain     Wicklow and Wexford, and     of

 240                 Cambridge Philosophical Society.
 also at Carnsore, at the extreme south-east of Ireland.    The granite
  of the second type, which is a “Soda-granite,” occurs at Rathdrum
  and Oulart, and is distinguished from the former by a diminution of
  silica and an increase of lime and soda. The third granite is peculiar,
  and found only at Croghan Kinshela, near the gold-mines of Wick
  low. It consists of quartz, albite, and chlorite; while the potash
  granites of the main chain consist of quartz, orthoclase, and marga
 rodite mica.
      The second part of the paper described the three granitic districts
  of the north-east of Ireland, known as the Mourne, Carlingford, and
  Newry granitic districts.
      The granite of the Mourne district consists of quartz, orthoclase,
  albite, and a green mica, probably similar to margarodite.
      The Carlingford granite is a potash-granite, in which hornblende
  replaces mica. At the junction of this granite with the Carboni
  ferous Limestone of the neighbourhood, a remarkable change takes
  place in the granite on penetrating the limestone in dykes.      From
 being originally a compound of quartz, orthoclase, and hornblende,
 it is converted by the addition of lime into a compound of horn
 blende and anorthite, which latter mineral was noticed for the first
  time as entering into the composition of British rocks.
      The Newry granites belong to the “soda-granite” type, and
 resemble in many respects the secondary granites of the Wicklow
 and Wexford districts.

     Nov. 26,   1855.-A    paper was read on the Earthquake in Switzer
 land in   July last, by the Rev. O. Fisher.
     The 25th of July, 1855, on which the first and most severe shock
 was felt, was a very wet, close day, and the little wind stirring came
 from the S.W.
     In the Münster Thal the earthquake began by a rumbling vibra
 tion like that caused by a carriage run under an archway, gradually
 increased for about four seconds, and then suddenly ceased.        The
 oscillation seemed to be from E.S.E. to W.N.W., but would be
 affected by the build of the house.
     In the church at Brienne two stones fell from the groining thirty
 or forty feet into the organ pipes, to a point between 2 and 23 feet
N, by E. of the point vertically beneath their first position; and
allowing for the direction of the building, this would give the motion
 of the earth about from N.E. to S.W. This wave may have been a
reflexion caused by the wave entering the Jura from the valley.
Another shock was felt at Brienne, at 10 A.M., on the 26th.
     The great shock was felt at Strasburg, slightly at Lyons in a
direction from E. to W.; likewise at Chambery, Alessandria, and
Genoa.       The account given by Plana in the Times does not seem
very intelligible, but as far as can be made out from the stopping of
the clocks, it gives the direction of the shock at Turin about 30° W.

though he gives a table in which the least rate given for sound tra
velling through any kind of stone is 3640 feet per second, while the
rate of motion of the earthquake of Lisbon was 1750 feet. If the
view stated be correct, the disturbance must have been deep in the
earth, which would also explain the upward blow felt by Mr. Croker.
At greater distances the sound-wave would be expended sooner than
the earthquake-wave, and the accompanying sound be due to local
action.
   Near the centre the shock was sudden, passing away gradually.
At a distance it began with slight quivering, gradually attained a
maximum, and then suddenly ceased.        Now if the disturbance oc
curred along a large fissure, perhaps several miles in length, and of
unknown depth, the waves from different portions would reach any
given point in succession, and at intervals the combined effect of
many waves would be felt, producing a result analogous to the rolling
of thunder due to the varying distance of the source of sound, while
the sudden concussion at a nearer point is like the detonation heard
when the lightning is near the auditor.
   The shocks were less severe in the mountains than in the valleys.
As far as the wave progressing horizontally is concerned, it would,
on entering a mountain, at first be nearly bounded by a horizontal
plane continuous with that of the valley, just as light is propagated
in straight lines; but there would also be a diversion of a part (ana
logous to the diffraction of light at a screen) into the mountain, so
that where the wave passed for some distance into a range it would
finally be felt at the summit.     It is observable that the shock on the
25th was less severe on the Riffelberg than at Zermatt, yet it travelled
through the mountain and was felt at Turin.
   The period of elevation of the Alps seems about contemporaneous
with the older Pliocene of Sir C. Lyell. The country is broken up
with faults, which probably there, as elsewhere, follow the lines of
valleys.   The valley of Wisp lies in the axis of two ranges which
have   allthe appearance        mighty valley

may have arisen from       shifting

the Alps may give reason for thinking this             still going on.

   The author concludes from this reasoning, that the assumption of
vibrations perpendicular to the plane of polarization leads to clear,
simple, consequent, and connected views of the whole subject; while
the opposite supposition involves obscure, overloaded, and contra
dictory representations.    Similar arguments may be drawn from a
consideration of biaxial or trichromatic crystals. We must, how
ever, refer to the original paper in Poggendorff’s Annalen for October
1855, for a fuller exposition of the author's views and arguments.--

If     it be then blown out and again ignited, it continues to glow
    without the piece of coke, so that by contact with the coke it has

    arise from an electrical action between the two substances.—Archiv

a polarity induced    in the latter or not. , Mr. Tyndall has recently
founded a decision     of the question on the consideration, that the
diamagnetic repulsion must increase in the simple ratio of the
strength of the current if it be simply an action of the magnetic
pole upon the unchanged substance of the diamagnetic body; on
the contrary, the increase must be as the square of the strength
of the current if the action be due to an excited polarity; just as
the action of one magnet upon another, whose magnetism is
unchanged by the former, is simply as the current strength,
whereas upon a piece of soft iron it is as the square of the mag
netic intensity.     Partly by his own experiments, and partly by
others previously made by E. Becquerel, Mr. Tyndall has shown
that the diamagnetic repulsion augments with the square of the
current, which is a new proof of the polarity of a diamagnetic
bodv.
   floud      not have thought of subjecting these experiments to
 a corroborative repetition, were      I  not called upon by M. Mat
 teucci to do so, by means of the torsion balance which I had
 constructed for the determination of the density of the earth;

    On one end of the torsion balance hangs a sphere of bismuth
 weighing 484.15 grms, surrounded by a cylindrical wooden
 chamber coated within and without with tinfoil.             On a level

with the centre of this sphere  a magnet of known strength was
placed at a certain distance from the mass of bismuth, and the
consequent repulsion was observed.      The arm of the torsion
balance remained during the experiment in a state of oscillation,
which at the commencement could be produced at will, either

that the oscillating torsion balance never retains for any length
of time the same position of equilibrium unchanged, even where
all external influences are,    far     we know, preserved constant.

          from two fixed points of the circuit a branch current was sent
          through the multiplier of a sine-compass.    The tangent-compass
          was   only divided into  single degrees, and admitted therefore of
          no very accurate measurement of the strength of the current.

       Fifth eaperiment.—With a view of obtaining greater deflec

    to branch from two points of the circuit more distant from each
    other than the former ones.       It was, however, found that the

         All the observations show that the repulsion augments                                                                          in  a

256                    M. F. Reich   on Diamagnetic        Action.
ratio does not differ much from that of the squares of the cur
rents. In general, however, the latter ratio is not quite attained,
which is explained by the fact that the distance increases with
the repulsion. We are therefore certainly justified in assuming
that the diamagnetic repulsion is proportionate to the square of
the magnetic intensity which produces the repulsion, and is
therefore a product of a polarity excited by influence in the dia
magnetic body.
    With reference to the concluding paragraph of M. Reich’s                      in
teresting paper,         I
                    may be permitted to express the opinion that
the result which he has corroborated is not, in itself, a proof that
the diamagnetic force is a polar force.      It undoubtedly proves
that the repulsion is due to a state of excitement into which the
bismuth is thrown by the influencing magnet; but it does not,
I  think, prove the dual or polar nature of that excitement. True,
we have no example in nature of a similar excitement that is not
polar; but such is at least conceivable, although as yet unob
served.    For this reason I thought it necessary, in the paper to
which M. Reich has referred, to show that the excitement of
diamagnetic bodies is of a duplex character; and that the attrac
tions and repulsions of a bar of iron under magnetic influence,
have their exact antitheses in the repulsions and attractions of a
bar of bismuth acted upon by the same forces.
    In repeating experiments such as those described in the paper
to which M. Reich has alluded, a certain acquaintance with the
delicate mechanical conditions required to be fulfilled is necessary
to success.    Knowing this, it was not a matter of surprise to me
to learn that M. Matteucci failed, for a time, to realize my results,
and was consequently led to doubt their existence.          Hence, I
 suppose, his desire to see my experiments repeated with M.

Reich’s apparatus.     The doubts referred         am happy I    say,        to
no longer exist,     through the kindness        M. Matteucci him

XXXII.    Chemical Examination of certain Lakes and Springs on
  the Turko-Persian frontier near Mount Ararat.      By HENRY

  of Science applied to Mining and the Arts+.

              samples
      Kennett Loftus, Esq., F.G.S., and collected by him during
the progress of a joint Commission appointed by the English,
Russian, Turkish, and Persian Governments for the demarcation
of the Turko-Persian frontier; they were placed in my hands for
chemical examination in June last by Sir Roderick Murchison.
   Unfortunately the samples were so small, only a wine quart
bottle of each, that a complete chemical analysis was impossible,
but the few experiments which                             I

to show the  interesting character of these lakes and springs.
                              Lake of Urumia.
   Probably the most interesting is the Lake of Urumia, which
Mr. Loftus statest to be “about 82 miles in length and 24 wide,

    height being 4100 feet above the level              the sea. The water  of

10470439 grains of chlorine, corresponding to 17254.27 grains
of common salt; the remainder of the saline matter, amounting
to 4602:23 grains, consisted chiefly of alkaline carbonates, but
also contained small quantities of the sulphates and carbonates
of lime and magnesia; the smallness of the quantity of water

   The extreme saltness of this and the neighbouring lakes would
appear to arise from the separation, at some remote period, of
these masses of salt water from the main ocean, together with
the great Caspian and Aral lakes; and the continued evaporation
by constantly diminishing their volume       has been proved                     (as                              by

   “From the plain of Selmas northwards,” says Mr. Loftus,
“ calcareous tufa-springs are of continual occurrence, and those
of Derik are good examples of them.
   “The springs are close to the village of Derik. The water rises
with great force in the more northerly basin at regular intervals;
but in the other irregularly, at intervals of five or seven seconds,
gurgling from below, and throwing up a strong jet to the height
of a foot above the surface.    The temperature of the two springs
is the same, viz. 96° F., indicating a common origin.        As the
surface of the water cools, numerous thin lamellae of cream
coloured carbonate of lime are formed, and float about like scum.
These lamellae are sometimes 2 inches long, and about the thick
ness of a wafer.      As the water flows onwards, cooling in                                 its
passage,    deposits the calcareous granules

  It  was collected August 18, 1852, the spring                 the time    at
having the temperature,        before mentioned,                   of

   Its specific gravity was 1-0013, and the quantity                 solid          of
matter left         on
                  evaporation amounted         110.027 grains

       No. 2. Ferruginous Saline Spring, Derik near Selmas.
   This sample was collected on the same day as that last men
tioned, and had the same temperature, 96° F.
    It smelt distinctly of sulphuretted hydrogen, and by exposure
to the air became opake from the deposition of finely divided
 sulphur; there were also floating in it granular particles of car
 bonate of lime.
     Its specific gravity was 1:0016, and it left on evaporation only
 126'22 grains in the gallon of solid residue, closely resembling
 the saline constituents of the former spring in composition.
     The quantity of iron was so small that it scarcely deserves the
 title of “ferruginous;” indeed in the small quantity of water
 sent me, it was impossible to determine        amount.                its

  Adding the first two of each of the preceding, we find—

                                                                                                     ft.,   we

XXXIV.      On the Galactite                     of Haidinger, with Analyses of Scotch
                 Natrolites.                       By Dr. HEDDLE+.
IN seeking   out specimens of “Galactite” for analysis, my first
   difficulty lay in ascertaining if they were the species to which
Haidinger   had given this name; and finding that Mr. Rose's
Galactites came from a totally different part of the country from
that which afforded my own specimens,         bethought myself of              I
writing to Mr. Greg, the catalogue of whose collection was com
piled by Haidinger himself: the result was that Mr. Greg sent
me Galactites from two localities, neither of which I had imagined
to be the true one.
   As Mr. Greg's localities must be correct, I give them the pre
ference in my analyses.    The first was Glenfarg in Fifeshire;
the specimen sent was white, though not very milky;           ana                                         its

        Tº       only reversible thermal effect of electric currents
             which experiment has yet demonstrated, is that which
Peltier has discovered in the passageofelectricity from one metal to
another.   Besides this, we may conceive that in one homogeneous
metal formed into a conductor of varying section, different thermal
effects may be produced by a current in any part, according as
it passes in the direction in which the section increases, or in
the contrary direction; and with greater probability we may sup
pose, that a current in a conductor of one metal unequally heated
may produce different thermal effects, according as it passes from
hot to cold, or from cold to hot. But Magnus has shown by careful
experiments, that no application of heat can sustain a current in a
circuit of one homogeneous non-crystalline metal, however vary
ing in section; and from this it is easy to conclude, by equations
 (7)and (9), that there can                         be   no
                                    reversible thermal effect due                                                 to

The first of these expressions for the electromotive force involves
no hypothesis, but only the general principle of equivalence of
heat and work.        Its agreement with any experimental results is
only to be looked on as a verification of the accuracy of the ex
periments, and can add nothing to the certainty of the part of
 the theory from which it is deduced.            On the other hand, it
 would be extremely important to test the second expression (19)
by direct experiment, and so confirm or correct the only doubtful
 part of the theory. The way to do so would be to determine in
 absolute measure the electromotive force, F, due to a small dif
 ference of temperature, t, in any thermo-electric pair, and to
 determine, in known thermal units, the amount of the Peltier
 effect at a junction of the two metals with a current of strength
 measured in electro-dynamic units, as we should then, by these
 determinations, be able to evaluate from direct experiments the
 values of the two members separately which appear equated in (19).
 As yet no observations have been made which lead directly or
 indirectly to the evaluation of the second member of (19) in any
 case, but I hope before long to succeed in carrying out a plan                                          I

       heated metal, was taken as an example in my first communication

       iron, were made the subjects of a consequent experimental inves                               ;

       each of them separately.              The application of the general rea
        soning to this particular case, and the answers which I have
        derived by experiment to the question which it raises, are de

           I also found that brass becomes neutral to copper, and copper
       becomes neutral to silver, at some high temperatures, estimated
       at from 800° to 1400° Cent. in the former case, and from 700°
       to 1000° in the latter, being a little below the melting-point of
       silver. The following diagram exhibits the results graphically,
       constructed on the principle of drawing a line through the letters
       corresponding to any one of the metallic specimens in a table
       such as that of § 130+, and arranging the spaces so that each
       line shall be as nearly straight as possible, if not exactly so.

   The object to be aimed at in perfecting a thermo-electric dia
gram, and perhaps approximately attained to (conjecturally) in
the preceding, is to make the ordinates of the lines (which will
in general be curves) corresponding to the different metallic spe
cimens, be exactly proportional to their thermo-electric powers”,
with reference to a standard metal (Ps in the actual diagram).
   135. Judging by the eye from the diagram, as regards the con
vective agency of electricity in unequally heated conductors, I infer
that the different metals are probably to be ranked as follows, in
order of the values of the specific heat of electricity in them:—

constant pressures at which it exists in the lower and upper hori
zontal branches of the tube in the second case; TI(T), TI(Tl) the
quantities of heat evolved and absorbed respectively by the pass
age of a unit mass of fluid through the two vertical branches
kept at the respective temperatures T, T'; and if F denote the
work done by a unit mass of the fluid in passing through the
engine; the fundamental equations obtained above with refer
ence to the thermo-electric circumstances, may be at once written
down for the case of the ordinary fluid as the expression of the
two fundamental laws of the dynamical theory of heat, both of
which are applicable to this case, without any uncertainty such
as that shown to be conceivable as regards the application of the
second law to the case of a thermo-electric current.     The two
equations thus obtained are equivalent to the two general equa
tions given in §§ 20 and 21 of the first part of this series of
papers, as the expressions of the fundamental laws of the dyna
mical theory of heat applied to the elasticity and expansive pro
perties of fluids. In fact, when we suppose the ranges of both

vertical branches be kept at temperatures a little above and below
the point of maximum density, no current will be produced; and
therefore    if To     denote this temperature,
gives II(Tl)=0. Again, if one of the vertical branches be kept

298           Mr. T. Tate                on a     New Double-acting Air-pump
the rod connecting them may be of any section consistent with
strength. The effective length of the stroke is equal to the
space between one side of the pipe R and the corresponding end
face of the cylinder, or it is very nearly equal to one-half the
length of the cylinder.
    In an upward stroke, the air above the piston A is propelled
through the valve V into the atmosphere, while a vacuum is being
formed beneath the piston B. When the piston A strikes against
the top of the cylinder, the air from the receiver rushes through
the pipe R and diffuses itself through the lower half of the
cylinder.     In a downward stroke, the air beneath the piston B
is propelled through the valve v into the atmosphere, while a
vacuum is being formed above the piston A; and so on.                   It
will be observed that the double     piston performs     a double duty  at
every single stroke; for while a vacuum is being formed on one
side of the cylinder by one piston, the other piston is propelling
air from the opposite side of the cylinder into the atmosphere.

                                                                     air

300                   Notices respecting New Books.
   The advantages of this new pump, as compared with the
common pump of the same capacity of cylinder, are as follows:–
   1. To effect the same exhaustion, the driving pressure moves
over one-half the space.
   2. From the superior construction of valves, the exhaustion is
carried to a much greater extent.
   3. From having a double stroke in a single cylinder, the ex
pense of construction is considerably reduced.
   4. As the exhaustion proceeds, the pressure requisite for
moving the pistons becomes less and less. The contrary takes
place in the common pump.
   In the pump which I have constructed the valves are made of
oil-silk, and the piston-rod is moved by the direct application of
the pressure; but I purpose to construct a pump on the new
principle, with metal valves covered with oil-cisterns, and lifted
up by the stroke of the piston, and also with a pump-lever (or
crank) attached to the head of the piston-rod. The pump thus
constructed will most certainly exhaust the                    air
                                                 from the receiver

 so well deserving         of
                         attention.
    Mr. Wedgwood traces out with much care the ultimate expres
sion  of the mode        which the fundamental conceptions
                          in                                          geometry of
are   brought  into intellectual existence.       He   supports  the   views                   of

THE   “On Axes of Elasticity and Crystalline Forms.” By W. J.
Macquorn Rankine, C.B., F.R.S.S.L. & E. &c.
  An Axis of ELASTICITY is any direction with respect to which
any kind of elastic force is symmetrical.
  In this paper the deviation of a molecule of a solid from that con
dition as to volume and figure which it preserves when free from the
action of external forces, is denoted by the word “Strain,” and the
corresponding effort of the molecule to recover        free volume and               its
figure by the word “Stress.”                               º

variables called Contra-ordinates.  The contra-ordinates of a point
R are the  projections  of the radius-vector OR on the three axes.

For rectangular axes, co-ordinates and contra-ordinates are identical.
The co-ordinates w, y, z and contra-ordinates u, v, w of a point R.
are connected by the equation

   As there are six independent quantities in the directions of a
system of three axes of indefinite obliquity, there is a system of
right or oblique axes in every solid for which six of the coefficients
of the characteristic function of the Biquadratic surface disappear,
reducing that function to     canonical form         its
                                                 nine terms. These              of

the factor.
   You will observe that the table does not extend below –16°,
although we have repeatedly every winter the mercury below —20°,
and occasionally below —30°. The only thermometer, however,
which we could trust as a wet-bulb in investigations so delicate was
not graduated below — 16°.
   For obtaining the dew-point by direct observation, we used the
condensing hygrometer invented by M. Regnault.
   We obtained dew with this beautiful instrument at all tempera
tures (limited only by the graduation of the thermometer —35°),
the only requisites when the thermometer is very low being time
and pure ether”.     I can testify from experience that this hygro
meter obviates all the disadvantages of Daniell's, which M. Regnault
enumerates in his hygrometrical researches.
   In order to show the reliance that may be placed upon our results,
we have put opposite each factor in the table the probable error and
measure of precision of the single data (from which the factor (f) was
derived), and also the probable error, measure of precision, and limits
of certainty of the adopted factor. The nomenclature and notation
are thus employed by Encke in his Memoir on the Method of
Least Squares.
   The measure of precision (h), as was indeed to have been ex
pected, decreases with the temperature.     This fact is not however
of so much importance as might at first appear.

probable that the factors, which we have given above 40°, are rather
greater than they would have been had the observations discussed
extended through       longer space

tion was 3.36;       this being much the largest deviation from the
adopted mean 2:53.
   The cause of this discrepancy is doubtless owing to the heat that
the wet-bulb thermometer derives from the radiation of surrounding
objects; and were observations sufficiently numerous, it might con
duce to accuracy were the factors calculated for every degree of
difference in the value of (t—t').
   We purpose instituting a comparison between two wet-bulb ther
mometers placed in similar boxes, the one box coated with lamp
black, the other with a polished metallic surface.
   Below 32° our results do not appear to coincide with the factors
deduced from the Greenwich observations; and the causes of these
discrepancies I must leave to time.
   As, however, we have had considerable experience at these tempe
ratures, I may perhaps be doing service to observers in bringing
before their notice two causes of error, to which we have found our
selves particularly liable when the thermometer is near 32°.
    1st. If the air is a little above, and has been below 32°, there will
frequently be a small button of ice at the foot of the wet-bulb ther
mometer, which is not easily perceived, and which will keep it at
32° when the temperature of evaporation is really above that point.
   2ndly. It is well known that under certain circumstances water
may be cooled below 32° without freezing; and an example will
perhaps best show the error which this fact may occasion.
   Let us suppose that the temperature of the air is 27°, and that
when the thermometer is wetted it sinks to 26°, and then rises.
Should it rise very slowly, or not at all, the probability is that 26°
is the true temperature of evaporation, but if rapidly, the rise may
be due to the conversion of the water into ice; and it will be prudent
to observe whether or not the thermometer again commences to sink.
   We have frequently observed this phenomenon, and I am quite at
                                           a its
a loss to what to ascribe        uncertainty.
  It  has occurred both        high wind and calm (the thermometers
                                      in                          a

be  quite uncertain       what temperature the water might freeze.

I    am obliged       admit that the limits

    be unconformable in this district to the cretaceous system.   Reasons
    were given for thinking that the materials, of which both the Wealden
    and Purbeck were composed, had travelled from west to east; and
    the beds of the New Red Sandstone, as they occur in Devonshire,
    were pointed out as affording a mass of strata which would furnish
    a detritus of the character of a large portion of the Hastings sands
    of Hampshire and Dorsetshire.
       In describing the Purbeck beds,the author followed the system of the
    late Professor E. Forbes, dividing them into upper, middle, and lower;
    and entered into some detail of the alternations of salt and freshwater
    conditions that prevailed during their deposition.      The aspects under
    which the same beds    appear  at different points  of the district under
    examination were particularized, and it was attempted to be shown
    that these were in conformity with the theory of a current setting
    from the west towards the east. The mode of occurrence of the
    remains of insects in the middle and lower Purbecks was somewhat
    minutely described, and it was suggested that some interesting
    chronological speculations might be grounded upon                 it.
       The paper concluded with    an  attempt  to  explain the singular frac
    tured condition   of  about  thirty   feet of the lower Purbeck strata
    throughout the eastern part        the county.        was supposed that

   April 23.-A paper was read by the Master of Trinity, on Plato's
Survey of the Sciences, contained in the seventh book of the Republic.
   Plato, like Francis Bacon, took a review of the sciences of his time;
and like him, complained how little attention was given to the phi
losophy which they involved.       The sciences which Plato enumerates
are arithmetic and plane geometry, treated as collections of abstract
and permanent truths; solid geometry, which he “notes as deficient”
in his time, although, in fact, he and his school were in possession
of the doctrine of the “five regular solids;” astronomy, in which he
demands a science which should be elevated above the mere know
ledge of phaenomena.       The visible appearances of the heavens only
suggest the problems with which true astronomy deals; as beautiful
geometrical diagrams do not prove, but only suggest geometrical
propositions.     Finally, Plato notices the subject of harmonics, in
which he    requires a science which shall deal with truths more exact
than the ear can establish, as in astronomy he requires truths more
exact than the eye can assure us of. It was remarked also, that
such requirements had led to the progress of science in general, and
to such inquiries and discoveries as those of Kepler in particular.
  May 21.—A paper was read “On the singular Points of Curves.”
By Professor De Morgan.
  Mr. De Morgan defines a curve as the collection of all points
whose co-ordinates satisfy a given equation; and contends for this
definition as necessary in geometrical algebra, whatever limitation
may be imposed in algebraic geometry.            He divides singular points
into  points of  singular position  and  points   of singular curvature; the
character of the former     depending   on the axes, but not that of the
latter.   Both   species  are defined as possessing a notable property,
and such as no arc of the curve, however small, can have at all its
p oints.
   The form first considered is that of which the case usually taken
is an algebraic curve. Let p(x, y) be a function which for all real
and finite values of w and y is real, finite, and univocal; let the curve
be p(r, y)=0, considered as an individual of the family p(r, y)=const.
The two curves dº : dra.0, dº : dy=0, or pr=0, by=0, are the sub
ordinates of this system, on which the singular points of all depend.
   When p is not reducible to another function of the same kind by
extraction of a root, it divides the plane of co-ordinates into regions
in which, severally, it is always positive or always negative. By
this consideration it is easily shown (independently of              y',
                                                                   y", &c.), that

has the  sign  of  prºdw”--2pydrdy      qiyydy”.   Hence,     immediately   after

                     the curve     left

as their values of          y" agree or differ in sign.
                                by .
    An    a   priori proof is given that multiple points, cusps, and isolated
points, must be determined by p,-0, py–0, or can only take place
when both subordinates meet the curve.        It is shown that, in the
system p(w, y)= const., the cusp of p(w, y)=0 must be an evanes
cent loop, and the isolated point an evanescent oval, or bounded
portion.   Some discussion of the meaning of y'-a-H b v — 1 at an
isolated point is given.
   There have been two methods of treating the singular points.
The first has recourse to the theory of equations, using differentia
tion, if at all, only to supply coefficients.    The second attempts
canonical forms derived from differential coefficients, and examines,
in succession, the meaning and bearing of the successive orders of
differential coefficients.   Mr. De Morgan affirms that this second
method cannot be..what it pretends to be; and, by treating it gene
rally, shows that its questions are ultimately dependent upon the
theory of equations.     An equation of the form 2Ay”=0, when it
has no   equal roots, decides the character of a singular point defini
tively; and reduces it to a number of intersecting branches without
contact, a number of coinciding isolated points without real tangents,
or some of one and some of the other. When the equation has some
real roots, each set furnishes either multiple branches with contact,
or cusps, or conjugate points with real tangents.      All this is easily
illustrated by examining the curve in which p(x, y) is an infinitely
small constant, near to the singular point of p(x, y)=0.

 infinitesimal alterations in the coefficients, how many will remain
 real, and how many will become imaginary 2
    Newton has given the foundation and the chief step of a geome
 trical method (Newton's parallelogram) which has passed into oblivion,
 though it occurs in the celebrated second letter to Oldenburg, has
 been fully described by Stirling, used by Taylor and De Gua, and
forms the main method of Cramer's work on curves. Mr. De Mor
 gan proposes to call it the method of co-ordinated eagonents.
    He proceeds to describe and enlarge this method; observing that,
of the polygon which represents an equation, Newton and his fol
lowers are in full possession of the connexion of the sides with the
solutions, and fail only in not grasping the connexion of the whole
polygon with the whole equation.          Both Newton's method and
Lagrange's, the second of which is an arithmetical version of the
first, may be applied to irrational equations, but it will be convenient
to confine the description to the form Xaw"y"=0, where m and n
are integers.
    In aa"y", let n be an abscissa, and m an ordinate, and let (m, n)
be called the exponent point of the term aw"y".       Take some paper
ruled in squares (or ruled both ways in any manner, for any equal
rectangles will do) to facilitate the process when n and m are always
integers, and lay down all the exponent points in Xaa”y”=0.
Through some of these points draw a convex polygon including all
the rest, which can only be done in one way.       Should the points be
so many and so scattered that some method must be applied, the
geometrical method is a translation of the main arithmetical method
of Lagrange's theorem. The points which end on, or otherwise
fall in, the sides of the polygon show the essential terms of the equa
tion: no others    are wanted to determine q and u in y=a^(u-HU).
The   upper  contour of the polygon shows how all the solutions com
mence in   descending    powers of a ; the under contour does the same
for ascending   powers.     Take any side of either contour, its projec
tion on the axis of n shows the number of roots it represents, the
tangent of the angle it makes with the negative side of the axis of n
shows the value of r.
   It will not be needful to abstract the developments given in the
paper: we shall only notice the inverse method. The following
example is taken, and the construction of the equation is even easier
(under Cramer's form) than the direct treatment of              The example  it.

   1. “Notice of a Visit to the Dead Sea.”         By H. Poole, Esq.
Forwarded from the Foreign Office by order of Lord Clarendon.
   Mr. Poole went to this district to look for nitre, which was re
ported to occur there; but he met with none, and found reason to
suppose that the report was unfounded.        He noticed bituminous
shales at Nebi Mousa, and sulphurous earths both there and at El
Lisan on the Dead Sea, but the sulphur was not found in any large
quantity.   The author exhibited to the meeting a series of these
deposits, and of rock-salt and other minerals from the neighbourhood
 of the Dead Sea, together with recent natural history specimens,
volcanic and other rock-specimens,                         and some tertiary and cretaceous
fossils from the district visited.
   2.    “On the Affinities of the great extinct Bird (Gastornis parisi
ensis,   Hébert) from the lower Eocene near Paris.” By Prof. Owen,
F.R.S., F.G.S.
    Prof. Owen communicated the results of his comparisons of the
 fossil tibia of the Gastornis parisiensis, Hébert, a large bird-from
 the lower Eocene deposits at Meudon near Paris—with the tibiae of
 known recent and fossil birds.
    The tibia of the Gastornis presents the same median position of
 the supra-tendinal bridge as in the Albatross and the lamellirostral
 web-footed birds; but, as the same position of the bridge occurs in
 the Notornis, the Gallinule, the Raven, and some accipitrine birds,
 that character is not conclusive of the affinities of the Gastornis to
 the Palmipeds; and it is further invalidated by a difference in the
 aspect of the plane of the lower outlet of the bridge.         In the Alba
 tross (Diomedaba) and the Lamellirostres, the foramen or outlet looks
 directly forwards;       plane its   vertical.  is                  In

 and the Dinornis tribe.     Amongst the Gallinaceae, the Turkey (Me
 leagris) nearly resembles the Gastormis        the position    inthe bridge;   or of

                         of                     the spot described             at                                 in

Mr. Rubidge     on the Geology      of some parts of South Africa.                   313
the letter referred to. Besides being found in the alluvium there,
gold was met with in a quartz-vein in the trap traversing the strati
fied rock,-in other quartz associated with the trap,   and in a mass
of limestone enclosed in the trap-dyke;—but none in the stratified
rock itself (which belongs to the Dicynodon or Karoo Series).
   Mr. Rubidge next alluded to the fossil plants which he there found
in the strata; some of these he referred with doubt to Calamites. Six
years ago also the author found numerous vegetable remains (some of
which were possibly referable to Lepidodendron) at Jackall's Kop, on
the eastern side of the Stormberg Range, in the same formation as
that of the Drakensberg and Smithfield; and Calamite-like plants in
the western part of the Zuurbergen.    The author remarked that the
plant-remains above referred to much resembled those collected by
Mr. Bain at the Ecca Heights in rocks of the Karoo Series. Mr.
Rubidge had also found bones of the Dicynodon near the Caledon
River and at Halse’s farm.six miles from Smithfield.
   From various observations by himself and others, the author had
been enabled to recognize the existence of the Dicynodon or Karoo
rocks in the Drakensberg, at Harriesmith, at Winburg, and even at
Megaliesberg; and Dr. Sutherland has lately described the same
rocks in Natal, where they are rich in coal.
   The amygdaloid rock which suppliestheagate-gravel of the Orange,
Caledon, Kroai, and Vaal Rivers appears to exist in the “Mont des
Sources” in the Drakensberg, as an unworn specimen was found in
the Eland River (a tributary of the Waal), not more than twelve
miles from its source.
   Lastly, Mr. Rubidge supplied some remarks on the geology of the
copper district of Namaqualand and bordering countries.      Granitic
rocks of several varieties occur, together with gneiss, mica-schist,
and talc-schist.    The gneiss strikes 5° to 20° S. of W., and dips
alternately N. and S.; one dip continuing for many miles.      On the
hills the gneiss and schists are covered by horizontal sandstones,
which appear to be the same as the sandstone of Table Mountain,
and continuous with it.
   The copper is found in fissures of the gneiss, where it is locally
disturbed in  its dip, the strike remaining unaltered; that     along       is,
anticlinal and   synclinal  folds      or
                                     axes;  also   fissures extending
                                                           in

and silicates often appear     to   be
                                  infiltered into the rock-mass.   The
ores most common are red and black oxides, green and blue silicates,
purple and yellow sulphurets, and few carbonates.

heat varies with reference to the pressure, and is still believed to be
engaged in researches on the subject, one involving questions of
which experiments on the mechanical effects of elastic fluids seem
to offer the most promising means of solution.
   One of the greatest difficulties which had presented itself to
Mr. Grove's mind, with reference to the theory of Carnot, had
been one of analogy, derived from the received theories of elec
tricity. Many electrical cases might be cited in which no electricity
is supposed to be lost, though a certain mechanical effort is produced
by the electricity;              if,

    The general scope of the argument from the negation of per
 petual motion leads the mind to regard the so-called imponderables
 as modes of motion, and not as different kinds or species of matter;
 the recent progress of science is continually tending to get rid of the
 hypotheses of fluids, of occult qualities, or latent entities, which
 might have been necessary, in an earlier stage of scientific inquiry,
 and from which it is now extremely difficult to emancipate the
 mind: but if we can, as it is to be hoped we shall, ultimately arrive
 at a general dynamic theory, by which the known laws of motion
 of masses can be applied to molecules, or the minute structural
 parts of matter, it seems scarcely conceivable that the mind of
 man can further simplify the means of comprehending natural
phaenomena.
                1856.-"On certain Magnetic Actions and Affec
        February 22,
tions.”  By Michael Faraday, D.C.L., F.R.S.
   All bodies subject to magnetic induction, when placed in the
ordinary magnetic field between the poles of a magnet, are affected;
 paramagnetic bodies tend to pass bodily from weaker to stronger
 places of force, and diamagnetic bodies from stronger to weaker
 places of force.       If the bodies are elongated, then those that
 are   paramagnetic   set along the lines of force, and those that are
 diamagnetic across them : but if these bodies have a spherical
 form, are amorphous, and are perfectly free from permanent mag
 netic charge, they have no tendency to set in a particular direction.
 Nevertheless, there are bodies of both classes, which being crystal
 line, have the power of setting when a single crystal is wrought into
 the form of a sphere, and these are called magnecrystals;              their
 number is increasing continually; carbonate of lime, bismuth,
tourmaline, &c., are of this nature.       Bodies which being magnetic,
set, because they are elongated, are greatly influenced in the force of
the set by the nature of the medium surrounding them, and to such
an extent that they not merely vary in their force from the maximum
to nothing, but will often set axially in one medium, and equatori
ally in another. Yet the same bodies, if magnecrystallic and
formed into spheres, though they set well in the magnetic field, will
set with the same force whatever the change in the media about
them, and are perfectly freed from the influence of the latter.
Thus, if a crystal of bismuth formed into a sphere, or a vertical cylin
der, has, when suspended, its magnecrystallic axis horizontal, and
if the various media about                it,

    A consequence of magnecrystallic structure is that the same
body is more paramagnetic, or more diamagnetic in one direction
than in another; and therefore it follows, that though such a crystal
may have no variation in set-force, produced by change of the
surrounding medium, it may have a variation produced in the
absolute force of attraction or repulsion; even up to the point of
being attracted in one position and repelled in another, though no
change in form, or in the surrounding medium, or in the force of
the magnet, or in the nature of the body itself, be made, but simply
a change in the direction of the structure.          This was shown by a
crystal of the red ferroprussiate of potassa, which, being coated
carefully with wax, was suspended from the arm of a torsion balance
so that it dipped into a solution of protosulphate of iron occupying
the magnetic field*.       When the magnecrystallic axis was parallel
to the lines of force the crystal was attracted by the magnetic pole,
when it was perpendicular to the lines of force the crystal was
repelled; acting like a paramagnetic and a diamagnetic in turns.
No magnecrystal has yet been found having such a relation to
a vacuum, or to carbonic acid (its magnetic equivalent); calcareous
 spar is nearly coincident with such a medium, and shows different
 degrees of force in the two directions, but is always a little on the            .
 diamagnetic side. Calcareous spar having a trace of iron has been
found very nearly up to the desired point, on the paramagnetic
 side; and as these preserve the full magnecrystallic relation of the
two directions, there is no reason to suppose that a crystal may not
be found which may not be paramagnetic in one direction, and dia
 magnetic in another, in respect of space as zero.
    There is every reason to believe that the general magnetic rela
 tions of a magnecrystal are the same with those of the same substance
in the amorphous state; and that the circumstances which influence
 one, influence the other to the same degree. In that case, the magnetic
 affections of a body might be ascertained by the examination of the
 magnecrystallic affections; thus the effect of heat upon bismuth,
 tourmaline, &c., might be examined by the set of the crystals; and
 with so much the greater advantage, that short globular forms
 could be used, perfectly free from the magnetic influence of the
 surrounding media required as temperature baths, and requiring no
 displacement of these media with the motion of the crystal.                So
 crystals of bismuth, tourmaline, carbonate of iron, and other bodies
 were suspended in baths of oil, water, &c., the temperature gradually
 raised and lowered, and the torsion force of the set for each tem
 perature observed. With bismuth, a crystal having a force of 200
 at 20°F. was reduced to a force of 70 at 300°, and the diminution
 of force appeared to be nearly equal in             all
                                                   parts     of

 equal number     of  degrees.  A    piece     amorphous bismuth, com
                                                of
pressed    in one direction, gave nearly the same amount and degree          of
 change for the same alteration       of temperature; leading      us   to the
 persuasion that the whole magnetic force              of

at 0° had a setting force of 540, when raised to 300°, had a setting
force of only 270: the loss of force was progressive, being greater at
lower than at high temperatures; for a change from 0° to 30° caused
a loss of force equal 50, whilst a change from 270° to 300° caused a
loss of only 20. Carbonate of iron suffered a like change; at 0° the
force was 1140, at 300° it was only 415; at the lower temperature
the loss for 30° was 120 of force, at the upper it was only 34.
   In   all these and        many other cases, both with paramagnetic
                                     in

with the elevation          temperature; and therefore

       CONTRIBUTION                  TO   THE KNOWLEDGE OF FLUORESCENCE.

1.
I       HAVE   succeeded     obtaining    in
                                         fluid which    one   the best
                                                                    a                        is            of           of
      fluorescent liquids, and which may      prepared with great facility  be
and    atavery small cost.    Our common lampblack        well known                              is                    to

obtained which possesses the property of fluorescence.         In this state
the fluid is rather too concentrated, and in order to obtain the proper
degree of dilution I proceed in the following manner:—I take a
quadrangular glass vessel with parallel walls of about an inch and a
half in height, half-fill it with alcohol of the above strength, and
then add the fluid.      By producing a cone of light in this by means
of a biconvex    glass  of short focus, the intensity of the colour will
soon show whether the right degree of dilution has been attained.
The fluorescence is greenish-blue, like that which is obtained by
means of an extract of the seeds of the thorn-apple.         Its behaviour
towards coloured glasses is also the same. If a brownish-yellow glass
be held between the eye and the fluorescent cone of light, the latter
is seen almost unaltered; but it disappears almost entirely when the
glass disc is brought between the lens and the fluid.
    2. Relation of fluorescence to the electric light.—The luminous
phaenomena of electricity may evidently be divided into two classes;
namely the phaenomena of the electric spark, and the luminosity
produced by the ignition of the bodies through which electricity
passes.     The former light may be produced by the sparks of the
machine, or still better, because stronger, by the induction apparatus
with Neef's arrangement.        I have therefore operated with the latter
apparatus.     The induction apparatus is connected with an electro
meter in such a way, that the wire which touches the lead forms the
negative electrode. When the apparatus is in action, a blue light is
observed, covering the surface of the wire like a cloak.
    The following fluids were poured into test-tubes to a certain
height; these were held at the height of the fluids to the electric
light, and looked into from above:-1. A solution of sulphate
of quinine in water. 2. A decoction of the bark of the horse
chestnut.     3. An alcoholic extract of the seeds of the thorn-apple.
4. A similar extract of turmeric root.         5. An alcoholic extract of
litmus (dispersed yellow light). 6. A solution of chlorophyll in
alcohol.     The result of these experiments was, that the first five
fluids were fluorescent, but no fluorescence could be detected in the
sixth. A repetition of this experiment gave the same results. From
this it would appear that the electrical light is deficient in the rays
which produce red in the solution of chlorophyll.
     Inow instituted a series of experiments in order to ascertain the
 effects of the light of a platinum wire ignited by the passage of an
electrical current.     For this purpose a platinum wire of an inch and a
half  long   was fixed in such a manner, that porcelain saucers con
taining the above-mentioned fluids might be placed beneath             it.
                                                                        The
wire was then brought
                                  to
                                 red heat
                                  a             by
                                               the current, and the fluids
placed under       one after another.
                   it                     These experiments were made
in   a camera-obscura lined with     black,  and the result was entirely
negative.     They were then repeated           by
                                              pouring portions    of
                                                                  the fluids
into   test-tubes,  holding  them      to
                                       the  ignited  wire, and looking        in
from the top.      Under these circumstances also        no
                                                        fluorescence could
 be  detected. Only the fluid No.         glittered with

EXAMINATION OF THE GREEN MATTER OF THE TRUE INFUSORIA.
           BY THE PRINCE OF SALM-HORSTMAR.
   The author commences by stating that his former communication
upon the green colouring matter of the Infusoria” was founded upon
an error, as the objects investigated by him were not Infusoria but
minute Algae (Coccodea viridis).   He has now investigated the green
matter of  Euglena viridis.
   The animals, which were very lively, when collected on a filter,
dried, and extracted with alcohol, furnished an emerald-green extract
with a yellowish tinge, which gives a blood-red dispersed light. The
extract evaporated to dryness at a gentle heat presented the follow
ing properties:—
     Itdoes not dissolve perceptibly in water, even when heated.
Ammonia dissolves it when heated with a yellowish-green colour,
and the solution is somewhat turbid.        It is somewhat soluble in
solution of caustic potash with the assistance of heat; the solution
is yellowish-green.
   Sulphuric aether dissolves it very readily with an emerald-green
colour.    This solution exhibits a very strong blood-red dispersion of
both sun- and candle-light.      It does not leave a coloured residue
when left to spontaneous evaporation in an open test-glass, so that
the coloured matter possesses the remarkable property of being vola
tilized with            aether.
   It dissolves readily in                  oil
                                    turpentine with green colour, and
                                                     of                            a

                   By JoHN TYNDALL, F.R.S. &c.”
       CASE of colour blindness has been recently brought under
        my notice by Mr. White Cooper, of so singular a character
that  I think even the brief description of it which the pressure
of other duties permits me to give will not be without interest to
the readers of the Philosophical Magazine.
   Out of eleven hundred and fifty-four cases examined by Dr.
George Wilson of the University of Edinburgh, and recorded by
him in his truly interesting and valuable work on Colour Blind

medical practitioner in Yorkshire, who in November 1849 was
thrown from his horse.       “After rallying from the collapse which
immediately succeeded the accident, he suffered from severe pain
in the head, delirium, mental excitation approaching almost to
mania, loss of memory, and other symptoms of cerebral disturb
ance. . . . . On recovering sufficiently to notice distinctly objects
around him, he found his perception of colours, which was for
merly normal and acute, had become both weakened and per
verted, and has since continued so. . . . Flowers have lost more
than half their beauty for him, and he still recalls the shock
which he experienced on first entering his garden after his re

  tº At page 137 I find some observations of   mine referred to.  I would
here remark, that whatever observations or experiments     I have hitherto
made on this subject were merely repetitions or modifications of those of
Dove or Helmholtz, whose excellent memoirs    I had the pleasure of intro
ducing into this country.

332        Prof. Tyndall       on a      peculiar     case   of Colour Blindness.
   It was my intention to make a guess at the cause of colour
blindness in the case above described; but guesses, without the
means of verifying them, are so unsatisfactory, and so apt to pro
duce fruitless discussion, that for the present at least            will con         I
fine myself to the statement of the facts.
   Two other cases of a different nature were also brought under
my notice by Mr. Cooper, and may, on account of their rarity,
be worthy of a brief reference.
   The first is that of a little girl, about seven years old, the
development of whose eyes had been arrested before birth.                The
child's sight, however, though imperfect, was sufficient to enable
her to distinguish colours with accuracy.              When the spectrum
was displayed before her, she ran her          fingers   promptly over the
colours and named them correctly.              She could also read large
print. The phaenomena of irradiation presented themselves to
her as they did to me; an incandescent platinum wire became
thicker as she receded from                     it.

                                                                  as

XLII.     Researches on the Methods of preserving the Sensitiveness
    of   Collodion Plates.    By Joh N SPILLER and WILLIAM
    CRookEs.”
   is now nearly two years since we had the honour of pre
IT senting to the photographic world our first experiments
made with the view         of preserving the sensitiveness of collodion
 plates. In the Philosophical Magazine for May 1854 (an abs
 tract appearing in the Photographic Journal of that month) we
 communicated the possibility of securing this end by taking
 advantage of the deliquescent nature of certain neutral salts,
 which, by retaining water in the film, enabled us to prolong or
 defer the exposure of the sensitive plate for a length of time
 which was not practicable by the ordinary collodion process.
 For this purpose we proposed the use of the nitrates of zinc,
 manganese, lime or magnesia, and, as the type of a class of sub
 stances equally suitable in the organic kingdom, glycerine;
 sugar also had been tried, but with no good result. In conse
 quence of public attention being again drawn to glycerine, by
the lecture recently delivered before the Society of Arts, we
think it but right to assert our claim of priority in suggesting
the application of this body to the purpose under consideration.
 We quote from the article of May 1854. “Glycerine at first
seemed to promise very good results, but the principal difficulty
was the necessary impurity of the commercial product, in con
sequence of       itsbeing obtained from the exhausted leys              the               of
soap boilers.”         Now, however, that            improved process
                                                            an                                  of
manufacture has been introduced                the works of Price's Patent

not well serve the object           in
                                     view.    With this intention we pro
cured    a sample       of Price's   glycerine      soon    as   became     as   it             an
article  of commerce, and although the result                         of
                                                          our experiments
coincides to      a  certain extent with those of Mr. Pollock and
others, we nevertheless think             worth while

we believe, materially

                              ascertain the action      glycerine upon

after the expiration of a month.  Finding the action of light to
exercise this influence, we determined to keep separately, as far
as possible, these two necessary ingredients in the process. With
regard to the degree of concentration of the glycerine, the sample
made use of has a specific gravity of 1:23; this we have employed

In regard to sensitiveness, they will, if used immediately, be found

have, however, detected evidence of slight deterioration in pro
portion to the length of time the exposure has been deferred.
In cases where it is necessary to keep the plates ready excited
through a protracted interval, we have devised a convenient
plate-box to store them in, which may easily be made by replacing
the wooden grooves in an ordinary plate-box by two corrugated
sheets of gutta percha, and laying a square of thin caoutchoue
at the bottom for the glasses to rest upon.               Such a box will

Methods of preserving the Sensitiveness                                 of Collodion Plates.                  337
     Bearing in mind the qualities requisite to fulfil in the best
 manner the functions of a preservative agent, it occurred to us.
 that it might be possible to find a body having in itself the
 power of rendering the collodion film sensitive to light, or at
 least of sustaining it in that condition, and at the same time
 possessing deliquescent properties; substances having these two
 characters combined are presented in the fluoride and silico
 fluoride of silver. To put this supposition to the test of expe
  riment, we prepared these compounds (by dissolving freshly pre
  cipitated carbonate of silver in hydrofluoric and hydrofluosilicic
  acids respectively), and used their solutions, in place of the
  ordinary nitrate of silver bath, for exciting the iodized collodion
  film. Plates so treated readily became coated with a layer of
  iodide of silver, which seemed to be equally sensitive to light,
  whether produced by this or the method commonly employed;
  they had also the power of retaining a moist surface; but, un
  fortunately for the present object, it was found that a strong
  solution of fluoride of silver, like that of the nitrate, has the pro
  perty of dissolving                     off
                             the precipitated iodide         silver, destroy          of

  try their application          more dilute form, after exciting the

340                       Sir W. Snow Harris on                   a    General Law          of
Transactions for 1830, I announced a law of electricity of great
generality, viz. that the heating effect of the ordinary electrical
discharge transmitted through a metallic wire placed in the cir
cuit is as the square of the accumulation, and is entirely depend
ent on the quantity of electricity discharged, without any regard
to the intensity indications of the ordinary electrometers.  Con
sequently through whatever interval of air the discharge can
pass, as measured by a Lane's electrometer, the heating effect of
the momentary current in the wire will, with a similar circuit,
be always the same for the same quantity of electricity,+a de
duction which has since been fully verified by further discoveries
in electricity%.    M. De la Rive, for example, found the heating
effect of the voltaic current, and which he estimated by the
beautiful helical thermometer of Brequet, wholly dependent on
the quantity of electricityt.    Faraday also shows, Experimental
Researches    (366.), that “if the same quantity of electricity pass
through the galvanometer, the deflection of the needle is always
the same whatever may be the electrical intensity;” and again
(704), in the case of electro-chemical decomposition, “the force
of a given quantity of electricity is always the same, notwith
standing the greatest variations of intensity.”      Thus the law
which        I
          had previously announced has been so far satisfactorily
confirmed by the subsequent investigations of two philosophers,
whose admirable researches have enriched this branch of
physics.
   2. Although my original announcement is thus sanctioned by
experimental evidence of the highest authority, yet M. De la
Rive, in his valuable work, Traité de l’Electricité, recently pub
lished, has quoted largely from certain memoirs of M. le Professeur
Riess of Berlin, who thinks he has shown the fallacy of my an
nouncement, “la fausseté de cet énoncé.” Repeated experiments,
he says, “have informed me that the elevation                                          of temperature in
a metallic wire by the electrical discharge is proportional to the
quantity of electricity accumulated multiplied by       density,                            its               or
what comes     the same thing, proportional
                           to                    the square     the               to                    of
quantity divided                   by    battery
                                     the    the   extent
                                                            of
                                                          that his                     f:”        so
formula would be                   T–   g          in   which     T     is   the elevation         of   tempe
rature,          Q    the quantity, and                 s   the extent            of  the battery.           At
p.   116,        M. Riess attributes my failure                             in   arriving    at
                                                                                              the same

        3. As this is a question of much physical interest, more especially
     in the present progressive state of electricity as a science, and as
     any observation of so skilful and profound a philosopher as M.
     Riess merits great consideration, more especially when counte
     nanced by so distinguished a writer as M. De la Rive,                am                         I
     desirous to   submit,  for the consideration of those engaged   in elec- -
     trical inquiries, some further remarks and experiments relative to
     the exceptions thus taken to the accuracy of my early announce
     ments. I am led to take this step, being under the impression
     that I may thereby benefit science, and throw some further
     light on this interesting subject.                        I
                                                think it will be found that
      º
      M.   Riess, on   referring  to my  inquiries, has not clearly appre
     hended the     phaenomena    in question, so prominently   set forth by
      M. De la Rive.                  I
                             may perhaps further claim, and not unrea
      sonably, the privilege of seeking to obtain some little justice for
      myself, in reference to the remarks of M. Riess, viz. that my ex
                  have proved “unfruitful,” and that he has “shown the
       alsity of my announcement,” observations which seem to imply
      a belief in the infallibility of his own deductions, and which he
     thus erects into a sort of standard of value with which to com
s
     pare mine.                 I
                     think, however, it will be found that the results
     arrived at by M. Riess, and quoted by M. De la Rive, are really
     no others than those which I had myself previously obtained and
     published in my memoir above mentioned (1); and I trust to be
     enabled to satisfactorily explain in what consists the difference
     in our interpretation of these results.
         4. First, however, I must beg to be allowed to submit a few
      brief explanatory observations on the nature and construction of
      my instrument—the thermo-electrometer, which M. Riess ima
     gines to have been so imperfect in my hands as to induce him
     to place it under what he supposes to be a new form. The                                              in
     strument has been much used, not only in this country but also
     on the Continent, and has without doubt rendered good service
     to the progress of electrical research; it        fact, upon this         is,   in
     instrument that much        the real value ofM. Riess's inquiries    of
     depend.
       The thermo-electrometer, Plate III.figs.1,2,3, was first invented
     by me    long since
                  so         the year 1820, now more than thirty-five
                                          as

tions to the Philosophical Transactions*, that with circuits of cop
per wire varying from 300 to 900 feet in length, arranged in a zig
Zag form upon insulating supports, the effect of a given quantity
of electricity discharged through the wire of the thermo-electro
meter is inversely proportional to the length of the circuit, the cir
cuit in this case being taken in lengths of 300, 600, and 900 feet,
a result which M. Riess has himself confirmed by a subsequent and
similar experiment; hence my expression for the heating effect of
                                                   2

Riess's expression           T= s”        the symbol           s   being, when correctly
interpreted, nothing more than the resistance we necessarily                                     in
troduce into the circuit of discharge, in augmenting the number
of charging rods and other obstacles, when we extend our battery
by increasing the number of jars; to which we must add the
resistance arising from a division of the coated glass upon which
the charge is accumulated.       In order to make an exact experi
ment, we should accumulate and discharge the same quantity of
electricity, either from a given number of jars of different amount
of coated surface, or otherwise from a single jar in which the
extent of the coating may be varied, or otherwise from coated glass
of variable thickness. In either case we may change the indicated
“ density,” “déterminée directement au moyen d’un électrometre
a poids,” without changing the resistance in the circuit.      In                                 all
these cases, however, although the electrometer greatly varies,
the heating effect           of

times as great as the large jar B, and although the discharge
can pass over four times the distance as measured by a Lane's
electrometer.   This experiment alone, without other considera
tions, appears to me conclusive of the fact, that the hypothesis
of a variable “density’ in the accumulated electricity has no
substantial foundation, at least so far as it relates to the intensity
indications of the electrometer.

354                  Sir W. Snow Harris on a General Law of
only when we employ large quantities of electricity and circuits
of considerable extent, that we may neglect the battery resistance
as being extremely small.     It was not until employed circuits         I
of 300 to 900 feet   long (10),  and a considerable electrical accu
mulation, that            I
                   found the numbers representing the heating
effect on the thermo-electrometer in the simple inverse ratio of
the length of the circuit, or nearly so. This source of resistance
to discharge, therefore, is an element of much importance.        It
appears however to have escaped M. Riess's attention altogether.
   When we take into account these several sources of disturb
ance, we can scarcely hope to find the heating effect of a given
quantity of electricity always reciprocally proportional to the
number of jars, or what M. Riess calls the “extent of the bat
tery,” although the results may approach that ratio.
   In some instances, if the quantity of electricity be small and
the jars of the battery of great capacity, having for example from
4 to 6  square feet of coated glass each, then the comparative
resistance introduced into the circuit of discharge by the addition
of other similar jars, becomes of much greater importance;                                         if,

different metals introduced into the ball of the thermometer
evince heating effects in this same reciprocal proportion.               Thus
in the ordinary case of the electrical discharge, silver and copper
are with a given quantity of electricity the least heated, and lead
 the most; gold, zinc, platinum, iron, tin, &c. come in due place
between these extremes; whilst the degree of effect indicated on
the scale taken inversely, approximate very closely to the com
 parative values of these relative conducting powers.             It is espe
 cially remarkable that the conducting powers of copper and lead,
 as thus determined, have precisely the same relative value as
 given in the numbers of M. Becquerel”.             The numbers for other
 metals do not differ considerably when we take into the account
 the great variety of circumstances liable to derange the result.
 These, and other experimental facts which might be quoted,
 favour the conclusion, that the simple degree of movement of
 the fluid in the stem of the instrument, without further correc
                         at all

proper acknowledgement of my sense of the value of Professor
Riess's many interesting researches in this branch of physics. It is
really with no view to a painful philosophical controversy that I
have been led to submit this paper for the consideration of the sci
entific world, but solely with a view to a correct interpretation of
very important electrical phaenomena and the progress of elec
tricity. I  would also, as already observed, desire to obtain some
little consideration, in justice to myself, in reply to the rather
disparaging criticisms which M. Riess has been led to make on
my original researches, and which have been further and recently
repeated by M. De la Rive; and I especially invite the attention
of those engaged in electrical investigations to my several papers
referred to in this memoir.

XLIV.     On certain Modifications of the Form                     of the new Double
   acting Air-pump with a Single Cylinder. By                     T.TATE, F.R.A.S.*
                                              air-pump, described in
THEthecharacteristic feature of the new
        Philosophical Magazine for April         1856, consists in the
double  piston acting   in a single cylinder.    For the sake of                   di
stinction,   I
             shall call this form of the pump No. 1.        have since   I
constructed this  pump    with different systems   of valves, with the
view of determining the form which is most eligible for general
Ulse.
   There is a little loss of dynamic effect in working the pump
No. 1, from the circumstance that one of the solid pistons forms
a vacuum on one end of the cylinder at every stroke; but this
loss of work, or dynamic effect, is considerably less than that
which takes place in the common pump.        In order to eliminate
this defect,     I
               have placed valves in the pistons A and B, lifting
towards the corresponding ends of the cylinder. By this arrange
ment the exhaustion is performed with the least possible expen
diture of work or dynamic effect. This form of the pump, for
the sake of reference, I shall call No. 2. But this oeconomic
construction is attended with a little loss of exhausting power,
owing to the greater amount of                 byair
                                      which fills the valve spaces.
Whilst the exhaustion    effected    No.        measured     isabout         by
two-tenths       of   an
                   inch   mercury, that

                                                                   is               by
about four-tenths of an inch.
   Some persons,      my opinion without
                           in                sufficient reason, seem

 valves are constructed after the manner of No. 2, but in which
 the pistons are placed a little more apart, so that neither of them
 ever passes the exhaustion orifice E, but at the end of every
 stroke the interior face of one of the pistons just arrives at the
 corresponding edge of the exhausting orifice.        It is scarcely ne
 cessary to observe, that this form of the instrument possesses
                                                                     the
 same property as that of No. 2 with respect to the oeconomy of

            “A  General Method in Analysis,” published in the Trans
    IN     actions of the Royal Society for the year 1844, Professor
     Boole proposes a method for the reduction of differential equa
    tions to others already soluble, and gives several examples of                                its
    application.

IN hauer
    the November Number of the Annales     Chimie, M. Baum
         proposes a method for the determination of oxygen in
                                                                 de
organic substances.    The principle on which it rests consists in
burning the substance with oxide of copper, and estimating the
oxygen lost by the oxide; the quantity of oxygen contained in the
carbonic acid and water produced, less the quantity lost by the
oxide of copper, gives the amount of oxygen contained in the
substance. This determination requires special apparatus, which
the author describes.
  By the continued action of nitric acid on naphthaline, Laurent
obtained phthalic acid, which has the formula C*H*O°. Its forma
tion from naphthaline, C*H*, is explained on the supposition that
4equivs. of carbonand 2equivs. of hydrogen are eliminated as oxalic
acid.   M. Dusart has found that nitronaphthaline, C*(NO")H7,
undergoes a similar change when acted upon, under certain con
ditions, by caustic potash. In this case the nitronaphthaline loses
4 equivs. of carbon, which appear to be eliminated as such,
and a body C*H"NO" is produced. This represents the nitro
compound of a hydrocarbon as yet unknown, C18H8, and which
is isomeric with cinnamene. By acting on this new compound,
which Dusart names nitrophthaline, with sulphide of ammonium, a
base is formed which has the formula C18H3N.          He calls it
                .                                 it its

   The fatty matters contained in the seeds are neutral. When
the seeds and various oleaginous kernel fruits are reduced to a
state of minute division, by which the cells are destroyed, and the
substances composing them put in intimate contact, the neutral
fatty matters contained in them are changed into a fatty acid and
glycerine. In this case a similar change is effected to that ob
served when the cells of the apple or grape, which isolate the
ferment, are destroyed by being crushed; the sugar contained in
them, acted upon by the ferment set free, is split up into alcohol
and carbonic acid. M. Pelouze ascertained by direct experiments,
that the fatty matters, as originally contained in the seeds, are
neutral, there being only traces of fatty acids present.        His
mode of experimenting was to enclose seeds and grains of many
different kinds in vessels which effectually excluded the air.
From time to time he opened these, and determined the amount
of fatty acid liberated.     He found that the quantity varied
directly as the time. The different kinds of neutral fatty oils
varied very much in the rapidity with which they were decom
posed; and this decomposition differs not only with the tempe
rature, but with the quantities operated upon.     He attempted,
but without success, to isolate the ferment, by which he supposes
that the decomposition is effected.  In the course of his investi
gations he found that the sugar contained in nuts, almonds, &c.,
is identical with cane-sugar.
    In the Australian Manna (which exudes from a species of
 Eucalyptus) Berthelot has found a crystalline saccharine matter
 which he names Melitose.      The crystallized preparation has the
 formula C*H*O*-i-4HO, and when dried at 100°C. it loses
 the 4 equivs. of water.   Its aqueous solution deviates to the right
 the plane of  polarization;  by the addition of sulphuric acid this
power is diminished by about one-third.           Its behaviour with
reagents is almost exactly that of cane-sugar.
    But when caused to ferment, by the addition of yeast, it ex
hibits a striking peculiarity. While 100 parts of grape-sugar
 give, on fermentation, 222 parts of carbonic acid, the same
quantity of melitose, which is isomeric with      it,
                                                    gives 44.5 parts.
    When melitose was treated with        SO",      an uncrystallizable
saccharine matter was produced.        This comports itself exactly
as  melitose, and produces, like  it,   on
                                         fermentation, exactly half
the  quantity   ofcarbonic acid which        equal weight
                                             an             of   grape
sugar would produce.
    On examining the solutions      of melitose after fermentation,
they were found       contain peculiar saccharine principle which

Bineau on the Absorption of Ammonia by Cryptogamic Plants. 375
   M. Bineau    has made some observations on the absorption of
 ammonia and the nitrates by cryptogamic plants.       His experi
 ments were made on the Hydrodictyon pentagonale and the Con
ferva vulgaris. He infers from them these consequences —1. The
 demonstration of the fact of an absorption or of a decomposition
 of ammoniacal salts with an intensity analogous to that of CO".
 This has hitherto had no parallel in the case of saline matters,
which are generally absorbed much less abundantly than their
solvents.   2. That the nutrition of the Algae is promoted by their
tendency to remove the nitrates from the waters in which they
vegetate, either by directly assimilating the nitrogen, or by con
verting the nitrates into ammoniacal salts.      3. That the elabo
ration by green plants of nitrogen compounds, as well as of car
bonic acid, is facilitated by light.
  In  the November Number of Liebig’s Annalen, Dr. Casselmann
discusses at some length the process proposed by Streng for volu
metric determinations by means of bichromate of potash. He
communicates the results of some comparative experiments which
he made with a view of testing this method, and describes the
conditions under which it is applicable.  He considers that the
method has only a limited application for scientific purposes.

   The late Dr. Pauli discovered in wood-vinegar an acid which
he thought to be pyrogallic acid; since his death the question
has been examined by M. Buchner, who finds that it is not py
rogallic acid, but oxyphenic acid, C*H* O*. This acid invari
ably accompanies the products of the destructive distillation of
wood, but is not found in coal-tar, being probably decomposed

  M. Kerl   proposed a method for the determination of copper,

Its formula is C40H8° 018 H 4HO, and it loses      the water at 100°C.
It   is to be considered as composed    of benzoic acid, saligenime, and
grape-sugar:—
     C40H22O26+4HO=C14H8
        -

                          Benzoic acid.   Saligenine.    Grape-sugar.
       Populine.
Salicine is composed of saligenine and grape-sugar, and when
treated with acid is resolved into saliretine and grape-sugar. Simi
larly, populine, when treated with acid, splits up into benzoic
acid, saliretine, and grape-sugar.
   It was thought that if the benzoic acid could be separated
from the populine, salicine would be formed.          By the action of
caustic  baryta  this is effected, and the salicine separated has also
the physical and chemical properties of that prepared in the usual
way.    The benzoic acid formed corresponds with the quantity
required by theory.
   By treating salicine with nitric acid, helicine is produced. In
the same way, by treating populine with nitric acid, benzo-helicine
is formed.    And from this benzo-helicine, by the action of caustic
magnesia, helicine is produced, which is exactly the same as that
produced directly from salicine.
    Helicine is decomposed by acids into grape-sugar and hydride
of salicyle; and benzo-helicine similarly into benzoic acid, hydride
of salicyle, and grape-sugar.                                        -
   Piria considers at length the conditions under which bodies
form copulated compounds.          When these copulated compounds
 split up, the elements of water are always assimilated, and in
 the formation of these copulated compounds water is eliminated.
 He proposes this law, that when n constituents unite to form a
copulated compound,     201–1)   equivalents   of   water are eliminated.
Thus in the copulation of two bodies =2, of 3=4, of 4=6,
of 5=8. Piria considers populine an example of the copulation
of three bodies, and here 4 equivs. of water are separated. Amyg
daline is considered by Piria as containing five groups of atoms,
in the copulation of which 8 equivs. HO are separated.
   By acting on glycerine with iodide of phosphorus, Berthelot
obtained a new body, the iodide of propylenyle, C° H*I.   The
discovery of this body has lately led to numerous important results.

of aethyle does in the common alcohol series. By distilling it

    142. It is to be remarked, in the first place, that any portion
of a solid traversed by current electricity may be divided, by
tubular surfaces coinciding with lines of electric motion, into an
infinite number of channels or conducting arcs, each containing
an independent linear current. The strength of a linear current
being, as before, defined to denote the quantity of electricity
flowing across any section in the unit of time, we may now define
the intensity of the current at any point of a conductor as the
strength of a linear current of infinitely small transverse dimen
sions through this point, divided by the area of a normal section
of   itschannel.  The elementary proposition         the composition        of

thermo-electric properties of copper and iron wires are affected
by alternate tension and relaxation in such a manner as to leave
no doubt but that a mass of either metal, when compressed or
extended in one direction, possesses different thermo-electric rela
tions in different directions.       Fragments of different metals may
be  put  together   so as to form    solids,  possessing by structure the
thermo-electric characteristic of a        crystal,  in an infinite variety
of ways. Thus, a structure consisting of thin layers alternately
of two different metals, possesses obviously the thermo-electric
qualities of a crystal with an axis of symmetry.                 have investi               I

    zero as the temperature is raised from an ordinary atmospheric

    be in the interior; and since the substance is homogeneous, and

nothing more than the absolute temperature multiplied by the

                                              have hitherto avoided
mentioning this point in my papers; principally because I have
so high an esteem for the labours of the physicist for whom Prof.
                                        I
Thomson claims priority, that was anxious to avoid even the ap
pearance of wishing to lessen his deserts.    But as Prof. Thomson
has since then  frequently  repeated that  assertion,-among   other
places in the paper in the March Number of this Journal, where,
in page 215, he calls that theorem “Mr. Joule’s conjecture,”—
I think it necessary to say a few words on the subject.
   Holtzmann established the same formula for the function C
in a paper which appeared as early as 1845*; and Helmholtz, in
his pamphlet published in 1847, “On the Conservation of Force,”
citing Holtzmann’s paper, calculated several values obtained by
this formula, and compared them with those arrived at by Cla
peyron in a different manner.     But the views upon which Holtz
mann founded his    speculations  do not agree with the mechanical
theory of heat as at present received; so that after this had been
recognized, the correctness of the formula found by him was,
naturally, again rendered doubtful. On this account, in a paper
communicated to the Berlin Academy in February 1850+, “On
the Moving Force of Heat,” in which                         I
                                             brought Carnot's pro
position in agreement with the mechanical theory of heat,                                       I
again endeavoured to determine his function more accurately.
          I
Therein arrived at the same formula as Holtzmann, and believe                       I
      I
that then, for the first time, correctly explained the principles
upon which this formula is based.
   In presence of these facts, Prof. Thomson, to justify his state
ment, saysf, “It was suggested to me by Mr. Joule, in a letter
dated December 9, 1848, that the true value of A might be                                     in
versely as the temperature from zero.”     Against this must beg               I
to urge,   First,  that, as far as  am      I
                                        aware, it is usual, in deter
mining questions of priority in scientific matters, only to admit
such statements as have been published.      And believe that this  I   to,
custom   ought    to be  conscientiously adhered        especially                            in
theoretical investigations; for     usually requires continued and

                                        is    before venturing upon
its publication. Secondly, that since Thomson does not say that

Mr. Joule had   proved the theorem, but only that he had offered
                             I
it as an opinion, do not see why this opinion should have the
priority over that which Holtzmann had arrived at three years

   In conclusion allow me to make one remark. In a more recent

Carnot's function  C, another function of the temperature, which
I have designated by T, and by which        developments are very            all
much simplified. This function has         determinate relation            a                                          to

baryta dissolved per 1000 grs. of acid, whilst we have 2099 in No.4 jar.
   But the relative bulk of acid is not the only influence which affects
the affinity of sulphuric acid for baryta, as the relative quantities of
nitrate of baryta and sulphate of potash put in presence also exert
an action.   This fact is illustrated by the following results, taken
from three different tables, in which the same quantities of acid were
used, but different proportions of salts:—

                 the Valenciennes                                By M. Laurent.              In a
Letter to A. Tylor, Esq., F.G.S.
   This communication referred to the works in the coal-basin of the
departments of the “Nord” and the “Pas de Calais,” on the pro
longation of the Belgian basin of Mons. At the end of the last
century, France in the north possessed only the mines of Auzin,
which were first worked in 1716. This state of things lasted until
1832, when the workings only extended to Denain.      In 1839, the
concessions of  Douchy, Bruelle, Vicoigne, Auiche,  Agincourt,  and
Thioncelles were made. The works of research went on until 1841,
at which period the adventurers, discouraged by the numerous fruit
less attempts made in the supposed direction of the basin towards
Arras, abandoned them. Six years later, the works undertaken
towards the north-west of Douai, in the direction of the present
concessions of the “Pas de Calais,” indicated the true direction of
the coal-basin; and down to 1854, numerous trial-sinkings,                of
which many passed through the coal, led to the establishment of
nine new concessions; and a tenth, on the border of the basin, is in
progress. Two more also have been made this year (1855), one to
the north of Douai, the other to the north of Bethune, above
Choques, where they suppose that the bands of dry coal (faisceau
maigre) end, the basin beyond this place becoming narrower, and
representing only the seams of caking coal in all the concessions to
the west.
    Many works have, moreover, been undertaken in the course of
the last three years, in search of a widening of the basin by the
series of the seams of caking coal, and of an extension of the dry
coal band, which disappears at Choques.            With the exception of
those made    by  the “Vendin     Company,”    these sinkings have as yet
given only negative results.
    In    all
            the sinkings which have been made from Valenciennes                                to

of the deposition of these Permian beds, as evidenced by the nume.
rous impressions of foot-tracks of Chelonians, Lizards, and Batra
chians, which walked over the shores of the Permian waters, when
the sandstones of Corncockle Muir and Dumfries were sandy beaches
with mud-patches scattered over them.
    Mr. Harkness regards the several patches or areas of the rocks in
question as having once been connected in a mass of great super
ficial extent; and he thinks it probable that the denudation which
is supposed to have removed the greater portion took place in the
pleistocene epoch; the preservation of the isolated patches being
due to local subsidences.
       April 9, 1856.-D. Sharpe, Esq., President, in the Chair.
    The following communications were read:—
    1. “Notes on the Geology of the neighbourhood of Sydney and
of Brisbane, Australia.” By J. S. Wilson, Esq. Communicated
by Sir R. I. Murchison, F.G.S.
    Mr. Wilson, the Geologist of the North Australian Expedition,
availing himself of such opportunities as occurred to make geological
 notes on the tracts hastily visited on his way to Cambridge Gulf,
 where the party had disembarked, communicated a series of obser
vations on the sandy Carboniferous Rocks of Sydney, the coal of
 the Hunter River, the structure of Nobby's Island in Newcastle
 Harbour, the geological characters of the district from Newcastle,
 through Maitland and Singleton, to the Liverpool Range, the gold
 diggings at the Hanging Rocks, and the Peel River district.       After
 returning to Sydney, Mr. Wilson sailed to Moreton Bay, where
 he again had an opportunity of studying the Carboniferous strata, as
 well as the crystalline rocks around Brisbane; the latter are to
 some extent auriferous.
    2. “On the Strata.of Hastings Cliffs.” By S.H. Beckles, Esq., F.G.S.
    Between Hastings and Cliff End, to the eastward, the sea has
 considerably modified the aspect of the cliffs since Mr. Webster
 described the strata of this coast in detail; and the author of this
 communication, having devoted much time and labour to the search
 for fossils in these cliffs, has been enabled to work out the relations
 of some beds of sandstone and clays subordinate to the conglomeratic
  shale and ironstone which Mr. Webster described as the lowest
 strata visible in the series.     The above-mentioned shale and iron
 stone contain remains of Insects (discovered by Messrs. Binfield in
  1853) and Saurians, together with Cyrena and Unionidae; and the
 ironstone is full of fragmentary plant-remains.      In the sandstone
 beneath are also Uniones, and the natural casts of great foot-tracks,
 already described by Mr. Beckles.         In the next succeeding bed
 are beautiful Zamia-like plant-remains, together with a large Unio or
 Anodon, and a Paludina.          Beneath these is the clay, in which
 Hybodus-spines were the only fossils found.

  Mr. Hopkins         on the Eaternal Temperature                of the Earth.           399
astronomer, judging from the appearances which Mars and Jupiter
present to us, would entertain any serious doubt as to the existence
of atmospheres surrounding those planets, and the probability would
seem to be almost equally strong of Saturn being likewise enveloped
in a similar manner. The obliquity of the axis of rotation is known
with considerable accuracy in the cases of Mars and Jupiter; and
also in that of Saturn, if it coincide with the axis of rotation of his
ring. Venus presents great difficulties to the observer, but it ap
pears now to be pretty satisfactorily determined, that the period of
rotation about her own axis is nearly the same as that of the Earth,
and that the obliquity of her axis is large, amounting to as much as
about 75°. This must produce an extraordinary difference between
the changes of annual temperature in that planet and those which we
experience.     The author has endeavoured, in this paper, to estimate
numerically the effect of this anomalous obliquity. Practical astro
nomers have entertained the opinion that Venus likewise has an
atmosphere.      Of Mercury we know too little by direct observation
to form any opinion on those points founded on observed facts, and
the same remark will apply to the remoter planets beyond Saturn;
but most astronomers probably feel much the same conviction that
Mercury, Uranus, and Neptune have atmospheres of greater or less
 extent, as that they revolve round their own axes with greater or
less angular velocity.
    It is not the author's object, however, to adjust the balance of pro
babilities for particular hypotheses in favour of planetary atmospheres
or against them; but assuming their existence, to estimate their effects
 on the planetary temperatures.      And in like manner he points out the
influence which must be exercised by a greater or less conductivity, and
 specific heat in the superficial matter of a planet, without professing to
 discuss the probability of such properties being materially different in
 the different planets. The Earth's atmosphere is known to be almost
 completely diathermanous for heat radiating directly from the Sun;
 and it is assumed to be equally so for the heat which proceeds directly
 from the fixed stars, and to which the general temperature of space
 is due. This radiating heat therefore has little or no effect in heat
ing the atmosphere during its transmission to the Earth's surface;
 but after falling upon and heating terrestrial objects, it loses the
 power of radiating completely through the atmosphere, and is trans
 mitted back into space through the atmosphere by conduction, con
 vection, and partial radiation to limited distances.         But for any of
 these modes of    transmission,  it is essential that the   temperature   of
 the atmosphere should be greater in             its
                                              lower than         upper por

the Earth, amounting, according to the estimate of some astronomers,
to as much as 75°, as heretofore stated.        This would of course
render the character of her seasons entirely different from those of
the Earth. The greatest mean annual temperature would be at the
pole.    Independently of the horizontal transference of heat by acrial
currents or other causes, taking the extreme obliquity of 75°, and sup
posing the atmosphere of Venus to be exactly like that of the Earth,
her mean temperature at the equator would be about 56°C., and at
the pole 95°C. This latter would probably be much lowered by
 currents; but if the height of the atmosphere of Venus be less than
that of the Earth's atmosphere by about 25,000 feet, the author con
 siders that the mean temperature of Venus in her equatorial regions
 would not exceed that of the temperate regions of the Earth; while
 the mean polar temperature would probably be about 40° C., or
 about 12° or 13°C. higher than the Earth's equatorial temperature.
 The heat of sunshine may be moderated by an atmosphere more laden
 with vapour than that of the Earth.
    Supposing the atmosphere of Venus like that of the Earth in its
 nature and        its
                   magnitude, the temperature      her poles, with the   at

amounting to nearly 60°C., supposing the matter of which her su
perficial crust is composed to have the same conductivity, specific
heat, and radiating power as the crust of the Earth. If these be
much greater for the Moon, this inequality might be considerably
diminished.     At the poles it must be comparatively small.
    The lunar  temperatures    here spoken of are those of the matter
forming her external crust.      The temperature which would be indi
cated by a thermometer placed in her immediate vicinity would be
affected by the Moon (in the assumed absence of an atmosphere)
only by her direct radiation. We have not the means of determining
what this temperature may be.

    The method pursued in this paper is a modification of that mode
of viewing electrical phaenomena in relation to the theory of the uni
form conduction of heat, which was first pointed out by Professor W.
Thomson in the Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal, vol. iii.
Instead of using the analogy of heat, a fluid, the properties of which
are entirely at our disposal, is assumed as the vehicle of mathematical
reasoning.    A method is given by which two series of surfaces may
be drawn in the fluid so as to define its motion completely.         The
uniform motion of an     imponderable  and   incompressible fluid permea
ting a medium, whose resistance is directly as the velocity, is then
discussed, and it is shown how a system of surfaces of equal pressure
may be drawn, which, with the two former systems of surfaces,
divides the medium into cells, in each of which the same amount of
work is done in overcoming resistance. It is then shown that if the
fluid be supposed to emanate from certain centres, and to be absorbed
at others, the position of these centres can be found when the pres
sure at any point is known; and that when the centres are known,
the distribution of pressures may be found.       Methods are then given
by which the motion of the fluid out of one medium into another,
the resistance of which is different, may be conceived and calculated,
and the theory of motion in a medium in which the resistance is
different in different directions is stated.
    The mathematical ideas obtained from the fluid are then applied
to various parts of electrical science. It is shown that the expres
 sion for the electrical potential at any point is identical with that of
 the pressure in the fluid, provided that “sources” of fluid are put
instead of positive electrical “matter,” and centres of absorption or
 “sinks” for negative “matter.”
    The theory of Faraday with respect to the effect of dielectrics in
 modifying electric induction, is illustrated by the case of different
media having different conducting power; and it is shown, that, in
order to calculate the effects by the ordinary formulae of attractions,

we must alter in a certain proportion the quantities of electricity
within the dielectric, and conceive an imaginary distribution of elec
tricity over the surface which separates it from the surrounding
medium.
  The theory of magnets and of the       phaenomena of paramagnetic
and   diamagnetic  bodies is expressed with reference to the “lines of
inductive magnetic action;” and elementary proofs of the tendency
of paramagnetic bodies toward places of stronger magnetic action,
and of diamagnetic bodies toward places of weaker action, are given.
This distinction of paramagnetic and diamagnetic is not here used
absolutely, but indicates a greater or less conductivity for the lines
of inductive action than that of the surrounding medium.
    The magnetic phaenomena of crystals are then examined, and
referred to unequal magnetic conductivity in different directions;
 and the case of a crystalline sphere in a uniform field of force is
 worked out.
    The laws of electric conduction, as laid down by Ohm, are shown
 to agree with those of the imaginary fluid, and definitions of quan
 tity and intensity are given, which will apply to magnetism as well
 as galvanism.
    The theory of the attractions of closed circuits, as established by
 Ampère, is shown to lead to the following results:—
     1. The total intensity of the magnetizing force estimated along
 any closed curve embracing the circuit is a measure of the quantity
 of the current.
  2. The quantity of the current, multiplied by the quantity of in
ductive magnetic action, from whatever source, which passes through
it,gives what may         be
                       called the potential      the circuit. The ten

   Like Hermann,   the author is of opinion that the carbonic acid is
to be regarded as belonging to a carbonate subsequently produced;
and if this be deducted, the above numbers lead to the following pro
portions of oxygen:—

  Hermann has assumed the proportion of oxygen to be =3: 6:15.
The average of the author's analyses is 3:52: 11.9, for which we
may substitute 3: 5 : 12.    According to this, völknerite may be
regarded as MgO, Al” O*-i-4(MgO, 3HO), or as
                                  Alº O2, 3HO-F5(MgO, 2HO).

           following investigation was made in the metallurgical
THElaboratory         of the Museum of Practical Geology, at the
request of Dr. Percy, with the special object of ascertaining
the causes of the characteristic properties of ordinary “tough
pitch copper” and of “overpoled coppert.”
    Before detailing the experiments, it may be well to describe
very briefly that part of the smelting process termed refining, in
which the copper is obtained in these conditions. An impure
copper, the product of previous operations, is kept melted in the
oxidizing atmosphere of a reverberatory furnace for a consider
able time. The products are copper containing suboxide in
solution, and a slag rich in suboxide of copper.           The object of
this process is to remove as completely as possible by oxidation,
the last traces of various metals and the sulphur left in the cop
per after the previous treatment. Copper thus saturated with
suboxide is known as dry copper.          The slag is then skimmed off,
and anthracite thrown upon the surface of the melted copper.
By this means the suboxide is reduced, and the action is com
pleted by plunging one end of a pole of green wood under the
surface of the melted metal.          The gases produced by the decom
position of the wood produce a kind of ebullition, which causes
every portion of the metal to be brought more, rapidly and
thoroughly in contact with the anthracite than would otherwise

split at the edges when hammered out at a dull red heat after
having been melted under charcoal.       They could, however, be
hammered out when cold without       cracking  in the least. The
pieces experimented on weighed about 150 or 200 grs. ; possibly
larger pieces would be more difficult to hammer out without
cracking, but it would require an experienced coppersmith to
give an opinion on the working properties of such pieces. Similar
pieces as those alluded to cut from the ingot of copper made at
 the Hafod Works, cracked even when hammered cold after being
 melted in hydrogen or under charcoal.     The amount of lead was
 not determined in this ingot.   No complete analyses of copper,
 such as wire or sheet, were made; and in those published with
 which the writer is acquainted, no mention is made of oxygen
 as a constituent : but, what is curious, in some, metals such as
 potassium, calcium and magnesium are said to occur.         This
 seems to require further investigation.      Russian copper coin
was found to contain oxygen, but it seems to be less essential to
the malleability of this variety of copper than to the English
copper; because when the oxide in Russian copper is reduced by
melting under charcoal, the metal may be hammered out even
at a red heat without cracking much.   This seems to show greater
purity, though it is not equal to electrotype copper.
    Several experiments were made with the view of finding some
method of melting tough pitch copper without either increasing
or diminishing the amount of suboxide present in                  which,      it,        if
practicable, would allow         of   its
                                      being melted without losing mal
leability.     The two substances employed were common salt and
chloride    of calcium, the former not chemically pure chloride                          of
sodium, but commercial salt. The method pursued was                    melt         to
the salt and drop the metal into                 was found that electro

submitted to the action of ammonia, or indeed any reducing gas
at a red heat, is altered in appearance on the surface, owing to
the slight porosity produced.                       If
                                       the surface was previously
polished, it becomes dull.    If the experiment is continued long
enough to reduce the suboxide in the centre of the piece of metal
operated upon, it may afterwards be completely reduced to powder
by rubbing it gently in a mortar; but if the action of the gas
has not extended to the centre, a core of tough metal remains,
from which the altered portion cracks off by bending the piece
of metal backwards and forwards. It is curious that the copper
containing suboxide is rendered more brittle by ammonia than
by any other reducing gas which has been tried; but that the
change arises simply from reduction of the suboxide seems proved
by the fact, that copper containing no suboxide is not altered by
heating in ammonia.      No quantitative experiments were made
to ascertain exactly whether every trace of suboxide is reduced by
heating the wire in ammonia, which seems probable, because the
wire, as has been said, is rendered still less pliant than when
heated in hydrogen for a similar period.   The specific gravity of
the wire B was found to have diminished   by  heating in ammonia
from 8.733 to 8-64.
   Effect of Silicon.—Berzelius seems to have been the first to show
that when a mixture of finely divided copper, silica, and charcoal
is strongly heated, a combination of copper and silicon is obtained
(see English edition of ‘Gmelin's Chemistry,’ vol. v. p. 464). It
seemed, therefore, not unlikely that overpoled copper might con
tain some silicon, because carbonaceous and siliceous matters are
in contact with it when in the furnace at the overpoled state,
and that it might owe some of                   its
                                       properties

     About 672 grs. of electrotype copper, which had been melted
under charcoal, were mixed in the state of filings with recently
ignited chromate of lead, and the mixture was heated in a com
bustion tube connected with a weighed set of Liebig’s potash
bulbs, and a combustion was made as in the case of an organic
body. No gas was perceived to bubble through the potash solu
tion.     At the end of the experiment some air was drawn through
the    apparatus,  and the potash bulbs were reweighed.        They had
increased only 0:115 gr.        Assuming this to be carbonic acid, it
 corresponds to 0.031 gr. of carbon in 672 grs. of copper.          This
 experiment is also inconclusive.
     A piece of the sheet made from the ingot which had been
 rolled out by Mr. Forbes was cleaned by boiling in caustic pot
 ash.     It weighed 221 10 grs. It was laid in a platinum basin
 which was immersed in a solution of sulphate of copper contain
 ing free sulphuric acid.         The platinum basin was then con
 nected with the     positive  pole  of a galvanic battery, and a plate
 of   copper  connected with the negative pole was arranged over
 the basin in the solution of sulphate of copper.         The whole was
 covered so as to exclude dust, and left till the residue of the
  copper in the basin was very small.          It still contained a little
  metallic copper, which was removed by the action of a solution
  of perchloride of iron containing some free hydrochloric acid.
  The residue was then washed by decantation, dried, and weighed.
  It had a very dark gray, or nearly black colour, and weighed
  0.08 gr. When a portion of this was heated on platinum foil it
  evolved a slight and peculiar odour, glowed for an instant, and
  left a small incombustible residue.        Another portion, weighing
  0.012 gr., was placed on a very small piece of platinum foil,
  which was introduced into a small glass tube, one end of which
  dipped into a solution of caustic baryta protected from the action
  of the air, and the other end of which was then connected with
  an apparatus from which a very feeble current of air, perfectly
   free from carbonic acid, could be sent.      Some of this air was then
   sent through the tube containing the slip of platinum and into
   the solution of caustic baryta, and it was observed that no cloudi
   mess was produced in the liquid.        The heat of a spirit-lamp was
   then applied to that part of the tube where the piece of platinum
   containing the powder was placed.         At first a very slight subli
   mate was   evolved,  which had the colour of sulphur, and which
   condensed in the cooler part of the tube. When the tempera
   ture of the platinum foil on which the powder rested had reached
   redness, every bubble of air as it passed through the baryta water
   produced a precipitate. After a short time the apparatus was
   disconnected, and excess of hydrochloric acid was added to the
   baryta solution, when the precipitate dissolved with effervescence.

in the centre of which there is always a depression, owing to the
contraction of the metal during solidification.      In this depres
 sion are generally  seen a number of     crystalline  points. The
 appearance of copper which has been melted under charcoal is
influenced by a number of circumstances.        One of these is de
serving of special notice, because it gives rise to one of the most
marked characters of overpoled copper, viz. the “rising in the
mould.”
   When copper which has been melted under charcoal is cast
into an ingot mould under ordinary circumstances, the ingot,
when cooling, gives off a gas, sometimes causing projection
into the air of small globules of the metal, and it solidifies
with a very rough but tolerably flat surface.          At other times no
projection of globules takes place, and the ingot cools with a
smooth surface; but in this case it is not flat; for just at the
moment of solidification a quantity of still fluid metal is squeezed
from the central portion of the ingot towards the centre of the
upper surface, producing a ridge along                When such ingots
                                                                  it.

Other   ingots have numerous large cavities among the small ones,
and a   very rough surface produced by the small craters from
which   the gas escaped.    The specific gravity of a piece of a small
ingot   made like the    previous one, which had this appearance,
was found to be    8:211;  of another piece of the same, 8.285. Of
course the specific gravity will vary according to the degree in
which these cavities can be filled with water when taking the
specific gravity.    The method pursued was to place the piece of
metal in boiling water and allow it to cool under water.          This
was found to    give  higher  results than when the same      piece of
metal was placed in water under an exhausted bell-jar; but the
filling of the cavities can never be perfect, because they do not
communicate. The reason assigned for the well-known fact of
the evolution of a gas has been, that oxygen was dissolved by
the melted metal and expelled from it during solidification (see
English edition of ‘Gmelin's Chemistry,’ vol. v. p. 402). It
seems, however, certain that it cannot be oxygen, because “dry
copper” and “tough pitch copper,” which certainly contain
oxygen, give off none during solidification: further, the surfaces
of the cavities when the ingot is fractured are seen to be perfectly
bright and metallic, which they would not have been had oxygen
been  in contact with them at the temperature at which they were
formed. The gas seems to be either carbonic acid or carbonic
oxide, or it may be sulphurous acid, as is shown by the follow
ing experiments.
   If a piece of copper is melted under charcoal and allowed to
cool in the crucible, it will be found that the appearance of the
fracture, though affected by the rate of cooling and other things,
never presents any trace of vesicular structure; but that  instead                 if,

affects the result, viz. the air through which the metal passed

Instead of the ridge on the surface, as there is when the air is
allowed free access to the metal while pouring, there is a depres
sion.      This depression shows very markedly the crystalline
structure of the metal; for during the contraction attendant
on solidification, the still liquid portion seems to have been
drawn into the central portion of the ingot, thus rendering evi
dent the crystals which had formed; this is especially evident in
the depression.      It is not improbable that the movements of
different parts of the metal during solidification, by mixing por
tions containing oxygen with other portions containing carbon
or sulphur, may be one reason why the gas evolved is especially
evident then. This difference, produced by pouring the metal
into an oxidizing or reducing atmosphere, was observed very
many times; and it was found quite easy, by arranging the
moulds beforehand, to cast one ingot which should be vesicular
and another which should not, from the same crucible,_casting
the one immediately after the other in any order.
     If
      it is desired to cast the metal which has been melted under
charcoal perfectly free from cavities, the utmost precautions must
be taken to exclude air.       The method which was found to suc
ceed best, was to place on the crucible a             just large enough   lid

    From these experiments, it will be seen that tough pitch cop
per is copper containing an amount of oxygen equal to from 3
to 3.5 per cent. of suboxide of copper, in addition to small quan
tities of foreign metals, such as lead or antimony, or both, and
that the existence of a certain amount of oxygen in it is essential
to the perfect malleability of such copper.
    That the brittleness of overpoled copper is not due to carbon,
but to the foreign metals occurring in tough pitch copper, the
influence of which upon the malleability of the metal is no longer
counteracted by the oxygen compounds, owing to their having
been reduced by the carbon.                            -
    That the  porous   structure of    overpoled    copper arises from a
reaction between carbon or sulphur (for the anthracite employed
on the large scale contains sulphur) absorbed by the metal in
the furnace and oxygen absorbed by it whilst casting, which
gives rise to a gas.    That it may be cast with a dense structure
by taking precautions to exclude the action of the air, such as
by filling the mould with coal-gas, and pouring the metal so
that it shall pass through coal-gas and not through air; and
that this porosity is not the cause of the brittleness of overpoled
copper.
    That the specific gravity of copper which has been melted
under charcoal and cast with a porous structure is increased by
being drawn into wire, so that it is nearly as high as wire made
from copper which had a dense structure at first.
    That the specific gravity of copper which has been melted
under charcoal and cast with a dense structure is not increased
by being drawn into wire, and that the specific gravity of the
 wire is the same before as after annealing.

   The mean ratio of S to M here found, shows that the sun’s
effect on the diurnal tide is somewhat more than half the moon’s
effect.         In Mr. Airy's          discussion           of the semidiurnal tides of
Ireland, the following mean ratios of S to                         M are found+:—

   According to the statical theory of the tides, the ratio of the
solar to the lunar effect should be the same for the diurnal and
for the semidiurnal tides; but according to the dynamical theories
of the tides, the coefficients in the solar and lunar tides depend in
a different manner on the depth of the sea, and therefore the
ratios deduced from the diurnal and semidiurnal tides should
be different.
   According to Mr. Airy's theory of tides with friction, the
ratios of the solar to the lunar coefficients in the semidiurnal
and diurnal tides are given by the following equations:—

water should occur at the time of meridian passage of the lumi
nary, as was first pointed out by Newton, Princip. Math, lib. i.

of high water is accelerated by an interval equal to the difference
between the tidal interval and half the period of a tidal oscilla

     These depths agree remarkably well together; and although
 they differ widely from the result obtained from heights, and
 from the result of Laplace’s ‘Brest Observations on the Semi
 diurnal Tide,' yet we shall find them confirmed in a remarkable
 manner by the depths of the sea, deducible from the age of the
 lunar tide.

 with the results obtained from the diurnal solitidal and lunitidal

be observed that probably the depth inferred from tidal intervals
and ages may be the depth of the sea at a greater distance from
the coast; while the depth deduced from heights is the depth of
the sea after it has begun to shoal, the tide being composed
partly of a derivative and partly of the original Atlantic tide.
   Is it impossible, or improbable, that the result deduced from
times, viz. 11.65 miles, is the depth of the central channel of the
South Atlantic and of the Antarctic Oceans, while the depth
deduced from heights, viz. 5:12 miles, is the mean depth of
the whole Atlantic?
   These and many other interesting questions suggest them
selves, which I shall leave for the consideration of those concerned
in the mathematical theory of the tides. The separation of the
effects of the sun and moon in the diurnal tide, which has never
before been made, must prove of value in correcting the bases
on which the mathematical theories of the tides rest; theories
which, notwithstanding the amount of mathematical genius ex
ercised on them, must be considered as still in a most imperfect
and unsatisfactory condition.

         Th;    Propositions I. and II., investigated above, suggest
             the kind of assumptions to be made regarding the
reversible thermal effects of currents in uniformly heated crystal
line solids, and the electromotive forces induced by any thermal
circumstances which cause inequalities of temperature in different
parts. The formulae expressing these agencies in the particular
case which we have now investigated, guide us to the precise
forms required to express those assumptions in the most general
possible manner.                                                            (a,

  A   prism was mounted before the object-glass of a telescope
furnished with a micrometer; and to this telescope a smaller
one was attached, at such an angle, that one observer could view
a star by direct vision, while another simultaneously observed                                                      its
refracted image.      The first observer made the star intersect the
wires  of the small telescope; the second brought the micrometer

                  unnecessary to point out the advantages of this
        It is perhaps
mode of observation. These are the complete elimination of the
effects of the star's diurnal motion, and of refraction, advantages
which        it
         shares in common with Fraunhofer’s method.   It pos
sesses, moreover, the additional recommendations of requiring
only one observer, and of dispensing with the necessity of illu
minating either the field or the wires of the telescope. Those
who have had any experience of the difficulty attending observa
tions of faint spectra will appreciate the value of this last pro
perty.

LVIII. A             Trifle     on    Projectiles. By J. J. SylvesTER, Professor
                  of Mathematics         at the Royal Military Academy”.
 IN solution
     teaching the subject of projectiles in vacuo, the following
             has presented itself to me of a question not wholly
 without practical interest, viz. of determining the angle of projec
 tion to give the best range in the most general case, viz. when a
 gun is fired upon a slope at a given vertical height above the slope.
 The solution is not wholly either without theoretical interest in
 point of method, as leading to a result of some little complexity
 in maxima and minima by very simple calculations, and without
 the aid of the differential calculus. Therefore          venture to sub     I
 mit it to the readers of the Philosophical Magazine. In the
 next Number of the Magazine                              I

and sodium, converted both ultramarines when gently heated into
red ultramarine.  Green ultramarines, when not acted upon by
strong agents, had always a tendency to pass into blue.
   The same subject has been ably investigated by Breunlin, an
abridgment of whose paper will appear in next month’s Magazine.
   With a view of obtaining an easy method for the preparation
of fluoride of sodium, which might serve as a useful material for
the preparation of fluorine compounds in general, Briegleb in
vestigated the action of phosphate of soda on fluor-spar.    The
two substances, mixed together in the proper proportions, were
fused in a Hessian crucible, and the fused mass poured on an
iron plate. The last parts poured out of the crucible were com
posed of a mass of small crystals. These were insoluble in water,
and on examination were found to be apatite.     This formation
of apatite has been already observed by Manross. The fused
mass was boiled with water for some time; some fluoride of
sodium was obtained, but it bore no adequate proportion to the
quantity that the theory required. An attempt to produce fluo
ride of potassium in this way gave still less favourable results.
   When, instead of extracting the fused mass with boiling water,
itwas digested with water on the water-bath for some days, and
the liquid thus obtained filtered and evaporated, beautiful trans
parent octahedrons were obtained. These proved to be a double
salt of phosphate of soda and fluoride of sodium,_
                      3NaO, PO"--NaF4-24HO.
This salt may also be obtained by digesting for several days at a
moderate heat, finely powdered cryolite with a solution of phos
phate of soda and caustic soda.
   An attempt to produce potash and ammonia salts correspond
ing to the above gave negative results. '
   A double salt of arseniate of soda and fluoride of sodium is
obtained by fusing arseniate of soda and fluor-spar. To this,

simple method     determining the nitrates. This

March Number of the Annales de Chimie et de Physique. When
a solution of nitrate is mixed with excess of a solution of proto
chloride of iron and boiled, a portion of the iron is oxidized, and
at the same time a mixture of deutoxide of nitrogen and hydro
chloric acid is disengaged.    M. Ville found that when deutoxide
of nitrogen, mixed with excess of hydrogen, was passed over
spongy platinum heated to redness, the whole of the nitrogen is
converted into ammonia, and this may be estimated by a stand
ard solution. This method is applicable even where the nitrate
is mixed with considerable quantities of organic matter.      It can
be used for the determination of mitrates where the     quantity   of
nitrogen does not exceed a centigramme; but when a larger
quantity of nitrate is employed, losses are sustained which vitiate
the results. Coke washed with hydrochloric acid and calcined
in close vessels, Stenhouse's platinized charcoal, and spongy iron
may be substituted for the spongy platinum.

                            M. Béchamp          on Pyroxyline.
   M. Ville describes a very convenient apparatus for obtaining
a regular  supply of hydrogen or sulphuretted hydrogen, which
is a modification of Döbereiner’s lamp.     He points out, that
in the fundamental reaction (that of protochloride of iron on a
nitrate) a method of nitrogen determinations, similar in execu
tion and principle to that of Dumas, may be formed. The
deutoxide of nitrogen is passed over copper-turnings, and the
nitrogen estimated as such. But this is much less general and
less certain than the others.
    In the same journal M. Béchamp has a paper on Pyroxy
line.   He considers pyroxyline or gun-cotton as a compound of
cellulose, in which 5 equivs. HO are replaced by 5 equivs. NO”:
 C*H17 O'75NO", and names it pentanitrocellulose.           He had
found   before,  that the action of ammoniacal     gas gave  rise to
a new compound, ternitropyrowyline,     C*H'70'73NO2. By the
 action of caustic potash on a solution in aether and alcohol of
pyroxyline, he obtained an intermediate product, tetranitropyroxy
line, C20H17 O’4NO3.        These three nitro-compounds of cellu
lose differ not only in their definite composition, and in the cir
cumstances of their formation, but also in many of their proper
ties, as the action of solvents, that of reagents, and that of heat,
    The action of caustic potash on pyroxyline in the presence of
water is different. The final product is in this case sugar. There
are intermediate stages in the reaction, but they are not very
distinctly marked. The quantity of sugar could not be ascer
tained, for a great part of it is decomposed into apoglucic and
other acids.
    Sulphurous acid is without action on pyroxyline. Sulphuretted
hydrogen acts, but the products formed are not definite. When
pyroxyline is introduced into a strong solution of protochloride
of iron, the iron is peroxidized,                all
                                       the nitrogen      evolved  is         as

From the reproduced cotton, gun-cotton                      was prepared.
                                                                             By

may    be produced from the nitro-compounds formed                 by
                                                            the action

from the nitric aethers     general.  in
   There are two distinct series    nitro-compounds; that
                                           of                   which   of
nitrobenzine and    analogous    bodies are the   types, and that            of

by NO"; and in the last, HO is replaced by NO”. By the action
of ferrous acetate on the first,                         all

In  the case      of

contraction, and have measured this increase.
   A  muscle which contracts, absorbs, while          contraction, much.   in                        a
greater quantity           of

    carbonic acid and     azote, than does the same muscle             state                       in  a
    repose.       Apart             of
                            the carbonic acid exhales          the air, the              in
muscle imbibes the other part, which puts               stop      successive    a             to

that the oxygen which furnishes the carbonic acid exists in the

Joule, Thomson, &c., the chemical action which is transformed,

therefore        been able              to   measure the theoretical work due                                       to   the
oxygen consumed, taking the numbers which             had found for                         I

the real work which      obtained   is measuring the weight which by
a muscle       contraction can raise
                 in                         certain height, and the     to   a

somewhat greater than the second, and the heat developed by
contraction ought                       be
                         admitted among the causes
                                   to                   this slight                                   of
difference: these two numbers are therefore sufficiently        ac                                                  in
cordance with each other.

And if we assume k properly, z+kp may be made to touch the
multiplier of p, i.e. the multiplier may be made to take the form
                  —u<U+017F>z-kp)*+p((z+kp)p-Ho").
From the symmetry which reigns between a and y, it is obvious
à priori that any value of k which is rightly assumed for the
object in view will make o (when z is eliminated from it by means
of the equation z+kp=0) a multiple either of w—y or a +y;
the latter obviously cannot be true, since such values would make
the given cubic a function of a + y and 2 ; the proper values of
k will therefore make r—y=0, from which, combined with the
equation 2a"+2°+6ma”z=0, the values of a y:z may be deter
mined. These will be three in number; and as we may write,
instead of w and y, par, pºy, or py, pºa, we obtain three sets of
three points, corresponding to p being taken a +y+2m2; and
consequently, by interchanging 2 with w and with y successively,
we obtain altogether three systems of three sets of three points
each; any such factor as a +y+2m2 is a tangent to a point of
inflexion, and it is clear a priori that if the cubic is put under
the form w”--v(uw--o°), since                     v-0
                                       make w”=0, w can only be
a tangent at an inflexion.   Hence the nine sets of three points
just assigned are       is all
                      that can    found enjoying the property

Mr. Kiernan describes and figures anastomoses between branches
of the biliary ducts in the left triangular ligament of the human
liver.  The same author considered that the interlobular ducts ana
stomosed with each other, and communicated with a lobular biliary
plexus, although he had never succeeded in injecting this plexus to
the extent shown in his figure, neither had he directly observed the
anastomoses between interlobular ducts.      It must be borne in mind
that these observations were made before the liver-cells had been
described.
    Since the appearance of Mr. Kiernan's paper, various hypothetical
views have been advanced by different observers, with reference to
the arrangement of the minute biliary ducts and the relation which
the liver-cells bear to them. These points, however, have not yet

been decided by actual observation.
    Müller considered that the ducts terminated in blind extremities.
Weber showed that the right and left hepatic ducts anastomosed by
the intervention of branches in the transverse fissure of the liver,
 which he described under the name of Vasa aberrantia.
    Krukenberg, Schröder Van der Kolk, Retzius, Theile, Backer,
 Leidy and others have adopted the view that the liver-cells      within             lie
a   network      of
                 basement membrane.     On the other hand, Handfield
 Jones and Kölliker describe the liver-cells      forming     solid net
                                                              as                a

                                               of
 tremities    the ducts impinge, while Handfield Jones holds that the
                of
ducts terminate             by
                       blind extremities.                -

has a distinct fibrous capsule of its own, and is separated from
its neighbours by the branches of the vessels and duct for their
supply.
    The lobules of the liver of other animals are not thus separated
from each other, but the capillary network and the cell-containing
network of one lobule are respectively connected with those of the
adjacent lobules at certain points between the fissures in which the
vessels and duct lie.          In these livers there is not a trace of fibrous
tissue between the lobules.

 liver is now placed in soft cloths to soak up the water, and after
 some hours it will be found to have diminished much in volume, and
 to have a clayey consistence. The ducts are now empty, and may
  be injected with a carefully prepared prussian-blue injection, to
  which a little alcohol has been previously added.      The mixture is
  to be well stirred, and after having been carefully strained, it is
  slowly and cautiously injected into the duct.      Plain clear size is
  next thrown into the portal vein, until the liver has become fully
  distended with it in every part,    Lastly, a little plain size is                            in
 jected into the duct, the vessels carefully tied, and the liver placed
 in cold water until the size has set, when very thin sections can be
readily obtained with the aid of a sharp knife.    The author has tried
many other plans of injection, but the above has afforded the most
satisfactory results.   On one occasion a human liver was success
fully injected with four different colours; the portal vein with flake
white, the artery with vermilion, the duct with prussian blue, and
the hepatic vein with lake.
  Evidence       of the     existence of a tubular basement membrane                      in which
                               the liver-cells are contained.
    Not unfrequently liver-cells are set free with shreds of delicate
membrane attached to them, and this can sometimes be seen to be
prolonged either way in the form of a narrow tube.
    In certain specimens which have been exposed for some time to
the action of dilute soda, the walls of the cells appear to be dis
solved and the tubes are seen to be occupied with a highly refractive
mass, and their outline is rendered very distinct.
    When portions of the cell-containing network are placed in strong
syrup or glycerine, exosmose of the water occurs, the diameter of
the tubes is much diminished, and their outline becomes distinct,
but uneven, in consequence of     -

   In the foetus, the cells are seen to be separated from the cavity of
the vessels by two lines separated by a clear space.     One of these
lines is caused by the outline of the tube containing the cells, the
 other is that of the capillary wall.
   The author supposes that, originally, the liver is composed of a
double network of tubes (cell-containing network and capillary net
work), the walls of which in most situations become incorporated,
so that the secreting cells are only separated from the blood by one
thin layer of basement membrane, which is very permeable to water
in both directions, but the greatest force which can be applied with
out causing rupture is incapable of forcing bile through                               it.

  In    some  animals these communications are so numerous, that a
complete network is formed at the portal aspect of the lobule, or
around a small branch of the portal vein.
   Not only are the right and left hepatic ducts connected together
by intermediate branches in the transverse fissure of the liver, as
E. H. Weber long ago demonstrated, but the branches coming off
from these communicate with each other as well as with the trunks
from which they come off. These branches are very numerous, and
form an intimate network of irregular branched ducts.                   Similar
communications occur between the branches in the portal canals,
but they are not so numerous. This arrangement occurs to a less
extent in the dog and in the calf, but it is not present in           animals.                  all

   lobules.      In most Mammalia, but not in the pig, a few of the finest
   branches of the duct can be followed for some distance beneath the
   surface of the lobule.        These branches appear to lie amongst the
   secreting cells, but are not connected with them. They become
   continuous with tubes of the cell-containing network at a deeper
   part, while those secreting tubes nearer the surface of the lobule are
    connected with branches of the duct which do not penetrate.
         In many animals, particularly in the rabbit, and to a less extent
    in man and in the dog, the smallest branches of the duct are con
    nected together so as to form a network, which is continuous with
    that in which the secreting cells lie.
         In the pig, the small ducts are, as it were, applied to the surface
    of the lobule; from these smaller branches come off, which pene
    trate the lobule and are immediately connected with an intimate
    network, which lies partly in the capsule of the lobule itself.          This
    network is continuous with, and may be looked upon as the most
    superficial portion of, the cell-containing network.            In a perfectly
    normal state it contains      only   oil-globules  and granular   matter; but
     when the liver is    fatty, it is found to contain liver-cells loaded with
     oil. From such a liver the author has a very beautiful preparation,
     in which the continuity of the very narrow duct with the wide tubes
     of the network, distended with large cells containing oil, can be well
     seen.     The duct and the tubes in which the secreting cells lie, both
      contain a little injection.
          The author has succeeded in demonstrating the communication
rº   between the ducts and cell-containing network in several mamma
     lian animals, as well as in the human subject, by injecting the ducts
     in the manner described. Of these, the seal, hedgehog, rabbit and
      Guinea-pig have afforded the best specimens.
          In Birds, the continuity in injected specimens has been traced in
      the common fowl and in the turkey.            The quantity of epithelium in
      the ducts of birds forms a     great   obstacle to the passage of the injec
      tion, and from their extreme tenuity, the capillaries do not bear the
      preliminary injection of much water.
          Reptiles.—The author has seen the continuity between the ducts
      and cell-containing network, in an uninjected preparation of the
º     newt's liver, and in an injected liver of the adder.
          Fishes.—In consequence of the very fatty nature of the liver of
      fishes, it was found to be very difficult to harden it sufficiently to
      cut thin sections. The frequent presence of entozoa and their ova,
      renders it difficult to inject the ducts.         The author succeeded in
      injecting the ducts and part of the cell-containing network in the
      sturgeon and in the Lophius, and in one instance, those of the very
      fatty liver of the cod. The continuity was also traced in an unin
      jected liver of the common flounder.           The injection often passes a
      certain distance into the finer ducts of fishes, but cannot be forced
      into the cell-containing network.           In this way the appearance of
      blind terminations to the ducts is produced, as the continuity of
      the tube cannot be traced beyond the point at which the injection
       stops.

   The secreting cells appear to occupy the entire cavity of the tube,
and are not arranged in any order; so that the secretion, having
escaped from the cells, must pass off towards the duct by the slight
interstices between them.       A similar disposition of the secreting
epithelial cells occurs, but in a less remarkable degree, in some other
glands; as the pancreas, lacteal, sebaceous, and sweat glands.
   The conclusions to which the author has arrived may be summed
up as      follows:–
      That the liver of vertebrate animals essentially consists of two
     1.
solid tubular networks mutually adapted to each other.         One of
these networks contains the liver-cells, and the other the blood.
   2. The cell-containing network is continuous with the ducts.
The small delicate epithelial cells lining the latter channels contrast
remarkably with the large secreting cells, which are not arranged

    remainder of the very interesting and important experiments which
    have been entrusted to me,       that portion of the whole, namely,
    which relates especially to centrifugal pumps. I have also to state,
    that if my engagements permit, I should be desirous of proceeding
    with a renewed and more extended set of experiments on the fric
    tion of discs, with an apparatus depending on the same leading
    principle as that which I have already used,—a principle which on
    trial has been found remarkably well suited for the desired purpose.
    For the attainment of greater accuracy and of a wider range of the
    experiments, it seems to me that no better method of procedure
    could be adopted, than to follow the same leading principles, with
    an apparatus of rather more refined construction, involving such
    improvements in details as have been suggested by the experience
    gained in the course of the experiments already made, and for the
    sake of greater steadiness of motion, worked by steam power instead
    of the hand of an operator. Should I have it in my power to con
    duct this renewed set of experiments, a detailed account of them
    will be preferable to a detailed account of those already made.
       In respect to the experiments on Centrifugal Pumps, I have to
    say that I have prepared plans for an experimental apparatus on
    principles which I consider are peculiarly well suited for the attain
    ment of useful and accurate results, and that I intend to proceed
    with the experiments as soon as my engagements shall permit.
       I have further to state, that from the Experimental Fund of £50
    granted by the Royal Society, the entire outlay as yet incurred has
    been £6 5s. 9d., leaving a balance of £43 14s. 3d. for the more
    extended experiments yet remaining to be made.

until the crystal being gradually carried round, attained that position
 at which any additional torsion-force would cause it to advance sud
 denly and considerably; this position was called the upsetting point :
 then left-handed torsion was put on until the like point was attained
in the opposite side: the amount of the revolution of the torsion-index
 from one upsetting point to the other, minus the angle between the
 upsetting points, was considered as the measure of the set of the
 crystal under the constant magnetic force employed.
    As the setting force of a crystal remained constant for any sur
rounding medium, it was evidently possible to select a crystal and a
 medium such, that in one position the crystal would be attracted,
 and in another, at right angles to the first, be repelled in the
 same medium.        This case was realized with the paramagnetic red
 ferroprussiate of potassa and a solution of sulphate of iron, and also
 with the diamagnetic crystal carbonate of lime and diluted alcohol.
 A crystal was sought for amongst the ferrocarbonates of lime having
 this relation to the assumed natural zero presented by a vacuum or
 carbonic acid; but this case was not realized.
    § 39. Action of heat on magnecrystals.--When                magnecrystals,
 subjected to the same constant magnetic force, were raised or lowered
 to different temperatures, it was found that the setting force was
 affected; and at                all
                            temperatures from 0°F. upwards the force
 diminished        the temperature became higher.

distances of above a thousand miles, and of course spreading over
the whole intermediate space, to a thickness sometimes of 10 or 12
feet at more than twenty-five miles from the volcano, would amply
account for the dispersion, by explosive eruptions, of the contents of
the largest craters ever observed.                                         -
    At the same time the author guards himself from being supposed
to have ever denied that some amount of elevation has taken place
in the external cone of a volcano through the occasional injection of
lava from within into rents broken across its framework, and hard
ened into dykes, which may be called a process of gradual disten
sion.   This, in fact, was suggested by him in 1824. All he con
tends   against  is the theory of Von Buch, that volcanic mountains
are the result of the elevation of nearly horizontal beds of lava and
conglomerates by some sudden expansion.            He maintains, on the
contrary, that the growth of a volcano by accretion, through erup
tive ejections on the exterior, and partial distension from within, is
a gradual, though intermittent,         normal process, which may be
watched almost like the growth of a tree.
   The author next referred to the opinion published by him in
1824, that the liquidity of the stony and crystalline lavas (excluding
the vitreous varieties) at the time of their protrusion, is owing, not
to complete fusion, but to the entanglement between their com
ponent granular or crystalline particles of some fluid, chiefly water,
at an intense heat of course, but unvaporized by reason of the ex
treme pressure to which they are subjected while beneath the earth,
and escaping in vast bubbles of steam, when, by the opening of a
                           its
                         discharge      permitted, and also                                by
                                                                                                         as of
fissure of escape,                                 is               kind                        a
exudation   through   the  pores  and crevices       the expelled lavas     of
they cool.
   The author originally extended this theory          the combination         of                        of
aqueous with igneous agency          lavas be in

                  considered       derived from mass existing beneath

  About Wretham, six miles north        Thetford, are several meres,
or small matural sheets   water, without any outlet.
                                            of         One    these,                                      of
about        48
         acres    extent, has been lately drained
                              in                      machinery, for                         by

 the purpose of obtaining the black peaty mud forming the bottom,
 and using it as manure.     This black mud is in parts above 20 feet
 in  depth, and  may  be described as vegetable matter in a more com
plete state of decomposition than ordinary peat.          At a depth of
 about 15 feet in this  peaty  deposit occurs a distinct horizontal layer
 of compressed   but undecayed   moss,  from 2 to 6 inches thick. The
 moss is sufficiently well preserved to be recognized as the Hypnum.
fluitans, common in bogs and pools throughout the British Isles, and
often growing in dense masses in shallow water.     The bed of moss
is of considerable extent, though not occurring everywhere within
the area of the mere. While wet and fresh it is of a bright rusty
red colour, and turns to a yellow-brown when dry. Numerous horns
of the Red Deer were found in the peat above the moss-bed, and
seldom at a greater depth than 5 or 6 feet from the surface; many
of the antlers were of large size, and some appeared to have been
cut with a saw. The black peaty mud beneath the moss is identical
with the upper portion, and rests on a light grey sandy marl. No
 shells were observed; but trunks of trees, probably birch and oak,
 are found. Local seams of sand occur, and occasional stones of flint
and quartz, resembling the gravel of the country.    Numerous posts
of oak-wood, shaped and pointed, were also found standing erect,
and covered up by the peat. From the above facts it appears that,
a great part of the upper peaty mud having been accumulated before
the Red Deer became extinct in this part of England, the moss-bed
must consequently have been formed at least some centuries ago;
and that, although the few mosses experimented upon by Dr. Lindley
decomposed rapidly, yet the aquatic mosses, judging from the fossil
bed of moss above described, are not rapidly destroyed by exposure
to moisture, and that some other explanation must be sought for to
account for the great want of Musci in the strata deposited in former
geological periods.

    The ore contains no metal precipitable by sulphuretted hydrogen
from the hydrochloric acid solution.
    In the residue insoluble in hydrochloric acid, minute, bright, black
crystals were detected, which were proved to contain titanium, and
were supposed to be anatase. Prof. Miller of Cambridge has been
able to measure certain of the angles, and found them to be
identical with similar angles of anatase.                        The discovery of this
mineral in the Cleveland ore is at least a point of considerable mine
ralogical interest, and may possibly furnish some additional indica
tion of the nature of the rock from which it was derived.
    The silica in the insoluble residue exists, it will have been ob
served, in two states, about two-thirds being soluble in dilute caustic
potash, and one-third insoluble in that solvent. The rounded white
particles, which, according to Bowerbank, have a truly oolitic or con
centric concretionary structure, are entirely formed of the soluble silica.
    The silica which existed in the hydrochloric acid solution was that
which was present in a state of combination in the ore, probably
with both protoxide and peroxide of iron; and the peculiar greenish
grey colour of the ore was doubtless due to the presence of this sili
cate of the mixed oxides of iron, just as the colour of the green par
ticles in the so-called greensand is believed to be due to the like cause.
   The proportion of phosphoric acid in the ore is comparatively
large, and may be easily accounted for by the fossiliferous character
of the ore. The quality of the iron smelted from this ore would cer
tainly be very sensibly affected by the proportion of phosphorus, and
probably also by the silica existing in a state of combination.

By the Rev. R. H. Cobbold.                Forwarded from the Foreign Office.
   The coal is worked by shafts and galleries in the hills near E-u, a
third-class city, in the prefecture of King-hua, from which it is
distant forty English miles by water. The pits are from 300 to 500
feet deep.     The coal is bright, and not bituminous.

   April 4, 1856.-" On the Measurement of the Chemical Action
of Light.”     By Henry E. Roscoe, Esq., B.A., Ph.D.
   No attempt has been made, up to the present time, accurately to
measure the changes brought about in chemical                        -   substances by the
action of the solar rays.
   The peculiar action of light on chemical bodies was first ob
served by Scheele on chloride of silver.                           Since that time the
subject of the chemical action of light has attracted a large amount
of attention, as the present perfection of the arts of the daguerreo
typist and photographer fully testify.                       Although we possess so

                             Royal Institution.                                       483
many facts concerning the chemical action of light, this branch of
science has only as yet arrived at that first or qualitative stage of
development, through which every science must pass.                   The laws
which    regulate  these phaenomena      are unknown to    us, and we possess
no means of accurately measuring the amount of the decomposition
effected by the light.
    The speaker proceeded to describe the results of a series of
experiments carried on by him in conjunction with Professor Bun
sen, which had for their object,-
    1. To determine the laws which regulate the chemical action of light;
    2. To obtain a measure for the chemically active rays.
    When aqueous solutions of chlorime, bromine, or iodine are ex
posed (under certain conditions) to the direct solar rays they are
decomposed, the corresponding hydracid being formed, and the oxy
gen of the water liberated.         The difference between the amounts of
free chlorine, bromine, or iodine, contained in the liquid before and
after exposure to light, gives the quantity of the substance decom
 posed during the isolation.         Now it was found that this quantity of
 chlorine, bromine, or iodine which disappeared, was not proportional
 to the time of exposure to the light; in twice the time, for instance,
 less than twice as much substance was decomposed.                The relation
 between the amount of light and the amount of decomposition was
 found in this case not to be a simple one.
     This anomalous action may be explained even from a theoretical
 point of view. Chemical affinity is the resultant of                    all
                                                                      the forces
 which come into play during the reaction; hence               it not only the
                                                                    is
 interchanging atoms which influence the result, but also those atoms
 which, without taking part            inthe decomposition, surround those
 actively engaged. The so-called catalytic phaenomena show this
 action  ina   striking manner. To apply this general principle               the     to
  special case before us; we have           begin with pure chlorine water;

  different result must     be expected.     This theoretical conclusion was

the amount of action is directly proportional to the time of eaposure.
   The relation between the amount of action and the amount of
light was experimentally determined, by allowing known quantities
of diffuse light to fall upon the sensitive gas.          Experiments thus
conducted showed that the amount of action is          directly proportional
to the amount or intensity of the light.           These simple relations

cated nature, from the numerous causes which conduce to the general
effect.
    The apparatus employed in these researches consists of 1. dia
phragms of porous porcelain, or little bags of sail-cloth, each con
taining a depolarized plate of gold or platinum, surrounded by
charcoal of sugar-candy, with a view to rendering the electrical
effects constant during a few moments in order to measure them ;
2. tangent compasses of great delicacy, adapted for experiments of
this nature; 3. atmospheric electrometers destined to the collection
of the electricity of vapours formed above the soil or the water; and
4. various accessories,—amongst others conducting wires of copper,
gold and platinum covered with gutta percha, &c.
    I have said that the electrical effects produced by the contact of
the soil and water are complex, for they vary in direction and inten
sity according to the substances which compose the soil, or which
are dissolved in the water; for the production of electrical effects, it
is necessary that there should be a heterogeneity between the water
of the river and that by which the soil is moistened. When the
waters are slightly alkaline they are negative; when they are acid,
as is the case with the earth of heaths, they are positive. The well
waters of Paris often present effects of this kind, in consequence of
the infiltration of drainage waters, which change in nature from time
to time; thus in the course of a month the electrical effects are seen
to change in intensity and sign, without any derangement of the
apparatus. From this state of things it results that sometimes there
are no electrical effects, as is also the case in experimenting with the
water of a river and its sandy banks, or the adjacent lands which
are washed during inundations.         It is necessary to establish per
manent observations to follow all the variations to which the actions
of contact are subject, and to be on one's guard against the effects
 of polarization, which are always to be found in operating only for a
 few moments.       Very commonly the polarization is destroyed in the
 course of   twenty-four   hours, and the effects of which we are in
 search  may   then be observed. In some exceptional cases the elec
 trical current has sufficient intensity to cause the action of a needle
 telegraph at a distance of several kilometres.
     When water evaporates, either from a stream or from the earth,
 it must necessarily carry off with it an excess of electricity of the
 same nature possessed by the one or the other, and this becomes
 diffused in the atmosphere; this electricity may arise not only from
 the reaction of the water of the river upon that with which the soil
 is moistened, but also from the decomposition of organic matter.
 In the latter case the electricity is always positive, whether it arises
 from the river or from the soil; in the former the two vapours are of
 contrary signs; the effects are complex.
     From the foregoing it will be understood why storms generally
 take place in summer, at that period of the year when the decom
 position of organic matters and evaporation are at their maximum,
 and also why they are so frequent and so violent under the tropics
 at the period when the sun approaches the zenith. This is so true,
 that in those regions there is always a storm bursting at each instant
 in a locality suitably placed in relation to the sun.

   The    phaenomena to which I have just referred are so varied, that
it is indispensable, before formulating general principles, to multiply
experiments in a place serving as a permanent observatory, then in
flat countries and amongst mountains, on the margins of rivers and
water-courses, and on the sea-shore, in countries like Holland,
where there are large alluvial tracts, in salt-marshes, &c. Then,
and then only shall we be able to judge of the importance of the
subject with which I am occupied, and which is connected with one

   This mineral has lately been frequently referred to.                  It forms
larger or smaller roundish lumps, coated with a yellowish-gray earth,
and consisting internally of an aggregation of fine silky needles,
amongst which yellowish crystals of Glauberite (NaO, SO3+CaO, SO3)
sometimes occur.    In other respects the substance is quite pure and
homogeneous.
   The powder dissolves with difficulty in boiling water, and the
solution has an alkaline reaction.            It is soluble in acids, even in the

stone near Ober-Langenau, Bohemia.          These coprolites are richer
in organic matter (sometimes as much as 7403 per cent.) than any
other at present known.       Treated with aether, they give a rather
considerable quantity of a greasy liquid matter, of disagreeable smell.
 Other coprolites have in the course of time been deprived of a large
proportion of their organic matter by decomposition, or by mecha
nical agents; those, however, under notice have suffered but little
alteration in quantity and quality, owing probably to the circum
stance that they have been quickly enveloped with inorganic matter,
and in this way secured from the action of water and air.      Every one
of these   coprolites is surrounded with a concretion of      magnesian
limestone, segregated from the imbedding rock.        These concretions
likewise contain nitrogenous organic matter, sometimes to the amount
of 36'56 per cent. This matter may be supposed to have originated
from the decomposition of numerous fishes, the remains of which are
frequently found preserved in the concretions.
    This considerable deposit of organic matter, besides        scientific                                               its

A connexion       between the taking-in of nourishment and the de
velopment of force did not make itself apparent.                The nourish
ment seemed only necessary to grease, as it were, the wheelwork
of the animal machine, to replace what was used up, and to renew
the old. The development of force out of itself seemed to be
the essential peculiarity, the real quintessence of organic life.
If,  therefore, men were                constructed,

The similarity with the philosopher's stone sought                 the ancient                   to by

  our watches by means of the tension of springs. A weight
  which lies on the ground, an elastic spring which is without ten
  sion, can produce no effects: to obtain such we must first raise
  the weight or impart tension to the spring, which is accom
  plished when we wind up our clocks and watches.                    The man
  who winds the clock or watch communicates to the weight
  or to the spring a certain amount of power, and exactly so
  much as is thus communicated is gradually given out again
  during the following twenty-four hours, the original force being
 thus slowly consumed to overcome the friction of the wheels and
 the resistance which the pendulum encounters from the air. The
  wheelwork of the clock therefore exhibits no working force which
 was not previously communicated to                   but simply distributes      it,

 Here the question of a perpetual motion remained open; the
 decision of this question marks the progress of modern physics,
 regarding which I promised to address you.
    In the case of the air-gun, the work to be accomplished in the
 propulsion of the ball was given by the arm of the man who
 pumped in the air. In ordinary firearms, the condensed mass
 of air which propels the bullet is obtained in a totally differ
 ent manner, namely by the combustion of the powder.              Gun
powder is transformed by combustion for the most part into
 gaseous products, which endeavour to occupy a much greater
space than that previously taken up by the volume of the powder.
Thus you see, that, by the use of gunpowder, the work which
the human arm must accomplish in the case of the air-gun is
spared.                                   -
   In the mightiest of our machines, the steam-engine, it is a
strongly compressed aeriform body, water vapour, which, by its
effort to expand, sets the machine in motion.         Here also we do
not condense the steam by means of an external mechanical
force, but by communicating heat to a mass of water in a closed
boiler, we change this water into steam, which, in consequence
of the limits of the space, is developed under strong pressure.
In this case, therefore, it is the heat communicated which gene
rates the mechanical force.       The heat thus necessary for the
machine we might obtain in many ways: the ordinary method is
to procure it from the combustion of coal.
   Combustion is a chemical process.         A particular constituent
of our   atmosphere,  oxygen,  possesses a  strong force of attraction,
or, as it is named in chemistry, a strong affinity for the consti
tuents of the combustible body, which affinity, however, in most
cases can only exert itself at high temperatures.        As soon as a
portion of the combustible body, for example the coal, is suffi
ciently heated, the carbon unites itself with great violence to the
oxygen of the atmosphere and forms a peculiar gas, carbonic
acid, the same which we see foaming from beer and champagne.
By this combination light and heat are generated: heat is gene
rally developed by any combination of two bodies of strong affi
nity for each other; and when the heat is intense enough, light
appears.     Hence in the steam-engine it is chemical processes
and chemical forces which produce the astonishing work of these
machines. In like manner the combustion of gunpowder is a
chemical process, which in the barrel -    of the gun communicates
living force to the bullet.
   While now the steam-engine developes for us mechanical work
out of heat, we can conversely generate heat by mechanical
forces.    A skilful blacksmith can render an iron wedge red-hot
by hammering. The axles of our carriages must be protected

by careful greasing from ignition through friction.           Even lately
this property    has been   applied   on a  large  scale.   In some fac
tories, where a surplus of water power is at hand, this surplus is
applied to cause a strong iron plate to rotate swiftly upon another,
so that they become strongly heated by the friction.             The heat
so obtained warms the room, and thus a stove without fuel
is provided. Now could not the heat generated by the plates
be applied to a small steam-engine, which in              turn should                   its                    be

498     Prof. Helmholtz on the Interaction                        of Natural          Forces.
   Starting from each of these different manifestations of natural
forces, we can set every other in motion, for the most part not
in one way merely, but in many ways. It is here as with the -
weaver’s    web,-
                 Where a step stirs a thousand threads,
                 The shuttles shoot from side to side,
                 The fibres flow unseen,
                 And one shock strikes a thousand combinations*.
   Now it is clear that if by any means we could succeed, as the
above American professed to have done, by mechanical forces,
to excite chemical, electrical, or other natural processes, which,
by any circuit whatever, and without altering permanently the
active masses in the machine, could produce mechanical force in
greater quantity than that at first applied, a portion of the work
thus gained might be made use of to keep the machine in mo
tion, while the rest of the work might be applied to any other
purpose whatever.    The problem was to find, in the complicated
met of  reciprocal actions, a track through chemical, electrical,
magnetical, and thermic processes, back to mechanical actions,
which might be followed with a final gain of mechanical work:
thus would the perpetual motion be found.
   But, warned by the futility of former experiments, the public
had become wiser. On the whole, people did not seek much after
combinations which promised to furnish a perpetual motion, but
the question was inverted. . It was no more asked, How can                                           I
make use of the known and unknown relations of natural forces
so as to construct a perpetual motion ? but it was asked,          a                            If
perpetual motion be impossible, what are the relations which
must subsist between natural forces? Everything was gained by
this inversion of the question. The relations of natural forces ren
dered necessary by the above assumption, might be easily and
completely stated.     It was found that        known relationsof all                            of
forces harmonize with the consequences        that assumption, and
a series    of
             unknown relations were discovered       the same time,     at
the correctness       be of
                    which remained         proved.   to   single one
                                                          be             If   a
of them could       proved false, then perpetual motion would
                                                     a                                               be
possible.
   The first who endeavoured       travel this way was
                                                to         French                     a
man named Carnot,       the year 1824.

of heat, which led him                to
                           some erroneous   conclusions,  his expe
riment was not  quite  unsuccessful. He discovered       law which                a
now bears his name, and      which    will return further on.

is not, as was formerly imagined, a fine imponderable substance,
but that, like light, it is a peculiar shivering motion of the ulti
mate particles of bodies.     In collision and friction, according to
this manner of   viewing   the subject, the motion of the mass of a
 body which is apparently lost is converted into a motion of the
 ultimate particles of the body; and conversely, when mechanical
 force is generated by heat, the motion of the ultimate particles
 is converted into a motion of the mass.
     Chemical combinations generate heat, and the quantity of this
 heat is totally independent of the time and steps through which
the combination has been effected, provided that other actions
 are not at the same time brought into play.                however, mecha       If,

    the earth, after having been thus brought to rest, should fall
    into the sun, which of course would be the case, the quantity of
    heat developed by the shock would be 400 times greater.
       Even now from time to time such a process is repeated on a
    small scale. There can hardly be a doubt that meteors, fireballs,
    and meteoric stones are masses which belong to the universe,
    and before coming into the domain of our earth, moved like the
    planets round the sun. Only when they enter our atmosphere
    do they become visible and fall sometimes to the earth. In
    order to explain the emission of light by these bodies, and the
    fact that for some time after their descent they are very hot, the
    friction was long ago thought of which they experience in pass
    ing through the air. We can now calculate that a velocity of
    3000 feet a second, supposing the whole of the friction to be ex
    pended in heating the solid mass, would raise a piece of meteoric
    iron 1000°C. in temperature, or, in other words, to a vivid red
    heat. Now the average velocity of the meteors seems to be thirty
    or forty times the above amount. To compensate this, however,                      .
    the greater portion of the heat is doubtless carried away by the
    condensed mass of air which the meteor drives before it.      It is
    known that bright meteors generally leave a luminous trail be
    hind them, which probably consists of severed portions of the
    red-hot surfaces.   Meteoric masses which fall to the earth often
    burst with a violent explosion, which may be regarded as a re
    sult of the quick heating. The newly-fallen pieces have been
    for the most part found hot, but not red-hot, which is easily
    explainable by the circumstance, that during the short time occu
    pied by the meteor in passing through the atmosphere, only a
    thin superficial layer is heated to redness, while but a small
    quantity of heat has been able to penetrate to the interior of the
    mass.    For this reason the red heat can speedily disappear.
        Thus has the falling of the meteoric stone, the minute rem
    nant of processes which seem to have played an important part
    in the formation of the heavenly bodies, conducted us to the
    present time, where we pass from the darkness of hypothetical
    views to the brightness of knowledge.       In what we have said,
    however,   allthat   hypothetical
                            is           the  assumption

       called                           We make use of their
action in the production of photographs.    Here compounds of
silver are decomposed at the place where the sun's rays strike
them. The same rays overpower in the green leaves of plants
the strong chemical affinity of the carbon of the carbonic acid
for oxygen, give back the latter free to the atmosphere, and
accumulate the other, in combination with other bodies, as woody
fibre, starch, oil, or resin. These chemically active rays of the
 sun disappear completely as soon as they encounter the green
portions of the plants, and hence it is that in Daguerreotype
images the green leaves of plants appear uniformly black. Inas
much as the light coming from them does not contain the che
mical rays, it is unable to act upon the silver compounds.
   Hence a certain portion of force disappears from the sunlight,
while combustible substances are generated and accumulated in
plants; and we can assume it as very probable, that the former
is the cause of the latter.                      I

   Now we have actually not only one, but several such planets,
which move around the sun, and             their mutual attraction    by
create little changes and disturbances          each other's paths.        in

   But even though the force store of our planetary system is so
immensely great, that by the incessant emission which has oc
curred during the period of human history it has not been sen
sibly diminished, even though the length of the time which must
flow by, before a sensible change in the state of our planetary
system occurs, is totally incapable of measurement, still the
inexorable laws of mechanics indicate that this store of force,
which can only suffer loss and not gain, must be finally ex
hausted.    Shall we terrify ourselves by this thought f Men
are in the habit of measuring the greatness and the wisdom of
the universe by the duration and the profit which it promises to
their own race; but the past history of the earth already shows
what an insignificant moment the duration of the existence of

sword awakes in us the conception of grey antiquity.       What
the museums of Europe show us of the remains of Egypt and
Assyria we gaze upon with silent astonishment, and despair of
being able to carry our thoughts back to a period so remote,
 Still must the human race have existed for ages, and multiplied
itself before the pyramids or Nineveh could have been erected.
 We estimate the duration of human history at 6000 years; but
immeasurable as this time may appear to us, what is it in com

series of rank plants and mighty animals, and no men; during

  The mean monthly amount            Schönbein’s was 1950;                                                                                     by                                                                                                                               by

  The mean daily amount by Schönbein’s was 1.70; by Moffat's
3:83.
   Such results are too plain to require any lengthened com
ments on the relative value of the two ozonometers.
   There can no longer remain a doubt that the papers prepared
by Moffat's formula are more sensitive than those of Schönbein
in the ratio of 2:3 to 1-0. The advantages possessed by the
former have been proved by observations in other localities
besides Bedford.      Mr. Glaisher, in his valuable report on the

 LXVI.          On the Law          of Electric      Discharge.           By Dr. P. RIEss.
     To the Editors            of the -Philosophical Magazine                  and    Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
    the May Number of your Magazine there is a paper of
IN twenty pages, entitled “On General Law of Electric Dis
                                                     a
charge, by Sir W. Snow Harris,” which would necessitate many
observations if all the errors contained in it were to be corrected.
As, however,      this paper possesses rather a personal than a
scientific  interest, I will confine myself to a very few remarks,
which may easily be added to by those familiar with the subject.
    The appearance of the above paper is not to be laid to my
charge.      M. De la Rive, in his most recent English work, has
given in part to my investigations upon electrical heat that con
sideration which they have long enjoyed in German works, and
has not made use of Harris's labours upon the same subject.
That Sir W. Harris should gladly give importance to his own re
searches is of course very natural; but whether he has done it
in a proper manner others may judge. For my own part have                                      I
only to observe, that it does not appear to me to be altogether
just that he should make me answerable for statements which
are not derived from my original works, that he should ascribe
to me “a systematic disparagement” of his scientific labours,
 and lastly, that he should allow himself            359          (p.
                                                              the bottom)       at
to  express     suspicion regarding me. Against the two first pro
                      a
ceedings   I  hereby remonstrate, and his suspicion beg              say     I             to           is
 totally unwarranted.
    The subject which, according          the title, forms the principal

                                     is                          the satis            to
faction      the author. He has long since set
            of                                              law upon the  up   a

whether the formula referred          with the signification
                                                   to        which                                      I

vour to ascertain the latter by experiment.          But most certainly
experiments must be justified by theory, and exactly performed
and described if any weight is to be attached to them.
    Far more irksome to me than this explanation, is the discus
sion of the other portion of the memoir which consists of the
frequently-repeated but unjustified assertion that my own               in
vestigations on heat, by which, at the expense of much time and
trouble,   I  have arrived at simple laws, are nothing more than
mere reproductions of the author's previous experiments.                 It
is quite true, and has been acknowledged by me, that his un
satisfactory and inconclusive experiments were the cause of my
investigations, which were rewarded with a better result. But
the credit of having opened up an investigation, although it is
by no means small, rarely satisfies those who led the way; they
require more, even though they should only acquire it in the
eyes of those who are unacquainted with the subject.               “It   is
a course     by  no means uncommon in the            history  of  physical
science.”
    Sir William Harris had made a great many electrical ex
periments, and from them, without possessing the necessary
knowledge, had deduced numerous results which always re
mained unintelligible to me, as they were often in contradic
tion to well-known facts, and even with the experiments of the
author himself.       I was not aware that any one, either here or
in England, had found these results more intelligible than                I
had done.       Of course, now that my endeavours of many years
have made known the laws of electrical heat, some experiments
out of this mass have become more comprehensible, but it is
 certain that even these experiments, cancelled by other contra
 dictory ones, would never have rendered the discovery of these
laws possible.      Nothing remained for me to do, in the state
ment of my investigations, except to bring the existence of these
experiments to the knowledge of the reader, and then, on my
 own account, to place the subject, which had been confused in
the highest degree, in a clear light. My first memoir on electric
heat (1837) commences with the mention of Harris's most recent
 work, a memoir which the author often quotes, and in which he
had summed up his previous observations *. As besides elec
 trical heat other phaenomena are investigated in this memoir,
 I  gave a complete abstract of it in Dove’s Repertorium der
 Physik, Berlin, 1838, and described the instruments and ex
 periments mentioned therein as exactly as the statements of the
 author enabled me to do. All the results of this memoir which
 I  considered as correct   I have since made use of under the name
 of the author with suitable acknowledgments.

and exactitude    of the experiments, but cannot constitute an
essential difference in the instruments. My claims to the right
of invention appear to be much stronger than those of Sir W.
Harris, for I have introduced changes into the electroscope of
Behrens and Fechner of a much more important nature than
those made by him in Kinnersley’s thermometer, but never
entertained a thought of describing the improved electroscope
as a new instrument.
   Lastly,  Ihave to remark, that the author's assertion that
Kinnersley only employed his thermometer for the illustration
of the mechanical force of the electrical explosion in the air is
eompletely destitute of foundation.     In 1761 Kinnersley also
made use of his thermometer to test the amount of heat which
the discharge of a Leyden jar “ produced in a strip of wet
writing-paper, a wet flaxen and woollen thread, a blade of green
grass, a filament of green wood, a fine silver thread, a very.
small brass wire and a strip of gilt paper.” It is inconceivable
that Sir W. Harris did not know this, not because it stands in,
one of my memoirs to which he has referred, but because these
experiments are mentioned in a classical English work, Frank
lin’s immortal ‘Experiments and Observations,’ which is cer
tainly the best known and most widely diffused of      the works    all
that have ever been written           on

powder; the darker kinds are looser and velvety.                   Green ultra

with acids; even with dilute acetic acid the colour disappears
more    or  less rapidly. The most beautiful shades are the soonest
decomposed.        Many ultramarines resist the action              acids more         of
emergetically than others; the green are the easiest decomposed.

   When strongly ignited                air, both ultramarines lose their
colour, which becomes first dull and dirty, and then quite disap

a  beaker with      hydrochloric     acid,  and completely decomposed.
   was filtered; silica, sulphur, and                         clay remained
on It
    the  filter, and were washed      out,  and the silica  separated  from
the clay        by
                solution      caustic potash, from which
                                      in                           was sepa                   it
rated      by
            acid, and determined.         The filtrate from the clay, sul
phur and silica was evaporated               dryness, the residue heated,
                                                         to
above 100°      C.,  then moistened with HCl, and digested with
water.     The silica which had been dissolved            hydrochloric acid.   in
remained      behind,   was   filtered,  and estimated along with the
other.
      In
       the filtrate, alumina and oxide          iron were precipitated
                                                                of                                              by
ammonia, and separated from each other                   potash; the lime     by
was  precipitated        oxalateby   ammonia, of and the soda determined
 assulphate          of
                   soda.
   Another portion                   of
                            ultramarine was fused with soda and nitre
in  a platinum crucible; the mass swelled               from the carbonic   up
acid liberated, and became bluish-green, green, and then colour
less.                                                                                                                -
   From the solution    acidulated water, silica was separated
                                       in                                                                       in
the usual manner, and the sulphuric acid determined      sulphate                              as
 ofbaryta. This analysis gave the whole        the sulphur, along
                                                                           as of
with the sulphuric acid contained already     such.
   Another portion was treated with hydrochloric acid, the silica
separated, and      the filtrate sulphuric acid precipitated
                            in                                                                                  by

chloride of barium. The sulphuric acid here obtained is con
tained in undecomposed ultramarine, in combination with lime
as gypsum, which is a never-failing admixture in clay.                  The
quantity of sulphur liberated as sulphuretted hydrogen in the
decomposition of ultramarine by acid was thus estimated.
   In a flask of a litre capacity, about 0.5 grim. ultramarine was
brought, and the flask filled with water. About 10 drops of thin
starch-paste were added, and about 10 to 15 cub. centims. of
strong hydrochloric acid. The blue colour disappeared gradually,
and became finally milky white.          By means of a burette, a solu
tion of 5   grms.   iodine in 1000 cub. centims. water was dropped
in, the mixture being continuously shaken until the charac
teristic colour of the iodine appeared.         The sulphuretted hydro
gen could be estimated to 0-1 cub, centim., for                  quantity            its            in

   The theories          of
                        the constitution                   of
                                               ultramarine have been                                as
various     asthe researches published                          on
                                                  them. One point has
been    agreed  on,  that with the   exception       iron            of
                                                                heavy metal      no
is  contained        ultramarine; but whether the product was
                    in                                                                              a
compound         silica, alumina, soda, and sulphur,
                 of                                             whether the      or
iron united with      sulphur   was the  colouring     principle,  has been
undecided.
   Elsner thinks that small quantity
                                  a               iron          of
                                                            essential     the
                                                                           is                  to
blue   colour,  but        an
                         excess injurious;   and Kressler and Prückner
hold  a   similar opinion.     Guyton Morveau held that the colour
ing principle was sulphide          iron. This opinion has been ex
                                            of
tensively      received.
   Brünner,         on
               the other hand, says that the iron plays      im                             no
portant part, for    mixture  a                  of
                                materials free from iron gave                                       a
blue, the same    that from materials containing iron.
                         as
I     have found that the iron, when present        considerable                in

 532               M. E. Breunlin           on the Constitution               of
 quantity, has an injurious action on the colour.         It was long
 known that silica, soda, and alumina gave, under no circum
 stances, a blue colour; but from the investigations of the che
 mists above mentioned, as well as from the fact that ultramarine
 treated with strong acids lost                 its
                                      colour under evolution       sul                   of
 phuretted hydrogen,       was evident that
                                  it           sulphur  was the most
 essential constituent.
    This has long been partially recognized, and         was assumed       it
 that the  sulphur  was    combination with iron.
                                  in
    Brünner considers that the sulphur          united with the soda,
                                                              is
 partly  as monosulphide        sodium, and partly
                                       of                 sulphate             as             of
 soda.    His view    grounded
                        is                  on
                                     this experiment.
    He took        an
                  ultramarine basis, which was          greenish-blue    of
                                                                          a
 colour, and ignited     several times with carbonate
                             it                             soda and                of
 sulphur,     by
               which the mass became       darker;      then mixed        he                  it
 with finely divided sulphur, and heated          the air. The mass
                                                              it   in
 increased    inweight. The unburnt mass contained 5:198 per
 cent.  sulphur.         By
                        burning,     increased
                                            it      weight 10:16 perin
 cent., and contained after the burning 12.81 per cent, sulphur.
 The increase        weight consisted
                    of                      7-618 per cent. sulphur
                                                      of

   Brünner calculated and found that 20:157 parts         sulphate             of             of
 soda corresponded           to
                          9:039  per cent. oxygen:    subtracted the      he

                       Green and Blue Ultramarine.                                             533
sulphur and 16.91 sodium, which gave 7-084 sodium and 10:337
sulphur, or 17:421 monosulphide of sodium. This arrangement
of the sulphur, sodium, and oxygen has, according to Brünner's
results, some probability, but the 11:306 per cent, sulphuric acid
can scarcely have been found.         Besides, Brünner does not seem
to have noticed, that in the decomposition of ultramarine by
hydrochloric acid sulphur is eliminated, which proves the pre
sence either of a polysulphide or of a hyposulphite of a metal;
while on the supposition of monosulphide of sodium no sulphur
should precipitate, but should                       all

    Elsner and Rammelsberg found that the quantity                sulphur          of
 was far more than sufficient         combine with the iron, and that

LXIX. A     general Construction for finding the maximum Range of

      the last Number of the Philosophical Magazine I read with
IN    much pleasure a communication from Professor Sylvester,
in which he investigates the maximum range of a projectile on
an inclined plane, the point of projection being situated above
the plane. At the end of his article he gives a geometrical Con
struction for finding the elevation for the best range on a hori
zontal plane.
   The following investigation, which gives a general construction
for planes not horizontal, may prove interesting to those readers
of the Philosophical Magazine who feel pleasure in following a

    If eachof the quantities E1, E2, Es, EA be liable to be as great as
107"x   5,  the last term in this expression will be the most im
portant if n be considerably greater than 4. Equating this term to
10-"x5, the greatest allowable error in E, we find
                                                               #
                          10—             (24   x 107),                       n=126 nearly,
                                #=
so that the machine may be worked about 100 times without fresh
setting.
   In #wice the limitation may be even less than this; for it may
happen that A'u, is smaller, perhaps much smaller, than 107"x5,
in which case the limitation will depend upon the absolute value of
A“u, or the possible value 107"x5 of E, as the case may be.
º
Should the restriction arise from the latter cause, we get by equating
the third term in the second member of (4) to 107* x 5, n=392
nearly.                                                                                                                                    -

  “Another machine, whose plans are more advanced than several

order of differences constant (p. 2).
   “I  should be unwilling to terminate this letter without noticing
another class of tables of the greatest importance, almost the whole
of which are capable of being calculated by the method of dif
ferences. I refer to all astronomical tables for calculating the places
of the sun and planets. It is scarcely necessary to observe that the
constituent parts of these are of the form a sin 0.” (p. 5.)

his machine by the late Mr. Baily, published in Schumacher's

  The following communication was read            —
  “On      the Representation of Polyhedra.”      By the Rev. Thomas P.
Kirkman, A.M.
   This paper constituted an addition to the paper by the same
author read June 21, 1855.
   The author observes that to every p-acral q-edron corresponds a
p-dral q-acron, the summits and faces of either having the same order
and rank as to the number of edges with the faces and summits of the
other. When p-q, the corresponding pair will sometimes be iden
tical figures, as to the number, rank, and arrangement of faces and
summits; and at other times, as is always the case if p be not equal
to q, the two figures will differ. When they differ they may be
called a sympolar pair, both being heteropolar; when they form one
and the same figure it may be styled an autopolar polyhedron.     An
elegant way of representing a sympolar pair is deduced from the
two following theorems:—
   A. The q summits of a q-acron are the angles of      a closed polygon
of q sides,  all

    On the Action              of Sulphuric Acid                on the Nitriles and Amides.                   549
      Dec. 13.—Colonel Sabine, R.A., Treas. and V.P., in the Chair.
      The following communication was read:—
      “On the Action of Sulphuric Acid on the Nitriles and on the
    Amides.” By G. B. Buckton and A. W. Hofmann, Ph.D., F.R.S.
      Although the identity of the nitriles with the hydrocyanic ethers
    has been established by the experiments of M. Dumas, who obtained
    them by the action of anhydrous phosphoric acid upon certain am
    moniacal salts, chemists have hitherto in vain sought for a method
    by which a passage might be effected from the nitriles to the general
    alcohol derivatives.
        Our attention has been directed likewise to the same subject, but
    our exertions, like those of our predecessors, have not yet been
    crowned with success. The researches on which we have been
    engaged, have, however, furnished some results which appear to us
    worthy of the interest of chemists, the reactions being at the same
    time remarkable for their neatness and susceptibility of general
    application.

   The author finds that the black-coloured Cryolite, when heated to
a dull redness, loses about 1 per cent. of moisture and acid, and
becomes less translucent; and he considers that the Cryolite was
originally dark-coloured, and that the white and somewhat less
compact and more opaque variety has resulted from the action of
some external cause; possibly, he thinks, in this case the agency of
everlying igneous rocks. Two vertical trap-dykes traverse the cliff
nearby, one on either side of the Cryolite; and, although no such
rocks now overlie the spot in question, the author thinks it quite
probable that the known powerful effects of the atmospheric agencies
in the Greenland climate may have removed all traces of the over
lying eruptive rocks, to the former existence and influence of which
he refers the change of condition seen in the superficial Cryolite.
  2. “Description of remarkable Mineral Veins.”   By Professor
D. T. Ansted, F.R.S., F.G.S.

  This communication was introductory to a series of notices of
remarkable mineral veins, which the author has in contemplation,
and comprised a notice of the Cobre Lode of Santiago de Cuba.
The author commenced his memoir by a brief statement of the sense
in which he used the term “mineral vein,” together with some
remarks on the nature of mineral veins, and the enumeration of
various kinds of observations needed in preparing such a report on
mineral veins as shall be useful for reference in subsequent investi
gations for scientific purposes.
   The great Cobre lode, which Prof. Ansted selected for his first
notice, as being a very exceptional and remarkable vein, has been
known for twenty years as the richest copper lode worked for a con
tinuance during that period.       It is remarkable for      great magni           its
tude and complication,                 its
                              extraordinary richness, the high degree                                       of

       The main lode of the Cobre is cut off to the west by a cross-course,
    after being heaved by several slides of small amount.       The whole
    workings on the principal vein are limited to a linear extension of
    800 yards, and to a breadth of about 200 yards.
       The lode appears to have originally afforded superficially a great
    breadth of ferruginous earthy mineral (gossan) rich with black
    oxide of copper, together with red oxide and carbonates, to a depth
    of 16 fathoms; beneath this, solid sulphurets occupied three courses
    of ore, now being worked. The northernmost is of large size,
    though variable, and underlies to the south; the middle and the
    southernmost courses are smaller, and nearly vertical;            three                          all
    apparently approximate    downwards.       The  “ground”         highly                     is
    mineralized both between the courses and outside the walls of the
    two outer courses. The Cobre mine          open    present     the 160
