                    energy are mutually convertible.      The direct.
conversion of mechanical   energy   into heat seems  sufficiently ob
vious from various known phenomena of friction and percussion;
and the admirable experiments of Joule have shown, with an
accuracy sufficient for              all
                           practical purposes, that      the process
                                                                                         or in

unit of heat.          The direct conversion of heat into work                                    is   not so
obvious, and         satisfactory         experimental               proofs       of   the fact are still
wanting.
   Physically        considered,the universe has been defined  matter                             as

allowed that         matter and motion can neither be created nor de
stroyed.        In   all   the wonderful transformations                           of   matter revealed
by   chemistry,          well known that the quantities        the sub                           of

2          Mr.  J.  Gill on the Dynamical  Theory   of Heat.
force,—a theory which appears to shed a fresh light upon almost
every branch of physical inquiry, and to impart a new interest to
subjects the study of which was already beginning to settle down
into a quiet current of fixed opinions.
    The grand simplicity of the idea of the conservation of force,
together with the tendency to generalize which influences most
inquirers in scientific matters, would naturally lead to the belief
that if mechanical energy is directly convertible into heat, heat
 should be also directly convertible into mechanical energy, and,
 of course, in the same proportion.       Hence it is assumed that
when a hot perfect gas performs work by expansion in a cylinder
supposed to be neutral to the thermometric effects of heat, and
having a piston moving without friction, it must naturally lose
as much heat in raising a weight of 772 pounds one foot as
would raise the temperature of one pound of liquid water 1 de
gree of Fahrenheit's scale.      By the same reasoning, steam, in
performing work in vessels supposed to be equally neutral to
heat, should lose exactly the same quantity of heat in doing the
same quantity of work; and as perfect steam (neither super
heated nor containing water in suspension) cannot lose heat
without undergoing a corresponding amount of condensation, it
is assumed that in the working of the steam-engine as much
steam is condensed (theoretically) as corresponds to the amount
of work performed in the proportion of Joule's equivalent, and
consequently that the quantitative heat of the steam passing into
the condenser is by so much less than the total heat of the steam
furnished by the boiler to the engine.
    More than thirty years ago Seguin, in his interesting work
‘On the Influence of Railways,’ endeavoured to trace the dyna
mical relation which he saw must exist between the heat applied
to the boiler and the energy developed by the engine; and it is
remarkable that, in many experiments made by him on the actual
working of steam-engines, with the express purpose of proving
the disappearance of quantitative heat which he thought must be
converted into the work done, he could not detect the expected
disappearance of heat.
    Soon afterwards Mayer published some very interesting spe
culations on the mechanical equivalent of heat; and, from theo
retical considerations on the effect of heat in increasing the elastic
pressure of air, he deduced a numerical value of the dynamical
equivalent, which agrees very closely with the result of Dr. Joule's
independent and highly philosophical experiments.          These ex
periments proved indisputably that mechanical energy is directly
convertible into heat; but so far no experiments seem to have
proved with equal clearness that heat was directly convertible
into mechanical work. More recently this part of the inquiry

              Mr.    J.    Gill on the Dynamical Theory of Heat.                     3
was taken up by the distinguished engineer M. Hirn of Colmar,
who, like M. Seguin at an earlier period, instituted a series of
experiments on the actual working of large steam-engines, to as
certain, if possible, the disappearance of heat equivalent to the
work done as assumed by the dynamical theory; but he could
not obtain satisfactory proof of the direct disappearance of quan
titative heat from the working steam as an equivalent of the work
done. These negative results led to a controversy, in which the
correctness of the dynamical theory was ably sustained by Pro
fessor Clausius; and at his suggestion M. Hirn made a fresh
series of experiments on the large scale as before, from which he
still could detect no disappearance of the heat supposed to be
changed into the work done.           His apparent facts were again
ably combated by the supporters of the dynamical theory; and
finally, in 1862, M. Hirn published a work in which he admits
that his former views were erroneous, and shows himself a con
vert to the dynamical theory, giving a fresh set of experiments
on large engines, in which he shows that heat does disappear
from steam in the act of performing mechanical work. He argues
that it must be so, as work or heat would be produced from no
thing unless we allow that an equivalent of heat has been actually
transformed into the work done, or reproduced in the heat deve
loped by friction—and consequently that, in                    all
                                                        cases where work
has been    performed                by
                              hot elastic  fluid, the fluid must contain
                                  is a
less heat after the work       done than       contained before, the heat
                                                it
which has disappeared being the equivalent                      of
                                                          the work done,
and    infact transformed into this work.         Moreover,    when   gas
                                                                               a a

                    initial tension, gives out the same amount                       of
force. But how explain the heating and cooling                   the gas  of         7
Formerly the explanation was easy,              on
                                               the supposition that the
specific heat        gases varied with the density, the capacity for
                     of
heat increasing          the density decreased.
                            as                        Regnault's experi
                                           of                 constant,
                                                                                     of or
ments showed that the capacity            gases for heat             is
nearly so; consequently the facts            the heating and cooling
                                            of
a  gas   by compression and expansion are inexplicable, and really
without     acause, unless we allow        direct relation between the
                                            a
work expended          produced and the heating and cooling
                           or                                          the     of
gas.
    Ithas been supposed that M. Hirn's more recent experiments,

and the excess of heat supposed to exist in the steam as it leaves
the boiler above the quantity of heat which it contains as it leaves
the cylinder, which latter quantity is found in the condenser—in
other words, that the work performed is proportional to the heat
which disappears from the steam in            passage through the             its
engine. After careful examination        the phenomena,    think       of                               I             it

difficulty. The quantity of steam furnished to the engine per
second with the throttle-valve full open, and consequently the
maximum amount of cut-off to produce the given constant
amount of work, was ascertained by keeping the engine in con
stant action during a whole day; and the number of strokes made
by the engine during this period was taken by a counter.           By
dividing the whole quantity of water by the whole number of
strokes of the engine, the weight of steam for each stroke was
ascertained.
    It was much more difficult to ascertain the quantity of steam
furnished to the engine in a given time while working with
out cut-off, and regulated to the same constant rate of work
by throttling or “wire-drawing” the steam.           In this case the
consumption of steam, and consequently the consumption of fuel,
increased; the furnace adapted for the more limited rate of com
bustion which sufficed for the more economical mode of working
was not sufficient for the larger consumption; and under these
circumstances the difficulty of maintaining the conditions of the
supply of steam constant during a whole day’s work was so great
as to render it almost impossible to ascertain accurately by the
former method the quantity of steam supplied; consequently an
other method was adopted for the purpose.        The quantity of cold
water supplied to the condenser, and the tepid water discharged
from the air-pump in a given time, were each accurately gauged,
the respective temperatures being taken into account; and the
exeess of the latter quantity over the former, representing the
steam passing through the engine, being divided by the number
of strokes in the given time, showed the weight of steam used
per stroke.
    The first series of experiments described by M. Hirn were made
with a large engine making twenty-seven strokes or revolutions
per minute, and producing the constant work of 150 horse-power,
as shown by a friction-brake.        Under the most economical con
ditions of the action of the    engine this work was produced from
k. 0-34554 of steam per second, representing 228-16 French.
thermal units or calories; and under the least economical condi
tions the steam used was k. 0.46927 per second, equal to 286.38
calories.    In the former case a disappearance of 40.34 calories
was observed ; and in the latter case heat equal to 38:08 calories
disappeared.
   A   second set  of experiments with the same engine, producing
work equal to        116 horse-power,    showed a consumption of
k. 023548 of steam       per  second in one case, and k. 0.32307 in
another—the observed loss of heat being 30-51 calories in the
first case, and 32:13 calories in the second case.
    Another set of experiments with a smaller engine, making

ninety-three revolutions per minute, and producing the constant
work of 90 horse-power, showed the steam used to be k. 0-1902
per second in one case, with an observed loss of heat equal to
21-5 calories; and in another case the consumption of steam
was k. O'229 per second, with a loss of heat equal to 22:58
calories.
     Inthe most economical of the above experiments a constant
amount of work equal to 116 horse-power was obtained from
k. 023548 of steam per second, the steam, of five atmospheres’
pressure, being superheated 93° C. (from 152° to 245°) and
cut off early, so that the expansion was as 6:1.            In another ex
periment, the steam being equally superheated and cut off near
the end of the stroke, so that the expansion was only as 1:15:1,
the rate of work being kept constant by throttling or wire-draw
ing the steam, the same 116 horse-power required the con
sumption of k. 0.32307 of steam per second, being 36 per cent.
more than in the former case.           Now, everything else being
equal, the furnace must furnish in the second case one-third
more heat than in the first case.                             If,

 sequently, as regards tangible proof from direct experiment, M.
 Hirn's earlier opinion that heat did not disappear from the
 steam in the production of work may have been really in accord
 ance with facts as far as they were perceived, though at variance
 with the whole truth ; and                           I
                                would submit that the conclusions
 arrived at from his more recent experiments, as above quoted,
 though in accordance with truth, may be questioned as to their
 satisfactory proof by experiment.     In short, now imagine that                        I
 our investigations on the subject by experiments on the actual
 working of steam-engines have not been conducted on really
 correct grounds, and that the results have therefore been ano
 malous.     It is no doubt true that the heat furnished by the fire
 is in       all
           cases more than the heat which passes into the con
 denser; and         no heat were otherwise lost, this excess would

defined), and it is mathematically demonstrated that heat should
disappear in such cases and might be transformed into the work
done, it may be freely admitted that the work performed by the
expansion of isolated steam is accompanied by a corresponding
disappearance of heat. This disappearance of heat, if the steam
is saturated, should cause a corresponding condensation of part
of the mass, or an equivalent amount of cooling if the steam is
sufficiently superheated to bear abstraction of heat without con
densing.      If a reservoir of saturated steam be put in free com
munication with a cylinder and loaded piston, the piston’s out
ward motion would be accompanied by an expansion of the
whole mass of steam, and a condensation of steam-particles
throughout the mass equivalent to the amount of work done by
the piston.
                    If,
                    now (the communication with the working cylin
der being closed), fresh steam from some other source                     forced                    be

compression thus effected should reevaporate the liquid particles
of  condensed steam, and the general mass                  steam should be   of
                dry,                                 yet     further quantity

                         stroke      the working piston

 the reservoir, the mass       steam should become superheated; and

 the fall    of

       If
      the steam supplied to the reservoir were injected at the
 same time and at the same rate as the steam is withdrawn in
 giving motion to the working piston, so that the density and
 pressure in the reservoir should remain constant, it would appear
 that the whole work would be done directly by the injecting
 piston, and merely transferred to the working piston by means
 of a moveable plug of steam at constant pressure and tempera
 ture. In this case no heat should disappear either from the
 reservoir or from the cylinder; and the contents of the cylinder
 at the end of the working stroke should be identical with an
 equal mass of steam of corresponding pressure and temperature
 from any common source.
  . The formation    of steam from the water in a boiler may be
 considered equivalent to the injection of steam ready formed from
 some other source; and during the whole stroke, if at full pres
 sure, or the full-pressure part of the stroke if working expan
 sively, only a small fraction of the heat assumed to be converted
 into work would disappear from the cylinder itself, being in the
 proportion of the contents of the cylinder to the whole contents
 of the steam-space in the boiler, and smaller as the fluctuations
 of pressure in the boiler due to the intermittence of supply to the
 cylinder are bounded by marrower limits. On the other hand,
                                                                                                       in by

   The column of smoke may perhaps serve as a test for the
existence of vortex-rings in other cases, when, produced in air,
they are invisible. This was tried in one instance.      It is a com
mon trick to blow out a candle by the puff of air from the muzzle
of a gun when a percussion-cap is exploded on the nipple. This
puff is probably a vortex-ring. Owing to the high velocity with
which it moves, it is difficult to trace the effect produced by the
column of smoke.        One person, however, firing from an elevated
position and at a distance of fifteen or twenty feet from the flasks
down upon the column, and another watching against a dark
background, a distinct ring was occasionally seen to dart from
the column after the percussion of a cap; but whether thesc
were “negative rings,” as was expected, or ordinary “smoke
rings,” was not easy to determine.

   P.S.—Since writing the foregoing, it occurred to me to fill the
box with ammoniacal gas and to discharge rings from this at a
column of the vapour of hydrochloric acid. In this case the ring,
before reaching the column, is perfectly invisible, and the exist
ence of the column is only seen by slight traces of partially con
densed vapour.   As was expected, a beautiful ring appeared, from
the combination of the two gases, when the ammoniacal ring
reached the column.

THEthetheory
        days      of Newton is that which represents wave-motion
as consisting in the alternate rising and falling of the parts of a
liquid in vertical lines, as in the two branches of a U-shaped
tube; this is usually cited as Newton’s theory of waves. There
is to be found, indeed, in the Principia the hypothesis of vertical
oscillations, and also the cut of the bent tube, so persistently
copied by subsequent writers; yet it is evident that Newton
adopted the hypothesis rather as an expedient for a special pur
pose (that of finding approximately         the relation of a wave's
length to     its
               period) than      strictly true
                                 as               nature; for

fore  I  propose the time defined by this proposition as only near
the truth.” This important qualifying clause seems to have been
quite overlooked by those who have professed to give Newton’s
theory of waves.
    The modern theory, which teaches that in wave-motion all the
particles of a liquid are revolving synchronously in vertical circles,
though so broadly hinted at by Newton himself as the true one,
in the words italicized above, has nevertheless been developed
for the most part only within the present century. It was first
clearly stated and ably advocated by Gerstner in 1804. More
recently it has been satisfactorily established as accordant with
observed facts and the laws of mechanics, by the experimental
researches of Weber and Scott Russell, and the mathematical                                           in
 vestigations of Stokes, Rankine, and others.               A concise exposi
 tion and demonstration of the           theory   may    be found in a paper
 by Professor Rankine, in the Philosophical Transactions for 1863.

equally represents a wave whose length is 36 feet and height
4  feet, with period 2-63; and similarly for other proportional
dimensions.
    Among the particular points in wave-phenomena which are
elucidated by this apparatus may be enumerated the following:—
    1. The undulating surface-profile.—This is shown in the mo
tion of the upper flexible wire, which presents a continuous
contour-line, of the exact curvature throughout of a true normal
wave—instead of a broken contour of arbitrary form, by means
of rising and falling balls, as in the ordinary wave-apparatus.
   2. The undulatory motion of all subprofiles, or lines of equal
pressure down to still water.—The representative of such lines is
the lower transverse wire, which moves similarly to the upper
one, but with a less curvature.     Every such line of equal pres
sure is a continuous  one,  composed   of particles in a state of dy
namical equilibrium, and constituting an ideal moving wave
exactly as if at the surface, the corresponding phases of        such                            all
waves being             on
                 vertical lines.

of equal pressure which at rest are vertical.—These lines are alter
nately lengthened and shortened, and bent to right and left, as
represented by the upright elastic wires.
   17. The varying distortions undergone by blocks or sections of
water originally rectangular, or rectangular when at rest.—Such
sections are represented by the spaces between the wires, and
their distortions by the distortions of these spaces.
   18. The fact of sensibly still water at half a wave's length
below the surface.—This is exhibited in the absence of lateral
motion at the lower extremities of the upright wires, and is a
necessary result of the law of diminution of orbits with depth,
as given above (15).
   19. The varying strain in wave action on floating bodies.—
This is seen in the varying angle made by the upright wires
with the upper transverse wire: the latter shows the position of
a raft, for example, lying on the wave-surface; the former, that
of a long thin body, as a board floating end down; hence the
varying relative direction of the wires shows the strain to which
a body is subjected, having both breadth and depth, as the hull
of    a vessel.

tage in connexion with this apparatus, but it is not important to
specify them here.     Enough has been stated to illustrate                    its

which consists in setting in vibration the column of air enclosed
in a longitudinally vibrating tube. These vibrations may be
made visible by light powder strewed in the tube; and by mea
suring the resultant dust-figures, the wave-lengths of the same
exciting tone in different gases, and therewith the corresponding
velocities of sound, may be readily foundt.
    Since it is not always certain in these experiments that the ex
 citing tone of the longitudinally sounding glass tube remains in
 successive experiments exactly the same, the apparatus was first
 of   all  altered that not only did one end
            so                                           the longitudinally        of

   Calculating the value from the formula 332-8 M1 + 100a.
(2–0.003665), we get 389-03.        The difference of the observed
and of the calculated value amounts therefore to 0.04 metre.
   It is therefore proved that up to 100° C. the change in the ve
locity of sound is accurately expressed by the factor M 1+xt,
and therefore that Laplace's factor        #, the ratio of the specific
                                            1
heats of air, is constant within very narrow limits.
   As this constancy is thus experimentally proved, observations
of the velocity of sound at 100° may conversely be used to de
termine a, the coefficient of expansion of air.
   Although & is not obtained with excessive accuracy from a
single determination, the deviations of a in various observations
are not too far apart; and from the mean of the seven observa
tions- we get
                         a = 0.003662.
We   see from this that, in spite of the considerable changes in the
velocity of sound in tubes, the method in question with a suitable
choice of apparatus yields very accurate determinations; and, in
the future, accurate values for the velocities of sound of different
gases, and therewith of the ratios of their specific heats, may be
expected from  it.

V. On       the Theory   of Pressure in Fluids. By R. Moon,                                             M.A.,
                Honorary Fellow of Queen's College, Cambridge*.
I     DESIRE
       pressure
                 to commend the following points in the theory of
                 in fluids to the attention of mathematicians.
    I. Suppose that we have a closed cylinder filled with air, and,
for the sake of precision of statement, suppose the axis of the
cylinder to be horizontal.      Suppose also that at the time t every
particle of the air is destitute of velocity, while the density of
the air varies on this wise; viz., the air to the left hand of a ver
tical plane which bisects the axis of the cylinder has the uniform
density D, while the air to the right of the same plane has the
density 2D.
    Under these circumstances, according to the received theory
with regard to the law of pressure in fluids, the air in the right
hand half of the cylinder will exert on the air in the left-hand half
exactly double the pressure which the air in the left-hand half
exerts on the air in the right-hand half; that           the law      pres        is,               of
sure   of the received  theory contradicts,     this  case,        in
                                                             the universal
principle that action and reaction are equal and opposite.
     II. Suppose that we have          vertical cylinder closed
                                                     a                                                  at   its
lower end, and having            air-tight piston capable           moving
                                        of an

how, according        the received theory
                           to                  pressure,           of
                                                             thin stratum                 a
of  air immediately beneath the piston will comport itself under
these circumstances.
     The pressure   the piston upon this lamina and the pressure
                           of
ofthe lamina upon the piston must under         circumstances                   all                          be
equal and opposite.
    Consequently,      the principle
                           if             the received theory
                                                         of        true                             be
 (viz. that the  pressure   varies only  with the density), the pres
sure   ofthe air upon the piston (and therefore the pressure                                                 of
the piston upon the air) must remain unaltered until change                                    a
has taken place       the density
                           in          the air       of

* 28                     Mr. R. Moon                 on the Theory        of
      (2) An interval of time during which such variation of pres
   sure may act.
      But while it has thus been seen that variation of density in
   the lamina must be preceded by variation of pressure in and
   upon the lamina, the received theory asserts that these two things,
   viz. variation of density and variation of pressure, are necessarily
   coexistent.
       Hence in the case just stated, since at the time t, when the
  second weight is introduced, there is no variation in the density
  of the air in the lamina immediately beneath the piston, it fol
   lows, according to the received theory, that when the second
   weight is introduced there will be no variation of pressure in the
  lamina, and therefore nothing to generate that which, according
  to the received theory, is the essential mark and test of a change
  of pressure, viz. variation of density.       According to the received
  theory, therefore, the equilibrium will be maintained after the
  second weight has been introduced, which is absurd.
      It is clear that in the case just considered, the effect of the
  introduction of the second weight will be to propagate instanta
  neously into the air beneath the piston a pressure of finite amount,
  extending to a finite distance below the piston—such additional
 pressure having         its
                          maximum immediately below the piston, and
 thence diminishing gradually till,          the portion        the cylinder       of

particle of the air will have acquired a velocity fat, and will have

described a space                   4.
   Moreover, since the motion during the time dt (being such as
has been described) can in no way have altered the density, it is
clear that at the end of the second interval dt each particle will
have acquired a velocity 2fat, and will have described a space
2fat”, the density remaining unaltered.

   It is obvious, however, that no such effects as those above de
scribed, and which, if the received theory of pressure be univer
sally true, must necessarily take place, can occur in the case we
are considering.    At the end of the time t + equally          the               ti,                  as

    It   clear,
          is      fact, that any theory

WI. Description of a new Thermostat. By FREDERICK GUTHRIE,
  Ph.D., F.R.S.E., Professor of Physics and Chemistry, Royal
  College, Mauritiust.
IN     physical and chemical research, and also in the arts, the
       problem of maintaining a constant temperature frequently
presents itself. To this end Bunsen constructed his ingenious
thermostat, whose action depends upon the expansion of mercury.
For many purposes Bunsen’s thermostat answers admirably; but
in cases where a perfectly constant temperature is required,                                                    I
have not found it sufficiently nimble in          action     adjustment.its              of

I  constructed the thermostat here      figured,   and have found                                        it    to
answer very satisfactorily.

mity of b passes into the water
and carries a bulb, c. The tube
b also carries a branch, t, the up
per end of which carries a cork
through which works very stiffly
the solid plug p.     The cork in
t is provided with a small hole to
allow air to pass.     Mercury is
poured into t until it rises to a
convenient height in b. The plug
p is adjusted and the whole held
very firmly in a clamp. The action
is obvious. At a certain tempera
ture the air in c will occupy such
a volume that the mercury will be
forced up b until its surface, a,
begins to shut off the gas. The
flame of l will thereupon diminish
in size. By pushing the plug p
further down mercury will beforced
up b, and a consequent lowering of
the temperature will follow.  By
this means the instrument can be                                set   for any temperature    with
out disturbing the mercury.

a general law which appears to rule these phenomena, having,
moreover, lately succeeded, thanks to the able advice of M. Des
Cloiseaux, in observing with certainty some more complex crystals
belonging to the oblique system,               I
                                     may now attempt to develope
with more detail, and with the sanction of experiment, the theo
retical views laid down in my first memoir”.
   Some remarks may first be made and some principles laid
down with the view of removing objections which might be
raised relative to the regularity and constancy of the pheno
mena in question.
   All observations agree in showing that the phenomenon of the
change of volume of a body by heat, whether it be an expansion
or a contraction, is produced in a continuous manner and with
a regularity perfectly similar to that of the changes in tempera
ture—the same volumes corresponding constantly and identically
to the same temperatures.
   Any idea of sudden and accidental, and, so to say, capricious
variations may then be rejected in this class of phenomena, as
well as the existence of slow variations which in the course of
time might occur in the numerical value of the coefficients                    of
expansion.
     I
    may cite,in support of the invariability of these coefficients,
two determinations made with great care, at an interval of a year,
on the same quartz crystal supported on the same platinum                     tri
pod, this latter having during this interval undergone several
hundred alternations of temperature between 7° and 80°. These
two coefficients correspond to the direction of the axis of the
crystal.
            First determination . a = 0.0000078118,
            Second determination a =0.0000078117.
   When, in my former memoir, I endeavoured to coordinate the
phenomena then known regarding the expansion of crystals be
longing to the various crystalline systems, the limited number
of the observations might indeed indicate a simple and general
law, but did not permit           by
                                being established with sufficient
precision; yet, guided              its

 of factshave been connected by very general geometrical consi
 derations, in like manner for the phenomena of expansion we
 may, by analogous considerations, express the law of the varia
tions met with in the numerical values of the expansions when
they are considered according to different directions. There are
then three distinct physical phenomena which may be connected
with analogous theoretical views; these are the propagation of
light and of heat through crystals, and the expansion by heat
of the crystal itself; and these theoretical views are precisely
of the nature of those which geometricians use when they                                                  in
vestigate ellipsoidal surfaces.         In fact, one and the same prin

  The dispersion then increases much more rapidly than the
deviation; hence in spectroscopes whose deviation is the same,
that one will disperse most, in which i and therefore 2 is the
greatest.
   The above discussion applies strictly only to the emergent
ray; but in the position of minimum deviation, the dispersion of
a prism is just double this, as may be seen from the general for
mula for dispersion (Radicke’s “Optics, vol. i. p. 179).     pro                            I
pose hereafter to discuss the question whether greater dispersion
with the same loss of light could not be obtained by some other
position of the prism.
   2. Reflection.—In estimating the loss by reflection, it is usual
to assume that the same proportion of the incident light is lost
at each successive refraction.  But in reality the light so refracted
is partially polarized, and in this state another law determines
the amount reflected.     Fresnel showed that of a ray polarized  -

    From the first example we see that by using 64° prisms                                  in
 stead of 45°, we obtain more than double the dispersion, with
 even less loss of light, while in the second case seven 64° prisms
prove much more efficient than twelve of 45°.
    All these calculations seem to point to the superiority of 60°
prisms over those of 45°. A much greater angle is objection
able from the increased distortion produced by the slightest im
perfection in the refracting faces.
    In prisms admitting the same amount of light, the more acute
the angle the less is the quantity of glass and the less the area
of each face. The ground might be taken that a 45° prism could
be made larger than one of 60° at the same expense, and thus
the difference in light remedied.      In this case, however, it would
be   necessary to enlarge  the  telescope, number of prisms, and in
fact the whole instrument.        Even supposing this change made,
the prisms of larger angle preserve their superiority, though not
in so marked a degree. The calculation is readily made by mul
tiplying the transmitted light by cos i, as is done in the above
examples.
   The index of refraction varying with the refrangibility of the
rays, the dispersion, loss of light, &c. would vary in different
parts of the spectrum. The change would, however, be small,
and could be determined, if necessary, by merely altering n.

cipal laws of linear perspective—as the existence of vanishing
points, that they are in a line drawn through the centre of visual
direction parallel with the vanishing lines, that vision with one
eye only can be considered in perspective, &c.; the coincidence
of the centre of visual direction and the centre of motion of the
eyeball is proved by the immobility of the radiating lines when
the eyeball only is moved, and their movement when the head is
moved with relation to the mirror; a means is afforded of finding
a point on a looking-glass, a perpendicular to the surface drawn
through which would pass through the centre of visual direction;
a principle is afforded on which an instrument may be con
structed for measuring the distance between the centres of motion
of the eyes. The instrument I used for this purpose consisted of
a card divided along one edge by lines drawn on both sides of
it,         nearly      possible coincident; this card being held
         a as                                                                                       on in

                        image might         seen          be          at
                                                      the same time (the
card being held with the divided edge horizontal), two lines                                        on
the card were seen         coincide with the images
                                 to                         two lines cor  of
responding       to
                 them               on
                             the other side      the card; and the dis
                                                                of
tance between the two lines             coinciding with reflected lines
                                                     so
being read off         on
                     the card,  gave  the distance between the centres
of  motion      of
               the eyeballs. This instrument admits              great im           of
provement; and will       it          be
                              evident that     delicacy may    itsincreased          be
 by increasing the proportion the distance between the image and
object bears      to
                  the distance      the mirror from the eyes.
                                                of                       has               It
been stated   that,        if     no
                            apparent   motion could        produced        be                   in  a
distant object        by
                     closing one eye after having covered that object
 by another nearer the eye, the eye          closed must   so  inoperative      be
when both   eyes   are used,  the greater  perfection     the one eye ob   of
scuring altogether the effect        the weaker of organ.    And      far                 so        as
apparent direction        concerned the experiment seems conclusive.
                               is
But this view appears         need modification; for
                                      to                     case     whichin   a         in
both  systems         of
                    lines were  distinctly  visible  simultaneously,    pro
ving both eyes were employed,                             no
                                       apparent motion could                                         be
produced        by
               closing the left eye; and although the left system
of lines was fainter than the right, and the left eye was undoubt
edly weaker than the right, the fact that the system appertaining
to the left eye was distinctly visible when both eyes were used
simultaneously proves that,       regarding the mirror, both eyes
                                                in
were effective.
  It   appears, therefore,that the powdered mirror affords    deli                         a
cate means      detecting
                 of       the share each  eye has    vision,    ex          in                 of
posing their inequalities    strength, and of detecting    both are   of             if
actually effective when used together—in the last, being more
delicate than the apparent-motion test.

     Sir David Brewster (Optics, p. 294) has stated that the centre
of visual direction coincides with the geometrical centre of the
eyeball; but it has been objected to this, that Volkman’s experi
ment on visual direction proves that the lines of visual direction
cross each other in a point anterior to the geometrical centre, and
that calculation will show this is inconsistent with the curvatures
and refractive powers of the humours composing the refractive
media of the eye; but                   as,

eight times      succession, the average time occupied

water was clear, and almost free from either taste         smell. The               of or

THE  expression is not by any means a matter of indifference. A body
of truth which is replete with laws, the meet reward of meritorious
centuries, may indeed, like a wealthy individual of high birth and
long descent, assume the most varied exterior without discredit; but
should it be scarcely yet provided with definitions, it has, like some
struggler of recent lineage and narrow means, merely a single guise,
which it would be impossible to improve without an awkward be
trayal of the peculiar manners and partial education of the wearer.
This single guise is known to literature as the dictionary; and in
it are most fitly adduced, as belonging to a primitive epoch, the facts
and circumstances on which the inductive method is to proceed.          In
the course of time, as hypothesis and verification mingle with their
predecessors and result in law, it becomes allowable to discard in form
many of the original details (whose accurate ascertainment had been
nevertheless important), and to state deductively the substance of
much that has been achieved. When such a period has been fairly
 reached, the manual is         its
                              legitimate exponent.    Eventually,      col       as
 lateral branches   spring from the  parent  stock,  science divides itself

under other titles the historical development and present position
of our modern hypotheses are portrayed with equal fidelity.       The
wisdom of such a course is sufficiently obvious, and is perfectly in
accordance with the rest of the editor's plan.     Good theories are
now more required than the class of facts with which we are accus
tomed to deal.   The law of multiple proportions has, fortunately for
numerous investigators, enabled us to correct and employ in logic
experimental results of comparatively inferior value; and it is begin
ning to be felt that with the accumulated labours of the last half
century, some of us ought to examine anew the fundamental concep
tions of chemistry. . It is quite time to dispute afresh the manifold
assumptions of the atomic theory, to discuss the minuter pheno
mena of chemical reactions, to test with rigour the philosophical
stability of our definitions and notation.    Few among those who,
amidst the turmoil of often too hasty experiments, really care to re
flect upon, and to stand face to face with, the full logical conse
quence of their results, will be disposed to doubt that the whole aspect
of chemical theory is destined to at least as great a revolution as it
has yet witnessed—a revolution in which the gross prevailing mate
rialism will probably have to succumb, when we may expect to
enjoy the freedom and purity of exact science. It                    then, most         is,

    In this brief review of the most extensive and valuable production
of its kind which has yet appeared in the English language, the
nature of our task has precluded the detailed observations which we
might have felt it our duty to make in reference to a smaller book.
Anything which Mr. Watts undertakes is invariably executed in so
thorough, clear, and direct a manner, that his editorship and prin
cipal authorship are sufficient recommendations to any one who is
acquainted with chemical literature.         He has, moreover, been for
tunate in obtaining the services of several distinguished chemists
and physicists, who have contributed articles on subjects to which
 they have paid special attention.         The whole work has thus the
completeness and authority which are due to a well-organized literary
plan well executed in                 all

several objects which, though unexamined, appeared to be certainly
worthy of notice; and these are very properly distinguished by
being placed between brackets. The article on the moon deserves
particular notice.   It comprises just a fifth part of the whole work,
and is an excellent sketch of “selenography.” It is accompanied
by an elaborate map, slightly exceeding 12 inches in diameter, exhi
biting the chief objects on the moon's surface that common tele
scopes can be expected to reach.      The writer has given, by way of
introduction, a few remarks on the telescope, and some rules for using
 it,which cannot fail     being serviceable

   When the velocity of the floating body is less than the speed of
advance corresponding to the depth to which it disturbs the liquid in
its immediate neighbourhood, it is probable that the virtual depth of
disturbance of parts of the liquid beyond the immediate action of the

    11. Possibility of Obliquely Advancing Tidal Waves.—It is pos
sible that instead of a depth less than the virtual depth corresponding
to the speed of advance of a tidal wave, the ridge of that wave may
place itself in a position oblique to the parallels of latitude, accord
ing to the principle stated in article 10. It still remains to be ascer
tained, by the study of tidal observations, whether such phenomena
take place in the tides of the ocean.                                       -

of the stars relatively to our system.      If the stars were moving   to
wards or from the earth, their motion, compounded with the earth’s
motion, would alter to an observer on the earth the refrangibility of
the light emitted by them, and consequently the lines of terrestrial
substances would no longer coincide in position in the spectrum with
the dark lines produced by the absorption of the vapours of the
same substances existing in the stars.
    The method employed by them would certainly have revealed an
alteration of refrangibility as great as that which separates the lines D.
They had, therefore, proof that the stars which they had examined,
among others Aldebaran, a Orionis, 3 Pegasi, Sirius, a Lyrae, Ca
pella, Arcturus, Castor, Pollux, were not moving with a velocity
which would be indicated by such an amount of alteration of position
in a line.
    Since, however, a change of refrangibility corresponding to that
which separates the components of D would require a velocity of
about 196 miles per second, it seemed to them premature to refer to
this bearing of their observations. The earth’s motion, and that of
the few stars of which the parallax has been ascertained, would make
it probable that any alteration in position would not exceed a frac
tion of the change which would have been observed by them.
    The author has since, for several years, devoted much time and
labour to this investigation, and believes that he has obtained a satis
factory result.
    He refers to Doppler, who first suggested that the relative motion
of the luminous object and the observer would cause an alteration of
the wave-length of the light; and to Ballot, Klinkerfues, Sonnche,
Fizeau, and Secchi, who have written on the subject.
    The author is permitted to enrich his paper with a statement of
the influence of the motions of the heavenly bodies on light, and of
some experiments made in an analogous direction, which he received
in June 1867 from Mr.       J. C. Maxwell, F.R.S.
    It is shown that if the light of the star is due to the luminous
vapour of sodium or any other element which gives rise to vibrations
of definite period, or if the light of the star is absorbed by sodium
vapour, so as to be deficient in vibrations of a definite period, then
the light, when it reaches the earth, will have an altered period of
vibration, which is to the period of sodium as V-H v is to W, when V
is the velocity of light and v is the velocity of approach of the star to
the earth.    Equal velocities of separation or approach give equal
changes of wave-length.
                    § II.   Description of Apparatus.
    A new spectroscope is described, consisting in part of compound
  risms, which gives a dispersive power equal to nearly seven prisms of
60° of dense flint glass. Various methods were employed for the
purpose of ensuring perfect accuracy of relative position in the        in
strument between the star spectrum and the terrestrial spectrum
to be compared with it; a new form of apparatus, which appears
to be trustworthy in this respect, was contrived,       Many of the ob

servations were made with vacuum-tubes or electrodes of metal, placed
before the object-glass of the telescope.

   The author states that he has examined satisfactorily the general
characters of the spectra of about seventy nebulae.      About one-third
of these give  a spectrum  of bright  lines;    these  spectra may      re
                                                                      all                                    be

   I took some  pains to learn the precise character of these luminous
bands.     When the slit was wide they resembled the expanded lines

drogen at the atmospheric pressure.         As the slit was made narrow
the two fainter bands, namely the one in the yellow and the one in
the blue, appeared to fade out without becoming more defined.              I
was unable to resolve these bands into lines.          In this respect they
are very different from the bright lines of the nebulae, which become
narrow as the slit is made narrow.
   The middle band, which is so much brighter than the others that
it may be considered to represent probably three-fourths, or nearly                                       so,

  which coincides with the double line of the spectrum of nitrogen;
  but, as the diagram shows, the band in the comet is in a small de
  gree less refrangible than the line of nitrogen.               This difference of
  refrangibility cannot be attributed to the comet's motion, since at the
  time the observations were made the comet was approaching the
  earth.
      The band in the blue is considerably more refrangible than F, and
  is  nearly  as refrangible as the group of bright lines in the air-spec
  trum which have the numbers 2642, 2669 in the map and tables
  of my paper “On the Spectra of the Chemical Elements” ”.
      The least refrangible of the bands occurs in the yellow part of the
  spectrum, at about the distance from E of one-third of the interval
, which separates E from D.

  The following communication was read:—
  “On the Occlusion of Hydrogen Gas by Metals.”                                         By Thomas
Graham, F.R.S., Master of the Mint.
   In my experiments, already published, on the occlusion of hy.
drogen by the metals palladium, platinum, and iron, the absorption
of the gas was observed to be of uncertain occurrence at low tempe
ratures, but was ensured by heating the metal, whether in the form.
of sponge or aggregated by hammering, and allowing it to cool:
slowly and completely in a hydrogen atmosphere.              This fact was
referred to the condition of absolute purity of the metallic surface.
being essential to the first absorbing action, as it is to the action of
platinum-foil or wire in determining the combustion of the gaseous
mixture of oxygen and hydrogen, as observed by Faraday.                  A new
method of charging the metals with hydrogen at low temperatures              -
has lately presented itself, which is not without interest.
   When a plate of zinc is placed in dilute sulphuric acid, hydrogen
is freely evolved from the surface of the metal, but no hydrogen is
occluded and retained at the same time.            A negative result was
indeed to be expected from the crystalline structure of zinc.              But
a thin plate of palladium immersed in the same acid, and brought
into metallic contact with the zinc, soon becomes largely charged
with the hydrogen, which is then transferred to                surface.    its
                                                                           The

    A similar result was obtained on making a hollow palladium cy
linder, of which the length was 115 millimetres, diameter 12 milli
metres, and thickness 1 millimetre, the negative electrode in an acid
fluid, while the closed cavity of the cylinder was kept exhausted by
means of a Sprengel aspirator.                No hydrogen whatever passed
through into the vacuous cavity in several hours, although the gas
was no doubt abundantly absorbed by the outer surface of the cylin
der and pervaded the metal throughout.
     It appears, then, that when hydrogen is absorbed by palladium the
volatility of the gas may be entirely suppressed; and hydrogen may
be largely present in metals without exhibiting any sensible tension
at low temperatures. Occluded hydrogen is certainly no longer a
gas, whatever may be thought of                              its

disengaged freely on the surface of the latter without being con
densed. A platinum plate which had acted for several hours as a
positive electrode, gave afterwards, when submitted to heat with ex

of the change, have for the most part a greater stability than the
original bodies.
   One evidence of this greater stability is afforded by the develop
ment of a quantity of heat (the heat of chemical action) from the
produced bodies having a smaller potential heat than the originalones.
   It results, both from reason and experiment, that in order to undo
or reverse any definite chemical action, just so much heat must be
directly or indirectly expended as was evolved by the original action.
   For the same quantity of heat evolved, the resulting temperature
varies with the mass and kind of matter heated, and with the rapid
or gradual evolution of the heat.
   When the evolution of heat is instantaneous, the resulting tempe
rature may be calculated from the quantity of heat evolved and the
mass and specific heat &c. of the matter heated.
   By a unit of heat is meant the quantity of heat necessary to raise
the temperature of one kilogramme of water one degree Centigrade,
or, more accurately, from 0° to 19.                                  -

   Every 18 grammes of water is a combination of two 1-gramme
proportions of hydrogen H, with one 16-gramme proportion of oxy
gen O ; and by the combination of 2 grammes of hydrogen with 16
grammes of oxygen, there are developed 68 units of heat.
   Of these 68 units of heat, however, little more than 57 units are
really due to the chemical action, nearly 11 units of heat being
evolved by the contraction of the original mixed gas into two-thirds
its volume    steam, and

   Under certain familiar conditions, chemical action seemingly takes
place    its utmost possible extent        single direction only, with

with maximum evolution of heat.
   For example, taking atomic proportions        grammes, the heat
                                                                                                  of of
                                                                   in

                            of            101 units; and the heat

formation of chloride of copper, CuCl4, is 605 units.      Hence, with
chlorine in solution and excess of both copper and zinc, there is
finally produced the maximum possible amount of chloride of zinc
and no chloride of copper.
   Again, on addition of sufficient zinc to solution of chloride of cop
per, there is complete combination of chlorine with zinc and complete
separation of chlorine from copper, i.e. complete burning of the one
metal and complete unburning of the other.
                                   IV.
   But under simpler though less familiar conditions, chemical action
habitually takes place in more than one direction simultaneously,
with production of correlative products in varying proportions.
   Thus, with hydrogen and excess of both chlorine and oxygen,
although the heat of formation of oxide of hydrogen, H°O, is 57
units, and the heat of formation of chloride of hydrogen, 2HCl, is
only 47.5 units, yet in this case the hydrogen does not combine with
the oxygen to the exclusion of the chlorine, but divides itself between
the oxygen and the chlorine in proportions which vary with the con
ditions of the experiment.       .
   In accordance with this result it is found that, at the same red
heat, excess of chlorine will effect the partial decomposition of water
with extrusion of oxygen, and, conversely, that excess of oxygen
will effect the partial decomposition of hydrochloric acid with extru
sion of chlorine.
   So that, beginning with the two chemical substances water and
chlorine, or beginning with the two chemical substances hydrochloric
acid and oxygen, or beginning with the three chemical substances
hydrogen, chlorine, and oxygen, there exist at a full red heat the four
chemical substances, water, hydrochloric acid, chlorine, and oxygen–
the proportions of the four substances depending certainly upon the
relative quantities present of the elements concerned, and most pro
bably also upon the temperature of the experiment.
    Similarly, beginning with the one chemical substance water
(Grove), or beginning with the two chemical substances oxygen and
hydrogen (Bunsen), there always exist at a sufficiently high tempe
rature the three chemical substances water, oxygen, and hydrogen.
   Although, by exposure to a red heat, the electrolytic mixture of
oxygen and hydrogen gases becomes completely combined or trans
formed into water, yet, as recently shown by Bunsen, at the high
temperature of 2024° only one-half, and at the still higher tempera
ture of 2844° only one-third of the mixture undergoes combination,
the other one-half or two-thirds remaining in the state of mixed gas.
                                    W.
   Chemists are acquainted with many reciprocal actions comparable
with those of chlorine upon water, and of oxygen upon hydrochloric
acid, the most familiar instance being probably the decomposition of
ignited oxide of iron by hydrogen with extrusion of iron, and the
converse decomposition of oxide of hydrogen by ignited iron with
extrusion of hydrogen.

   Similarly, sodium will decompose the oxides of carbon, while carbon
will decompose oxide of sodium; and just as a sufficient excess of
chlorine may be made to effect the almost complete decomposition
of a given quantity of water, so may a sufficient excess of carbon (or
carbonous oxide) be made to effect the almost complete decomposition
of a given quantity of sodium-oxide or zinc-oxide, as in the ordinary
processes for obtaining the two metals, notwithstanding that, for
an equal consumption of oxygen, the respective combination heats
of sodium and zinc exceed by far the combination heat of carbon or
carbonous oxide.                                        -
   Again, although the combination heat of oxygen and carbonous
oxide is 68 units, while that of oxygen and hydrogen is only 57
units, yet, as was shown by Bunsen many years ago, upon exploding
a mixture of oxygen with a joint excess of carbonous oxide and hy
drogen, the oxygen does not attach itself exclusively to the carbonous
oxide, but divides itself between the carbonous oxide and hydrogen
in a ratio determined by their relative proportions.

  1. “On some new species of Palaeozoic Crustacea from the
Upper Silurian rocks of Lanarkshire, &c., and further Observations
on the Structure of Pterygotus.”     By Henry Woodward, Esq.,
F.G.S., F.Z.S.
  The nature of the remains which have been referred by Mr.
Salter to Eurypterus (Pterygotus) punctatus was first discussed by
the author, who came to the conclusion that the Lanarkshire spe
cimens belong to a new species—Eurypterus scorpioides,            while the
chelate antennae and the detached lip-plate must have belonged to
other species.
   Eurypterus scorpioides is the first of the new forms now described
by Mr. Woodward, and is represented by a specimen exhibiting an
almost entire individual, and certain other fragments.           The punc
tate ornamentation of this   species may   be  readily distinguished   from
the scale-like markings of Pterygotus and Slimonia. The second new
form, Eurypterus obesus, is remarkable               for
                                                 the great obesity       the      of

     2.   “On   the Coniston   Group.”    By Prof. R. Harkness,    F.R.S.,
F.G.S., and Dr. H. A. Nicholson, F.G.S.
  The object of this communication was to record the occurrence of
a new and unique horizon, containing a rich Graptolite-fauna, in
that portion of the Silurian series of the Lake-district termed the
Coniston-flags by Professor Sedgwick. The authors also gave a
detailed description of these flags, and pointed out their physical
and palaeontological relations with the Coniston Limestone below
and the Coniston Grits above them.
  The palaeontological relations of the Coniston Limestone and of
the underlying green slates and porphyries have been previously
shown to be those of the Bala and Caradoc group.      The mudstones
succeeding to the Coniston Limestone yield an entirely new fauna,
including six species of Diplograpsus, all of which, with one excep
tion,  are in Britain characteristic Upper-Llandeilo forms; and the
evidence of the other species is in the same direction.  In Ireland,
however, many of these species have been obtained from strata of
Caradoc age. The fossils of the Coniston Grits have very little
affinity with those of the Kendal Flags, nor do they exhibit such a
facies as would connect them with the lower members of the Upper
Silurian series. Palaeontologically, therefore, this Coniston series
must be looked upon as a continuous group of rocks; and the phy
sical evidence leads to the same conclusion.    There is thus, in the
Lake-district, a greater development of Caradoc and Bala rocks than
is to be found elsewhere in the British Islands, as we are now re
quired to add a great thickness of strata, possessing, on the whole,
a decidedly Lower-Silurian fauna, but- containing some new forms
of life in its higher portions.
   3. “Death of Fishes on the coast of the Bay of Fundy.” By Dr.
A. Leith Adams, F.G.S., 22nd Regiment.
   On the 24th of September, during a heavy gale from the west,
impinging almost straight on to the entrance of the Lagoon, known
as Anderson's cove, enormous numbers of fish were observed floating
dead upon the surface of the water, and thrown up in quantities by
the waves. On the gale subsiding, the whole surface of the lagoon
and       its
        banks were covered with dead fish,       the depth

away northward and westward.       The author now gave the results
of his subsequent investigations while engaged in the survey of the
Pendle Range and the neighbourhood of Burnley and Blackburn,
which have shown that the increase in the thickness of the sedi
mentary deposits is continued into that district, the aggregate thick
ness of the Coal-measures, the Millstone-grit, and the Yoredale
series being in the Burnley district 18,635 feet, while in Leicester
shire it has dwindled down to 3100 feet. In discussing the ques
tion of the source of these sediments, the author came to the con
clusion that they were derived from a primaeval Atlantis, a view
which he considered to be strengthened by the fact that the Carbo
niferous sedimentary strata of North America also swell out towards
the north-east, and become attenuated towards the south and west.

first that we are justified in concluding the light to be formed solely
of reflected solar light; now that which comes from the sun would
perhaps only constitute the diffused basis of the field of vision.
The comet would then have a light of its own, the tint of which
very much resembles that of the nebulae, but its position greatly
differs from that of the nebular lines, one of which coincides with f.
The other line of the comet is also different in position, and is on
the further side, nearer magnesium than the nebular ray.      It is thus
proved that the displacement does not result from motion, but
is due to the nature of the cometary matter. As these bands are
more luminous than those of a star of equal magnitude, we are led to
the assumption of a special light emanating from the comet. The
measurements are not close enough to justify our comparing these
spectra with those of other known spectra; and we now know, more
over, that this comparison would be illusory, for the visibility of the
spectra in gases depends on numerous circumstances which we can
not determine.
   In the second place, this spectrum strongly resembles that which
other astronomers besides myself have observed in other comets.
We may thus generalize these results by induction; and that
would furnish an argument for the extraplanetary origin of these
bodies.
   Taking Venus near its greatest digression, and analyzing it with a
spectroscope with angular vision with two prisms, I observed that the
light indicated traces of atmospheric action at a height above the
horizon too great for the influence of the terrestrial atmosphere to
be perceptible.    This must then be referred to the atmosphere of
Venus itself.   It is well seen in the region of Brewster, named 3, and
in the other region in front of the sodium.      These bands are due to
aqueous vapour.      The lines of nitrogen of the air near F are also
greatly strengthened, which proves the presence of an atmosphere
about this planet analogous to our own.
   These observations have been confirmed on the simple spectro
scope made with Merz's and with Hofmann's prisms, using eyepieces
formed with cylindrical lenses, which were sent me by M. Merz, and
which possess a high degree of perfection.
   Now that with such powerful means we can penetrate into the
constitution of the stars, I have put the question to myself whether
the diversity of the spectra in certain types of stars does not rather
arise from differences in the proportions of substances which consti
tute them, than from an absolute diversity in the substances them-         .
selves. I have commenced this investigation in detail by comparing
stars of the second type (yellow stars like our sun) and red stars of
the third type.                                               -
   Comparing the two stars & Orionis and Arcturus, a surprising
identity is found between the principal lines and those of our sun.
More than thirty lines were found to be identical with those of
Fraunhofer's map, which by    itssize   better fitted for these com
                                       is
parisons than Kirchhoff's large map.     The fundamental difference
appeared  to  consist in the strongest lines being more intense      in

                    Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                              77
a. Orionis than in Arcturus;    and all are less so than in the sun.   It
might, moreover, be asked whether even in our sun the intensity of
these lines is constant; and this we are led to doubt when we com
pare Fraunhofer's figure with that of Van der Willigen, in which
fainter lines are met with than those marked by the first observer.
The group which stands out the best is that of iron; a. Orionis has,
moreover, systems of gaseous absorption analogous to those of our
atmosphere.     But this kind of investigation is only just sketched out,
and much time is required to arrive at definite results.
   Unfortunately this investigation cannot be accelerated, owing to
the small number of nights without any moon, and suitable for it
in other respects, and to the danger of fatiguing the sight too much.
A phenomenon is in fact frequently met with which shows how an
observer must be somewhat on his guard.          When, after having
kept the eye fixed on a star for some time, we look into the finder
of the large telescope for several seconds, a perfectly dark band of
the same size as the spectrum is seen across the field itself.    The
eye is thus paralyzed by the decomposed light far more than by a
white light of equal intensity.   Inversely, on putting the eye to the
telescope, for the first few moments scarcely any of the numerous
details are observed, which begin to come out little by little until
complete definition is attained.    These phenomena show that the
eye must be spared, and that without care it might be injured in
these researches.
   But at the same time we see what an intensity the system of cy
lindrical ocular lenses can retain. Some time ago it could scarcely
have been suspected that the eye could be fatigued by the light of
the spectrum of a star.—Comptes Rendus, May 11, 1868.
ON GILDING GLASS FOR THE PREPARATION                         OF OPTICAL            MIRRORS.
                    BY W. WERNICKE.
   In the last ten years various methods of silvering glass for the pre
paration of optical mirrors have been described, which have been
successfully applied in practice.    In order also to enfeeble the action
of the sun's rays in solar observations, it is usual now to coat the
object-glasses of telescopes with thin layers of silver—a method first
proposed by Foucault, and now introduced into several observatories.
The nature of silver is opposed to a continued use of the metallic
mirror; for when exposed to the air it loses                 its
                                                    lustre after     great          no

    Engaged on optical experiments,     I have recently found a method
 which never fails and can always be easily and conveniently exe
 cuted. For the preparation of a brilliant and firmly adhering layer of
gold three solutions are prepared, which are kept separate, and when
used need only be mixed in definite proportions:—
    1. A solution of chloride of gold in water containing 1 grim. gold
in 120 cubic centims. The gold is dissolved in the smallest quantity
of aqua regia, the excess of acid evaporated on the sand-bath, and the
solution diluted 120 cubic centims.       It is not necessary to heat the
hydrochloric acid solution until protochloride is formed; for the pre
sence of a small trace of free acid is unimportant in the formation of a
good mirror. The solution of gold must, however, be absolutely free
from such metals as are deposited in the metallic form by the redu
cing-liquid, and more especially from silver.      If the chloride of gold
contains traces of chloride of  silver, most of the gold is deposited in
the metallic   form,   and the thin  badly   coloured mirror is soon de
tached from the glass.
    2. Soda-lye of the specific gravity 1-06. This need not be pure;
in my experiments I have used commercial soda (containing chlorine
and sulphuric acid) made caustic by ordinary lime, with the same
success as chemically pure caustic soda.
    3. The reducing-liquid.     50 grims. of sulphuric acid are mixed
with 40 grms. of alcohol and 35 grms. of water; and after the addi
tion of 50 grms. of finely powdered manganese, the mixture is distilled
at a gentle heat on the sand-bath, and the vapours passed into a flask
containing 50 grms. of cold water.         The distillation is continued
until the volume of the water is doubled; the liquid obtained, which
contains aldehyde along with some formic and acetic ether, is mixed
with 100 cubic centims. of alcohol and 10 grms. of sugar converted
by means of nitric acid. The change of the sugar is effected by dis
solving 10 grims. of ordinary cane-sugar in 70 cubic centims. of water,
adding 0.5 grim. of nitric acid of the specific gravity 1-34, and boil
ing for a quarter of an hour. This reducing-liquid, preserved in
well-corked bottles, may be used for several months with the same
Success.
   In order to prepare a plane or a concave mirror, one part of the
soda-lye is mixed in a suitable vessel with four times its volume of
the solution of gold, and a quantity of reducing-liquid amounting to
#    or at most ºr of the whole is added. The mixture is rapidly co
loured green, owing to the liquid separated; it is immediately
brought in contact with the surface to be gilded, and in such a
manner that the gold can deposit from the top downwards.              The
rapidity of the gilding depends on the temperature. With a mean
temperature of 18°C. the mirror begins to form in 30 minutes, in
1} hour it is transparent with a splendid green colour, and in 2; to
 3 hours it is so thick that it is only translucent with a dark-green
light. At a temperature of 50° to 60° C. the same effect takes place
in 20 to 25 minutes, and at a temperature of 75° even more rapidly;
 it is not desirable to use a higher temperature, for the gold appears
 then to adhere less firmly to the glass. Within the limits mentioned,

the excellence of the mirror is the same as regards lustre and dura
bility; but it may sometimes happen that at a high temperature the
air contained in the water ascends in small bubbles and thus causes
fine holes in the mirror, which are not visible in reflected, but are so
in transmitted light; for this reason, when a high temperature is used,
it is convenient to raise nearly to boiling the alkaline solution of
gold before the addition of the reducing-liquid, and before bringing

   The mirror, when ready, is carefully washed with water, leaned
against the wall with the bottom resting on bibulous paper and the
 coated side underneath, and dried in the air at the ordinary tempera
ture; it exhibits then a perfect polish.
  In preparing the glasses for gilding, it is in most       cases    sufficient
to clean the surface with soda-lye and alcohol. Care must be taken
not to use an acid for cleaning; the layer of gold in this case sub
sequently becomes detached from the glass.-Poggendorff’s Annalen,

oN soME SPECIAL ELECTROMAGNETIC PHENOMENA, AND ON WE
  BER's HYPOTHESIS ON ELECTROMAGNETISM.  BY E. VILLARI.
   The author has investigated the influence which the initial mag
netic state of a bar of iron or of steel exerts on induced magneto
electrical currents excited in an adjacent conductor by any modifica
tion whatever, be it increase or diminution, in the magnetic condi
tion of the bar. His object was to verify Weber's theory, which was
also proposed by De la Rive, and which is only a complement of
that of Ampère, according to which, molecular currents preexist in
magnetic bodies, and are merely directed by the action of magneti
zation, carrying along with them in this motion the particles of the
body.    He thinks that if there is molecular motion, the rapidity
with which it is effected must depend on the initial magnetic con
dition, like the magneto-electrical currents which result from                   it,
and which themselves depend on the rapidity       the magnetic modi
                                                      of
 fication.
       The apparatus     he
                       used consisted      ofabar  of steel     or
                                                               iron, round
which were coiled two     conducting    wires;  through   the outside one
a first current passed, which magnetized the bar, and then other
weaker ones, direct      inverse, which more
                          or                      orless modified the ori
ginal magnetism;        the other, the inside, which was connected with
                         in
  galvanometer, the breaking         of
                                     the outside coil and the alteration
in athe magnetism produced induced currents, which were                     to    be
measured.
   The author himself gives the following summary           his researches,
                                                           of

certain class of phenomena in which, when presented to the mind
for the first time with the view of predicting the magnitude of
any effect which would be produced in a body by the addition of
proportionate increments of a given force, the results exhibited
by experiment are altogether different in magnitude from those

of a peculiar order of analogies, drawn from a wide range of phy

 two line wires, was absolutely necessary for that purpose, until
 Steinheil,      1837, made the discovery that one
                    in                                            these wires                of

wire was terminated with a metal plate inserted in the moist
ground.     This physicist also pointed out that the resistance
offered  by  the earth to the propagation of the current along the
wire   might  be reduced to such an extent as to be quite insensible
when compared with that of the double metallic circuit; so that
not only was one-half of the wire economized, but even the re
sistance that such a mixed circuit of earth and wire presented
was diminished by one-half.
    92. The explanation of this singular and important fact, as
given by Steinheil, was that the conducting-power of the earth,
though very inferior when compared with that of the metals, yet
its  bad conductivity was more than compensated for              the im                                         by
mensity        of    its
                 section.     This  interpretation    the earth’s action               of
naturally led       the opinion that the electric current, after tra
                           to
versing the whole length          the telegraph-wire, returned through

84              Mr. H. Wilde's Experimental         Researches
who thinks that the anomalous results obtained by Matteucci
may be accounted for by supposing that the molecules interposed
between the two electrodes, not being so numerous when the
latter are near together, may constitute the electric chain by the
mutual neutralization of their opposite electricities, which is pre
ceded by their polarization; but when the electrodes are very
distant from each other this communication can no longer take
place, and they are then discharged, by means of the bed with
which they are in contact, into the entire mass of the terrestrial
globe+.     From this explanation it will be seen that De la Rive,
 in common with Matteucci, holds the opinion that a diminution
 of the distance between the electrodes in contact with the earth
is attended with an increase of resistance to the passage of the
current from the electromotor.
   96. This brief historical sketch of the present state of know
ledge on the function which the earth performs as a conductor
of electricity, as made known by those physicists who have pre
ceded me in this research, will, I think, lead to a full compre
hension of my own experiments in the same direction, and of the
new phenomena which form the subject of this paper.

                                               employed were the
machines   described in the First Series of these researches, and
consisted (1) of a 24-inch magneto-electric machine (58) worked
by hand. This machine would melt four inches of iron wire '025 of
an inch in diameter in short circuit, i. e. when the iron wire was
directly interposed between the polar terminals of the machine.
   98. (2) A 5-inch electromagnetic machine excited by a 2%-inch
magneto-electric machine (63).-This machine was furnished
with two armatures, one for the production of “quantity,” and
the other for the production of “intensity’ effects. The quan
tity-armature would melt fifteen inches of iron wire '075 of an
inch in diameter, and the intensity-armature thirty-six inches of
iron wire '035 of an inch in diameter, in short circuit.
    99. (3) A 10-inch electromagnetic machine (66) excited by a
3}-inch magneto-electric machine.—This machine was provided
with the quantity- and intensity-armatures before described (70),
 (71), (72). The quantity-armature of this machine, when ex
cited by the 3}-inch machine, would melt about fourteen inches
of iron rod 4 of an inch in diameter, and the intensity-armature
seven feet of iron wire tº of an inch in diameter.

for the heat abstracted by the polar conductors) seven-eighths of

produced in the iron wires, the passage of a current through the
conductors into the earth.
    111. The current from the battery of thirty-three Daniell’s cells
in series was first transmitted through the tangent galvanometer
in short circuit, when the needle stood permanently at 10°.
    112. When the same battery-current was transmitted into the
canal, through the conductors and electrodes arranged as in
fig. 12, the galvanometer introduced at N still indicated 10° of
current, thereby showing a null resistance on the part of the
water in the canal to the passage of the whole amount of current
which the battery was capable of producing.
    113. But on attempting to transmit the powerful alternating
currents from either the quantity- or the intensity-armatures of
the 5- and 10-inch machines into the canal through the same
arrangement of conductors and electrodes as in the preceding
experiment, the amount of current actually transmitted was not
sufficient to make three inches of the thin iron wire (107) intro
duced at N sensibly warm to the fingers, the result now indica
ting an almost total resistance to the passage of the current which
the electromagnetic machines were capable of producing.
    114. On uncoiling the two rings of copper rope and extending
them in straight lines, about twenty feet apart, along the bottom
of the canal towards the points O, P, with the distant ends C, D
of the conductors entirely disconnected, the current from the
5-inch intensity-armature made two feet of iron wire 035 of an
inch in diameter bright red-hot at N, and the current from the
 10-inch intensity-armature melted four feet of wire '050 of an
inch in diameter, the result now indicating a great diminution
of the apparent resistance of the earth to the passage of a pow
erful electric current.
    115. But on attempting to transmit the current from the        5
and 10-inch quantity-armatures through the conductors extended
in the canal, the amount of current now transmitted was only
sufficient to make fifteen inches of the thinner wire used in the
preceding experiment (114) sensibly warm to the fingers, the
result again exhibiting an increase of the earth's resistance
 similar to that observed when the conductors were coiled up into
 ringS.                    -
    its.  Similar effects of resistance to the passage of the current
 into the earth, as indicated by the non-heating of the thin wire
 at N, were also obtained when the 24-inch machine, or the single
 Grove’s cell, was connected with the submerged conductors in
 their extended form.
    117. That this resistance to the passage of the current from

tors themselves (106), or to any fault in the connexions, was at
once made evident by joining together the distant ends C, D of
the extended conductors, when the iron wires introduced at N
were immediately melted.
  118. In order that a discharge             of electricity through the ex
tended conductors K, L might be obtained, it was essential that
the connexion between the ends A, B and the aërial connexions
H, I, although immersed in the water, should be entirely me
tallic; for when one of these ends, A, was separated from the
other end,    I, byonly the thickness of a piece of tape, no heating
 effects sensible to the touch were produced in the thin iron wire
 at N by the powerful current of the 10-inch intensity-armature,
even when the distant extremities C, D of the conductors were
joined together.
    119. Though the current from a single Grove’s or Daniell’s
 cell was not powerful enough to heat sensibly any thin wire at
 N when either of these cells was placed in connexion with the
extended conductors with their ends C, D disconnected, yet an
amount of current was always found passing through the con
 ductors sufficient to produce a deflection of the galvanometer
 at N. Moreover, when contact between the Grove’s or Daniell’s
 cell (or one formed of zinc and platinum, excited by dilute sul
 phuric acid) and the extended conductors was maintained for a
 few moments and then broken, the galvanometer always indicated
 a counter current from the extended conductors about half the
 strength of that previously passing from the electromotor.
    120. That none of the effects of conduction and resistance of
the terrestrial bed, as manifested by the heating or non-heating
 of the wires at N, were brought about by the exercise of any
mutual influence of the conductors upon each other through the
intervening body of water,        or,

in  the experiments.
    122. On repeating,        the same order,

identical in every respect with those observed when the electrodes
were only a few feet apart. Thus a series of thirty-three Daniell’s
cells indicated 10° of current on the galvanometer at N, whether
the distance between the ring-electrodes was 3 feet or 300 feet;
while with the quantity- and intensity-currents from the 5- and
10-inch electromagnetic machines the opposite effects of resist
ance, as manifested by the non-heating of thin wire at N, were
obtained, whether the ring-electrodes were at the greater or at
the less distance (113).
    123. Again, when the conductors were uncoiled and extended
in the canal 300 feet from each other, the currents from the                      5
and 10-inch intensity-armatures melted and made red-hot the
same lengths and thicknesses of wires at N as when the conduc
tors were extended in the canal 9 feet apart; while, on the other
hand, the currents from the 5- and 10-inch quantity-armatures
encountered the same resistance, as manifested by the non-heating
of the wires at N, at the greater as at the less distance (115).
    124. The following Table contains the results of a carefully
made series of experiments with different numbers of similar
Daniell’s cells, when the ring-electrodes were immersed in the

    125. The results contained in columns 3 and 4 of the above
 Table prove conclusively that no change whatever occurs in the
 electric condition of the earth in consequence of a mere change
 in the distance of the electrodes from each other.                   It will also
 be evident that variations in the intensity of the battery-current
 are sufficient to produce corresponding changes in the resistance
 of the earth similar to those produced by the quantity- and                     in
 tensity-currents from the electromagnetic machines when the
 conductors were extended in the canal (114, 115).
    126. Returning to a consideration of the effects produced by
 the alternating current from the 5-inch intensity-armature when
 the ring-electrodes were connected with the aërial conductors of

90           Mr. H. Wilde's Eaperimental    Researches
equal length (113):—Although, when the electrodes were three
feet apart, a sufficient amount of current was always passing into
the canal to produce a spark and shock on breaking contact at
N, yet it was insufficient, as we have seen, to heat sensibly wire
so thin as 016 of an inch in diameter.        When, however, the
electrodes were made to approach so as to be within one inch of
touching each other, a length of three inches of the above-men
tioned wire was made red-hot.
   127. In order that this mutual influence which the electrodes
exercised on each other, to promote an increase of discharge
from the electromotors, might be more closely investigated when
the distance between the electrodes was still further reduced,
the tape-covered twin conductors were submerged in the canal
in their extended form, as shown in fig. 11, with the ends A B
connected with the respective ends of the aërial conductors, and
the distant ends C, D entirely disconnected.     From the porous
nature of the  tape-covering  with which the conductors were en
veloped, it will be obvious that this covering, though a good  in
sulator in air, would, when saturated with water, offer little or
no obstruction to the passage of an electric current either into
the earth or between the conductors.
   128. When the current from the 5-inch intensity-armature
was transmitted through the submerged twin conductors, 2 feet
of the same-sized wire which was made red-hot at N when the
naked conductors were extended in the canal (114) was now
melted.    And the current from the 5-inch quantity-armature,
which   previously  only made 15 inches of wire 021 of an inch
in diameter warm to the touch, now melted this same wire, and
also made red-hot 15 inches of thicker wire, '050 of an inch in
diameter.
   129. On coiling the twin conductors into a double ring about
2 feet in diameter and immersing it in the canal in the place
previously occupied by the separate ring-electrodes of naked
copper rope, the 15 inches of thicker wire ('050 of an inch in
diameter), which was only made red-hot by the 5-inch quantity
armature in the last experiment, was now melted, thereby indi
cating the passage of a more powerful current from the electro
motor when the twin conductors were coiled into a ring than
when they were extended along the bed of the canal.          With
this arrangement      of the double coil, the current from the
10-inch intensity-armature melted- 6 feet of wire '065 of an inch
in diameter.
   130. That the increased quantity of current passing through
the twin conductors, above that transmitted through the naked
conductors, whether in their coiled or extended form, was due
to the direct influence which the twin conductors exercised on

                   in Magnetism and Electricity.                 91
each other, and is an effect entirely distinct from that which the
earth produces when receiving into itself a discharge of electri
city, was at once made evident by lifting the saturated double
coil out of the canal and suspending it in the air, when the cur
rent from the 5-inch quantity-armature was still sufficiently
powerful to make bright red-hot, at N, 15 inches of the same
wire which was only made warm to the touch when the naked
conductors were extended separately in the canal (115).
    131. That the resistance which the naked ring-electrodes
presented to the passage of the current from the 5-inch and
10-inch intensity-armatures did not arise from the circumstance
of their convolutions being in close metallic contact with each
other, was proved by the fact that the same resistance to the
passage of the current from these armatures (as shown by the
non-heating of thin wire at N) was experienced when the tape
covered conductors were coiled up into two separate rings and
immersed in the canal at the same distance from each other as
were the naked ring-electrodes.
     132. Suspecting that the resistance which the two tape
covered coils when separated offered to the transmission of the
 current into the earth was due to an inductive action set up
 among the several convolutions of each coil and operating to
 produce a repulsion of the current on itself, the following expe
 riments were made for the purpose of testing the accuracy of this
 Wlew.
     133. Each length of the tape-covered conductors was, in the
 first place, uncoiled, and extended in a straight line along the
 bottom of the canal, with a lateral distance between them of about
 20 feet.    On transmitting the current from the 5-inch inten
 sity-armature through the conductors, a length of 2 feet of iron
 wire '035 of an inch in diameter was made bright red-hot at N,
 showing the passage of the same amount of current as when the
 naked conductors were extended in the canal under like circum
 stances.
     134. Each of the conductors was then bent backwards and
 forwards along the bottom of the canal in three lengths of 56
 feet, so that the conductors were each of them in the form of an
 elongated letter N. On transmitting the current from the same
 armature through this arrangement of conductors, the 2 feet of
 wire at N was made somewhat less bright red than in the pre
 vious experiment.
     135. Again, on binding the three lengths of each of the con
  ductors together with string, and immersing each of the con
  ductors thus folded in the canal, as shown in fig. 13, the 2 feet
  of wire at N, though hotter than could be endured by the touch,
  was not made visibly red-hot.

92           Mr. H. Wilde's Eaperimental      Researches
   136. From a consideration of the opposite effects of resistance
and conduction exhibited when the tape-covered conductors were
arranged separately in the canal in the several ways described
 (131, 133, 134, 135), it is evident that the transmission of the
current from the electromotor is preceded by an inductive action
upon the liquid particles in contact with the conductors, which
action, according as it is adverse or favourable, retards or acce
lerates the discharge  of the current into the earth. The increased
quantity of electricity discharged into the earth from the three
fold conductors, above that from the same conductors when coiled
into separate rings, is not surprising, as we have already seen
that in the case of the coiled twin conductors the inductive
action of a number of convolutions in contact with each other
on every side was much more perfect (as shown by the melting
of thick wires at N) than when these same twin conductors were
extended in the canal (128, 129).
    137. To recapitulate what has already been advanced in proof
of the action of the electrodes being independent of any mutual
influence which they might be supposed to exercise on each
other through the intervening body of water when transmitting
a current of electricity into the earth:-We have seen that
the same effects of conduction and resistance were produced, and
equal amounts of current were transmitted into the earth from
the same electrodes, whether the distance between them was 3
feet or 300 feet—a result altogether incompatible with the well
ascertained laws which have been determined in connexion with
the transmission of electric currents through liquids contained
in insulated vessels.
    138. That the distance between the electrodes does, under
certain circumstances,    exercise an influence on the quantity of
electricity transmitted from the electromotors was evident from
the heating and fusing of wires at N when the conductors were
brought into close proximity to each other by the contrivance of
the twin conductors. But that this influence operates within
limits extremely small was also evident from the fact that, when
the ring-electrodes were only 3 feet apart, none of the electro
motors would heat the thin wire at N. Moreover, that the mu
tual influence of the electrodes upon each other when in close
proximity is an action entirely distinct and separable from
the influence which these electrodes exercise upon the earth is
shown by the heating of wires at N when the saturated coil of
twin conductors was lifted out of the canal and suspended in
the air (130).
    139. This distinction between the two inductions becomes
still more obvious from the fact that, when the twin conductors
were extended in the canal,     the inductive influence of the con

                     in Magnetism and Electricity.                93
ductors upon each other acted in conjunction with the normal
inductive action of the earth to promote an increase of discharge
from the electromotors above that observed when the naked or
the tape-covered      conductors were extended separately in the
canal    (114,  115,  128). On the other hand, when the tape
covered threefold conductors were extended separately in the
canal (fig. 13), the inductive influence of each conductor upon
 itself acted in opposition to the normal action of the earth, so as
 to diminish the amount of discharge from the electromotor below
 what was observed when the same conductors were extended in
 straight lines, or arranged in the form of the letter N.
      140. Reverting to the fact that when contact was made be
 tween the 5- and 10-inch intensity-armatures and the conduc
 tors extended separately in the canal, the heating and melting
 of wires at N indicated the passage of a powerful current into
 the earth (114, 123):—A question of great importance now
 arose as to whether this current was transmitted in consequence
  of a physical conductivity of the terrestrial bed, or by the elec
  trolyzation of the liquid in contact with the conductors. Hitherto
  electricians have been content to affirm that the earth absorbs or
  drinks up the electricity transmitted from the electromotors.
  Matteucci had indeed found that when the electrodes were
    lunged into the soil impregnated with sulphate of copper or
  sea-water, the quantity of electricity discharged from the elec
  tromotor was increased; but, beyond this fact, no experiments
  have yet been recorded with the view of establishing the abso
  lute dependence of the transmission of the current into the earth
  upon the electrochemical properties of the liquids incorporated
  with it.
      141. One important step towards the establishment of this
  dependence was the diminution of the earth’s resistance observed
  when the tension of the current transmitted along the conduc
  tors was increased (114, 115)—a result entirely in accordance
  with what is observed in the electrolyzation of water in insulated
  vessels.   Moreover we have also seen that though the discharge
  of the current into the earth from the extended naked conduc
  tors was distinct from, as well as less in amount than, the dis
  charge between the twin conductors extended in the same liquid,
  yet it was of the same kind and in the same direction in the one
  case as in the other. The difference, then, between the discharge
  of the conductors into the earth and into each other being one
  of degree only, it seemed to me that some advantage might be
   derived from the study of the action of the naked and tape
  covered conductors upon each other when coiled and immersed

94            Mr. H. Wilde's Eaperimental     Researches
 in insulated vessels, for the purpose of comparing the results
 with those obtained when the same conductors were immersed
 in liquids in contact with the earth.
    142. A large wooden tub, partially filled with the same canal
water as that in which the previous experiments were made, was
insulated from the ground by means of three fireclay bricks
 (fig. 14); and in this tub the two ring-electrodes of naked cop
per rope were immersed with the planes of the rings about 3
 inches apart.
    143. On making contact between the 5-inch intensity-arma
ture and the coils immersed in the tub, a resistance to the pas
sage of the current (as manifested by the non-heating of thin
wire at N) was experienced, similar to that which was observed
when the same electrodes were immersed in the canal (113).
On diminishing the distance between the electrodes from 3 inches
 to 1 inch, the 3 inches of thin wire 016 of an inch in diameter
was now made red-hot, as was the case when these coils were
immersed at the same distance from each other in the canal (126).
    144. Similar effects of resistance to the passage of the current
from the 5-inch intensity-armature to those obtained with the
naked ring-electrodes were also experienced when the tape
covered ring-electrodes were immersed separately in the tub at
the same distances from each other as in the preceding expe
riment.
    145. Again, no transmission of the current sufficient to heat
thin wire at N occurred when contact was made between the
coiled electrodes, when 3 inches apart, and the 24-inch machine,
or a single Grove’s cell—the results agreeing in this respect also
with those obtained in the canal.
    146. The tape-covered conductors were now rearranged in the
tub as a double coil of twin conductors, bound together with
string, with the ends C, D disconnected.
    147. On transmitting the current from the 10-inch intensity
armature through the immersed coil, 5 feet of wire 065 of an
inch in diameter was melted at N, while the current from the
5-inch quantity-armature made 15 inches of wire '050 of an
inch in diameter bright red-hot, whereas the current from the
same armatures melted respectively 6 feet and 15 inches of the
same-sized wires when the double coil was immersed in the
canal (129)—a result which again shows, but in a converse man
ner, that the mutual influence of the conductors upon one another
was supplemented by the inductive influence of the earth, as in
the case where the conductors were extended jointly and sepa
rately in the canal (114, 128).
    148. Contact was now made between the double coil and a
single Grove’s cell; but although the galvanometer indicated

                        in Magnetism and Electricity.                                        95
the passage of a tolerably strong current through the coil, yet it
was not sufficiently powerful to make the thin wire red-hot
at N.
     149. When contact was made between the double coil and
the single pair of zinc and platinum plates contained in a glass
vessel (102), the passage of a current through the water in the
tub was indicated by the liberation of bubbles of hydrogen from
the platinum plate, as well as by the deflection of the galvanometer
at N. This result was also obtained when the current from the
same pair of plates was transmitted through a small double coil
of twin conductors (165) immersed in a glass of distilled water.
     150. When the ends A, B of the double coil in the tub, or of
the coil in the glass vessel, were connected with the respective
 terminals of the galvanometer, after                   all
                                                   contact with the voltaic
 couples had been broken, the galvanometer always indicated
a    strong secondary current from the coils, similar                      that    to
 observed when the conductors were extended                 separately      the         in
canal (119).
     151.     Aquantity      ofcommon salt was now dissolved           the tub in
of   fresh   water,  sufficient      make the solution
                                    to                          nearly   aspos.     as

96                    Mr. H. Wilde's Experimental Researches
  current from the 10-inch intensity-armature through the coil,
  so perfect was now the communication between the conductors
  through the electrolyte, that not the smallest spark could be ob
  obtained on making and breaking contact between the ends
  C and D.
     155. A phenomenon already observed, on a small scale, by
  De la Rive+ when engaged in transmitting the alternating cur
  rents from a magneto-electric machine through dilute sulphuric
  acid by means of platinum electrodes, was here reproduced in a
  most remarkable manner. When the coils were immersed in
  the tub of fresh or salt water, or in dilute sulphuric acid, it was
  observed that not a single bubble of gas arose to the surface of
  the liquids, no matter for how long a time the powerful alter
 nating currents from the 5- and 10-inch intensity-armatures
  were transmitted.
     156. That these currents were capable of producing energetic
 electrochemical effects, simultaneously with the non-appearance
 of gas in the tub, was proved by introducing into the circuit at
 N a pair of large platinum plates plunged in a glass vessel con
 taining dilute sulphuric acid, when an abundant liberation of
 the mixed gases from each of the plates occurred, while at the
 same time no gas was liberated from the coils in the tub. Hence
 it seemed as though the alternating current could be transmitted
 through the same kind of liquid, either with or without electro
lyzation, by simply varying the arrangement of the electrodes.
     157. When, however, the direct current from any of the
armatures was transmitted through the double coil, the passage
of the current was in           all
                              cases accompanied                by
                                                       the liberation                   of
hydrogen from the liquid          which the coil was immersed.

dually became red-hot, while the thicker wire at N, though
hotter than could be endured by the finger, was not made
visibly red during the maintenance of the battery-contact.
    161. On reversing the battery-connexions, by joining the end
A to the platinum and the end B to the zinc by means of the
thicker wire at N, this wire immediately became bright red-hot,
while the thinner wire at CD remained cold; but on continu
ing the battery-contact for about a minute, the thicker wire at
 N gradually became less bright, until it finally ceased to be
visibly red, when the thin wire at CD again became red-hot;
and as often as the battery-connexions were reversed, so often
did the wires at the battery and distant ends of the coils become
alternately, but never simultaneously red-hot.
    162. Another phenomenon attending the alternate heating of
the iron wires was the liberation of hydrogen from the double
coil only during such time as the thin wire at CD was main
tained at a red heat, but never while the thicker wire at N was
heated; for as often as the battery-connexions were reversed,
the liberation of hydrogen from the coil immediately ceased, and
did not reappear until the thin wire at CD was reheated.
    163. Moreover, on making and breaking contact between the
ends A, B of the double coil after they had been maintained in
connexion with the Grove’s cell for a short time with the ends
 C, D disconnected, sparks could be obtained from the coil for
more than five minutes after all connexion with the electromotor
had been broken ; the galvanometer, as might have been expected,
always indicated a strong secondary current from the coils, in
 the reverse direction to that transmitted by the electromotor.
    164. From a consideration of the foregoing experiment, made
with the view of explaining the absence of any appearance of
electrolyzation of the water in the tub by the alternating currents
from the electromagnetic machines, it will be evident, from the
heating of the thin wire at C D when contact was first made
between the battery and the double coil, that the hydrogen
evolved by the electrolyzation of the water formed an insulating
envelope surrounding one of the conductors, which thereby
enabled a considerable portion of the current from the electro
motor to traverse the conductors instead of being transmitted
through the water.      But when the battery-contacts were re
versed, the cessation of the stream of hydrogen from the coil,
and the non-heating of the thin wire at CD, indicated the re
union of the hydrogen envelope with the liquid in contact with
the conductor; while the hydrogen evolved by the new current
on the other conductor did not become visible until      itsaffinity
for the oxide produced   by  the  previous current had been satis
fied. But    by continuing the battery-contact,    a new hydrogen

lous exception which Faraday thought                 had discovered     hehis                            to

                     in Magnetism and Electricity.                      99
 own law of definite electrolysis, when experimenting with a similar
 pair of plates, had no real existence.        Nevertheless, as exception
 might probably be taken to the fact that the coil was made of an
 oxidizable metal (though       I have no doubt that a coil of platinum
 wires would behave in      precisely   the same manner), and in order
 that a question that has excited so much discussion amongst
physicists, and is still regarded by some as an undetermined
 point in electrical science, might be definitely settled, I was       in
 duced to repeat Faraday’s experiment as nearly as possible in
the manner in which he himself conducted it”, but with certain
 variations which suggested themselves to me while observing the
effects produced by the alternating current from the single
 Grove’s cell upon the double coil when immersed in the tub of
salt water.
    170. Two glass vessels, Q and R, fig. 15, were filled with the
same dilute sulphuric acid, spec. grav. 1:25.           The vessel Q con
 tainedasingle pair of amalgamated zinc and platinum plates, which
 were connected respectively, by means of thick copper wires,
with two platinum plates immersed in the vessel R. On introdu
cing a very sensitive galvanometer, or a bit of bibulous paper
saturated with a solution of iodide of potassium, into the circuit
of one of the connecting wires, the deflection of the needle or the
evolution of iodine indicated the passage of an electric current
through the liquids in both vessels; but no matter for what
length of time connexion was maintained between the electro
motor Q and the electrodes in R (by means of the thick wires),
no liberation of gas appeared on the platinum plates in either of
the vessels.    Hence it was that Faraday inferred that a feeble
current might be transmitted from an electromotor without the
electrolyzation of the liquids in contact with the electrodes.         So
                              I
convinced, however, was that the absence of any appearance of
electrolyzation in this case was due to the resistance and reac
tions of the nascent gases enveloping the platinum plates in Q and
R, that it only appeared necessary for me to alternately invert
the direct current from the electromotor Q, before it arrived at
the electrodes in R, in order that the same recombination of gas
on the electrodes and increased discharge from the electromotor
might be brought about as when the alternating current from
the Grove’s cell was transmitted through the coil immersed in
the tub of salt water.
    171. This alternation of the direction of the current was
effected by means of a commutator, S, fig. 15, placed between the
vessels Q and R.       Care was taken that the alternating metals
of the commutator were separated from each other by a sufficient
thickness of insulating material to prevent the metals which re

a commutator, instead of that from a magneto-electric machine.
He also found that an alternating current meets with less resist
ance when transmitted through an electrolyte than does the
direct current from the same voltaic battery, and rightly conjec
tured that the non-appearance of the gases liberated by the
alternating current was due to their recombination on the surface
of the electrodes. Moreover De la Rive, in common with many
other physicists, has maintained that the transmission of the
current, and the electrolyzation of the liquid in contact with the
electrodes, are inseparably connected.                     I
                                               do not, however, find
that  any  one has  yet  given a direct proof,  or one free from am
biguity, that the transmission of a current of so low an intensity
as that used in Faraday’s experiment is dependent upon the elec
trolyzation of the liquid through which such current is trans
mitted.     Hence it is that up to the present time the absolute
generality of the law of definite electrolysis has been doubted
by some philosophers, and has never acquired more than a high
degree of probability with others.
   175. Returning to the phenomena exhibited by the conduc
tors when in contact with the terrestrial bed:—It has been shown
that  all

                              of                                     the                  by

                in

machine, which would not heat thin wire when the conductors
were coiled up separately         the canal  in       the tubor      in

could be endured by the finger, the result thereby indicating a
greater amount of resistance to the passage of the current into
the earth than that which the salt water in the tub presented to
the passage of the current between the same conductors when in
the form of a double coil. This difference of resistance to the
passage of the current, according as the conductors were extended
in the sea or coiled up together in the tub of salt water, coincides
with the difference which we have already observed when the
same conductors were coiled up in the tub of fresh water and
extended separately in the canal (115, 147).

the current from the 24-inch machine was sufficient                  melt                                 4
inches        of
             thin wire        N; whereas the current from single

hot (176, 177).
    187. That the increase of discharge from the 24-inch machine
into the sea above that which was transmitted into the canal
from the same electromotor, under like conditions, should be
attended by a corresponding diminution of electrodynamic effect
 at the distant point C, D, was only what might have been ex
pected from the results already obtained in the canal: thus,
when the current from this machine was transmitted through
 the conductors extended in the sea, the amount of current ar
riving at C, D would only make # of an inch of the thin wire
red-hot; whereas when the conductors were extended in the
 canal, the current from the same machine would melt, at C, D,
 3 inches of this same wire. When, however, a single Grove’s
 cell was connected with the conductors extended in the sea, the
current arriving at the distant point was, owing to                  compara                      its
tively low intensity,              so
                              little diminished that would make                 it                                an

  creasing the conductivity of the water, and thereby facilitating
  the discharge of the electromotor into the earth.
     200. When contact with the electromotor was made in such a
  manner that the platinum termination of the conductor H formed
 a positive electrode, 0.36 of a cubic inch of oxygen was generated
  in the eudiometer in one minute.
     201. On reversing the polar connexions at the electromotor,
 so that the platinum should now form a negative electrode, 0.73
  of a cubic inch of hydrogen was generated in the eudiometer in
 one minute.
     202. A large platinum plate was now substituted for the small
  strip of platinum at the extremity of the conductor H, and the
 eudiometer-tube was replaced by a glass jar, into which the pla
 tinnm plate was introduced.
     203. On transmitting the current from the machine into the
 earth so that the platinum plate formed a positive electrode, the
 magnitude of the current was sufficient to melt 3 feet of iron
 wire 035 of an inch in diameter at N, and to generate, in six
 minutes, 20 cubic inches of oxygen, which represent the trans
 mutation of 6.92 grains of water into the same number of grains
 of gaseous oxygen at the ordinary atmospheric pressure and
 temperature.
     204. On reversing the polar connexions, so that the platinum
 now formed a negative electrode, 20 cubic inches of hydrogen
 were generated in three minutes, which volume of gas repre
 sents the transmutation of 0:43 of a grain of water into the
same weight of gaseous hydrogen.
    205. These experiments, besides exhibiting in the most stri
king manner the electrolyzation of water when in contact with the
terrestrial bed, also show, by the volumes of oxygen and hydro
gen generated in equal times, and by the times occupied in the
evolution of constant volumes, that these gases were evolved at
the electrodes in the proportions in which they enter into com
bination to form water.
    206. In order that no reasonable doubt may be entertained
that the oxygen or hydrogen evolved from the electrode in the
pool had no relation whatever to the oxygen or hydrogen libe
rated on the surface of the conductor extended in the canal, I
will just add another observation to those already made in proof
of the independent action of the electrodes when plunged into
masses of liquid of planetary dimensions.        In the summer of
1861 I had the good fortune to witness, near Manchester, the
effects of a discharge of lightning on a piece of copper wire
which had been used by my direction for the purpose of esta
blishing a connexion between a line of telegraph and the signal

                         in Magnetism and Electricity.                      109
ling-instruments.          One part of the copper wire happened to be
placed in close proximity to the copper lightning-conductor of a
factory chimney, while another part of the same wire passed
within an inch or so of touching a thick iron gas-pipe connected,
of course, with the underground mains. The lightning, it would
seem, in its passage between the clouds and the earth, finding a
much easier path by way of the copper wire and gas mains than
 by way of the lower extremity of the lightning-rod terminating
 in the moist earth, melted and volatilized a length of about 15
 feet of that portion of the copper wire which extended between
 the lightning-conductor and the gas-pipe.
      207. Now the power which atmospheric electricity, or elec
  tricity of tension, possesses of effecting the electrolyzation of
  water is so well established” that no reasonable doubt can be
 entertained that the fusing of the copper wire in the instance
 above mentioned was attended by the electrolyzation of the water
  in contact with the metal gas mains, in the same manner as the
  current from the 10-inch intensity-armature, which fused 3 feet
  of iron wire at N also, simultaneously electrolyzed the water in
  the pool. But in the case of the electrolyzation of water at the
  lower extremity of a lightning-rod, the very foundation of any
  mutual action which might be supposed to exist between the
  positive and negative electrodes of an electromotor discharging
  itself into the earth is entirely removed.
      208. Moreover, as the electrolyzation of the water in contact
  with the inferior extremity of a lightning-conductor is indepen
  dent of the length of conductor extending upwards above the
  surface of the earth, it would follow that if it were possible to
  prolong this conductor through space to a planetary body (Mars,
   for example) containing the same electrolyte as that forming
   part of the terraqueous globe, or if such a line of metal were
   extended between two aqueous spheres of planetary dimensions
   (fig. 17), then would a current of electricity traversing this line
   of metal (according to the polarity of the electrodes) transmute
   the water of each of these spheres either into oxygen                or into
   hydrogen alone.
       209. Though I have been at considerable pains to prove ab
   solutely that the passage of an electric current from a conductor

into water is in every case accompanied by electrolyzation, yet                                                   I
have nowhere ventured to affirm that it is impossible for water
to conduct an electric current without electrolyzation when no
 electrode is present; since it is only at the surfaces where the
 electrode and the electrolyte touch each other that the electro
 lytic phenomena are really manifested, and, so far, the presence
of an electrode composed of a substance heterogeneous to that
 which is in course of electrolyzation is essential to the absolute
 ness of the law of definite electrolysis.   Now there is no evidence
 whatever to show that water, whether in insulated vessels or in
contact with the earth, conducts an electric current after it leaves
the electrode in any way different from that in which the current
is propagated in solid bodies such as metals; and consequently
no hypothesis founded upon a contrary, assumption             has any
claim to be admitted.    When,    therefore,  the positive or negative
electrode of an electromotor is    plunged    into a body  of water in
contact with the earth, it seems to me that the corpuscular motion
of the electrode, by the very act of communicating itself to the
 molecules of water in immediate contact with        transforms them                it,

 112          Mr. H. Wilde's Eaperimental   Researches
 made to develope     themselves at the will of the experimenter,
 either suddenly,  by  explosion, or gradually, in the form of the
 oxyhydrogen-flame.
    214. As the electrolytic products, as we have seen, are only
 manifested and obtained at the point where the generating or
 conducting aqueous circuit is interrupted by an electrode, just
 as the spark only occurs at the point of interruption of the me
 tallic circuit in air, so a theory framed upon the supposition
 that the transmission of an electric current through a closed
 metallic circuit depends upon a succession of invisible sparks
following each other through the solid portions of the conductor,
might be supported with the same amount of plausibility as an
hypothesis based upon the assumption that the propagation of
an electric current through a closed aqueous circuit (212), or
through the homogeneous portions of a liquid, after the current
leaves the electrode, is dependent upon a series of imperceptible
decompositions and recompositions of the whole of the electro
lyte traversed by the current.
    215. That the evolution of electrolytic oxygen and hydrogen
from water is an operation of transmutation, and not one of de
composition, was further shown by the converse experiment of
the reconversion of oxygen or hydrogen alone into water.      The
strip of platinum terminating the conductor H (197) was intro
duced into an inverted test-tube 4} inches long and # an inch
internal diameter, the upper half of which was filled with hydro
gen and the lower half with acidulated water.       The lower end
of the tube was then immersed in the     pool  of acidulated water
 (199); and the platinum electrode, exposed to the hydrogen and
water in the tube, was made positive, by placing the conductor
H in permanent connexion with the platinum terminal of a single
cell of the nitric-acid battery; while the zinc terminal of the
same cell was connected with the conductor extended in the
canal.
    216. After connexion between the battery-cell and the elec
trode in contact with the hydrogen and water in the pool had
been maintained for about five hours, the water had risen in the
tube one inch and a half, thereby indicating the transmutation
of a corresponding volume of hydrogen into water.
    217. On substituting an equal volume of oxygen for the hy
drogen in the tube, and making the platinum electrode negative
by a much more feeble current than that used in the preceding
experiment, the water completely filled the tube in about thirty
hours, thereby indicating the transmutation of the whole of the
oxygen into water.
   218. From these experiments we may justly infer that       if a

                              in Magnetism and Electricity.                113
feeble electric current were generated in any manner in a me
tallic conductor extending between two aqueous spheres of pla
netary dimensions, and if one of these spheres were surrounded
by an atmosphere of oxygen and the other sphere by an atmo
sphere of hydrogen, then would the negative and positive elec
trodes terminating the extended conductor transmute the oxygen
envelope of one sphere and the hydrogen envelope of the other
sphere into water.
   219. That the views which I have enunciated respecting the
transmutation of water into oxygen or into hydrogen, and the
new facts which           I
                     have adduced in support of them, should not
have been previously touched upon in some way, would indeed
have been surprising, considering the number of powerful intel
lects which have been engaged in the field of electrochemical
science during the present century.       Thus we find Davy, in the
course of some     experiments   on the   electrolyzation of water in
contact with globules of mercury on which oxide was formed
without the apparent liberation of free hydrogen, suggesting the
                          I
same idea which have been engaged in demonstrating, viz. that
water might be the ponderable basis of both oxygen and hydro
gen +; but he hesitates to adopt so formidable a conclusion, as
in no other case could he obtain one gas without the correspond
ing quantity of the other, or without some product into which
the other gas might be supposed to enter.             Subsequent re
searches on the power which hydrogen in the nascent state
has to combine with the oxides, have fully justified this suspense
of judgment.      But in following up this speculation in the case
of the electrolyzation of water when the positive and negative
electrodes of the powerful battery of 2000 double plates of the
Royal Institution were plunged into separate vessels of water,
connexion between them being established through the human
body by inserting a finger in each vessel, this philosopher would
hardly seem to have been just to his original conception; for
had he not attempted to account for the phenomena by the
theory of transfer, or been hampered with the hypothesis that
the liberation of the oxygen and hydrogen in the separate ves
sels depended upon a series of decompositions        and recomposi
tions of the liquids extending              all
                                     the way between the two elec
trodes,
             he no
            other conclusion could have been arrived              at

  action of his gas battery presents to the electrochemical theory
  of Grothuss, which makes the propagation of the current between
  two electrodes dependent upon a series of decompositions and re
  compositions of the water through which the current is transmit
  ted”. Grove’s objection to the theory is this:—In a single pair of
  the gas battery we must, according to the theory of Grothuss,
  suppose that oxygen and hydrogen in their separate states tear
  asunder oxygen and hydrogen already united—the force which
  produces the composition of water being in fact regarded by the
  theory as sufficiently strong to overcome the force by which                                                  its
  constituents are already held together. Grove also points out that
  the gas battery presents cases            which, according
                                                         in         this theory,               to

the various notions which have up to the present time been held
on the nature of water, it is highly important that a proper esti
mate should be taken of the powerful influence which the chro
nological order in which some discoveries in physical science are
made has in establishing in the minds of philosophers of one
generation ideas of causation and composition which are looked
upon as absurd by philosophers of another. Thus we find that
water, up to the time of Cavendish and Watt *, was considered to
be an element, simply on account of the inability of chemists to
convert it into anything else; while the present notion of the
compound nature of water rests entirely on the inability of mo
dern chemists to obtain water from oxygen or hydrogen alone,
or to obtain either of these gases alone from water.
   223. Now, had the chronological order in which the experi
ments described in this paper and those of Cavendish and Watt
were made been reversed, the doctrine of the transmutable na
ture of water would at once have been accepted, as agreeing
strictly with observation and experiment.    But the theory of the
atomic composition of water, if broached for the first time at the
present day, would be summarily rejected as not accounting
either for the evolution of oxygen or hydrogen from water form
ing part of the terraqueous globe (200, 201), or for the recon
version of either of these gases alone into water (216, 217).
   224. Nor would the theory of Grothuss under these altered
circumstances meet with any better reception at the present day
than would be accorded to the theory of the composition of water,
because the former theory, as we have seen, breaks down com
pletely when called upon to account for the electrolyzation of pla
netary masses of water by means of a single electrode, or when
the distance between the two electrodes is considerable ; and yet,
although the theory of Grothuss was invented solely for the
purpose of reconciling the phenomenon of the electrolyzation of
water with the theory of                    its                  f,

   Thus the occurrence of two of the four values of which has                                                     f
been shown to be susceptible is at once accounted for; and if we
reflect that almost universally when an equation of the second
order is integrable by Monge's method, there are two equations
of the first order of the form (2 a) from each of which it is sepa
rately derivable, there cannot, I think, be a doubt that the four
                                                      f
values above derived for must be attributable to the values off
        f,
and     in equation (12), and to the corresponding functions in
the other first integral of (2).
   Acting from this clue, we shall be justified in assuming, and
we shall find it to be the fact, that when the equations of condi
tion (10) are satisfied, (2) will be susceptible of the two following

a deposition of the little-soluble acid carbonate on the surface of
the cake and in the pores of the paper.      Not to lose too much
ammonia, the salt was collected in a slightly damp condition.
Sample III. was the same preparation as II., but was subjected to
a much longer process of drying, with, however, little apparent ad
vantage.
  The substance IV. was the semicrystalline solid which is left
when the commercial carbonate is first treated with ammonia so
lution.   It was dried as was II., and behaved similarly, except
that it had no lustre to lose. - Lastly, W. was the crystalline form
of the carbonate obtained by dissolving the commercial carbonate
(freed from adhering acid carbonate) to saturation in water
mixed with some strong solution of ammonia, and then keeping
the solution cool for a couple of hours in ice.    It was not pre
pared with much dispatch for analysis; and the numbers ob
tained show evidence of marked decomposition having occurred.

Th;         modified spectroscope presently to be described was
        arranged some time ago by me, for the purpose of supply
ing   a deficiency long felt in using the ordinary form of spectrum
apparatus.
     I believe     all
                  who have much employed the delicate and beau

 analysis, will agree with me that the ordinary single-prism
arrangement         is        by    no
                          means well suited for use        the routine                     in
work     of chemical   laboratory.   When the   eye    the operator                   of                   is

beyond easy control. Practice will,           course, overcome much  of
of the difficulty attendant upon this circumstance; but for rapid
and satisfactory work          always necessary
                                         it   is     obtain the aid              to                        of

XVIII.      The Internal Motions                    of Gases compared with the Motions
     of   Waves of Light. By G.                     Johnston E STONEY, M.A., F.R.S.
        To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
         GENTLEMEN,                              Dublin, July 14, 1868.
        HEfollowing pages are a collateral inquiry in a memoir on
      the Constitution of the Atmospheres of the Sun and Stars,
which was sent to the Royal Society in May of last year. They
are now separated, as it has appeared desirable to shorten that
memoir.     Could you spare space for them in the Philosophical
Magazine : Their aim is to make quantitative estimates in regard
to the internal motions of gases, which, though rough, may suf
fice for a preliminary comparison of these motions with the mo
tions of the waves of light.
    For the sake of perspicuity and to avoid wearisome periphrases,
free use is made of the hypothesis that the lines of motion within
gaseous molecules are or resemble orbits. All that we really know
about them is that they are periodic, and that their periods are
the same as those of the waves of light to which they give rise.
But there is the same convenience in thus speaking in the lan
guage of a definite hypothesis, which has been provisionally
adopted for the sake of this convenience, as there is when we
speak of waves of light,                  its
                           transverse vibrations, and the lumini

be allowed to expand without a change of temperature, d and l
become larger, while the velocities are but little changed from
what they were before”.                     If
                            the gas be changed for another, for
instance if hydrogen be substituted for oxygen at the same tem
perature and pressure, the number of molecules remains the
same, d also remains the same, l is probably a little altered.
But the mass of each molecule is now but one-sixteenth of the
mass of each molecule of oxygen; and to compensate for this,
the velocities with which the molecules move are 16° or upwards
of 250 times as swift.                                          -
   3. The molecular motions consist of two very distinct parts—
the motions of the molecules among one another, and the mo
tions in the interior of each molecule.       In an eminently gaseous
body the former of these classes of motion engrosses a large part
of the vis viva t, but the motions are irregular, and on this
account, as well as probably because they are too coarse, they
are unfitted to absorb or develope vibrations in the luminous
aether, except possibly in a very small degree, just as the wa
ving of the hand may produce a slight sound. So far, there
fore, as the rectilinear motions of the molecules are concerned
the gas will be eminently transparent. But each molecule is also
a little separate system, the constituent parts of which are in                                     s
energetic motion among themselves.             These minuter motions
are interfered with   by the  neighbouring      molecules only during
the instants when the    path  of a molecule is being deflected upon
 itsclose approach      another molecule; and
                             to                        the intervening
                                                                           in as
times when the path         rectilinear are long
                                      is              comparison with
these brief instants, the internal motions           each little systemof
will    befor the most part undisturbed and therefore regular.
And accordingly             we
                       must presume that          they which influence
                                                               it     is
the  aether, producing  those  bright   lines which constitute nearly
the whole    spectrum         incandescent gas, and are

                                    the aether, absorbing these same
 rays.   How wonderfully regular the internal motions                the                 of
 molecules   are, and    the same time how
                                 at              complex, appear                          to   be
  *  That the velocities will be somewhat altered seems evident when we
bear   inmind the great change which, when       gas expands, has been effected
                                                       to a

   4. Another and quite different case which probably exists is
where, in virtue of forces acting within the molecule, the periodic
time of a motion within it is subject to fluctuation, going through
a regular cycle of changes over and over again.         In such a case,
instead of a line in the spectrum we should find a band of defi
nite breadth, and usually with well-defined edges, as in the
spectra of silicon and zinc.     It may be observed that this kind
of fluctuation,  unlike that which is attributable to a disturbing
agent external to the molecule, seems quite as likely to affect
motions of long as motions of short period; and accordingly the
species of bands of which it is probably the cause are met with
indifferently in      parts       all

142          Mr.    J.   Croll on Geological Time, and                           the probable
astronomy and geology, viz. that geology deals with unlimited
time, as astronomy deals with unlimited space.   A little consi
deration, however, will show that there is not much analogy be
tween the two cases.
   Astronomy deals with the countless worlds which       spread                                    lie
out   inthe boundless  infinity space; but  geology     of
                                                     deals with
but one world. No doubt both reason and analogy are favour
                                                                                                               of to no its

                        it   is      But when we compare the age

                                       magnitude, we must not take the
age   ofone        of    its
                     members      (say,  our globe) and compare        with                          it

period not exceeding something like 100 millions of years.
Taking the age of the earth’s crust at 100 millions of years,
which probably is a high estimate, how long is it since the mate
rials which now form these Laurentian rocks were laid down in
the ancient sea-bottom in the form of sand and mud : This is a
question which no one can answer; for we have no means of
knowing how much of the 100 millions of years were exhausted
before the Laurentian age. At           events,         all
                                                     must      very consi     it             be

   Sir William Logan thinks that the time which separated the
limestones containing the Eozoon Canadense from the Upper
Cambrian period may              great be  the time which elapsed be
                                              as              as

elapsed since the Cambrian period.          Assuming that the glacial
epoch began about        quarter a                 is of

the course of 3 millions of years past is inconsistent with the
evidence of geology on that point.            This, however, is at least
very doubtful.        It is quite possible that these three millions of
years may embrace the greater part of the Tertiary period. Now
we have evidence of at least three ice-periods since the beginning
of the Tertiary period—one about the middle of the Eocene
period, another during the Upper Miocene period, and the third
and last the well-known glacial epoch”; and it is quite possible
that the evidence of more may yet be found.
   But before discussing the nature of the evidence which geo
logy affords of the existence of former glacial periods, we shall
turn our attention briefly to Tables II., III., and IV. These
three Tables embrace the three periods of greatest excentricity
during the past 3 millions of years. The excentricity, longitude
of the perihelion, &c. are given at periods of ten thousand years
apart.
   There are still eminent astronomers and physicists who are
of opinion that the climate of the globe never could have been
seriously affected by changes in the excentricity of                  orbit.                          its
This opinion results,                         no

purely astronomical one. Viewed from                  astronomical stand         an
point,          as
             has been    already   remarked,   there      actually nothing            is
from which any one could reasonably conclude with certainty

the longitude of the perihelion of the six periods marked with
an S are copied from a letter of Mr. Stone to Sir Charles Lyell,
published in the Supplement of the Phil. Mag. for June
1865; the eight periods marked L are copied from M. Lever
rier's Memoir in the Connaissance des Temps for 1843. For
the correctness of everything else, both in this Table and in the
other three,            I
                alone am responsible.
   Column IV. gives the number of degrees passed over by the
perihelion during each 10,000 years.    From this column it will
be seen how irregular is the motion of the perihelion. At four
different periods it had a retrograde motion for 20,000 years.
Column W. shows the number of days by which the winter ex
ceeds the summer when the winter occurs in aphelion. Column
VI. shows the intensity of the sun’s heat during midwinter,
when the winter occurs in aphelion, the present midwinter
intensity being taken at 1000.         These six columns comprehend
all the astronomical part        the Tables.    Regarding the correct

 winters occurred in aphelion, the heat of the sun at midwinter
 would only equal 837 instead of 1000 as at present. Consequently,
if it takes 1000 parts of heat to maintain the temperature 278°
 above the temperature of space, 837 parts of heat will only be
 able to maintain the temperature 232*7 above the temperature
 of space; for 232°7 is to 278 as 837 is to 1000. Therefore,
 if the temperature was then only 232*7 above that of space, it
 would be 45°-3 below what it is at present.                  -
    This method of calculating how much the temperature is
 lowered by a given reduction of the sun’s heat is that given by
 Sir John Herschel in his “Outlines of Astronomy,’ $ 369 a.

voured to show that this method is not rigidly correct.                       It
results from the principles of the dynamical theory of heat,
and is also supported by experiments made by Professor Draper,
of New York, and others, that the rate at which a body radiates
its heat off into space is not directly proportionate to                 abso                         its
lute   temperature.     The rate         which       body

its  temperature rises, increases more rapidly than the tempera
ture. As.        body rises
                   a                temperature, the rate
                                           in                         which                 at                     it
radiates off its heat increases; but the rate            this increase        of
                                                                            not                           is
uniform, but increases with the temperature; consequently the

by subtracting the numbers in column VII. from 39°, the mid
winter temperature.         Column IX. shows the midwinter tempe
rature of the centre of Scotland, on the supposition that the
Gulf-stream was diminished in volume in proportion to the ex
centricity.     In former papers it was explained how a change of
excentricity must affect ocean-currentst.           -                   -
   I  have not given a Table showing the temperature of the
summers at the corresponding periods. This could not well be
done; for there is no relation at the periods in question between
the intensity of the sun’s heat and the temperature of the
summers.       One is apt to suppose, without due consideration,
that the summers ought to be then as much warmer than they
are at present, as the winters were then colder than now.            Sir
Charles Lyell, in his ‘Principles,’ has given a column of summer
temperatures calculated upon this principle. Astronomically the
principle is correct, but physically it is totally erroneous, and
calculated to convey a wrong impression regarding the whole
subject of geological climate.        The summers at those periods,
instead of   being  much warmer than they are at present, would
in   reality be far colder than they are now, notwithstanding
the great increase in the intensity of the sun’s heat resulting
from the diminished distance of the sun.              If a country is
free from snow and      ice,  then no doubt the temperature    will rise
during summer as the intensity of the sun’s heat increases; but
when such a country is enveloped in perpetual snow and ice,
the temperature of the summers will never rise much above the
freezing-point, no matter what the intensity of the sun's heat
may be. The physical reason of this was explained on a former
occasion f.    In a country covered with ice, the direct heat of
the sun is often very intense, in fact scorching. It will raise
the temperature of the mercury in the thermometer exposed to
the direct rays of the sun, but it fails to heat the air. Captain
Scoresby, for example, when in lat. 80° 19 N., found the side
of his ship heated by the direct rays of the sun to about 100°,

while the air surrounding the ship was actually 18° below the
freezing-point.    On another occasion he found the pitch melt
ing on the one side of the ship by the heat of the sun, while
water was freezing on the other side from the intense coldness
of the air.
    The mean temperature of Wan Rensselaer Harbour, in lat. 78°
37° N., long. 70°53' W., was accurately determined from hourly
observations made day and night over a period of two years by
Dr. Kane. It was found to be as follows:—

But although the quantity of heat received from the sun at that
latitude ought to have been greater during the summer than in
England", yet, nevertheless, the temperature is only 1°38 above
the freezing-point.
    The temperature of Port Bowen, lat. 73° 14' N., was found to
                                                                     -

Here the summer is only 2°4 above the freezing-point.
    If we go to the Antartic regions, where the influence of ice is
still more felt, we find the summers even still colder. Capt. Sir
James Ross found, when between lat. 60° and 77° S., that the
mean temperature never rose even to the freezing-point during
the entire southern summer; and when near the ice-barrier on
the 8th of February, 1841, a season of the year equivalent to
August in England, he had the thermometer at 12° at noon, and
 so rapidly was the young ice forming around the ships that it
was with difficulty that he escaped being frozen in for the
winter. And on the February of the following year, when he
again visited that place, he had the thermometer standing at 19°
at noon, and the sea covered with an unbroken sheet of young
 ice as far as the eye could reach from the mast-head.          This
 extraordinary low temperature at that season of the year was
 wholly owing to the presence of the ice. Had there been no ice
on the Antarctic continent, Sir James would have had       a summer

   Now, during the glacial epoch, when Europe was almost
covered with snow and ice, the summers could not possibly have
been much warmer than they are at present in Arctic and Ant
arctic regions. In other words, during the glacial epoch the
mean summer temperature would be very little above the freez

   It    is clear that,        the case we are now considering, the collective

   For, if M be the momentum lost by collision when the velocity
before impact is uniform and equal to W, it is clear that when the
velocity before impact is represented by V—W, the quantity V, may
be such that the momentum before impact may be finitely less than
M; from which it follows inevitably that the amount of momentum
lost by collision in this latter case must be less than M.
   Let us now vary the data by supposing that the velocity before
impact increases instead of diminishes as we recede from the surface
of collision, so that at the moment of impact, before taking account
of the effects of collision, the velocity at any point of the impinging
cylinder is represented by W--W, instead of           V-V.
   It is clear that the momentum abstracted by the collision in this
latter case will be greater, and finitely greater, than in the case
where the velocity before impact is uniform and equal to W. Let the
additional momentum abstracted in this case be M, the whole mo
mentum so abstracted being represented by M+M,.
   Let us now make a final variation in the conditions of the problem,
by supposing that at the moment of impact, and irrespective of the
impact, a velocity equal and opposite to W is communicated to each
particle of the impinging cylinder, so that at that instant, without
taking account of any action of the one cylinder upon the other,
the velocities of the two cylinders along their surfaces of contact
will be equal, or, rather, will be alike zero, at the same time that
at every other point of the impinging cylinder there will be a vari
able velocity V, increasing in amount as we recede from the surface
                                                                                   *
of contact.
   In estimating the effect of the cylinders being in contact under the
circumstances last described, it is clear that the abstraction from each
particle of the impinging body of the velocity V can only be regarded
as preventing the transference to the second cylinder of so much
of the momentum M+M, as that velocity, if it had constituted the
entire velocity before impact of the impinging body, would have
given rise to, viz. M,-and that the momentum Me whose appearance
in the expression M+ M, is due to the fact of the first cylinder
having been originally endowed with the variable velocity V, in ad
dition to the constant velocity V, will still continue to be transmitted
to the second cylinder from the first.
   We are thus led to this singular and, doubtless, pregnant conclu
sion, that in a continuous material system in which there is neither
discontinuity of velocity nor discontinuity of density,          all   the con
sequences    of  collision may occur, viz. the instantaneous transmission
of   afinite amount       ofmomentum from one part      of   the system  to  an
other, provided    we     have  discontinuity    in
                                                  the  tendency to  compression
    the different parts        of
                                the system.

  1. “On the Disposition     of Iron in variegated Strata.”     By
George Maw, Esq., F.G.S.
  In this paper the author gave detailed descriptions of the pheno
mena of variegation in rocks of various ages and composition, with
numerous analyses of the differently coloured portions.    The con
clusions at which he had arrived were the following:—(1) That
the assumed production of the colouring-matter of red beds from the
decomposition of Iron Pyrites appears untenable.        (2) That the
bleaching of red beds by the reducing action of fossil carbonaceous
matter will not account for the facts of variegation.   (3) That this
bleaching and nearly every form of variegation of red beds are caused
by the passage of iron from the discoloured areas, unaccompanied
by any change of combination, excepting the invariable conversion
of the anhydrous into the hydrated peroxide. (4) That the arrange
ment of the iron has not been produced by solution.       (5) That it
has in some cases been produced by a variety of evident conditions
independent of mere chemical reaction, while in other cases it seems
to have occurred arbitrarily. (6) That it is unaccompanied by any
 other change in the combination or position of the constituents of
 the stratum, and appears to be wholly independent of        chemical      its
 constitution, any simple chemical theory being,    short, insufficient
                                                               in
 to account for the movement           of
                                 the iron.  (7) That the motion has
 sometimes taken place centripetally         and sometimes centrifugally.
 (8) That the partial conversion              of
                                           the carbonate        protoxide

 chemical causes      ofvariegation.    Other causes are the conversion               of
 the red   anhydrous   into the yellow hydrated peroxide, the secondary
 formation  of  the bisulphide and the several stages             decomposi

 tion in    mechanical association with the      peroxide,   and,  lastly, the
 infiltration of  lime and   magnesia   into red beds.     (9) That some              of
 the more complicated forms are due partly          segregation, and partly
                                                          to
 to   changes  of  combination.      (10) That the ferruginous banding                of

  2. “On the older Rocks of South Devon and East Cornwall.”
By Harvey B. Holl, M.D., F.G.S.
  The author divided the rocks of the district to which the com
munication referred into a Lower, Middle, and Upper South-Devon
Group, and stated that the lowest beds were brought up along a
line of country extending from Dartmoor by Kingston Down to the
Brown Willey granite, where they formed a broad anticlinal axis.
These rocks are unfossiliferous, and may not be lower in the series
than the base of the Ilfracombe group of North Devon, or the highest
part of the group immediately below             the latter being more pro

of   mean size, and the commutator     be so turned as to close the se
condary circuit, a platinum wire more than 2 metres long and 3
millim. thick can be made incandescent for a few instants.         Che
mical decompositions requiring great tension may also be shown,
as well as physiological effects and a voltaic arc of short duration.
In fact, we obtain for a brief space the same effects as are produced
by a battery of fifty-five to sixty elements arranged in a series.
    The calorific effects produced by this apparatus might be used for
firing mines, and the physiological effects for medical purposes.
    In short, the secondary battery with lead electrodes enables us to
obtain either powerful temporary effects of quantity from a conti
nuous source of electricity of small quantity, or powerful temporary
effects of tension from a continuous source of small tension.
    This concentration of the work of the battery is doubtless only
obtained through the intervention of a chemical action, and is
effected with the losses inevitable in every organ of change.     There
is not, as in the case of induction for instance, the direct production
of one physical effect by another physical action; but the final result
is none the less an accumulation or a modification of electrical force
which can be utilized in certain circumstances.
    These facts show, moreover, the importance of the part which
secondary currents must play in electrochemistry, and the applica
tions which may result therefrom.—Comptes Rendus, June 22, 1868.

observing thefirst deviations was retained, since, as appears from the
numbers given below, the values obtained on repeating the same
experiment agree as closely with one another as can be expected
in such experiments. The vessel serving as source of heat was,
in the first place, so turned that the radiating surface was ver
tical and turned to one side (say, to the left).          It was then
turned horizontally towards the ceiling, then vertically towards
the other side, and finally horizontally towards the floor. For
each of these positions the magnitude of the deviation was de
termined by turning the reflecting mirror in succession vertical
towards one side, then horizontal towards the ceiling, and ver
tical towards the other side.     The construction of the apparatus
did not allow of                its
                      being turned horizontally downwards.
   For each      these positions the observation was repeated three
                     of
times, and the mean       these observations, taken immediately one
                                      of

rected upwards       downwards, we should have expected equal

from the radiating vessel and from the neighbouring bolt-head

166       Prof. Magnus on the Polarization of Heat at 100° C.,
   Upon the radiating surface of the tinned-iron vessel a transpa
rent glass plate of 1 millim. thickness was now fastened.      It is
clear that the temperature   assumed  by  the outer surface of this
glass plate was lower than that of the metallic face upon which
it was fastened, and from which it derived its heat. Nevertheless
the quantities of heat which it delivered are much greater than
those radiated from the metal plate. This superior action of the
glass cannot be due to                     its
                            sending out heat from     entire mass;                                        its

allow heat     100°of       pass through.

no polarization at all; and herein lies a further proof that the

       XXIII.    On the General Solution of Algebraic Equations.
                By THoMAs P. KIRKMAN, M.A., F.R.S.*
A*       algebraic equations can be solved as clearly as the cubic
       and the quartic, that of the (n+1)th degree after that of
the nth, by the use of the following theorem, and of familiar.
algebraic operations.
   Let any of the various ways of writing the group O of IIn
substitutions made with the n elements 1, 2, 3,..., (n-1), n, as
a product of n-1 groups, be this,
                   Q=G2. Ga, GA.              .   . Gn–2.   Gn-1. G.,
where G, is a group of the                rth order, in which the n—r final
elements are undisturbed.
   Let H        be any given asymmetric function of the n variables
w), a 2, as,   ..., a,which has TIn values by their permutations.
   Let G, . H’      be the sum            of the n values of H; made by the
substitutions of Ga, and let
                                        G. H'-J;
be the ath power of that sum.    It is here convenient to write
the exponent a in an algebraical sense over G, ; and it can ob
scure nothing, since           G.,   considered
                                        -
                                                      as    the group product         G,G,
is simply Gn.
   Also let
                              G#-1.     G. H'-G}_1.J.
be the bth power of the sum of n—l values of            which are           J.
made on the group Gn-1; and so on.
    And let Tºn be the group of the m cyclical permutations of the
first m elements, the remaining n—m being undisturbed.
    We can construct without any difficulty, except tedious alge
braic routine, the function following, for any given system of
positive exponents that we desire,

XXIV.       On certain Objections to the Theory of the Equivalent of
    Refraction.      By Dr. ALBRECHT SchBAUF, Custodian of the
    Imperial Mineralogical Cabinet of Vienna +.
           a cursory examination of the optical literature of the past,
ON we          find numerous essays, of various dates, which, being
based upon the theory of emission, have denied the correctness
of the hypothesis of vibration. The idea of refractive power               in
troduced into optics by Newton appears to have the same pur
port (Schicksal).        Besides these older investigations, the most
recent work of Rühlmannt are intended to show the inapplica
bility and incorrectness of the refractive power. Since in the
above-named investigation several of my previously published
conclusions on this subject are declared to be erroneous,               I take
this opportunity of placing these objections in their proper light.
      I imagine, moreover, that there are many assertions in M.
 Rühlmann's criticism which he would not have published if he
 had not ignored, for reasons unknown to me, my later investiga
 tions—both those on “Equivalents of Refraction”f (1865), and
 my “Studies”.S published in December 1866. These two                       in
 vestigations, compared with my former publications (1862), con
 tain many new points of view, and precisely in that very field
 which M. Rühlmann has chosen as the starting-point of the
 discussion.       It appears, indeed, that the doubts now published
 by M. Rühlmann concerning the theory of refractive power were
 considered and explained by me in the course of the preceding
 y €ar.                      -
      If  we examine the results of M. Rühlmann's important work
 on the Thermo-optical Constants of Water, the first point which
 demands        some attention is the sentence on page 202|, “That
 the    magnitude     M given by Schrauf is by no means a constant,
 but     continually  varies with the temperature.”
      The variation of the refractive power with the temperature,
 however, is not unknown to me, and received my mature
  consideration long ago.           In my “Studies,” p. 69,           I  stated
  a    year   previously,    “A uniform result of the calculation,
 however, is that the values of M (refractive power) diminish
  with increasing temperature.              The obvious objection here
  arises, that, in consequence of this observation, the function

 of the dependence of the refractive index upon the density of
 the body is not absolutely exact.     To this objection it must,
 however, be replied that this chapter (‘the Variation of the Den

 determine the correctness or incorrectness of a function: the
 variations of the density of the body and         index     refraction                          its          of

                                 have in Chap. XIX. § 131, dis
cussed the action of conducted heat upon light.
   The developments carried out on pp. 352–354 are based essen
tially on the following fundamental propositions.
   On the accession of free external heat, an alteration takes
place in the length of the molecular paths and the rate at which
they are traversed;     hence an alteration in the volume and
temperature.     The changes in these two (length and rate), how
ever, do not take place symmetrically, and they may have the
same or opposite signs.    In the latter case a contraction may
take  place on increasing the temperature of a body, or an expan
sion on cooling             it.
   We are taught                  by
                       Fizeau's observations that       the case                            in                        of
certain solid bodies the indices of refraction increase even when
the temperature increases.     My calculations        the refractive                   of
power     liquid bodies show that the refractive indices diminish
            of
more rapidly than      due     the alteration

 by the temperature.
   For the explanation       this fact  of  must assume that the      we
amount        heat entering the body has
             of of                             twofold effect. The          a

tion diminishes, while the other increases with elevation of tem
perature, it follows that the influence of heat is considerably
influenced by the internal grouping of the atoms around the
axls.
   Although, however, this secondary influence of temperature
has long been known to me, I do not feel on this account in the
least compelled to regard the theory of refractive power as in
correct.  The following are, amongst others, my reasons:—

                              have said, “Many hypotheses are

The first      that the forces
                is              X, are dependent upon the chemical
properties. More attentive consideration, however, shows that
there can            be    no

hence led        the hypothesis that the retarding forces X, are

     action of the change of volume declares itself in the law of the
     refractive power; the change in the molecular path has, on the
     other hand, a secondary, very insignificant positive or negative
     influence upon the function X, of the luminous propagation.
                                                                                                                           .
         The proof of these statements is given by the numerous data
     in my “Studies.”     However, I may here collect the most im
     portant facts to prove that, by comparing different bodies for
     equal temperatures, even of the most diverse volumes, we
     look upon the retarding forces X, as constant, or even as equal.
     According to formula (II.), the constancy of M proves the con
     stancy of        X.

       The comparison of these numbers leads us to maintain the
Newtonian refractive power M, since the latter are either equal
or simple multiples.     In the Biot's formula m no such uncon
strained agreement can be seen.      Even the law of simple factors
is here of no    avail, although  it is evident that undetermined
factors are also necessary for m.

   No agreement can be perceived from these numbers between
the optical values of these substances (which are so nearly allied
chemically), although such agreement was clearly manifested in
the above comparison of the values of M.
   There are some who certainly will not fail to point to the
small deviations of M from the absolute values of the multiples.
        I
But think that every one who considers the matter impartially
will recognize the law of multiples as that which determines, in
the first approximation, the numerical values of the elements.
And hence        I
              consider that the above comparison has sufficiently
proved that the optical function of the elements shown by the
Newtonian refractive power M follows the law of serial factors.
  I  consider that such a regularity, when we fully consider the
analogous chemical series, furnishes a further proof of the cor
rectness of the views which I have hitherto held.
   Finally, I must mention the important fact that have suc             I
ceeded, by means of the optical atomic numbers (also a conse
quence of my equation I.), in deriving the crystalline form of
compounds from the volumetric values of the elementary atoms

occurring in the compoundt.
   Thus one relation follows another in an unconstrained man
ner, and no one is in contradiction with the facts.    The hypo
theses which have been hitherto forced     simplify themselves in
many respects, and unexpected new relations appear at every
step.
  In the preceding            I have        declared   my adhesion    to the   hypo
thesis  of simple factors, and I even consider such an hypothesis,
similarly to the method of volumetric calculation, necessary to
establish the truth and possibility of an optical function.
   I must here add that the defenders of the formula (u-1)W

M. Haagen takes for chlorine a value 12 higher, m'(Cl)=979,
than corresponds to the observation of the isolated element.
     Haagen,     it is true,
                         by means of this higher value for chlorine,
gains the power of deriving the refractive equivalents of the chlor
hydrocarbons under the assumption of a small mean error.          But
the above  example  of terchloride of phosphorus   shows that the em
ployment of mean values may easily lead to mistakes.           myself                             I
in my “Studies,” in considering the organic series, could have
adopted many more simple derivatives for               if had neg                  \,        I

ences for the refraction between observation         and calculation
from the elements are certainly small, and    many cases very              in                         a
simple derivation from the elements       possible. But such        is                                            a

Mr. W.                    F.    BARRETT, during
                                             visit to Dublin last spring,
          showed an uncommonly beautiful electrical experiment,

tises on electricity, but appeared to have since dropped out of
recollection.    I do not find any reference to it in such books as
I  have access             to to.

             as it
long      the jar remains sufficiently
charged.
     The explanation may      conveniently      be
divided into two parts—one respecting
the distance      which the fragment
                           at                                                       of
gold-leaf will establish itself, and the
other explaining how        weight    sup its                  is
ported.
        At   all
          distances the strip      charged               is
 by induction, electricity unlike that                                              of

 Mr. G.          J.      Stoney on the Eaperiment of Mahomet’s Coffin.                                                          189
is drawn to the nearer end, precisely equal quantities of both
kinds being simultaneously evolved.       Now, if the strip be far off,
in which case the    positive electricity of the knob will act with
very nearly equal effect upon the two ends of the strip, positive
electricity will escape from the sharp end more freely than nega
tive from the blunter end.     The strip will therefore become ne
gatively charged and be attracted.        On the other hand, if the
strip be very near the knob, the difference between the forces
with which the electricity of the knob acts upon the nearer and
further ends will become so great that the negative electricity
will be made to flow inwards, in spite of the bluntness of the
inner end, more copiously than positive electricity escapes out
wards. Here, then, the strip would become positively charged
 and be repelled.    There is therefore an intermediate distance at
 which neither the repulsion nor the attraction preponderates; and
 at this distance the strip in the first instance places itself, or at
least would place itself if it were devoid of weight.
    The gold-leaf may be regarded as acted on by three forces:—
the relief of atmospheric pressure due to the attraction of the
electricity of the knob upon the negative electricity of          nearer                                               its
end (this        force directed towards the knob); the similar relief
                     is  a
of  atmospheric pressure due          the repulsion        positive elec

tricity, which        force acting

weight       the gold acting downwards.

                         one side of the strip were lower than

forces are both feebler and more horizontal.     The attractive
forces therefore tend to restore the transverse diameter to its
horizontal position, the repulsive forces tend to draw it from it;
and which of them it will obey depends on whether the attrac
tive or repulsive forces have the greater moment round the longer
axis of the strip.   But if the moment of the repulsive forces pre
ponderate, the plane of the strip becomes vertical, and any

briefly  to state, with reasons for rejecting them, the theories
hitherto advanced.
   The theory       Aguilonius supposes that

                                            of             their point      at                         of
convergence, and parallel         the line joining the centres
                                       to                              the                        of
two  pupils—and     consequently    that the two    images     any object            of
situated  in this plane, occupying,         they necessarily do, one and
                                                       as

the other at a distance from this, say, # of an inch, and direct
his optic axis to the former, he will not see the two images of
the latter as one, though their object is situated in the plane
mentioned, but as two distinct images, the one beyond the
other.
   Experiments to the same effect might easily be multiplied;
but the one given abundantly demonstrates the inaccuracy of
the theory of Aguilonius.
   The theory of corresponding points, so called (as held on phy
siological grounds by Galen, Alhazen, and Newton), cannot be
denominated a theory of vision. It is directed to the accounting
for but one of the phenomena of vision, that of single sight with
two eyes. It does not deal with visible direction and distance,
whereas these conditions, governing, as they do, external visible
position, include the result of single sight with two eyes as a
necessary consequence.
    The theory of vision propounded by Dr. Smith in his ‘ Optics,’
and that by Dr. Wells, from which he derives his explanation of
the phenomenon of single vision with two eyes in his ‘Essay on
Single Vision with Two Eyes,” are practically (as           trust will              I
satisfactorily appear hereafter) merely attempts to formulate the
misapprehensions by consciousness of true visible distance which
take place under the influence of habit. A simple experiment
subversive of both these theories may be made thus.           Let two
small objets, as pins in a board, be placed directly in front of the
middle point between the eyes, the one at some short distance,
say, 6 inches, and the other at some more considerable distance,
say, 18 inches, and             let
                          other two small objects      placed      op       be                 on

     a distance of 11% inch from the two images (seen in like man

   Or, to change the form of statement, the entire impressions on
the retinae, before becoming objects of consciousness, are projected in
space upon surfaces bisecting each other (perpendicularly to the
plane of the aires) at an angle greater or less according to the dis
tance—the component points of each impression being simultaneously
referred outward in lines passing from them through a point a little
behind the centre of the crystalline lens, but, eacepting the earpan
sion and the inversion resulting from the crossing in the eye of the
directions of outward reference, undergoing no change of relative
position—the distance between the planes passing at right angles to
the optic aris through any two of the successive concentric zones of
points which make up the retinal impression continuing the same.
   I do not mean here to assert that an outward projection actu
ally takes place, but that the effect of such a projection produced
by an intermediate process of mind is presented to the consci

pine board whose opposite great surfaces are rectangles parallel
to one another, 13 inches long and 8 inches wide, with five pins,
furnishes the means for obtaining accurate results where the
distance between the near and             far points does not exceed 12
inchesºk.
     To use this contrivance (supposing the distance from                   the
middle of the line between the centres of the eyes to the near              ob
jective point to be 6 inches, and from the near to the far                  ob

inch from the short side SR, and 5 inches from the long side
R F, take the point A. Through this point and at right angles
to the side S R draw a line NO. In

 draw another line PL.          In this latter “ IT         B|     Tº   D

tant 21, inches from the point B, and
4% inches from the other; and finally
 41% inches from the point B take the
 point D. At each of the points so
 taken set a pin.        Now place the board
 in a horizontal       position  a little below
 and parallel to the plane of the axes,
 with the pin at A 6 inches from the                           /

 of the eyes, and, together with the pin
 at B, in the vertical plane which bisects
 this line at right angles; which disposition of the pins is had
 when, looking at the images of the pin at A, the left eye's image
 of the pin at T and the right eye's image of that at T are found
 lying in the axes.
      When now the axes are fixed upon the images of the pin at A,
 the right eye's image of the pin at B will be seen in the same
  line of no variation as the left eye's of the one at D, and at a
  point a little beyond where the latter is seen; and when they are
  fixed upon the images of the pin at B, the left eye's image of that
  at A will be seen in a position a little before where the right eye's
  image of a pin, set nearly 11% inch directly to the right of A,
  will be seen, the distance between these being sensibly less than
  that between the images received from B and D when the axes
 were converged toward A.
     * Another board of the same width and 18 inches long, serving as a
  support to this, to be held with one end against the nose by the hands
   pressing both pieces at the sides, will be found serviceable for maintaining
  steadiness of position.

distance          of A, the axes be fixed upon the images of the  pin at B,
then the image of the pin at A seen by the left eye, and that of
a pin placed nearly 11% inch directly to the right of A seen by
the right eye, will be found lying in the same perpendicular of
no variation, the latter beyond the former, the distance between
the two images being less than in the first case.
    In experimenting with this instrument, the position of the
image of the pin at B seen by the left eye in a surface at right
angles to the optic axis of that eye is visibly realized.         For when
the axes are fixed toward A (as in the first        instance),   the image
of the transverse     piece  seen from the left   eye  visibly  has a posi
tion at right angles to the axis of that eye, and intersects the
corresponding image of the right eye, in a line of common inter
section crossing each image where that image, whether referred
back to the retina or to the distance of the transverse piece itself,
would be pierced by the optic axis.
    In making these experiments, care should be taken not to
turn the axes into the oblique directions, to do which there is
 always a strong inclination; for then the images which were
 seen in those directions as described, the one before or behind
 the other, would be seen coincident.
    I  will now proceed to answer an apparent objection. In the
 first demonstration under my proposition,                      I
                                                      undertake to show
 that the   impression   on the left  eye  from B becomes visible and
 is seen at b, by showing that it is seen a little behind where the
 impression on the right eye from an object placed at D is seen
 by the right eye, arguing that nothing else than a projection in
 the manner described can account for the local relationship in
 which these impressions are seen. The evidence of conscious
 ness, then, that these impressions are seen in a certain local
 relationship, is made the groundwork of my argument. Now it
 may be urged that the evidence of consciousness is equally
 strong that the impression from the object at B on the left eye,
 when seen, lies in the axis of the right eye at the actual distance
 of the object itself at B+.
     In the first place,          let   us
                                    determine whether consciousness,
 when    carefully   examined,   does really continue        find this im

converging the axes toward A, till the right eye's image of the

than that of the convergence of the axes are not apprehended in
 their true visible positions in the surfaces of vision.
   Why, then, does consciousness mistake, precisely as we find
it doing, the true place of the visible image of any object, lying
not at the point of intersection of the axes, nor at any point
equally distant with this from the base of vision*:
    My answer                 is,
                    that under tendencies resulting from experi
ence, consciousness   apprehends erroneously the distances really
presented for                its
                  action according      the laws     vision, and with  to                        of
respect    each lateral image apprehends the distance
               to                                             the sur                                              of

        vision from the base      vision, and the distance   of    the                                                       in
surface from the  image     the centre, for the distances that would
                                               at
exist between these surfaces and these images               the given                                      if

  But habits created by magnitude may cause mistakes of                                  vi
sible distance involving also the image in the avis.
    Thus, for example, if the mind has been accustomed to ap
preciate the images of mountains of moderate magnitudes, thereby
tendencies will be impressed upon it to appreciate moderate                              di
mensions with images of this class.         Hence, when the image
of a mountain of extraordinary magnitude is presented (in an
ordinary state of the atmosphere), consciousness will be influ
enced to appreciate the dimensions as less than they really are,
and, in order to this, the distance from the base of vision as a
 duly less one. And the effect on any concomitant images, as of
 trees or animals, would be a like seeming diminution of their
 visible magnitudes.     For it is plain that if consciousness makes
 a mistake of distance, then, in obedience to the law of habit, it
 will assign that size which the image would really have at that
 distance, or that effect of lateral distance, or resulting expansion,
 which the divergence of the lines of direction would give at that
distance.

bright incandescence by an electric current, and surrounded by
a glass globe having an aperture in front.           Before this was a
cell, C, with moveable rock-salt sides to contain the liquid under
examination.       Before this, again, and precisely opposite, was a
thermo-electric pile, P, fitted with                      its

                                       still found a larger amount
of heat fall on the   pile in both cases on pouring the opaque
liquid into the cell. When a glass cell an inch deep was used,
the heat falling on the pile was raised 3 per cent. by the opaque
liquid. When a glass cell 12 inch deep was employed, a similar
increase of fully 5 per cent. was produced, and this by the intro
duction of a liquid so opaque that at this thickness it intercepted
all the light    the brightest sun.

seen  to  divide themselves into two groups:—
    First. Those where an increased transmission attended the
introduction        moderately diathermic liquid films between plates
                     of
either  of  rock-salt        glass; and

thicknesses        the same liquids

of the most diathermic liquids known. The index of the bichlo
ride is nearer that of glass and rock-salt than the index of the
bisulphide, just as might be expected.        Melloni has stated that
7-7 per cent. of the incident rays are reflected from a single
polished plate of rock-salt.*. Although this figure is probably
rather too high, still there can be no doubt that any moderately
transcalent liquid, when poured into a cell whose walls were suffi
ciently near together, would, by                               its

greater or less degree, if the density of the body introduced ex
ceed that of the medium it replaces.                     -
    It was  easy to see the truth of this reasoning   by tracking the
course   of a pencil of luminous rays through the empty and full
cell. The light of the red-hot spiral that formed the source of
heat was received on a semitransparent screen placed behind a
 glass cell half an inch deep.   The beam was seen on the screen
 as a luminous circle 1:7 inch in diameter.      Filling the cell with
 bisulphide of carbon, the diameter of this circle contracted to
 1.6 inch. When the cell was half full, the effect of the compa
rison between the upper and lower half of the
 circle was very striking; this is shown in
fig. 3.     With the cell 3 inches deep the
 luminous circle c c was diminished from 2-4
 inches, when the cell was empty, to 1-8
 inch, when it was filled with bisulphide of
 carbon.
    This observation    explains the effect no
 ticed when bisulphide or bichloride of carbon
 was poured into deep glass cells; for though
 sometimes concentrated by a rock-salt lens, the rays from the
 source were always more or less divergent, and overlapped the
 area of the pile.   Lessening the divergency of the incident rays
 ought to diminish the effect; and this, by experiment, was proved
 to be the case. Hence also with parallel rays no concentration
 of the beam could take place on the introduction of the liquid,
 and with convergent rays a decreased amount of heat should
 reach the pile when a dense medium occupies the cell.
    But why should not an increase occur with rock-salt as well as
 with glass cells    This anomaly puzzled me a good deal at first ;
 for, on consulting the Table of refractive powers, there does not
 appear to be any reason why such a difference should exist.          I
  think, however, the answer to this question is mainly to be found
 in the difference between the diathermancy of rock-salt and
 glass. Rays of heat pass through the former substance with
 but little alteration in their quality or quantity; but in passing
 through the latter, their character is changed as well as their
 amount lessened ; after passing through one plate of glass they
 traverse a second plate with less absorption.      It may be that the
 bisulphide of carbon absorbs somewhat the same class of thermal
 rays as glass; the heat-tint or thermochrose of the two bodies is
 possibly alike. Assuming this to be the case, when a cell with
 glass sides is used, the absorption of the liquid would be so far
 reduced that the action of the causes tending to increase the
 transmission would become evident.       On the other hand, with a

       Determinations    of the Absorption of Heat by Liquids.     215
rock-salt cell the heat-rays would not be sifted in any sensible
degree, and hence the absorption by the deep layers of liquid
which were employed would be sufficient entirely to mask the
opposite effect observed with a glass cell.       I regret that when
making these experiments it did not occur to me to try how far
the foregoing assumption is true, by causing the beam to pass
through a plate of glass before it entered the rock-salt cell;
and now I have not the opportunity of making this crucial test.
But the following experiment, which strikingly shows the influ
ence of sifting, may be taken in support of the view here stated.
The divergent rays direct from the source of heat used through
out these experiments were caused to pass through an empty
glass cell ; an inch deep.       Falling on the pile, they gave a de
flection represented    by  100.   Filling the cell with bisulphide of
carbon   augmented     this number to 110, or an increased heat of
10 per cent. The cell was emptied, replaced, and a second cell
3 inches deep, already filled with bisulphide of carbon, was inter
posed in the path of the rays from the source. The beam had thus
to traverse 3 inches of bisulphide of carbon before it reached the
empty cell, so that on passing through an additional        inch of the
same liquid, but little or no further absorption would take place;
and the action of the liquid in concentrating the rays should thus
be more pronounced. Representing by 100 the radiation through
the 3-inch stratum of liquid and the empty #-inch cell, filling
the latter with bisulphide of carbon raised this figure to 120, or
an increased heat of 20 per cent.         Compared with the former
observation, this experiment shows that even in a glass cell at
least 10 per cent. of the total radiation is absorbed by a layer
# an inch thick of bisulphide of carbon; much             more likely,
therefore, is it that in a rock-salt cell the absorption by deep
layers of liquid should disguise the causes tending to augment
 the transmission.
    Finally, it may be asked if pouring the bisulphide of carbon
into a glass cell increases the heat reaching the pile, how is it
 that Melloni, who, as is well known, used glass cells in his experi
 ments on the diathermancy of liquids, does not mention the factº
                            I
 This is accounted for, believe, by Melloni’s method of experi
 ment: he did not determine the transmission through his empty
 glass cell first, and then through the liquid added to the cell; but
 noting only the free radiation to his pile, he then introduced the
 cell and liquid at once. Consequently he assigned an absorption
 to some liquids which probably was wholly due to the glass walls
 of his cell. Hence it is that whilst Melloni states a layer of bi
 sulphide of carbon 36 inch deep absorbs 37 per cent. of the heat
 from an argand lamp, Dr. Tyndall, who used a rock-salt cell and

216      On Determinations    of the Absorption of Heat by Liquids.
a better method of experiment, finds the absorption by a corre
sponding thickness of liquid under 20 per cent.*
   Summing up the results of this inquiry, the main points are
as follows. :—When the more diathermic liquids are introduced
between two plane parallel plates of rock-salt separated by a very
small interval, the rays from an artificial source are found to be
more freely transmitted than when air intervenes between the
plates. For a space 02 inch wide the increased transmission
amounts with bichloride of carbon to about 12 per cent., with
bisulphide of carbon to 9 per cent., and with chloroform to 4-5
per cent.    This effect disappears and less heat is transmitted (1)
when the    transcalency  of the liquid diminishes; e. g. the same
thickness of sulphuric ether intercepts 30 per cent. of the heat
previously passing through the empty cell; (2) when the distance
between the plates is increased beyond, say, Ty of an inch in the
case of bisulphide, and <U+017F>º of an inch in the case of bichloride of
carbon. The increased transmission by these liquids reappears,
however, in thicker layers when plane parallel glass plates are
 substituted for rock-salt, and continues, apparently indeed aug
menting, as the depth of the cell increases, so far as the experi
ments were carried.      Bisulphide of carbon, poured into a cell
 with glass  sides 1-2 inch apart, increases the heat falling on the
pile 6 per cent, and bichloride of carbon a still larger amount.
Altering the temperature or nature of the source, the size of the
aperture in a screen behind the cell, or the position of the cell,
makes no material change in these results.          But altering the
 character, or augmenting the thickness, of the walls of the cell
has considerable influence.     For example, if the cell-walls be of
glass, increasing their thickness from one- to three-tenths of an
inch raises the heat falling on the thermoscope 6 per cent, when
equal depths of the selfsame liquid are poured into the cell.
Again, by merely changing the parallel sides of the same cell
from rock-salt to precisely similar plates of glass, the very same
liquid can be shown to intercept a certain quantity of the heat
falling on the thermo-pile in the one case, and to augment that
 quantity in the other—the difference amounting to upwards of
10 per cent. of the total radiation through the empty cell.
    * Dr. Tyndall has pointed out (Phil. Trans. 1864, p. 328; Phil. Mag.
vol. xxviii. p. 439) how seriously the glass cells used by Melloni must have
influenced the results of his experiments.     Melloni, indeed, saw this him
self, but endeavoured to prove, by trying two of his liquids between rock
salt plates, that the error vanished in the thickness of liquid he employed;
(La Thermochrose, pp. 163 and 199). The liquids chosen were colza         oil
and water—the worst     he   could have selected; for had Mellomi made the
comparison with more diathermic liquids,     he   would have discovered his
error.                                            -

  Mr. Barrett on the Combination of Rectangular Vibrations.        217
     The explanation of the foregoing facts may be traced to two
 main causes.      The increased transmission noticed with films of
 the more diathermic liquids chiefly arises from the reduction or
 abolition of the reflection taking place from the interior surfaces
of the walls of the cell, owing to the optical density of the liquid
introduced being nearer to the cell-walls’ than that of the medium
it replaces.     But in glass cells of considerable depth, retaining
the former explanation, the augmented heat there observed is
probably mainly due to an effect of the refraction of divergent
rays by plane surfaces; this gives rise to a concentration of the
beam, which becomes sensible when accompanied by a great
transcalency of the liquid in the cell. In similar cells with
rock-salt ends the effect is not observed, probably on account
of such cells sifting the beam far less than glass, and thus
permitting a higher absorption of the liquid.              Nevertheless
even with rock-salt cells the causes alluded to must necessarily
render, to a certain extent, incorrect the precise absorption
hitherto attributed to liquids.        These sources of error in de
termining the true absorption by a liquid or solid can, how
ever, be avoided by employing truly parallel rays; and these
are best obtained from the sun.
    In   conclusion   I would  add that  I do not pretend the observa
tions contained in the      foregoing  paper  can in any material way
affect    any portion   of the celebrated researches on radiant heat
which Professor Tyndall has so long conducted.             On the con
trary, to my mind, they add lustre to that research, by showing
in some degree the difficult and delicate nature of the inquiry.
In fact this little investigation of mine is not of such importance
as to merit even this reference, were it not that         I speak from
the sincere and     jealous  attachment of a  disciple to his master.

218            Mr. W. F. Barrett                  on a    Simple Method                    of Exhibiting

      Instructive
treme costliness of the apparatus necessary for their proper ex
hibition has hitherto debarred many from repeating them.
   A more simple method of combining rectangular vibrations
was long ago devised by Mr. Wheatstone, who employed for
this purpose a slender prismatic rod of steel, fixed at one end,
and free to vibrate at the other.   One of the sides of the rod
 was filed away, until the vibrations were quicker in one direction
 than the other by a certain definite ratio. When pulled aside
the rod compounded these vibrations, and the resultant motion
became apparent by the movement of a silvered bead attached
to the free extremity of the rod. The labour of filing away the
steel, and the necessity of having a separate rod for each com
bination, has practically prevented this instrument coming into
use.     Beyond a most ingenious mechanical contrivance for re
presenting the combination of vibrations,            am not aware that            I

unfrequently an author, unable to guess what will be the forthcoming
educational plan, writes without a definite idea of any kind to guide
him, unless it be that of addressing some particular class of students
at a given school; and if one insists wholly on the inductive me
thod, another asserts the necessity of much deductive preface, while
a third is lost in transcendental speculation.               A great deal of this
confusion     might    have been avoided        by  assuming     the independent
attitude and      occupying     the   lofty position   of the older writers.     At
the end of the last and beginning of the present century, for example,
it was no doubt the intention of such chemists as Macquer, Lavoisier,
Davy, and Thénard to place within the student's reach a manual
which should exhibit chemistry as a whole; it                     the main, works        is,   in
of  such    a nature that were then most extensively read. Even where
 detail was avoided rather than given, the reader could never have
 felt the impression from such book                    fragmentary.

the fifth contains an inquiry as to whether anhydrous salts form
supersaturated solutions; and the sixth and last part is a summary,
with a classified list of the salts examined.
   1. Definition.—When water at a high temperature is saturated
with a salt, and, on being left to cool in a closed vessel, retains in
solution a larger quantity of the salt than it could take up at the
reduced temperature, the solution is said to be supersaturated.
    2. History.—During many years the phenomena of supersatura
tion were studied with reference to solutions of Glauber's salt.         In
1809, Ziz of Mayence” showed that the sudden crystallization of
these solutions is not due to agitation; that the vessels containing
the solutions do not require to be hermetically sealed, but if put
under a bell-glass, or loosely covered (as with a capsule), they can be
preserved during a long time; that solids brought into contact with
the solutions act as nuclei and produce instant crystallization, but
that such solids act best as muclei when dry; if wet or boiled up
with the solution, they become inactive. The most efficient nucleus
is a crystal of the salt itself. Air, if artificially dried, ceases to be a
nucleus.      Three varieties of the sodic sulphate are noticed, i. e. the
anhydrous and the ordinary 10-atom hydrate, and also a peculiar
salt formed when supersaturated solutions in closed vessels are left to
cool down. This a salt, as it is termed, contains less water of crys
tallization than the ordinary salt, and is more soluble.                If
                                                                 the vessel
in which it is formed be suddenly opened, or the mother-liquor
touched with a nucleus, the mother-liquor instantly solidifies into
the 10-atom hydrate, and the a crystals become opaque, like the
boiled white of an egg.
   In 1819 Gay-Lussact referred the state of supersaturation to the
inertia of the saline molecules, the molecular condition of the sides of
the vessel, and other causes.      He also showed that solutions of some
other salts exhibit the phenomena of supersaturation.          In 1832 the
number of such salts was shown by Dr. Ogden                  f
                                                       to be not less than
twenty-one,
   In 1825 Faraday S published some experiments on the supersa
turated solutions of Glauber's salt.      Graham||, Turner", Ure, and
others also contributed new facts; but the most elaborate inquiry
was by M. Löwel between the years 1850 and 1857, the results of
which are contained in six memoirs”.        According to this writer, the
ordinary 10-atom sodic sulphate increases in solubility from 32° to
93°2 F., at which latter temperature it begins to fuse in          water    its        of
crystallization, and      deposit the anhydrous salt. This salt follows

  motes or dust that prevent or lessen adhesion between it and the
  aqueous part of the solution, and apparently render an inactive solid
  active. When a glass rod &c. has been kept in water or passed
  through flame and dried, or cooled out of contact with the air, it is
  more or less chemically clean, and remains so while sheltered. When
  Ziz found a knitting-needle active on one solution, and by pass
  ing it through the cork which confined a similar solution it became
  inactive, he simply made the wire chemically clean by the friction.
  Air is not a nucleus, and when it appears to act as such, it is simply
  as a carrier of some solid particle not chemically clean.         Hence
  narrow-necked flasks when opened retain their solutions liquid longer
  than wide-necked ones, as the former are less likely to catch motes
  &c. from the air than the latter.     Supersaturated solutions are best
  preserved by plugging the necks of the flasks &c. with cotton-wool,
  since in cooling down the air is filtered in passing through the plug,
  and motes and dust are thus kept back.
     Tubes made chemically clean by the action of strong sulphuric acid
 may be filled with a strong solution of sodic sulphate, and when cold
 the tubes may be placed in a freezing-mixture at 10°F, without any
 separation of the salt.    Hence the author differs from M. Löwel's
 theory, which supposes a molecular change to take place when strong
 solutions of the salt are cooled down below 60°. Supersaturated solu
 tions of various salts were cooled down to various temperatures from
 32° to 0°F, without crystallizing.       Sodic acetate, for example, was
 kept for some hours at 14°, when on touching it with a wire it became
 solid, and the temperature rose to 104°.      Sodic arseniate, sodic suc
 cinate, sodic borate, sodio-potassic tartrate, potash alum, and other
saline solutions were treated in this way.       Some of these solutions
become viscid at a low temperature, and do not immediately crys
tallize on removing the cotton-wool plug.         If they be touched, or
º
the side of the flask scratched with a chemically clean wire, there
is no action; but if the wire be not chemically clean, the scratches
immediately become chalky white by being covered with minute crys
        the salt, and the action then spreads until the solution becomes
SOI.101.         -                                                 -
    Some salts that are not very soluble in water, such as the plumbic
acetate,   form highly charged supersaturated solutions, and retain
their liquid state below ordinary atmospheric temperatures.         When
at a certain point they suddenly solidify.       Other solutions   merely
deposit the excess of salt above the condition of supersaturation,
leaving the mother-liquor saturated; the cupric sulphate is an ex
ample of this.
   The memoir contains a number of details respecting the action of
nuclei, whether derived from the air, from the flask, from the salt
itself, from the filter, or the cotton-wool used in closing the vessels.
If the solution touch the wool, crystallization immediately sets in ; or
if the upper part of a chemically clean tube be touched with a finger
slightly greasy before filtering into it the hot solution, the latter will
cool down to the temperature of the     airwithout crystallizing, nor will
there      be
            any effect

that   a modified salt may be deposited, denies that it is due to any
molecular change that takes place in the solution, either from reduc
tion of temperature or any catalytic property of the sides of the

is the anhydrous salt that is held in solution, a portion of which is
thrown down as the temperature falls; and this anhydrous deposit,
entering again into solution, forms a dense substratum containing less
water than the upper portions, so that when the modified salt forms

   The object of this paper is to exhibit the phenomena of diurnal                             in
equality in the tides on the coasts of India, and describe the mode
adopted by the author for obtaining formulae based on astronomical
elements for predicting them. It is accompanied by the following
records of observations, given in a diagram form —

  The height and times predicted by the author for 1867, and
published by the India Office, are given on the diagrams for that
year, so that they may be compared with actual observation.

    water time.   In  particular cases, the actual values of height and time
    of diurnal tide   may   be directly deduced from the values of diurnal
    inequality.    From these it was found that diurnal tide follows the
    moon’s movements at a much shorter interval than semidiurnal, the
    retardation of the former being from two to three hours only, while
  ...that of the latter is from thirty-four to thirty-six hours.            -
       The mode adopted for identifying the varying        values  of diurnal
  inequality with their physical causes was then explained. A hypo
   thetical series of diurnal tides, based on the varying values of the
   declimation of the sun and moon, was calculated, the necessary local
   constants being deduced from the particular cases in which their
   values could be directly obtained.       These hypothetical diurnal tides
   being combined with a series of semidiurnal tides deduced from the
   diagram of observations, the diurnal inequalities so obtained were com
   pared with the actual diurnal inequalities.     It was then found that a
   further element was wanting, which was approximately and provi
   sionally obtained by the introduction of a second empirical diurnal
  lunar tide of twelve inches maximum half-range at Bombay, and
   six inches at Kurrachee.       This tide was assumed, like the first and
  principal diurnal tide, to be dependent on the moon’s declimation,
   but to vanish at intervals of two or three days, before the moon
   crossed the equator. The author expresses an opinion that this em
  pirical correction might probably be superseded by one more con
  sistent with physical causes, if more extended and more correct
   observations were subjected to investigation.
       Lastly, the comparison of calculated heights and times with the
-  records of observations for four months at Bombay and eight months
  at Kurrachee were given. This showed that three calculated tides
  out of four were correct within three inches in height and fifteen
  minutes in time, the errors of the remainder ranging up to nine
  inches in height, and thirty minutes in time.
       Since receiving the observations made at Bombay and Kurrachee
  in the year 1867, the author has subjected them to another process
  for obtaining the actual times and heights of diurnal tide, which
  has been more successful than that described in the paper.
      The only data made use of were the diurnal inequalities in height
  at high and low water—the range of semidiurnal tide and the diurnal
  inequality in time, which were necessary to the previous process,
  being now altogether disregarded.
      The diurnal inequalities in height were obtained by measuring the
  widths of the brown spaces where they were crossed by the vertical
  lines representing noon on successive days. The two daily values
  thus obtained are respectively the sine and cosine of an angle which
  represents the difference in time between semidiurnal and diurnal
  tide. Dividing the low-water by the high-water value gives the
  cotangent of that angle, and thence the angle itself.       Thus the time
  of actual diurnal tide (first in relation to the time of semidiurnal low
  water, and then in relation to solar time) was obtained.
      The actual range of diurnal tide was obtained by adding together
  the squares of the high-water and low-water values (sine and cosine),
  and taking the square root of the sum.

   With these two series of results as ordinates, curves were drawn
representing times and ranges of actual diurnal tide, which were thus
presented in a convenient form for comparison with the diurnal tide
which had been previously calculated.
   The comparison confirmed the previous conclusion that the tide
based on the simple declination theory was insufficient; and the em
pirical correction which had been adopted seemed to provide an ap
proximation to the required addition to      both     time and height.   it,             in

                                                         at

differ from each other. The bulk and height        the Quaternary de               of
posits had strengthened the conviction which           expressed     his                 he                   in
previous paper (on the Amiens gravel), that there was long period,                             a

        Mr. A. Tylor on the Quatenary Gravels of England.            233
reaching nearly to the Historical epoch, in which the rainfall was
 excessive, and which he termed the “Pluvial period.”
   These sections also led the author to the following conclusions:—
 (1) That the débris was deposited by land-floods, and that the mode
of deposition was quite distinct from that of moraines produced by
the melting of ice.      (2) That the character of the deposits in the
valleys of the Aire, Taff, and Rhonda proves that they were formed
under similar conditions.        (3) That these gravel-beds point to a
Pluvial   period of great   intensity and duration.    (4) That the ice
action of which there is evidence was subordinate to the aqueous
action.     (5) That the fossiliferous Quaternary deposits have been
best   preserved where they have been formed in cavities lying be
tween the     edge  of the bank of a river, estuary, or sea, and an
escarpment running parallel with it at no great distance. (6) That
the immediate source of the gravels was the high land adjoining the
rivers, whence they had been washed down by rain, with the assist
ance of lateral streams, to the lower ground, where they had come
into contact with larger quantities of running water, had been mixed
with rolled materials, and spread in thick beds over the bottoms and
slopes of valleys or the sides of escarpments. (7) That the surface of
such a deposit rarely slopes at more than 2° or 4°, while the slope
of the beds lower in the series near the escarpment averages 12°.
The escarpment is usually concealed under a coating of gravel or loess.
   Mr. P; RESTwich dissented from the view of the author, that the
valleys had been excavated to their present depth before the gravels
were deposited; and, with reference to a former paper, explained
that Mr. Tylor and himself had taken different points of observation
near Montiers, and that his own views as to the separation which
in some cases may be shown to exist between the high- and low        -
level gravels were correct.
   Mr. Evans also combated Mr. Tylor's views, and pointed out
the difficulty of accounting for deposits of gravel such as are at
present found in valleys already excavated to their present depth.
   Mr. W. Boyd DAwkINs objected to calling in hypothetical
causes to account for effects when existing causes are sufficient, and
cited the sudden melting of snow as a sufficient cause, as had
already been suggested by Mr. Prestwich.
    Sir CHARLEs LYELL supported the same view, and mentioned a
case which had occurred at Salisbury some few years ago as an
instance of the effects of such floods.      He also cited the existence
 of flint implements   in the   gravels on either side of Southampton
 Water as evidence of the existence of man during a long period of
 excavation of valleys.     He also mentioned the discovery by Dr.
 Harris of flint gravel   identical with that of the present valleys be
neath the basalt of Miocene date in Antrim.
   Mr. SEARLEs W. WooD, Jun., insisted on the impossibility of even
an enormously increased rainfall filling the valleys as suggested by
Mr. Tylor, and pointed out the influence which such an accession
of fresh water must have had on the animal life in the estuaries. He
also mentioned tidal action as an excavating agent in valleys.

   234            Intelligence and Miscellaneous      Articles.
      Prof. ANSTED showed, by calculation, that even a vast increase in
   the rainfall would not suffice to fill the valleys so as to deposit the
   gravels as at present found.
      Mr. WHITAKER quoted the existence of distinct terraces of gravel
   one above the other in the Thames Valley as proving the gradual
   excavation of the valley.
      Prof. MoRRIs doubted as to the precise character and age of the
  deposits in the valleys in South Wales having been accurately
  ascertained.
      Mr. TYLoR briefly replied.
      Prof. RAMSAY made some concluding remarks, expressing his
  disagreement with the views of the author as to the enormous         -
  magnitude of the ancient rivers.

      oN THE PREPARATION OF CARBON TUBEs, CRUCIBLEs, ETC.
                                 BY G. GORE *.               -
                had occasion to    require small rods and vessels of carbon,
  HAVING
       free(ornearly so) from silica, forexperiments with hydrofluoric   acid
  and with fused fluorides, I have been induced to devise the following
  method of obtaining them.        Articles and vessels of the desired shape
  (but of sufficient dimensions to allow for shrinkage) were formed of
  different kinds of wood &c.; they were then allowed to dry in a
  warm place with occasional turning, then enclosed in a copper tube
 retort provided with two exit-tubes for the escape of gas, the tube
 placed horizontally between fire-bricks and heated with extreme
 slowness at first, and finally to bright redness, by means of a row of
 Bunsen’s burners.       It was necessary to continually turn the retort,
 and so to distribute the heat during the burning-process that none of
 the evolved tarry matter condensed upon the articles; otherwise it
 altered their form and dimensions in a remarkably curious and fan
 tastic manner. The red heat was continued until gas ceased to be
evolved.     If the burning was too rapid, the articles fell to pieces or
 cracked very much.
     The articles formed by this process consisted chiefly of rods, cru
 cibles, boats, and tubes (the longest tubes made being 63 inches
long, after burning); and the materials experimentally employed
for their construction consisted of lignum vitae, boxwood, beech,
kingwood, ebony, ironwood, mahogany, zebra-wood, Memel oak,
English oak, rosewood, “bastard rosewood,” maple, lancewood,
walnut wood, Norwegian pine, partridge-wood, “Braziletta,” cocoa
wood, vegetable ivory (or taqua-nut), coquilla-nut, and the hard
shell of the cocoa-nut. The articles usually shrunk about one-fourth
of their original dimensions during the process; but the amount of
shrinkage varied with the different kinds of wood &c.; even with
the greatest care many of them became twisted and shapeless during
the process.
    The best kinds of these various materials were found to be lignum

cess.  , Rods made from lignum vitae and the other denser kinds                                                 of

serve well for carbon pencils for the electric arc; but              they had                      if
been burned too    rapidly their electric  conducting-power     was much less.

   Our machine consisted of six rotating plates, each provided with
sixteen bobbins joined in tension and forming a total resistance R of
twelve turns of the rheostat.   These plates are joined in quantity, so
as to form an electromotor of six independent machines sending their
electricity into a common external circuit. The resistance of the whole
is then equal to R divided by 6, or to two turns of the rheostat. In
each series of experiments the velocity remained constant; it varied
in the different series from 350 to 550 turns in a minute.     The ma
chines were driven by a Hugon's gas motor, the regularity of which
has been proved to be perfect.    By means of a brake on the principal
shaft, the force, and there with the heat imparted to the machine,
could be regulated and measured. The heats regenerated in the ex
ternal resistances were measured under the usual conditions.
   All the experiments showed that the number C of thermal units
thus regenerated in an external resistance increases as this resistance
increases, diminishing then to zero when it becomes infinite.         It
attains a maximum for a value of a equal to R, or to twelve turns of
the rheostat; it is exactly represented by the formula

tromotive force is A and the internal resistance R, the heat regene

ON    THE EXPANSION AND COMPRESSION OF SATURATED WAPOURS.

             communicate the result      researches      saturated vapours
                                                                       of                            on
 on which     have been engaged for the last two years. The question

condensed when        volume        its

loss      of
        heat.
  At the sitting     the Academy, January 25, 1866, communicated
                                  of                                                                      I

                          an of
a first series                                           Since then have                                                 I
constructed       apparatus      which the expansion  by    compression                                   or                    of
vapours      high temperatures may
                 at                      effected     pleasure.        be                    at
     A horizontal copper cylinder, closed        parallel glass plates and          by
 heated          by
             the aid        oil-bath, contains vapour
                                       of     an              state   satu                                in   a          of

                 Intelligence and Miscellaneous          Articles.                 239
ration; its capacity is 6 litres, and its length 60 centims. A vertical
cylinder of a litre capacity, communicating at its lower end with
the preceding, is immersed in the same oil-bath; it contains a piston
of thesame metal, which by being moved augments or diminishes the
volume of the vapour.   The rod of this piston passes through a
stuffing-box at the top of the cylinder; and the vapour can act upon
the two faces of the piston. This vapour is supplied from a boiler
containing the liquid, and which on the one hand communicates with
the horizontal cylinder, and on the other with the upper part of the
 piston-cylinder.
     When the oil-bath is at the desired temperature, the boiler is
 raised to the same point; then the stopcocks are opened, so that the
 vapour is simultaneously admitted into the two cylinders.          The two
 faces of the piston are then under the same pressure, and it can be
 moved without any great effort.
    To effect a compression, for instance, communication is cut off
 between the boiler and the glass-plate cylinder; a certain quantity
 of vapour is thus isolated in the apparatus. But the vapour is
 allowed to act on the upper face of the piston.         The piston is then
 rapidly lowered, and the volume of isolated vapour is thus momenta
 rily reduced, which is sufficient for observing the phenomena which
 take place in this vapour when it is compressed without either ad
 dition or subtraction of heat. The construction of the piston offers
 no difficulty, for it is not necessary that it perfectly retain the vapour.
    The pressure of the vapour is given by a manometer fitted to the
 boiler and containing a column of liquid from the mercury to the
boiler. By heating the tubes which conduct the vapour into the two
 cylinders, condensation is prevented and the vapour reaches the
glass-plate cylinder dry and saturated.
    The difficulties of construction have been very skilfully surmounted
                     I
by M. Golaz; and have been able to observe the vapours of water,
 ether, chloroform, and benzine as high as ten atmospheres.             The
partial condensation of vapour produced by a sudden change of
volume is manifested by a mist of very brief duration; the action of
the sides makes it at once disappear. When the mist is very dense,
it is seen without difficulty when a mirror reflecting the light of the
clouds is looked at through the glass plates; but when very feeble,
it has the appearance of a slight fume which undulates in the cy
linder: the glass plates must in this case be very bright. There is
one case in which this is impossible; and that
                                                     is,when the vapour
                                                                                   to is
compressed.       The action    ofthe sides quickly brings the vapour
its initial temperature, and then portion

condensed.      This condensation produces     no   mist; but      dims the
                                                                     it

                                     is

                                            very perceptible mist.       The
higher the temperature the more intense the mist, which was never
observed with expansion.        Experiments were made from 80°          150°,                                  to
and therefore   up     nine  atmospheres.

                             115°, and to                     by
                                            compression alone above 130°.
Observations between these temperatures were interrupted                                                            by   an
accident.
 It    has thus been experimentally proved that for these two liquids

          XXXII.            On Some Effects of a Chemically Clean Surface.

Th;in                      solutions of a number of salts contained
                       supersaturated
            chemically clean vessels can be kept during a long time
 without crystallizing, and even be reduced to temperatures much
 below the freezing-point of water, provided they are protected
from the motes and dust of the air, and other chemically unclean
bodies, which act as nuclei. For this purpose it is sufficient to close
the mouths of the tubes and flasks with cottom-wool, which filters
the air as it enters the vessel during the period of a rising baro
meter.     When, however, the barometer falls, a portion of the
air escapes from the tube, and carries with it some of the aqueous
molecules of thesolution; and the effect of this action often repeated
is to lower the surface of the liquid and to deposit         along the                     all
width            of
            the depression     crystalline crust

   I  sent in a note of these experiments to the Royal Society by
way of addendum to a paper “On Supersaturated Saline Solu

the 28th of May last”.                             I
                              also brought the substance of that
note before the Chemical Section of the British Association at
Norwich on the 20th ult. The subject excited some interest,
and several gentlemen who spoke on the occasion called for a
definition of a chemically clean, in contradistinction to a dirty
surface, one gentleman quoting the adage that dirt is something
in the wrong place.

to the evaporation      and condensation of the liquid in the glass.
This effect           be well shown by putting a little pyrolig
                     may
neous ether or     wood-spirit   into a deep glass, covering it with
a receiver and exhausting the air.         Under these circumstances
it readily boils, and the vapour condenses at various points of
the surface so as to form tears.            The same effect may be
shown by filling a long tube with spirits of wine, and then
nearly emptying                it,   so    as      to
                                   clean the surface.        the tube                            If                          be

below for      short time, tears will form during the cooling

case  is  the same            that  as   in
                                        wine.     Ether alone,
phide     ofcarbon alone, will not form tears,            the plate        liquid      as
instantly evaporates.         Benzole does not act well; naphtha acts
tolerably well.
I     have noticed tears formed                              2 by

prevents the adhesion of water, but does not prevent the adhesion
of gas.
    A   precisely similar explanation may be applied to supersatu
rated saline solutions.   In chemically  clean vessels many of them
may be preserved unchanged during a long time, and their very
existence as supersaturated solutions depends in many cases on
the absence of nuclei. Previous observers remark how sensitive
some of these solutions are to cold; solutions that could be kept
during the summer months begin to deposit crystals when the
first touch of winter’s cold is felt.     have kept such solutions I
unchanged during winter, and have put them into freezing
mixtures at 20°, 10°, and even at 0°F., and have frozen some
of them without any separation of the salt. Previous observers
are constantly referring to the supposed molecular changes un
dergone by the solution, or by the sides of the vessel containing
it,when many                  of
                   the results thus obtained                                  are traceable             to   un

that they become chemically clean, and the liquid adheres

in which the solution is to be kept fluid with the acid of the

solution of ammonia should be used.        In this way, not only
is the surface cleaned in the best      manner,    but any loss of

             XXXIII.          On Rhodium.          By R. BUNSEN +.
                                    [With   a Plate.]
    working platinum ores on         manufacturing-scale, three
IN products are obtained, which

                                    are principally used for the
preparation of the other metals occurring along with platinum.
These are:—
   (1) The residues which remain after extracting the ores with
aqua regia; they are rich in osmium and iridium, and are there
fore especially fitted for the preparation of these metals.
   (2) Osmium-iridium, which is obtained from these first residues
by lixiviation, and which serves best for the preparation of ru
thenium.
   (3) The residues of the mother-liquors, which have been re
duced by iron from the aqua-regia solution from which the pla
tinum has been removed; being especially rich in palladium
and rhodium, they are most conveniently used for obtaining
these metals.
   The following investigation was made with a material of this
kind, which was supplied to me with the utmost liberality from
the Imperial Mint in Petersburg.       A kilogramme was used for
each  operation.   These  Petersburg  residues contain      the plaall
tinum-metals with the     exception     osmium,
                                              of and are   especially

                         to                  rhodium they contain.

Claus, who worked             on

                               to

salts of sesquichloride of rhodium.     The circumstance that, as
I have found, the bichloride of potassium and iridium is dissolved
to a considerable extent by a solution of sal-ammoniac, or chloride
of potassium saturated with rhodium-salt, must excite a reason
able doubt whether the metal thus prepared, and which has
hitherto been regarded as the purest rhodium, and to which
Claus, like Berzelius, assigned the atomic weight 52, does not
contain considerable quantities of iridium.    Hence it seemed ne
cessary to forsake the old way and attempt a more exact method,
so as to settle the doubts which the various and frequently dis
cordant statements about rhodium still leave.
              1. Separation     of Platinum and Palladium.
    The separation from platinum and palladium of rhodium,                   iri
dium, and ruthenium, which are insoluble in aqua regia, by                   di
gestion with this mixture, does not succeed with the residues in
question; for a considerable portion of the latter metals is pre
sent partly in a finely divided state, partly in the form of hy
 drated sesquioxides,     and consequently         is dissolved in large
 quantities with the former metals—apart from the circumstance
that the residue is filtered with extreme difficulty.        But it is easy
to extract   platinum    and   palladium    almost   completely   from the
other metals by mixing the original material with one-third to
one-half its weight of sal-ammoniac and heating the mixture
gently in a Hessian crucible until the sal-ammoniac is completely
volatilized and only vapours of chloride of iron are seen; the
residue is then heated in a large porcelain dish with two to three
times   itsweight    ofcrude commercial nitric acid, and evaporated
to  the consistence   of syrup. By ignition with sal-ammoniac, the
metals not    belonging       the platinum group are partially con
                              to
verted into chlorides; iridium, rhodium, and ruthenium are
rendered insoluble, and the gelatinous silica present                   in
                                                                         the
original material transformed into             pulverulent condition,

that  it can    bereadily filtered. The chlorides formed from the
sal-ammoniac yield, when digested with nitric acid, just               as
                                                                      much
hydrochloric acid     as    sufficient for
                           is                dissolving  the  platinum           as
bichloride;     atthe same time the copper and iron present reduce
the palladium dissolved         nitric acid
                                in                 to

contained     inthe solution, not      bichloride, but

they are colourless; the least excess of iodide of palladium makes
them appear wine-red. 77 grammes of iodide of palladium were
obtained.
    A   specimen        of the precipitate left on ignition pure metallic
palladium, which dissolved readily and completely in nitric acid.
The whole of the iodine used in the precipitation may be readily
obtained in the form of chemically pure hydriodic acid, and be
used for fresh precipitations.   For this purpose the iodide is                            in
troduced into a tubulated   retort, the neck of which is drawn out
and bent down at right angles, and is fitted into a flask close over a
layer of water. Into the tubulure is fitted a glass tube bound round
with asbestos and cemented by gypsum, through which a slow
current of hydrogen passes from a Döbereiner's apparatus to the
iodide placed on the bottom of the retort. The retort is heated
in a magnesia-bath (to be afterwards described) so strongly that
almost only hydriodic acid and very little free hydrogen emerges
from the drawn-out end.        As the metal thus reduced retains
very small particles of subiodide of palladium with great persist
ence, which render it partially insoluble in nitric acid, it must
be strongly heated once more in a current of hydrogen.
   The mother-liquor of this vermilion precipitate, which has
thus been worked up for platinum and palladium, may still con
tain rhodium and iridium.      It is evaporated to dryness with a
little iodide of potassium, whereby a mixture of iodide of rhodium
and iodide of iridium is separated ; this is dissolved in aqua regia,
and is separated by bisulphite of soda, as will afterwards be de
scribed—or, still better, is mixed with the material to be after
wards worked by this process.

  The residue, after treating with nitric acid a kilogramme of
 material, weighed 0.4 kilogramme. The platinum-metals had
to be extracted in a form suitable for further operations. Hess's
method of extraction by fusion with zinc alone is very imperfect,
and attended with considerable loss. The following method,
which depends on the deportment of zinc and chloride of zinc,
 is,  think, preferable                all

 mobility, and in the readiness with which the small globules
 coalesce to larger ones.          When the chloride has taken up as
 much of the oxide as it       can,   the layer of oxide reappears; but by
 being again sprinkled with sal-ammoniac this disappears.                      The
 fused zinc strewed with sal-ammoniac has another property in
 common with mercury—that of instantaneously adhering to
 many other metals, and, in case they form alloys with zinc, of
 rapidly dissolving them. When the sal-ammoniac is strewed on
 the surface, the chloride of zinc bubbles up, in consequence of the
 ammonia and hydrogen liberated by the zinc. Several oxides
 and chlorides, especially those of the platinum-metals, on coming
into this layer of chloride, which is kept in rapid agitation by
 reducing gases, are reduced and rapidly dissolved by the zinc.

 separating platinum-metals from

    The metallic mass separated from the zinc regulus, and alter
nately digested with hydrochloric acid and water, forms a fine
dusty black powder, and, together with some admixed grains of
sand arising from the crucible, weighed 65 grims”.             It has the
property of softly exploding with the appearance of fire when
gently heated.       The ignited and cooled powder, when brought
in contact with cold unexploded powder, at once explodes the
latter.         If
               the explosion is effected by heating in an hermeti
cally closed tube, either exhausted or filled with carbonic acid,
neither hydrogen, nor chlorine, nor nitrogen, nor oxygen, nor
aqueous vapour is liberated.        From the method of preparation,
these are the      only bodies which could be present absorbed or in
combination; it must therefore be assumed that all, or part, of
the metals separated from the zinc are in a peculiar allotropic
condition, which by heating, or by contact with non-allotropic
metals, is got rid of with development of heat. The black powder
which exhibits these explosive properties consists essentially of
rhodium and iridium, with more or less considerable quantities
of the platinum-metals originally present, as well as traces of
lead, copper, iron, and zinc.
     It is most intimately mixed with three to four times                                                                  its

  through a tube just projecting below a perforated cork, and
 emerges through a delivery-tube which is just over the layer of
  liquid.   When the air has been completely expelled the exit
 tube is closed, and the flask filled with hydrogen is connected,
 by means of a piece of thick caoutchouc tubing, with the Dö
 bereiner's apparatus for the whole duration of the reduction.
 The temperature of the flask is kept just below 100° C. by placing
 it in a large iron pot which is heated by a small flame day and
 night.    A water-bath at a constant level is better. The re
 duction begins at once, and is completed in five or six days if
the quantity of metal amounts to about-100 grms. The first
 deposit consists principally of platinum and palladium ; in the
succeeding one rhodium preponderates; and the last parts are par
ticularly rich in iridium. It is best to stop the reduction as soon
as the liquid has assumed a greenish-yellow colour.         The last
traces of iridium which it still contains are obtained by evapo
rating the contents of the flask, igniting them with carbonate of
soda, and afterwards exhausting the fused mass with aqua regia,
so as afterwards to add them to another operation with chloride
 of barium. The reduction may be still more accelerated, if the
liberated hydrochloric acid is removed from time to time by
evaporation, care being taken to displace each time the hydrogen
by aqueous vapour or carbonic acid before allowing air to enter,
so as to avoid dangerous explosions.      The palladium-metals se
parated consist of lustrous spangles, foil, and dendrites. Pla
tinum and palladium are extracted by aqua regia, and, after
treatment with soda, separated by chloride of potassium and
iodide of potassium in the manner indicated above. The mother
 liquor still contains some rhodium and traces of iridium, which
 are precipitated as iodide by repeated boiling with solution of
iodide of potassium.       These are dissolved in aqua regia and
added to the    subsequent  separation of these metals.
     The metals thus treated with aqua regia, and partially oxi
dized, are reduced by hydrogen at a temperature just below red
ness, and again converted into chlorides by being treated with
chloride of barium in a current of chlorine. If from the solution
of these metals the last traces of platinum and palladium are
also removed by boiling with soda, and precipitation with chlo
ride and iodide of potassium, there only remains the separation
of iridium and rhodium.       For this purpose the reddish-brown
liquid is evaporated with hydrochloric acid, filtered, mixed with a
great excess of bisulphite of soda, and left to stand in the cold for
several days.     Rhodium slowly deposits as an amorphous lemon
yellow soda double sulphite, while the solution becomes yellow
and finally decolorized.    With this change of colour, the rhodium
precipitate also becomes brighter.     The precipitate, well washed

270                  Prof. G. Quincke    on the  Capillary
constantsforliquids likewater (0.008 gr)ormercury(x=0.055gr.).
Yet, as Laplace has shown, these constants must increase with
the square of the density if the function of attraction remains the
same; and it is even possible that they experience a sudden in
crease near the change of condition, just as the density or the
electrical conductivity suddenly changes.            Experintent has also
shown that, as the temperature of water and other liquids sinks,
the constant increases.        The author has observed the same fact
in the case of      mercury,   in opposition to the- statement of M.
Frankenheim”.
    Near their melting-points the capillarity-constants have com
parable values, as will presently be shown.            Hence metals with
a  high    melting-point,   apart  from other  differences,  must indicate
a high value for ordinary temperatures,              as is seen from the
above Table.
    As a layer of liquid near the surface acts like a stretched mem
brane, the surface must offer to external impressions a resistance
which is greater the greater the capillarity-constant.          Hence the
metals must be ranged according to the value of 2 in the same
order as that of their hardness.            Karmarsch’s experimentst,
in fact, as well as those of Calvert and Johnson f, on the hard
mess of metals, give values in accordance with this relation which
agree as well as can be expected in such determinations.
     It might be thought that wires of the same section with a
 larger surface must exhibit greater tenacity.            The author has
 made experiments in this direction with round and flattened
 silver and copper wires, and he has found that the tenacity with
 a flattened wire is almost the same as in the case of a round wire
of the same section and the same material.            It must at the same
 time be remembered that in flattening, not merely the density
 but the continuity of the surface is altered, as microscopic inspec
 tion shows, and the wire acquires cracks like flattened dough.
 Moreover the surface of such a flattened wire is not a surface of
 equilibrium, and other forces (the difficult displaceability of the
 particles) prevent the formation of the surface of equilibrium
 towards which the capillary forces tend.           In the different parts
 of the surface there will be different tension.        As, moreover, the
 section of the flattened wire is      very  irregular,   a more accurate
 calculation would only afford interest in case we could make
experiments between drawn wires having an elliptical and those
having a circular section.

forated by holes; otherwise the tenacity of a piece of gold leaf
must be greater than experiment shows to be the case. If we
take care that these holes are wanting, or are present in small
quantity, the tenacity is very great. The author has deposited
thin layers of platinum, silver, or gold upon plane glass surfaces,
and is astounded at the tenacity possessed by layers of 0.01 mil
lim. thickness. A suitably formed piece of steel planes regular
shavings in such a layer.      Copper deposited upon the silver layer
gives, together with the silver, a very firm membrane.        On tear
ing from the glass, the side turned towards the glass is convex,
the other is concave. The author thinks it probable that it is
chiefly the tension on the free metallic surface (which, according
 to theory, must be greater than at the limit of glass) that pro
 duces this curvature.       Hence a metal with a high capillarity
constant, like platinum, does not adhere to glass surfaces when
 it is deposited upon them in the cold, but acquires cracks and
 peels off. It is only after the tension on the surface has been
 diminished by strong heating that the metal adheres more firmly.
If    by the pressure of polishing the density and therewith the
 capillary tension of the metallic surface are increased, metallic
 layers become detached from the glass, which would otherwise
 adhere firmly.      Measurements of the tenacity of such thin layers
 were not made     by  the author, owing to the difficulty of fastening
 and    loading them.
     If   thin metallic laminae like gold leaf be raised to a higher
 temperature, by which the mobility of the individual particles is
  increased, they curve in consequence of the superficial tension
  (just as liquid drops form from a thin layer of liquid), and the
  pores of the thin metallic laminae become larger. This explains
  the phenomena observed by Faraday in thin metallic laminae”.
      The principle adduced above, that in the common surface of
  two solids there is a capillary tension, renders it possible to
  foresee the explanation of a few other known but hitherto unex
  plained phenomena.
      Two plates adhere more firmly the thinner the layer of liquid
  between them. In like manner, two solids stick the more closely
  the thinner the layer of cement or glue between them.
      The tenacity of damask steel or rolled iron depends on the
  circumstance that in the manufacture care is taken to produce a
  greatcapillary-surface—the junction of heterogeneous substances.
   Different kinds of iron are packed over each other and joined
   by rolling and welding; it is not improbable that they remain
   separated by an extremely thin layer of oxide or of slag. Heated
   afresh between each welding, the soft masses may arrange their

272               Prof. G. Quincke on the Capillary
common surface in such a manner that the capillary tension on
them is constant and attains the maximum value which is pos
sible for the common limiting surface of the two bodies.
   If  this arrangement be changed, by the force of crystalliza
tion for instance, the fibrous structure changes into a crystal
line one, and the solidity must become much smaller.
   In drawing wire, hollow cylinders of metal of differing density
glide over each other.   The heat developed by the drawing con
tributes to render the metal particles more readily displaced, so
that on the common surface of two such hollow cylinders the
capillary tension is a maximum.      The tenacity of hard-drawn
wires must be greater than that of annealed ones.     In physical
mixtures of heterogeneous substances (alloys, steel) wire-drawing
must favour the formation of capillary surfaces more even than
in the case of homogeneous metals; so that in these the decrease
of the capillarity-constant is most marked. All this agrees with
observation.
  The great tenacity of bodies which are built up of thin systems of
tubes, like bones, the tenacity of organic substances which consist
of individual cells with large capillary surface, are explained by this
capillary tension. If these solids have been originally formed
from soft masses, on their solidifying there has been a constant
tension in the entire capillary surface as great as was possible
under the given circumstances.       The changes which this tension
of the surface subsequently undergoes in consequence of altera
tions in temperature or of the form of the surface, will in general
be small in comparison with the whole value on solidification.

which have recently been demonstrated by M. Baeyer”, may
partially arise from the usual prismatic form, which agrees so
little with a surface of equilibrium.       In spheres, solid as well
as  hollow, there is little reason to apprehend changes of this kind.
   The difficulty of assuming forces near the surface of solids
which depend on the form of the surface, in opposition to tradi
tional ideas, is not in fact so great as might at first sight appear.
Displacements of the molecules of what are called solids have
long been known. The plasticity of icef, the phenomena of re
gelation<U+017F>, the experiments of M. Tresca on the efflux of solids Š,
the different deportment of the same substance according as it is
in the crystalline or the colloid condition, indicate a more or
less prominent community of properties in solids and liquids.
   A rigidly theoretical treatment of the capillary phenomena of
solids is rendered more difficult by the circumstance that the

 surfaces are not surfaces of equilibrium, as in the case of liquids,
that therefore, as in these too, we are ignorant of the nature of
the molecular forces and the distance at which they act.
    For this reason the author has directed his attention for the
present to actual liquids, and has endeavoured to determine the
capillarity-constants of fused bodies, especially metals, of which
hitherto little was known.     His expectation, that the capillarity
constants of metals near their solidifying-point must have com
parable values, he has found confirmed.      From the nature of the
case these determinations must be considered not more than
approximations to the true value, and indicate greater discrepan
cies than is the case with the determinations of liquids at ordi
nary temperature, like water, mercury, alcohol, &c.
    The noble metals, in the form of vertical wires, were melted in
a flame at as low a temperature as possible, until the suspended
drop fell. Neglecting the small quantity of fused metal adhering
to the thin wire, the weight P of the drop is the greatest weight
which the fused vertical mass can support, or

where 2r is the diameter of the wire in millimetres,                   &   the       capil
larity of the fused metal.
   In the same manner were heated glass threads which had been
drawn out of the same glass rod at the blowpipe-table.
   The flame used was generally a small coal-gas one, of 10 mil
lims. height and 3 millims. diameter.  Only in the case of pla
tinum was a current of  oxygen  passed into this flame from an
ordinary blowpipe.     Special experiments with gold wires showed
that flames at high temperature give drops which are compara
tively smaller only because the highest layer of the surface of the
drop touches solid metal, and must therefore be near the fusing
 point of the metal.    In thick wires the influence of the high
temperature of the flame must have least play, and hence these
give in general the highest values of the constants a. In this
arrangement of the experiment the author thought the highest
values of a to be the most trustworthy.

generally employed in expressing chemical changes.       But little
attention has hitherto been given to these attempts to bring
mineral chemistry into accordance with other branches of the
science.     This indifference may have resulted, on the one
hand, from a dislike to alter conventional modes of expression,
and on the other from the consciousness that the new formulae
were less simple, though perhaps more accurate, than those written
according to the old plan. Whatever the causes may have been,
the fact is that few use the “new system ’’ in writing the formulae
of minerals.           That a change is most desirable                           I   think few will
deny; the question     really is how such can be advantageously
effected.   The adaptation of the old formulae of the mineral
oxides, hydrates, sulphates, carbonates, phosphates, sulphides,
arsenides, &c. to those of the new system is a very easy matter.
But the alteration in the case of the silicates is very considerable;
and since these bodies constitute nearly two-thirds of the solid
crust of the globe, it is of great importance that any formulae by
which their composition may be represented should be capable
of exhibiting the natural relations of individuals.

of Dr. Odling * on this subject, of Dr. Frankland†, Mr.Wattst,

Dana, do not appear to contrast favourably as regards simplicity
                                    I
with the older ones, venture to bring forward some views which
I  have long held on the symbolic notation for the anhydrous                                                  si
licates and on some points in their constitution.    These views
were expressed in substance at one of the meetings of the Royal
Geological Society of Ireland last session; and the present junc
ture seems a favourable one for discussing them and exhibiting
some advantages derivable in practice from their application.
    In the following observations it will be understood that the
new atomic weights for the elements are those employed, unless
                                                             -

    It is usual at the present time to represent the silicates as
constructed on the type of water; thus the normal” hydrate of
SiO2 is

little doubt that if a reasonable compromise could be effected, the
 transition from the notation of the old to that of the new system
 would become so easy that many mineralogists might be induced
 to adopt the latter who are now opposed to the change.                hope                                     I
 to show presently that this may be done in a satisfactory manner.
     It might be objected that the exhibition of the oxygen ratio of
 a silicate by a formula is not an accurate statement of fact—that
 the oxygen acts merely in binding together the acidific and basic
 elements of the compound, and that the amount of oxygen em
 ployed in this way can be only measured by the atomicities of
 the principal constituents of the salt. To this it might be fairly
 replied that but little is really known of the function of the oxygen
 contained in a silicate; and though the above statements may
 be true,        all
                the decompositions      with which the mineralogist
 acquainted lead him           the general  conclusion that each atom

In addition  to this, a simple explanation is also afforded of the
causes of the great variation in the characters of silica, whether
obtained native or prepared artificially.                I
                                             would further suggest
that the recentresearches of M. Debray”   on the phospho-molybdic
acids bear very strongly upon the same point.     But very recently
some particularly well-defined and crystallized compounds of
phosphoric and molybdic acids have been discovered by M. De
bray, the composition of which shows that molybdic acid is
capable of undergoing an amount of molecular condensation of
which we had previously no conception. This is best illustrated
by the formulae of the silver-salts of two of these phospho
molybdic acids.  The old notation is that employed      by the
                                               -
author.
                  (1)     7AgO, (PO", 20MoQ°) +24HO,
                          2AgO, (PO3, 20MoQ*) -- 7 HO.
                  (2)     6AgO, (2PO", 10 Mo.O") + 14HO.
   It  would thus appear that we have not only MoQ”, but at least
two other polymers of this—Mo' 0" and Moº 0°.              It is well
worthy of remark that the first of these two bodies can be ob
tained only from alkaline solutions, and the second only from
acid liquids, and one modification can be speedily changed into
the other by simply realizing either condition. Tungstic acid
has been found to possess similar power of atomic condensation.
   Molybdic, tungstic, and silicic anhydrides and acids are well
known to present many chemical analogies; the proof of this
power of condensation in the cases of molybdic and tungstic
acids, combined with our previous knowledge of the silicic hy
drates and of silica itself, warrants us in attributing the same
power to silicic acid, more particularly when we shall find the
composition of the silicates and their relations to be easily expli
cable on such a view.     In reality, however, this is nothing more
than the   adaptation of one of the well-known principles of organic
chemistry relating to the condensation of radicals—the mode of
generation of compounds of this order being thus precisely stated
by M. Wurtz+ to be “based on the one hand upon the principle
of the accumulation of polyatomic radicals, and on the other hand
upon the successive dehydration which may be undergone by hy
drates containing polyatomic radicals.”
   The plan upon which           I

     I
     am well aware that the mode of regarding the native silicates
proposed in this paper is not likely to be considered with much
favour by those chemists who, with Von Kobell*, dislike the
idea of innovation, or others who, with Naquett, appear to be
disposed to place no limit to the power of condensation and suc
cessive  dehydration of the polysilicic acids.     have therefore                      I
sought for such experimental evidence as might be expected to
throw any light upon the subject, and hope soon to be able to
communicate the results of some experiments in a new direction
which promise to give a clue to the modes to be adopted in dis
tinguishing the different conditions of SiO2 throughout some of
their compounds.      Much independent evidence, however, is
forthcoming; and                 I
                     will now proceed to show that the composi
tion of the natural and artificial hydrates of SiO2 can be easily
and simply explained in accordance with the principles already
stated—and then, that the relations of the native anhydrous salts
become apparent                  when          their formulae are treated in                    a     similar
manner.

   In the absence of distinct evidence to the contrary, we may
regard the above as silicic hydrates uncondensed.       All the
salts of the uncondensed SiO" are formed on one or the other of
the above types.
   We have now the second great division of the silicic hydrates
and metallic salts, i. e. that comprising the hydrates of SiO"
=3(SiO2), or                 simple multiple of this.

the plan proposed in this paper, it will be seen how very easy the transition
from the equivalent to the atomic notation really                              is.

  I am    well aware that modern views on the molecular construc
tion of condensed compounds would oblige us to deny the possi
bility of obtaining some of the above hydrates in the free state.
It need scarcely be remarked that though this is admittedly the
case with such unstable bodies as the polysilicic hydrates, yet it
is well known that the metallic salts of condensed acids may exist
though the isolation of their corresponding hydrates would be a
matter of doubt, or (according to present ideas) an impossi
bility. Whatever views on the subject may ultimately obtain
acceptance, they are not likely to alter the above general modes
of expression for the atomic ratios of the best-known native sili
cates.    In the cases of the basic or subsilicates, it is shown above
that   they correspond to one or other of three hydrates of the
first stage of condensation of SiO4 dealt with in this paper, viz.
SiO°. In this way their relations can be clearly brought out,
though the cause of the peculiar ratio of R(= H) to Si is difficult
to understand.     The normal or unisilicates ought to be the most
highly basic of these salts; and yet we find the subsilicate of
Class 3 containing twice as much basic element as an unisilicate.
According to Dr. Odling this anomaly may be explained thus:–
“If    we consider alumina as always basic, then there are sili
cates’’ (such as those above typified) “in which the basicity ex
ceeds that of the tetrabasic group; but the basic or acidulous
function of alumina is yet subjudice; and if we exclude alumi
nous minerals, we shall find that the tetrabasic are the most
highly basic of       all
                     known silicates, natural
                                                                of or
                                                    artificial.”   These
remarks are specially directed        the proof
                                              to     the conformity                of
silicic  toother acids; but they obviously apply forcibly             the    to

   As these lists of minerals are only intended to illustrate the
application of the principle of classification proposed in this
paper,  I have carefully avoided entering upon doubtful questions
by expressing the constitution of silicates which have been                      hi
therto insufficiently examined.
   The above arrangement of the formulae renders remarkably
evident the relations existing between the members of the felspar
and other families. This group of minerals illustrates the mode
of accumulation of the anhydride SiO" upon itself without other
wise disturbing the arrangement of the molecule; and the com
position of these silicates appears to me forcibly to testify that
the normal rate of condensation of the molecule of SiO4 is three, or
some simple multiple of that number.

portant felspars of the volcanic rocks, just as albite and ortho
clase are of the granitic rocks.  Of these four (and other inter
mediate compounds), however, leucite and orthoclase are the
most directly comparable, being both potassium and aluminium
felspars, evidently formed on precisely the same type, yet differ
ing by the compound molecule SiO". It now becomes a matter
of much interest to attempt an explanation of this remarkable
and yet methodic variation in the acidific portion of these felspars.
With the assistance derived from some known properties of the
silicic hydrates, and the Rev. Professor Haughton’s valuable
translation of Durocher's memoir on Comparative Petrology*,                                                   I
think it is possible to understand the conditions under which
one or other of these felspars can be formed, and the mode of
production of either. We are already well aware of the fact that
leucite is convertible into orthoclase by removal of potash and
alumina by aqueous action; but this information gives little aid
in the direction we require.                         -

   It will have been already noticed that I have rarely dealt with
the formulae of hydrous metallic silicates.     So little is really
known of the function of the water contained in them, that it
seemed undesirable to dwell upon their atomic formulae at pre
sent; at the same time it is necessary to say that the composition
of large numbers of them can be easily represented in accordance
with the plan proposed in this paper.       This is especially the
case with the interesting family of the zeolites, the relations of
which to that of the felspars can be then clearly traced.

290            Messrs. E.   T.    Chapman          and    M. H. Smith   on the
in the following terms. Some evidence has been brought for
ward to show:—
   (1) That by an alteration in the construction of formulae, the
atomic ratios of the silicates may be easily expressed in accord
ance with the principles of modern chemistry, while some prac
tical advantages are gained, and those attending the use of the
old formulae are retained.
   (2) That the constitution and relations of the silicic hydrates
and salts are best understood by regarding them as (a) containing
the elements of the primary SiO2, or (b) a polymer of this.
   (3) That the rate of condensation of SiO2 within the mole
cule of a native anhydrous salt is represented by the number 3,
or a multiple of this by 2 or 3 only =SiO2, SiO5, 2SiO4, 3SiO4;
that this alteration can take place without interfering with the
general type of the compound, and that the passage from one
stage of accumulation to another can be easily explained by re
ference to the known properties of normal and polysilicic hy
drates.
       It is
         also shown that the silica, hitherto regarded either as
basic or as accessory in such minerals as the felspars, is present
really as the result of the partial or complete satisfaction of the
tendency of SiO" to pass successively into 2SiO" and 3SiO5, the
chemical conditions of the mass in which the mineral may have
been formed determining the degree of condensation within the
molecule.

acid and the excess of trichloride of phosphorus. The phospho
rous acid has a tendency to split up into phosphuretted hy
drogen and phosphorous acid, thus:–
                        4PH8O3=PH3+3PH3O4.
And PH", acting on trichloride of phosphorus, is known to yield
phosphorous acid and hydrochloric acid, thus:—
                  PH3+ PC18–212-E3 HCl.
At  any rate more than the theoretical quantity of trichloride is
required to convert the ether into the new compound.
   Ethyl- or ethocrotonic:* ether and acid have been so fully de
scribed that we have little or nothing to remark with regard to
them. We titrated the ether with the following result:-
   4.263 grims. required alcoholic potash equivalent to 96423 of
potassium. Therefore 100 parts of the ether neutralized 27-31
parts of potassium; theory requires 27:53. The ether was there
fore pure.
   The acid was prepared from the ether, and subjected to the
action of bichromate of potash and sulphuric acid.     An experi
ment on an unknown quantity of substance proved that acetic
and carbonic acids were the sole products of the oxidation. This
determination was made by methods which have been fully de
scribed elsewheref.
   The only point remaining to be ascertained, therefore, was,
Does the ethyl-crotonic acid split up into two atoms of acetic
acid and two of carbonic, or into one atom of acetic acid and four
of carbonic? To ascertain this, and at the same time to check
the non-quantitative portion of the work, a determination of the
amount of oxygen required to effect the change was made by the
method already described by one of us f. If the decomposition
took place so as to yield two atoms of acetic acid and two of car
bonic acid, seven atoms of oxygen only would be required, whereas
the other decomposition would require eleven atoms.

then, whilst still hot, placed under the receiver of the air-pump.
Of course this caused the contents of the flask to boil, and
thereby effectually expelled any carbonic acid that might be dis
solved in the liquid.      The strength of the standard chromic so
lution had    previously    been ascertained by causing it to act on
excess of oxalic acid.      The carbonic acid so liberated was dried,
absorbed by potash, and weighed.             Two equivalents    of carbonic
                                                                         -
acid  correspond   to one of available    oxygen.
   The chromic acid which had not been reduced by the ethyl
crotonic acid was now estimated in the same way, and the car
bonic acid so obtained deducted from the amount which the
known quantity of chromic solution would have liberated had no
portion of it been reduced.          From the difference it is easy to
calculate how much       oxygen   the acid had consumed.
   The details of the operation are as follows:—
    Strength of chromic solution.        100 grms. of the solution libe

   The above work was the first step in a proposed investigation,
by oxidation, of the acids of the acrylic series.          It was intended
to collect these acids and treat them in a similar manner; but
the difficulty of obtaining any of these acids, excepting those
which could be formed synthetically from the corresponding
secondary lactic acids, proved so great that the investigation was
temporarily abandoned.          Should opportunity offer we intend to
resume it.

   results of an investigation on the polarization  of the heat

In these experiments it was impossible to employ the same form
of apparatus as for solids, because it was necessary for the ra
diating surface to be horizontal. The whole portion of the ap
paratus containing the reflecting mirror, and the box containing

experiments were therefore confined to mercury, fatty oils, gly
cerine, melted resins, paraffine, and such like.
   Liquids present also an especial difficulty in consequence of
their surfaces, when the liquids are warmed, not being so flat
as they are at ordinary temperatures.      In      cases when we            all
examine     liquid

                                               of   a  temperature
than the   surrounding   air, we find the image    reflected from
it   to   be   no
              longer completely well defined.    Heat,      fact,                      in             is
continually given off from the surface, the cooler portions sink
to make room for the warmer portions which rise; and hence
are produced movements, small indeed, but which,     conse                              in

     Foremost amongst these stands the algebraical form of equa
  tion (and that a quantic), which connects not only the arc, but
 also the squared radius vector with the angle of contingence, and
  consequently the two former with one another. In a marvel
  lous and, so to say, transcendental fashion, these curves partici
 pate in the nature of algebraical curves—their apses, cusps, and
 points of retrocession being counted by the order of the involu
 tion, and becoming imaginary in pairs.

 volute of the first by a third, an involute of a second, and so

direction from point to point in a curve. Accordingly we ought not
to say, as is usually done, that at a cusp the tangent is suddenly
reversed in direction, but, rather, that the increment of the arc on
passing through a cusp changes sign, as it ought to do according
to first principles; for the flow of the incremental arc, from being
concurrent with, becomes opposite to that of the rotating tangent

might,       if it
              were worth while, do as much for the symmetrical
class of third and fourth involutes, of which the former will con
tain two and the latter three arbitrary parameters, by solving a
cubic and biquadratic equation in these two cases respectively.
   It is easy to see also that the arco-radial equation to the symme
trical involute of an odd order is of only half the degrees in s and
r” that it is of in the general case, and for the symmetrical invo
lute of an even order, although of the same degrees in r" and s as
in the general case, involves only the even powers of s.
  A few     words upon the second involute, and          have done; for          I
it is difficult to deal with  theory   in  any  detail so as to be intel
ligible, or even safe, without the suggestive and regulative aid of
drawn figures, which I have not yet been able to obtain in a form
fit for use.
   The two principal classes to distinguish in the second invo
lute are the cusped and uncusped species. The cusped second
involute winds round the parent curve upon which the extremities
of     its
        finite branch rests. The uncusped species crosses itself,
and intersects each branch                        of
                                     the first involute     which     en             of           it

       This is the polar equation to a known curve (of the kind used
    by Captain Moncrieff in his barbette gun-carriage).   It is of the
    class of curves generated by a fixed point on a wheel rolling on
    a plane. Such a curve may be termed the convolute of a circle of
    a pitch denoted by the ratio of the distance of the fixed point
    below the centre to the radius of the revolving circle; thus a
    convolute of zero-pitch is the spiral of Archimedes, a convolute
    of unit pitch the first involute to the circle: the general
    equation to a convolute, when the distance below the centre is d
    and the radius a, is given by the Rev. James White in the last
    September Number of the Educational Series, and is easily
    shown to be
                                          S   = sin-1. d +                   Vpº-dº.

    Similarly, we may define the pitch of the second involute to be
    the ratio of the distance of    apse from the centre      its
                                                             the radius;                                   to

     I
    conclude with the remark that if we regard the s and r* of
the successive involutes as rectilinear coordinates to a variable
point, the arco-radial equation will represent a peculiar class of
unicursal algebraical curves.   Thus the first involute will repre
sent a  pair (one for each branch of the curve) of coincident right
lines, and the general second involute (taking r” and s” as the
coordinates) a pair of coincident semicubical parabolas.
   In making s vary continuously on passing a cusp, the corre
sponding abscissa from increasing must begin to decrease, or vice
versd, according to the principles previously noticed.
   Thinking of the recovery of the cusps and apses from the arco
radial equation,                   I
                      have been led to consider a morphological
property of a more general class of unicursal equations, which I
think is likely to bear valuable fruit, and may possibly form the
subject of another communication.

rTh;“Observations  of the Spectra of some of the Southern                  Ne
bulae.”    By Lieutenant John Herschel, R.E.
   [Lieutenant Herschel, to whom the observations of the solar eclipse
of August   next have been entrusted by the Royal Society, has already
employed the instruments, placed in his hands by the Royal Society
for the observations of the eclipse, to good account by commencing
an examination of some of the brightest of the nebulae of the southern
heavens. The first results of this examination, which are contained
in the present paper, were obtained at Bangalore, Madras Presidency,
during the months of March and April 1868. The instruments con
sist of an equatorially mounted telescope of 5 inches aperture, driven
by a clock furnished with a pendulum governor by Cooke and Sons,
 and a spectroscope by Messrs. Simms furnished with one prism of
dense flint glass, and with a micrometer-screw and photographic scale
for measuring the lines. The nebulae No. 4390 and No. 2102 have
been described by me, Phil. Trans. 1864, p. 439, and Phil. Trans.

tinctly visible in the spectroscope, accompanied by a considerably
fainter and more refrangible companion.    Principal line measured

with some difficulty in spectroscope; a faint continuous spectrum of

   April 6. Scarcely recognized as a nebula in the telescope. Seen in
spectroscope: a short bright line with a fainter one on the more
refrangible side, and a third strongly suspected.       (Knowing so well
the relative  positions  of the “usual”   lines, it is impossible that an
unprejudiced corroborative opinion can be offered on such slight

310                          Royal Society:—
mention only one other.       Amongst the chemical reactions celebrated
 for the production of dazzling light, there are few which surpass the
 active combustion of phosphorus in oxygen.         Now phosphoric an
 hydride, the product of this combustion, is volatile at a red heat;
 and it is therefore manifestly impossible that this substance should
 exist in the solid form at the temperature of the phosphorus-flame,
 which far transcends the melting-point of platinum.           For these
 reasons, and for others stated in the lectures above quoted, I consider
 that incandescent particles of carbon are not the source of light in
 gas- and candle-flames, but that the luminosity of these flames is due
 to radiations from dense but transparent hydrocarbon vapours. As
 a further generalization from the experiment above mentioned, I was
 led to the conclusion that dense gases and vapours become luminous
 at much lower temperatures than aériform fluids of comparatively
 low specific gravity, and that this result is to a great extent, if not
 altogether, independent of the nature of the gas or vapour, inas
 much as I found that gases of low density, which are not luminous
 at a given temperature when burnt under common atmospheric pres
 sure, become so when they are simultaneously compressed.          Thus
 mixtures of hydrogen and carbonic oxide with oxygen emit but little
 light when they are burnt or exploded in free air, but exhibit intense
 luminosity when exploded in closed glass vessels, so as to prevent
 their expansion at the moment of combustion.
    I  have recently extended these experiments to the combustion of
jets of hydrogen and carbonic oxide in oxygen under a pressure
 gradually increasing to twenty atmospheres. These experiments
 were conducted in a strong iron vessel, furnished with a thick plate
 of glass of sufficient size to permit of the optical examination of the
 flame.    The results are so remarkable that, although still far from
being complete, I venture to communicate them to the Royal Society
before the close of the Session. The appearance of a jet of hydrogen
burning in oxygen under the ordinary atmospheric pressure is too
well known to need description.       On increasing the pressure to two
atmospheres, the previously feeble luminosity is very visibly aug
mented, whilst at ten atmospheres' pressure the light emitted by
a jet about 1 inch long is amply sufficient to enable the observer
to read a newspaper at a distance of 2 feet from the flame, and this
without any reflecting surface behind the flame.       Examined by the
spectroscope, the spectrum of this flame is bright and perfectly con
tinuous from red to violet.
    With a higher initial luminosity, the flame of carbonic oxide in
oxygen becomes much more luminous at a pressure of ten atmo
spheres than a flame of hydrogen of the same size and burning under
the same pressure.      The spectrum of carbonic oxide burning in air
is well known to be continuous; burnt in oxygen under a pressure
of fourteen atmospheres, the spectrum of the flame is very brilliant,
and perfectly continuous.
    If  it be true that dense gases emit more light than rare ones
when ignited, the passage of the electric spark through different
gases ought to produce an amount of light varying with the density

of the gas; and this is in fact the case, for electric sparks passed as
nearly as possible under similar conditions through hydrogen, oxygen,
chlorine, and sulphurous anhydride emit light the intensity of which
is very slight in the case of hydrogen, considerable in that of oxygen,
and very great in the case of chlorine and sulphurous anhydride.
When liquefied sulphurous anhydride is sealed up in a strong tube
furnished with platinum wires, and the temperature then allowed to
rise until the internal pressure amounts to three or four atmospheres,
the passage of induction-sparks through the enclosed gas is attended
with very brilliant flashes of light. Further, if a stream of induc
tion-sparks be passed through air confined in a glass tube connected
with a condensing syringe, and the pressure of the air be gradually
augmented to two or three atmospheres, a very marked increase in
the luminosity of the sparks is observed, whilst on allowing the con
densed air to escape, the same phenomena are observed in the reverse
order.
    The electric arc from fifty cells of Grove's battery is incomparably
more brilliant when mercury vapour, instead of atmospheric air, is
interposed in the path of the discharge between the carbon points.

 termining         the absolute equivalent of one or other of these metals
 It was       at first thought that this would be arrived at by a comparison
 of the metal with hydrogen, the refraction-equivalent of which has
hitherto been estimated at 1:3 (or 1.5 in the case of water); but the
last column shows that the difference between potassium and hydrogen
is not always the same, the differences being greater than can be attri
buted to errors of observation. Indeed the numbers seem to fall into
two groups : with the mineral acids the differences lie between 4:0
and 47, while with water, alcohol, and the organic acids, they are
always upwards of 6, varying indeed from 6'2 to 6:8, the average
being 6'55. But it is in these last-mentioned compounds that the
equivalent of hydrogen is believed to be 1-3. Assuming this, we
may reckon the refraction-equivalent of potassium to be about
6'55-H 1-3, that       7.85.             is,
                                We have, however, other means         arri                                                          of

    Another deduction from the above Table is that already alluded

viz. hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydriodic, nitric, metaphosphoric,
and sulphuric acids, it has a very much higher refraction-equivalent,
one in fact which is little less than sodium, and falls short of potas
sium by only about 4.3.                 Hence we may we deduce—
             Hydrogen in organic compounds                     . . .  ...   = 1.3
             Hydrogen in mineral acids . . . .             . . . . . .  . . =37
How far this conclusion may hold good throughout, and whether
one number should be an exact multiple of the other number, must
remain to be determined by future observations.                           It appears, how
ever, to answer in the affirmative the question whether an element
 can have more than one definite refraction-equivalent.
    Of course, from the Table given above, it would be easy to
deduce values for each of the electro-negative constituents; but it
would be safer to generalize from a larger number of instances.
    The series of observations on potassium and sodium salts are the
most complete and the most carefully revised of any which have yet
been made ; but if their refraction-equivalents are fixed, it becomes
a much simpler matter to determine those of most other metals.
 Thus, of lead the nitrate and acetate have alone been examined; but
 as the refraction-equivalents                 reckoned for these salts differ from
 those of the corresponding potassium compounds in each instance
 by 4-1, the presumption is great that the refraction-equivalent of
 lead is very near 80+4' 1, or 12:1.
    The following are numbers deduced from two or more salts of
 each metal. They must be looked upon only as approximately true;
 and any subsequent modification of the value 80 for potassium
must lead to a corresponding modification of the whole series.

   These numbers are suggestive in many ways; but            will only                          I
remark the very high refractive energy of lithium, the practical iden
tity of nickel and cobalt, and the remarkable fact that the specific
refractive energy of the metals are (with one or two exceptions) in
the inverse order of their atomic weights.

   The   experiments   described in this paper were made in the laboratory
of Mr.    Gassiot, who placed his great battery of 2600 cells of bichlo
ride of   mercury   at the disposal of the author.     Mr.Willoughby Smith
lent his resistance-coils of       1,102,000    Ohms;      Messrs. Forde and
Fleeming Jenkin lent a sensitive galvanometer, a set of resistance
coils, a bridge, and a key for double simultaneous contacts; and
Mr. C. Hockin undertook the observation of the galvanometer, the
adjustment of the resistances, and the testing of the galvanometer,
the resistance-coils, and the micrometer-screw.              The electrical ba
lance itself was made by Mr. Becker.
    The experiments consisted in observing the equilibrium of two
forces, one of which was the attraction between two disks, kept at a
certain difference of potential, and the other was the repulsion be
tween two circular coils, through which a certain current passed in
opposite directions.       For this purpose one of the disks, with one of
the coils attached to                        its
                               hinder surface, was suspended          one arm                       on
it, of

   The mean of twelve satisfactory experiments, at distances varying
from 25 to 5 inch, gave for the ratio of the electromagnetic to the
electrostatic unit of electricity—
             v=27-79 Ohms, or B. A. units.
              =277,900,000 metres per second.
                 = 174,800      statute miles per second.
     This      is considerably lower than that found by MM. Weber
            value
and Kohlrausch by a different method, which was 310,740,000 metres
per second.     Its correctness depends on that of the B. A. unit of
resistance, which, however, cannot be very far from the truth, as it
agrees so well with Dr. Joule's thermal experiments.
   It is also decidedly less than any estimate of the velocity of light,
of which the lowest, that of M. Foucault, is 298,000,000 metres per
second.
   In a note to this paper the author gave his reasons, in as simple a
form as he could, for believing that the ratio of the electrical units
and the velocity of light, are one and the same physical quantity,
pointing out the difference between his theory and those of MM.
Riemann and Lorenz, which appear to lead to the same conclusion.

IN ina previous communication we announced that the heat developed
       the external circuit of a magneto-electrical machine, working
with a constant velocity, was governed by the same law as in the case
of an ordinary battery. Our machine consisted of six rotating plates,
each provided with sixteen coils mounted in tension. The plates
themselves were united in quantity; that    the similar poles   each       is,                               of
of them terminated     two common points, with which were connected
                               in
the external circuit. Since then the machine has been arranged
afresh,      so combine the various plates

    Our experiments may be thus generalized:—
   Whenever bobbins in any number pass with a constant velocity at
 the same distances in front of magnets, they act like the elements of
 a constant battery.    Notwithstanding interruptions or inversions of
 the current, the quantity of electricity produced is governed by Ohm’s
 law, and the heat regenerated in the external circuit by that of Joule.
 These laws apply to        modes       grouping bobbins. The electro

 motive force      each bobbin varies with the velocity, and with all
                       of
 the circumstances of the construction.

                       is                              this couple                  p   of                    ;   it   is

                           separate visits to the
                    have had numerous       opportunities  of studying
the geology of the Californian gold-fields, and of investigating
the circumstances attending the chemical and physical changes
which have formerly occurred and which, to a certain extent, are
still taking place in those regions.        Whilst carrying out these
researches, various facts have come under my notice which appear
to throw some light on the formation of auriferous veins, as well
as on the distribution of the precious metal in the rocks in which-
it is found.
  I   have endeavoured to embody in the following paper some of
the results of my inquiries, in the hope that, should the con
clusions to which I have arrived be shown to be fallacious, the
facts which have been collected may nevertheless assist other                          in
vestigators in arriving at a correct interpretation of the pheno
mena attending the formation of auriferous veins.             In doing
this, I propose to first give a short description of the gold regions,
and subsequently to treat of their quartz veins, alluvial deposits,
                                        all
hot springs, and salt lakes,          which are intimately connected

with the chemical geology           of

In  addition to quartz, felspar, and mica, the latter of which is
well crystallized and often of a brilliant black colour, this rock
encloses titaniferous iron, and occasionally crystals of sphene of a
light yellow colour. Magnetic oxide of iron is also present in
notable quantities, and consequently imparts this property to the
enclosing granite. The granite of the Sierra appears to retain
its peculiar characteristics throughout          great portion a        ex                   of   its

   One of the most remarkable gold veins in California is that
extending from Mount Ophir, in Mariposa county, to Mokelumne
Hill in Calaveras, a distance of over seventy miles. This lead”,
which frequently crops boldly out above the surface of the ground,
and varies in thickness from six to sixty feet, may in some places
be traced for many miles across the country, and often presents
an outcrop like an immense white wall.             Although by no means
continuous, this may be considered as an axis with regard to the
other veins of the region, which have generally an almost similar
direction, and are most frequently grouped at no very consider
able distances from it.

nity of certain coloured streaks, generally nearly parallel with
the apparent lines of deposition of the quartz. When gold is
found lining a cavity in a lode, or is enclosed in plastic clay, it is
often in the form of crystals, which are usually either octahedrons
or cubes modified by planes of the octahedron or rhombic dode
cahedron.    When crystallization takes place in a narrow fissure,
the crystals are much flattened.
   In one of the detrital beds in the vicinity of the village of
Volcano, in the county of Amador, a distinctly marked quartz
vein may be observed cutting through the gravel, and evidently
formed by the action of water holding silica in solution.     The
mass of this lode consists of  agate and  chalcedony,  portions of
which are coloured by ferruginous stains. In speaking of this
vein, Professor Whitney says, “This is not by any means an
isolated case; other localities have been noticed where all the
conditions necessary to the formation of quartz veins, similar in
their general features to those in the auriferous slates, must have
existed during the most recent geological epoch.”
   With reference to this subject, Dr. Oxland” writes me as fol
lows:—“The recent quartz vein containing argentiferous pyrites,
of which I spoke to you when we met in California, is situated
at Sulphur Springs, Bear Valley, about ten miles north-east of
Borax Lake. This locality is resorted to by invalids for the pur
pose of bathing in the hot waters, which are supposed to possess
medicinal properties, and which flow in very considerable quan
tities out of the foot of a hill on the north side of the creek.
     “This   water, which  contains carbonate of soda, chloride of
sodium, and a little borax, is perfectly bright and clear, but so
hot, that it has to be conducted into a large reservoir to cool
before it can be admitted into the tubs provided in the wooden
bathing-sheds.
   “The hill out of which this hot water flows rises about 400
feet above the cañon through which the waters make their escape,

   Some attention has also been recently directed to bands of
auriferous slate found in the copper-bearing band west of the
main gold-belt of the State, and in the foot hills of the Sierra.
Of the deposits of this description, those near Lincoln, in
Placer county, and at Quail Hill, in Calaveras, are the most re
markable.                                                                                     -
     In
      these localities the gold, instead of being obtained from
well-defined veins chiefly composed of ordinary quartz, is en
closed in bands of siliceous slaty rock, extending north-west and
south-east, and dipping in conformity with the other strata of
the district.  At the surface the Lincoln deposit is chiefly dis
tinguished from the other slates of the neighbourhood by being,
in places, deeply stained by oxide of iron, and forms a low out
crop of about 3000 feet in length and 200 feet in width.
    Where this has been cut into, it has been found to consist of
alternating bands of clay-slate stained by oxide of iron, and of a
friable sandy quartz still retaining distinct evidences of stratifi
cation, and which under the microscope presents the appearance
of a siliceous skeleton from which the more soluble constituents
have been removed by aqueous agencies.
   Through these bands, and running parallel with their strati
fication, dykes of felspathic rock make their appearance, and
contain small opaque white crystals too much decomposed to
admit of identification. These, like the slate itself, contain gold,
but, in the case of the felspathic rock, in very small quantities
only.     In the slate are also found lenticular masses of blende
and iron pyrites, both auriferous, with stains of carbonate of
copper.  The whole mass of the stratified rock contains a cer
tain amount of “free gold,” although the seams vary consider
ably in their yield, some of them affording mere traces, whilst
others assay as much as 3      per ton.       oz.

     This vein is composed of parallel bands, some of which con
 tain small quantities of chlorite and iron pyrites. The quartz
 of which it consists is of a greyish colour, not very distinctly
 crystallized, has a peculiar greasy appearance, and contains cavi
 ties, on the surfaces of which have been deposited guttate silica
of a chalcedonious description. This rock contains gold in the
 form of large scales and plates.
     When examined under the microscope with a low power, this
 quartz presents in some places a cloudy appearance, and is found
 to contain a few small cubical crystals of iron pyrites, together
 with cavities filled by chalcedonious matter.         Under a higher
 power it is seen to contain fluid-cavities of about one-thousandth
 of an inch in diameter, and in which the ratio of the -vacuity
 to the cubical content of the cavity is about 1 : 10.
     This veinstone also encloses small cavities which appear to be
lined with clay, and in which no vacuities can be seen. It like
wise contains gas-cavities and markings very similar in appear
ance to the “glass-cavities” described by Mr. Sorby as occurring

                   of the Gold-fields of California.                                             329
in porphyritic pitchstone, in the leucite of the lava of Vesuvius,
and in the augite of some trappean rocks. In the case of quartz
from the auriferous veins of California, I am, however, inclined to
believe that they are due to crystallization only, since              have                   I
never been enabled to discover globular vacuities in any of them,
and precisely similar markings may be observed on many quartz
crystals on examining their surfaces by the aid of an ordinary
lens. Should a fresh deposit of silica immediately take place on
the planes of a crystal thus marked, an appearance not unlike
glass-cavities would be the result; and if the depressions on the
original crystal should become coated with clay, by deposition
from turbid water, before the formation of the succeeding stra
tum of quartz, a certain degree of opacity, like that observed in
the quartz of many auriferous veinstones, would be caused.               It
is also obvious that     crystallizations  of other minerals   might  take
place in such depressions; and these, becoming covered by the
succeeding deposit of quartz, would have, to a great extent, the
appearance of having been formed from a slag or glass in the act
of cooling from a state of fusion.
    That crystalline quartz is frequently produced by successive
 depositions we have abundant evidence from specimens in which
 a crystal is seen to enclose others, each successively smaller
than that which immediately surrounds                   Clay and oxide

   The most remarkable circumstance in connexion with this vein
is the occurrence within it of large quantities of hydrated silica
of a bluish-grey colour: this has a resinous lustre, and possesses
a distinct conchoidal fracture, but exhibits well-defined lines
showing layers of deposition parallel with the other bands of
which the lode is made up. It is found in the form of a series
of lenticular deposits, often several fathoms in length, interla
minated with the ordinary crystalline quartz, from which it is
separated by a thin heading of unctuous clay. This substance,

   When examined under a low power, this slate is seen to be
made up of angular fragments of quartz connected together by
clayey matter, their largest planes being parallel to the lines of
cleavage.    It also contains numerous spots of peroxide of iron,
which in many instances still retain the cubical form of iron
pyrites. By the aid of a high power the quartz fragments are
seen to enclose a few small gas-cavities; and one or two fluid
cavities, with distinctly visible vacuities, were observed.

   When examined under the microscope, this substance appears
to consist of the siliceous skeleton of the auriferous slate from
which the aluminous and ferruginous matters have been almost
entirely removed.    The angular fragments       quartz, being thus      of
deprived  of  the cementing  material which  originally  bound them
together and gave solidity      the mass, remain
                                            to          disintegrated             in   a
and friable state, although still retaining distinct indications                                     of

order to obtain sections affording good examples, even of smal
size, it is necessary to select such bands as may be more than
ordinarily crystalline, or to operate on thin fragments of crystals
sometimes found lining the interior of drusy cavities.
    In the more opaque and generally most auriferous portions of
veins, the cavities are numerous but exceedingly small, and are
often so opaque (apparently rendered so by being internally
coated by a lining of clay) that no vacuities can be distinguished.
Some of the bubbles, contained in cavities requiring an arrange
ment magnifying a thousand linear to be distinctly seen, were
observed to move freely about.
    Out of more than sixty sections of veinstone examined, only
some six or eight were found to contain fluid-cavities of sufficient
size to admit of any attempt at accurate measurement; but in
all cases there appeared to be considerable differences in the
relative dimensions of the vacuities and the enclosing cavities,
and   I consequently ascertained by direct experiment the tempe
ratures at which they severally became filled.             For this purpose
a small bath, made of sheet brass with a piece of microscopic glass
fitted into each side, was employed.           The section to be examined
was clipped on the inside of one of the small panes of thin glass,
and the bath filled with spermaceti into which the bulb of a ther
mometer was inserted.          By attaching this apparatus to the stand
of a  microscope,    of which the body was fixed horizontally, heat
ing the bath, and throwing the light of an oil-lamp on the object
by means of a condenser, it was easy to study the appearance of
the different cavities under various conditions of temperature.
    The magnifying-power employed was in this case about 275
linear, and consequently only such sections as contained tolerably
large cavities could be satisfactorily examined. In every instance,
however, they were found to require very different degrees of
temperature to become full, since in the same specimens some
of the vacuities disappeared at 180° F., others filled at tempera
tures slightly above that of boiling water, whilst many, though
much reduced in size, remained perfectly visible at 365°             F.*
                            Alluvial Deposits.
    Although a very large amount of the gold annually obtained
was no doubt originally derived from auriferous veins, not more
than about one-third of the precious metal now collected is pro
cured directly from that source.            The larger proportion of the
gold brought into the market is derived from alluvial diggings,
   * As an illustration of this fact, the results obtained by heating the sec
tion of a crystal of quartz from the great Mariposa vein may be given. Six
several vacuities disappeared at the following temperatures, 250°, 260°,
280°, 290°, 310°, and 320°F.      Others were not nearly full at 362°F.

lost in the water-bath 0:59 per cent. of moisture; and by subse
quent ignition the further loss amounted to 8:46 per cent., thus
making the total loss 9:05 per cent. Another piece of wood
from the same locality lost 0:56 per cent. at 212°, and 8:43 per
cent. by subsequent ignition; in this case, therefore, the total
amount of water contained was 899 per cent.
    The assay of several specimens of the cementing pyrites showed
that it invariably contained a small but very variable amount of
gold. In order to ascertain whether this exists in the form of
water-worn grains mechanically enclosed within the sulphides, or
in the form of spongy and filamentary particles similar to those
met with in the pyrites of auriferous veins,       I dissolved various
samples   in nitric acid, and afterwards subjected     the residues to
microscopical examination. In this way         I detected granules of
the precious metal which had evidently been worn by the action
of water, whilst others appeared not to have been subjected to
such attrition.     However, on examining pyrites forming the
substance of various fossilized trees, I was unable, when the
samples were taken from the inside of the trunks in order to
avoid the possibility of accidentally attached particles, to detect
an appreciable amount of gold, even when the assays were made
on several hundred grains of the material;           but my experi
ments were conducted         on specimens from one locality only
(French Corral), and in Australia very different results appear to
have been obtained.      Mr. Ulrich states that “in the gold-drifts
pyrites is often found incrusting or entirely replacing roots and
driftwood; such specimens very quickly decompose on exposure
to the atmosphere, and samples have, on assay by Messrs. Dain
tree, Latta, and Newberry, yielded from a few pennyweights to
several ounces of gold per ton.”          According to Mr. H. A.
Thompson, “a beautiful specimen of crystallized iron pyrites,
deposited on a piece of wood taken from the drift immediately
below the basalt at Ballarat, gave, by assay, 40 oz. of gold per
ton; and in another case, where only the pyrites from the centre
of an old tree-trunk was examined, the yield was over 30 dwt.
of gold per ton.     Some of the fine dust obtained in washing out
the  gold at the Royal  Saxon claim, Ballarat, yielded, by assay, over
 15 oz. of  gold per  ton. When placed under the microscope, this
 dust was seen to be composed of minute crystals of pyrites ag
gregated into round pellets from 30 to Tºo of an inch in dia
meter, the surfaces being roughened by the projecting angles of
the crystals, and unwater-worn "*.

   is well known that the hydrodynamic equations give exactly
       same partial differential equation for the interior of an
incompressible fluid free from friction, and the particles of which
do not rotate, as obtains for stationary currents of electricity or
heat in conductors of uniform conductivity.                  It might be ex
pected, therefore, that, for the same shape of the space traversed
and for like conditions of boundary, the form of the stream for
fluids would be the same as that for electricity and heat, with
the exception of trifling differences caused by secondary condi
tions.     In fact, however, the differences in many cases are very
evident and profound between the arrangement of the current of
a fluid and that of the above-mentioned imponderables.
    Such differences are especially obvious if the current enters
through an opening with sharp edges, into a wider space.                      In
such cases the radiant lines of electricity separate from one an

become negative, and the fluid must be torn apart.         At such a
place the accelerating force which is proportional to the differ
ential coefficient of the pressure becomes, of course, discontinuous,
and consequently the condition is fulfilled which is necessary to
bring about a discontinuous motion in the fluid. The motion
of the fluid in passing by such a place must be of such a nature
that a surface of separation is there formed.
   The velocity necessary to bring about the rupture of the fluid
is that which the fluid would assume if it were to flow into
vacuum under the pressure which the fluid would have at the
same place when at rest. This is certainly a comparatively con
siderable velocity; but we must bear in mind that if fluids are
to flow continuously like electricity, the velocity at every sharp
edge around which the current turns must be infinitely great”.
It consequently follows that every perfect geometrically sharp edge
by which a fluid flows must tear it asunder and establish a surface
of separation, however slowly the rest of the liquid may move.
When the edges are imperfectly formed, and rounded, such a
separation requires a certain increased velocity.   Pointed projec
tions on the side of the orifice must act in the same manner.
     In regard togases, the same condition obtains with them as
with  liquids, with the exception that the       viva   the motion           vis       of

established for gyratory motions, the lines, and with them the
surfaces of gyration, can neither originate nor disappear in the
interior of a fluid free from friction, but that, on the contrary,
every line of gyration must retain the same moment of rotation
constant.    It is further clear that the lines of gyration upon a
gyration surface must advance with a velocity which is the mean
of the velocities existing on both sides of the surface.   It hence
follows that a surface of separation can only be elongated in that
 direction in which the stronger of the two contiguous currents
                                                                                      -

   I sought,    in the first place, for examples of persistent sur
faces   of separation in stationary currents which would allow
of integration, in order to test whether the theory gives forms of
currents which correspond better with experiment than when the
discontinuity of the motion is neglected.              If a surface of sepa
ration which divides      flowing    from still water has to remain sta
tionary, the pressure along the surface must be the same in the
moving layer as in the stationary one; whence it follows that
the tangental velocity of the particles of water throughout the
whole extent of the surface must be constant.                 So also must be
the density of the fictitious lines of gyration.               The beginning

     It   is easy to            see   that the conditions of the state of rest are
satisfied       by such an infinitely             long cylindrical current which,
issuing out of a tube of the same diameter, enters into a still
external fluid, and contains throughout fluid which moves pa
rallel to       its
                axis with uniform velocity.

                                                 This series enables
unitates to be assigned to such circulating decimals as 4.
   The operations Usºr, Ugº, Ulor, Una, Uggr, and U9992 are the
most useful and easily performed.
   When any series of numbers, the powers of natural numbers
for instance, is to undergo examination by unitation, it is useful
to make a rectangular Table with the unitates of the powers in
vertical columns; each vertical column belonging to one power
—the square for instance.     The unitates of the powers of the
roots are in horizontal columns, each horizontal column referring
to the powers of the same root–2 for instance.

   XLVI.     On the New Electromotive                     Force in the Voltaic         Arc.
                                  By E. EDLUND+.
       HEN        a luminous          arc is formed             between        two    charcoal
           points by means of a powerful voltaic battery, and the
 circuit is broken in any place on one side of the arc so that the
 current ceases, and if the circuit be completed after a brief                              in
 terval, the luminous arc is not extinguished, though the current
 was interrupted for a short time.       The time during which the
 current  may  be thus  interrupted   without extinguishing the arc
 depends upon the intensity of the current.        With a strong cur
rent the time may be longer; with a weak one the time must be
reduced if the arc is to continue.       If the same experiment be
made with a luminous arc between silver instead of carbon poles,
the light is extinguished at the moment of interruption, and
does not spontaneously reappear when the circuit has again been
restored.    This deportment of the light between carbon poles
doubtless indicates that the conduction in the arc lasts a short
time after the cessation of the current, by which it is possible
that the current, when the break on the side of the luminous arc
has been restored, can reproduce the arc.           If the conduction
had been quite destroyed during the short break, the incipient
current would not be able to traverse the path between the car
bon poles and renew the light.       But the conduction in the                              lu
minous arc is principally produced by detached particles which
are carried by the current from one pole to the other.        It must
hence be assumed that in the first moment after the break in the
conduction the particles of carbon are being continually detached
and carried from one pole to the other.
    In a previous investigation I have proved that the mechanical
work which the current consumes in order to disintegrate the
poles gives rise to an electromotive force which sends a current
in the opposite direction to the principal currenti.         now, this          If,
disintegration lasts for     short time after the cessation
                                  a                                the                 of

354                   Prof. E. Edlund on the New Electromotive
current.   When in reversing the lever the fork-points n and n' are
raised, the surface of the mercury rises about the points, owing
to adhesion; and therefore the contact between them lasts longer
than if the surface of the mercury remained unchanged.          the                                                  If
current is passing, a formation of  sparks  ensues as soon as con
tact between the mercury and the fork-points ceases; and as
long as the formation of sparks lasts, the current continues.
This retardation in the cessation of the current, due to the forma
tion of sparks, increases with the intensity of the current. The
reversal of the lever was effected by means of a falling weight, in
order that it might always take place with the same speed. The
 time which elapsed from the moment in which the forked points
 left the mercury in the cups n and n' to the moment in which the
points at the other end of the lever touched the mercury in the
 cups l and           l',
                 was calculated      amount                 to

luminous arc between silver points no deflection was obtained,
the needle was quite stationary. Hence between the silver poles
there was no conduction when the luminous arc was extinguished.
   From the deflections obtained (18.7 and 27-9) the electromotive
force in the disappearing arc cannot be directly calculated, because
the resistance is unequal in the two cases. In the first case it
consists of that in the arc, together with that of the magneto
meter.    In the latter case there is in addition the resistance of

of 34 divisions was obtained as the mean of fifteen observations,
with a probable error of +37.             From this the resistance in
the disappearing luminous arc may be calculated.                If the re
sistance in the German-silver wire is      p,   and that in the luminous
arc and the magnetometer together is called B, we have
                           B: B+p=34:40,
from which B=5-67p.                                                     -
    Eageriment 4. With thirty elements, but without introducing
the sulphate of copper into the circuit, fifteen observations were
made as in experiment 2. The battery was increased from twenty
six to thirty elements, because the luminous arc was so feeble with
twenty-six elements that it was often spontaneously extinguished,
in consequence of which the experiments had to be frequently
repeated.     The mean of these fifteen observations was 64 divi
 sions, with a probable error of +6.5.             The resistance in the
 battery was found on measurement to amount to 1-7p. The re
 sistance in the luminous arc with the use of twenty-six elements
 was found to be 5-67p; when thirty elements are used the           resist
 ance becomes somewhat smaller, for it diminishes as the             inten
                     *
 sity increases.    The resistance in the entire circuit was somewhat
 smaller than    17p  +5.67p=7:37 p. If the resistance had been
 equal to that in experiment 3, the deflection of the magnetometer
 would at most have been
                                 =83-2 divisions.
 Hence we have
                         832 : 40=E–a         : a,
 from which    a  =97   elements.
    We see from this that the electromotive force in the extinguish
 ing luminous arc between carbon points cannot be less than that
 of 97 Bunsen’s elements.
     The data furnished by this and by previous experiments may
 be used to calculate the electromotive force of the luminous arc
 from experiments     1 and 2.
     If the resistance in 30 elements is 1-7p,
     It may be assumed that in 50 elements it is 3} 1-7p, or         2.83p
     If the resistance in one inch of the solution of sulphate
        of copper be called r, a special investigation showed
        that p = 2.06r;
     Hence in five inches of the solution of sulphate           of l 2.43 p
        copper the resistance was       .   .    .  .  .   .  .
     Hence the total resistance in the battery and in the rheostat
 together is 5:26p,      Assuming that the resistance in the lumi
  mous arc and in the magnetometer, as in experiment 3, amounts

358         Prof. E. Edlund    on the New Electromotive
to 5:67p, the entire resistance in the battery, in the rheostat, in
the arc, and in the magnetometer together amounts to 1093.p.
   If the resistance in experiment 2, as in experiment 1, had
been equal to 5-67p, the deflection of the magnetic needle must
                   lº
have been
                           x 27.9 = 53.8 divisions.
Hence we have
                      53-8:18:7–50—a        :  a,
from which w = 12.9 elements.
   Eaperiment 5. The battery consisted of fifty elements; and five
inches of the solution of sulphate of copper were introduced into the
circuit. The resistance of the battery was found to be3-97p, which,
together with the resistance in the circuit, makes 6-4p.       When
the galvanometer circuit surrounded the luminous arc, the deflec
tion on reversing the lever was 117 divisions as the mean of ten
observations, with a probable error of +0.85. When thereupon
a resistance = 12.9p was introduced into the circuit, the deflec
tion was equal to 6.5 divisions as the mean of ten observations,
with a probable error of +0.37.        From this it may be calculated
that the resistance in the luminous arc and the magnetometer
together was equal to 16:1p.       The great increase in the resist
ance of the luminous arc was     probably due to a smaller intensity
of the current.       -
   Eaperiment 6. The battery and the interposed resistance were
the same as in experiment 5. The magnetometer-wire was con
nected with the commutator and the principal circuit as repre
sented in fig. 2.    When the lever was reversed, a deflection was
always obtained amounting to 19.2 divisions as the mean of fif
teen observations, with a probable error of +1-35.         The resist
ance in this case was =22:5p (=6.4p-H 16:1p).           If the resist
ance had been equal to 16:1p, as in experiment 5, the deflection
would have been = 26-83 divisions.        We have thus
                     26-83: 117–50—a         : a,
from which was 15-2 elements.
   Hence the mean of the three determinations adduced of the
electromotive force of the vanishing luminous arc amounts to
12-6 elements.    The probable errors adduced above show that
this determination can lay claim to no great accuracy.          It is
possible that the true value may be a few units above or below
the one adduced; but this is immaterial for our immediate object.
The experiments adduced prove that, in the voltaic arc between
carbon points, during the first moment after extinction there is an
electromotive force comparable in magnitude to that of from ten to

                                          Force in         the      Voltaic Arc.                                       359
 fifteen Bunsen’s elements. It is moreover to be remarked that the
 numbers obtained are the means of the electromotive force.         This
 is doubtless strongest during the first moment after the extinction
 of the luminous arc, and then diminishes in intensity till it quite
 ceases.   If the lever could be more quickly reversed than has
 been heretofore possible, and thereby         the closing     the mag      let                        of
 netometer circuit follow more     rapidly the opening     the principal                     of
 circuit and the extinction        the luminous arc,  of   higher value                      a
 would be obtained for the electromotive force of the luminous arc.

 contact. There are indeed two contacts between carbon and
 gas; but these act        opposite directions and neutralize each

   Eageriment 10. The battery consisted of fifty elements, with

the  difficulty  of obtaining constant deflections increased in the
same    proportion.    There was obtained as the mean of fifteen
observations,

   Although,    as the probable errors adduced indicate, the sources
of error are   great, the preceding experiments justify the conclu
sion that the current in question does not decrease when the dif
ference in temperature between the poles is less, owing to the
heating of the negative pole, which it ought to do if the current
were of thermoelectric origin.             To this may be added that this
diminution of the difference of temperature is very considerable,
although it certainly does not entirely disappear.
   When the positive pole is heated, the deflection seems to be
somewhat less—though this cannot be considered to be made

           Date of the Glacial and the Upper Miocene Period.                                                          363
    Let it be observed that it is not essential to the object in view
to be able to show from the facts of geology that former cold pe
riods, such as those of the Eocene and the Miocene, were as severe
as that of the glacial epoch. All that is required is simply to show
that, for anything that geology can prove to the contrary, those
cold periods may have been as severe as the glacial epoch. What
I  wish to show                 is,
                      that although the conclusions derived from
astronomical and physical considerations regarding the severity
of  former ice-periods may not       present      fully borne out by
                                                                 at                  be

as sea-bottoms; but the stratified rocks consist of a series of old
sea-bottoms which never were land-surfaces.     Many of them no
doubt have been   repeatedly  above the  sea-level, and may once
have possessed land-surfaces; but these, with the exception of

   When we examine the matter fully, we find that the transfor

sand     clay,
             or   the case may be, and then carried down

little harm to the rocky sea-bottom       over which it floats.   It is
true that an iceberg moving with a velocity of a few miles an
hour, if it came in contact with the sea-bottom, would, by the
mere force of concussion, tear up loose and disjointed rocks, and
hurl some of the loose materials to a distance; but it would do
but little in the way of grinding down the rock against which it
struck.    But even supposing the bottom of the iceberg were
properly shoed with the necessary grinding materials, still it
would be but a very inefficient grinding agent; for a floating ice
berg would not be in contact with the sea-bottom.            And if it
were in contact with the sea-bottom, it would soon become
stranded and, of course, motionless, and under such conditions
could produce no effect.
   It is perfectly true that although the bottom of the berg may
be devoid of grinding materials, yet these may be found lying on
the surface of the submarine rock over which the ice moves. But
it must be borne in mind that the same current which will move
the icebergs over the surface of the rock will move the sand,
mud, and other materials over it also ; so that the markings
effected by the ice will in     probabilityall erased     the current. be                    by

    Dr. Sutherland, who has had good opportunities to witness the
effects of icebergs, makes some most judicious remarks on the
subject.           “It
                    will be well,” he says, “to bear in mind that when
an   iceberg   touches the ground, if that ground be hard and resisting,
it must come to a stand, and, the propelling power continuing, a
slight leaning over in the water, or yielding motion of the whole
mass, may compensate readily for being so suddenly arrested.

    But Mr.   Campbell    himself  freely admits that the floating
ice which comes aground along the shores does not produce
striae.  “It sufficiently evident,” says, that glacial stria,
                    is                                            (p.           “

    “It is impossible,” he continues, “to get at rocks over which
heavy icebergs now move ; but a mass 150 miles wide, perhaps
3000 feet thick in some parts, and moving at the rate of a mile
an hour or more, appears to be an engine amply sufficient to ac
count for striae on rising rocks.”   And in ‘American Tramp,”
p. 76, he says, “stria, must be made in deep water by the large
masses which seem to pursue the even tenor of their way in the
steady current which flows down the coast.”
    Mr. Campbell, from      a careful examination of the sea-bottom
along the coast, finds that the small icebergs do not produce striae,
but the large ones, which move over rocks impossible to be got
at, “must * produce them.          They “appear” to be amply suffi
cient to do so. If the smaller bergs cannot striate the sea-bot
tom, why must the larger ones do so : There is no reason why
the smaller bergs should not move as swiftly and exert as much
pressure on the sea-bottom as the larger ones.         And even sup
posing that they did not, one would expect that the light bergs
would effect on a smaller scale what the heavy ones would do on
a larger.
    Ihave no doubt that when Mr. Campbell visited Labrador he ex
pected to find the sea-coast under the water-line striated by means
of icebergs, and was probably not a little surprised to find that it
actually was not. And I have no doubt that were the sea-bottom
in the tracks of the large icebergs elevated into view, he would
find to his surprise that it was free from striations also.
    So far as observation is concerned, we have no grounds from
what Mr. Campbell witnessed to conclude that icebergs striate
the sea-bottom.
    The testimony of Dr. Sutherland, who has had opportunities
of seeing the effects of icebergs in Arctic regions, leads us to the
same conclusion.         “Except,” he says, “from the evidence
afforded  by   plants  and animals at the bottom, we have no means
whatever to ascertain the effect produced by icebergs upon the
rocks”. In the Malegat and Waigat                 I
                                              have seen whole clusters
of these    floating   islands,  drawing   from 100 to 250 fathoms,
moving to and fro with every return and recession of the tides.
I  looked very earnestly for grooves and scratches left by icebergs
and glaciers in the rocks, but always failed to discover any ”t.
    We shall now see whether river-ice actually produces stria
tions or not.      Iffloating ice under any form can striate rocks,
one would expect that it ought to be done by river-ice, seeing
that such   ice    obliged
                  is         to follow one narrow definite track.

three scratches, upon a soft sandstone rock, which he could
reasonably attribute to floating ice, ought to have aroused the
suspicion of the advocates of the iceberg theory that they had
really formed too extravagant notions regarding the potency of
floating ice as a striating agent.
    There is no reason to believe that the grooves and markings
noticed by M. Weibye and others on the Scandinavian coast
and other parts of northern Europe were made by icebergs.
Mr. Geikie has clearly shown, from the character and direction
of the markings, that they are the production of land-ice”.
If    the floating ice of the St. Lawrence and the icebergs of
Labrador are unable to striate and groove the rocks, it is not
likely that those of northern Europe will be able to do so.
     It will not do for the advocates of the iceberg theory to as
 sume, as they have hitherto done, that, as a matter of course,
 the sea-bottom is being striated and grooved by means of ice
 bergs.     They must prove that. They must either show that,
 as a matter of fact, icebergs are actually efficient agents in stria
 ting the sea-bottom, or prove from mechanical principles that
 they must be           so.

who has had some experience of ice has never seen a stone on a
berg in these latitudes.      Captain Anderson of the ‘Europa,’
who is a  geologist, has never seen a stone on a berg in crossing the
Atlantic. No stones were clearly seen on this trip”*. Captain Sir
James Anderson (who has long been familiar with geology, has
spent a considerable part of his life on the Atlantic, and has
been accustomed to view the iceberg as a geologist as well as
a seaman) has never seen a stone on an iceberg in the Atlantic.
This is rather a significant fact.
   Sir Charles Lyell states that, when passing icebergs on the
Atlantic, he “was most anxious to ascertain whether there was
any mud, stones, or fragments of rocks on any one of these
floating masses; but after examining about forty of them with
out perceiving any signs of frozen matter, I left the deck when
it was growing dusk”f.      After he had gone below, one was
said to be seen with something like stones upon             The                           it.
Captain and officers      the ship assured him that they had never

                  is                                        which                         to
 we  must allude, viz. the opinion that great masses  the boulder           of
clay    the glacial epoch was formed from the droppings
        of                                                     ice                          of
bergs.            perfectly obvious that unstratified boulder-clay

of  the sea without separating.     The stones would reach the bot

of     all
        the mud, and the whole would settle down               stratified    in       a
form.    But, besides, how could the  clay     derived from   icebergs?

launched into the deep, and while they are          the form       landin                  of
ice.   The materials which are found        the backs        on

what fell upon the                ice
                          from mountain tops and crags projecting
above the ice.    Icebergs are chiefly derived from continental ice,
such      that

                        of                                        buried              is

mud we know, from the accounts given by arctic voyagers, are
sometimes washed down upon the coast-ice; but certainly very
little of either can possibly get upon an iceberg. Arctic voyagers
sometimes speak of seeing clay and mud upon bergs; but it is pro
bable that if they had been near enough they would have found
that what they took for clay and mud was merely dust and rubbish.
    Undoubtedly the boulder-clay of many places bears unmis
takeable evidence of having been formed under water; but it does
not on that account follow that it was formed from the drop
pings of icebergs.       The fact that the boulder-clay in every case
is chiefly composed of materials derived from the country on which
 the clay lies, proves that it was not formed from matter transported
 by icebergs.      The clay no doubt contains stones and boulders
 belonging to other countries, which evidently have been trans
 ported by icebergs; but the clay itself has not come from another
 country.      But if the clay itself has been derived from the coun
 try on which it lies, then it is absurd to suppose that it was
 deposited from icebergs.         The clay and materials which are
 found on    icebergs   are derived from the land on which the ice
 berg is formed; but to suppose that icebergs, after floating about
 upon the ocean, should always return to the country which gave
 them birth and deposit their loads is rather an extravagant sup
position.      And if they did not do that, then how could the
 boulder-clay always be derived from the country in which it is
found 2
   Boulder-clay, whether formed on dry land or under water, is evi
 dently the product of land-ice. Boulder-clay will be formed under
land-ice whether the ice be moving on dry land or along the sea
bottom. In many parts of England, as at Norwich for example,
the boulder-clay contains huge blocks which have evidently come
from Scandinavia and other distant parts on the back of icebergs.
These have been dropped among the clay then being brought
 down under the land-ice.          In fact during the glacial epoch,
unless the seas around a country were completely blocked up by
land-ice, it would be impossible to preventicebergs from coming
and discharging their loads occasionally amongst the clay forced
from under the land-ice.        Few Scandinavian or other far trans
ported blocks are found in the lower boulder-clay of Scotland;
and this is owing, no doubt, to the fact that the seas surrounding
that country during the glacial epoch were so completely blocked
up by land-ice that no berg could possibly approach near to the
coast.
    If we   simply admit (what follows from theory) that as the ice
began to accumulate on the land the sea began to rise, and that
the time of the greatest extension of the ice was also the time of
the greatest submergence, many a difficulty will disappear.

376       Mr.   J. Croll  on Geological    Time, and the probable
    The view which at one time prevailed in regard to this point
was, that at the period of continental ice the land stood much
higher than at present, and that as the cold began to abate, the
land began slowly to sink and went down under the sea covered
with ice. The land, after remaining for a long course of ages
under water, ultimately emerged still covered with ice; but, the
cold continuing to abate, the general covering of ice began to
break up, and then followed the period of local glaciers.
    I have never been able to find any proof given, either geological
or  physical,  that at the time that the country was enveloped in ice
the land stood higher.         Instead of a greater elevation of the land
 during the period of ice, geological facts seem to prove the reverse;
for in every country where we have evidence of glaciation, we
have also evidence of a corresponding submergence of the land.
The two so constantly accompany each other, that many geolo
 gists have been led to suspect the existence of some physical
 bond of connexion between them. We have good evidence, no
 doubt, that the land in relation to the sea must have stood much
higher as well as much lower than it does at present, but we have
no evidence that the country was at that particular time covered
 with ice. On the contrary, geological facts go rather to show
 that the land was then covered with forests and peat-bogs, and
 possessed an abundance of animal life.
    It follows from theory, as has been shown on former occa
 sions*, that during the cold periods of the glacial epoch the sea
 must have stood much higher than at present, and during the
 warm periods much lower. When certain considerations                  are
 taken into account which were overlooked on former occasions, a
 submergence to the extent of at least 500 feet may be accounted
 for. Although the repeated submergence and emergence of the
 land during Posttertiary times were probably due to oscillations
 of the sea rather than of the land, still we have evidence that
 there must have been local elevations and depressions of the land
 during the glacial epoch; for we find in some places that the
 land was submerged to the extent of upwards of 1000 feet, while
 in other parts it remained above water altogether. The oscilla
 tions of the sea-level resulting from cosmical causes would not
 in any way interfere with upheavals and depressions of the land
 resulting from volcanic or other agencies.
    It was evidently not the facts of geology, but the notion that
 the cold of the glacial epoch must have resulted from a greater
 elevation of the land, which gave rise to the opinion that the
 country stood much higher than at present at the time that it
 was covered with ice.        In order to account for the cold of the

glacial epoch and the general covering of ice, the land was first
elevated; and then to make matters harmonize with the facts of
geology, the land was submerged.
    There is no necessity for this hypothesis in order to account
for the cold of the glacial epoch; and even supposing that there
was, it would not suit.     The cold and ice of the glacial epoch
were too general to be accounted for upon the hypothesis of
elevation of the land.    It is the elevation of a part in relation to
the  surrounding  continents that can cool the climate of that part
and cover it with ice.    A general elevation would produce but
little effect; for in such a case the atmosphere would to a con
siderable extent rise along with the land, and no very sensible
change would result. We shall have to return to this part of
the subject on a future occasion.
    From the facts and considerations adduced we are,       would                                      I
venture to  presume,  warranted to conclude  that, with the excep
tion of what may have been produced by land-ice, very little in
the shape of boulder-clay or striated rocks belonging to the gla
cial epoch          lie
                 buried under the ocean—and that when the
now existing land-surfaces are                                all

 boulder-clay or till, when the country was enveloped in ice, all
 is almost, comparatively speaking, a perfect blank so far as
 palaeontology is concerned. “Whatever may be the cause,” says
 Sir Charles Lyell, “the fact is certain that over large areas in
 Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, I might add throughout the north
 ern hemisphere on both sides of the Atlantic, the stratified drift
 of the glacial period is very commonly devoid of fossils”*.
    In the “flysch " of the Eocenes of the Alps, in which the huge
 blocks are found which prove the existence of ice-action during
 that period, few or no fossils have been found. So devoid
 of organic remains is that formation, that it is only from its
 position, says Sir Charles, that it is known to belong to the
 middle or “nummulitic” portion of the great Eocene series.
 Again, in the conglomerates at Turin, belonging to the Upper
 Miocene period, in which the angular blocks of limestone are
found which prove that during that period Alpine glaciers
reached the sea-level in the latitude of Italy, not a single orga
nic remain has been found. It would seem that an extreme
paucity of organic life is a characteristic of a glacial period, which
warrants us to conclude that the absence of organic remains in
any formation otherwise indicative of a cold climate cannot be
regarded as sufficient evidence that that formation does not
belong to a cold period.
    But if there is a deficiency of direct positive evidence of a
general glaciation of the northern hemisphere during the Middle
Eocene, Upper-Miocene, and other periods similar to what we
know took place during the Postpliocene period, there               how               is,
ever, abundance             of                              in            of

        Date  of the Glacial and     the Upper Miocene      Period.   379
or immediately after those periods, or perhaps both before and
after the cold period. This follows as a necessary consequence
from the cosmical theory of climate. For it is physically impos
sible that we can have a cold and Arctic condition of climate on
the one hemisphere, resulting from a great increase of excentricity,
without at the same time having a warm, equable, if not an
almost tropical, condition of climate prevailing on the other
hemisphere.     Whether a high state of excentricity will produce
in our northern hemisphere a cold and glacial condition of cli
mate or a warm and equable condition, depends solely upon the
position of the winter solstice in relation to the perihelion at the
time.    But if the excentricity continues at a high value during
a  long course of ages, then, owing to the precession of the equi
noxes and motion of the perihelion, the conditions of climate on
the two hemispheres will be reversed every ten or twelve thou
sand years. Consequently when we find, as we do in the Upper
Miocene period and Middle-Eocene period, evidence of a cold
condition of climate, we may reasonably expect to find also evi
dence of a much warmer and more equable condition than now
prevails. And this is actually what we do find. “The Upper
Miocene flora and fauna of the whole of Central Europe,” says Sir
Charles Lyell, “afford unmistakeable evidence of a climate ap
proaching that now only experienced in subtropical regions.”
“In the present state of the globe the island of Madeira pre
sents the nearest approach to such a flora.           The proportion of
arborescent as compared to the herbaceous plants is very great;
and among the former the predominance of evergreens implies
an absence of severe winter cold’”.           And in regard to the con
glomerates of the Superga, near Turin, in which the erratic
blocks are found, “the fauna and flora both of the overlying
and underlying rock,” says Sir Charles, “have the same subtro
pical character as that of Miocene date in Switzerland and Cen
tral Europe generally.” “Hence,” he continues, “the hypo
thesis of the transport of such huge blocks by ice-action has
naturally been resorted to most unwillingly; but in the present
state of our knowledge it is the only one which appears
tenable.”
    Here is a case which, if found to be general, ought to settle
the whole question of geological climate.           Here is a bed of con
glomerate indicating a cold and arctic condition of things when it
was formed, with icebergs floating around the place now occupied
by the city of Turin, overlain and underlain conformably by
strata indicating a subtropical condition of climate.             But this
is not all. This warm condition of things was not confined to
Central Europe, but extended probably over the entire northern
               * “Principles,’ vol. i. p. 200 (10th edition).

380     Mr.    J.   Croll   on Geological          Time, and the probable
hemisphere, even up to the North Pole; for it has been proved
that Greenland at this time must have been free of ice and covered
with   a luxuriant flora. (See Heer's Flora Fossilis Arctica.)    The
facts are wholly inexplicable on the ordinary theories of climate.
The cosmical theory, however, not only explains them, but they
follow according to this theory as a necessary consequence; for
if it should actually turn out that there is no such thing as a
warm and equable condition of climate somewhere about the
time of an ice-period, then the whole theory would have to be
given up, because a warm period, according to theory, is just
as necessary a result of an increase of excentricity as a cold period.
   The occurrence of a warm condition of climate close beside a
cold condition is not a mere accidental circumstance which has
only been observed during the Upper-Miocene period.                For
when we     go  back to the Middle-Eocene        period,  we find the
“flysch,” which bears the marks of having been formed during
an ice-period, closely associated with the nummulitic strata, in
dicating a warm condition of climate.                         “It
                                                     has always been
objected,” says Sir Charles Lyell, “to the hypothesis that these
huge masses were transported to their present sites by glaciers
or floating ice, that the Eocene strata of nummulitic age in
Switzerland, as well as in other parts of Europe, contain genera
of fossil plants and animals characteristic of a warm climate.      It
has been particularly remarked by M. Desor that the strata
most nearly associated with the flysch in the Alps are rich in
echinoderms of the Spatangus family, which have a decidedly
tropical aspect.”
   Passing back to the Cretaceous period, we find, closely asso
ciated with the floating ice in the sea of the White Chalk, fossil
evidence of a warm condition of climate.          And then, if we go
back to the Permian     period,  we find   glaciers reaching the sea
level in the very centre of England, and other indications of an
age of ice, as has been clearly proved by Professor Ramsay.
But the fossil remains of the Permian period declare emphati
cally the prevalence of a warm and equable condition of climate
also during that age.
   Sir Roderick Murchison has done me the honour to refer, in
the last edition of the “Siluria,’ page 548, to my views on the
occurrence of glacial epochs during past ages.        He is opposed to
the opinion held by many geologists and expressed in one of m
papers, that there probably was ice-action during the Old-Red
Sandstone and other early periods.          Supposing that it were
proved that there was no         ice
                                during the Palaeozoic age, this would
not affect the cosmical  theory      the least degree; for
                                        in                       quite    it   is
possible, as  has been  already  shown               4,

sun   may have been greater        during the earlier periods of the
earth’s   history.    It must also be borne in mind that the simple
fact of the fauna and flora of that age indicating a warm and
equable condition of climate is not a sufficient proof that there
were no cold periods; for a warm and equable condition of climate
is just as necessary a result of an increase of excentricity as a cold
condition; and the warm periods may be represented by organic
remains, and the cold periods not.
    Returning to the Postpliocene period. If this period afforded
no geological evidence of a warmer condition of climate in
Europe than now prevails, it would be so far a presumptive
evidence against the assumption that the glacial epoch resulted
from cosmical causes.        But we have undoubted evidence that
the climate of     Europe  during  a portion of that period was much
warmer and more equable than at present; for we find evidence
of animals and shells existing in latitudes where they could not
now live in consequence of the cold.         The Cyrena fluminalis is a
shell which does not live at present in any European river, but
inhabits the Nile and parts of Asia, and especially of Cashmere.
The Unio littoralis, extinct in Britain, is still abundant in the
Loire.     The Paludina marginata does not exist in this country,
but inhabits the more southern parts of Europe.             These shells
have been found in       Posttertiary  deposits  at Gray's   Thurrock in
Essex, in the valley of the Ouse near Bedford, at Hoxne in Suf
folk, in the fluviomarine beds of the Norfolk cliffs, in the fresh
water formation at Mundesley, and other parts of England.
Along with these shells of a southern type have been found the
bones of the Hippopotamus, of a species closely allied to that now
inhabiting the Nile, and the Elephas antiquus, an animal re
markable also for      its southern range, and the Rhinoceros me
garhinus. But what         ismost remarkable, along with these have
been found such animals           of   an
                                     arctic type     the Mammoth, the

382         Mr.   J.   Croll on Geological Time, and the probable
entire country is covered with snow and ice.   The trunk of a
white spruce tree was dug up by Sir E. Belcher near Wellington
Sound, in lat. 75°32' N. The remains of an ancient forest were
discovered by Captain M'Clure in Bank’s Land in lat. 74° 48'.
“This remarkable phenomenon,” says Captain M'Clure, “opens
a vast field for conjecture; and the imagination becomes bewil
dered in trying to realize that period in the world's history,
when the absence of ice and a milder climate allowed forest
trees to grow in a region where now the ground-willow and
dwarf-birch have to struggle for existence.” Evidence of ancient
forests was found in Prince Patrick’s Island and in Melville
Island, one of the coldest spots, perhaps, in the northern                                      hemi
sphere.
   These phenomena have excited a very great amount of asto
nishment, and have been considered very puzzling; but they
need not be so regarded if it be the case that the climate of the
globe is greatly affected by variations in the excentricity of                                    its

     In   the discussion              of the subject of geological climate another
point has been greatly overlooked, viz. the enormous influence
that a mantle of ice continually lying on the continent of Green
land has upon the climate of the northern hemisphere.       If we
could by some means or other remove this cold mantle off that
continent, though                    all
                       things else should remain the same, the
effect that         its
               simple removal would have       the climate    the                     on                           of
entire northern hemisphere would             quite magical. On former be                                       a

384          Mr.   J.   Croll     on   Geological Time, and the probable
of the climate during the period in question, what would pro
bably be the conclusion at which he would arrive? He would
probably find here and there patches of boulder-clay containing
striated and ice-worn stones.         Now and again he would meet
with bones of the mammoth and the reindeer, and shells of an
Arctic type.     He would likewise find huge blocks of the older
rocks imbedded in the formation, from which he would infer
the existence of icebergs and glaciers reaching the sea-level.
But, on the whole, he would find that the greater portion of
the fossil remains met with in this formation implied a warm and
temperate condition of climate.         At the lower part of the for
mation, corresponding to the time of the true boulder-clay,
there would be such a scarcity of organic remains that he
would probably feel at a loss to say whether the climate at
that time was cold or hot.          But if the intense cold of the
glacial epoch was not continuous, but was broken up by one
or more warm periods*, during which the ice, to a conside
rable extent at least, disappeared for a long period of time (and
there are few geologists who have properly studied the sub
ject that will positively deny that such was the case), then the
country would no doubt during those warm periods possess an
abundance of plant and animal life.          It is very probable that it
was during those periods that the Arctic forests flourished.          It is
quite true that we may almost search in vain on the present land
 surface for the organic remains which belonged to those intergla
 cial periods; for they were nearly         swept away       all
                                                             the ice which               by

 absence of fossil remains corresponding to the glacial condition
of things which we now know also did prevail at that epoch,
would very likely come to the conclusion that the former part
of the Postpliocene period was a warm period; whereas we, at
the present day, looking at the matter from a different stand
point, declare that part to be a glacial epoch.        No doubt, if the
beds formed   during   the cold  periods  of the glacial epoch could be
distinguished from those formed during the warm periods, the
fossil remains of the one would indicate a cold condition of climate,
and that of the other a warm condition; but still, taking the entire
epoch as a whole, the percentage of fossil remains indicative of a
warm condition would probably so much exceed that indicative
of a cold condition, that we should come to the conclusion that
the character of the climate, as a whole, during the epoch in ques
tion was warm and equable.

knowledge of the character of the climate of any given period

that period; for these contain                     all

three  periods when the   excentricity attained    high  value.   These a
three periods are represented        Tables II., III., and IV. The

2,460,000 years ago. The second began about 980,000 years ago,
and terminated about 720,000 years ago. The third began about
240,000 years ago, and terminated about 80,000 years ago.

386          Prof. Cayley on the Solvibility of Equations
fore probable that almost every trace of the ice of the Miocene
period would be removed before, the glacial epoch began.         From
the close of the  glacial epoch  of the Middle-Eocene   period, repre
 sented in Table II., to the commencement of the glacial epoch of
the Miocene period, there is the enormous interval of 1,480,000
years.    During that time no less than 247 feet would be removed
 off the general  level of the country.
    From the close of the glacial epoch of the Miocene period to
 the present day, 120 feet of rock must have been removed from
 the surface of the land and carried down in the form of sedi
 ment into the sea.     And since the glacial epoch of the Eocene
 period, no less than 410 feet must have been removed. We need
 not, therefore, wonder that so few traces of the ice of those periods
 remain.    Remoye 410 feet of rock off the surface of the present
 existing continents, and where should we then find our “roches
 moutonnées,” striated rocks, boulder-clay, or in fact any evidence
 whatever on the land that there had been a glacial epoch during
 the Posttertiary period?

       regard to the theorem that the general quintic equation of
IN    the nth order is not solvible by radicals, I believe that the
proofs which have been given depend, or at any rate that a proof                                          :

   fect kth power, only when the kth root is a one-valued function

assume that for n > 4 the lemma is true without exception.
   The course of demonstration would be something as follows:—
Imagine, if possible, the root of an equation expressed, by means
of radicals, in terms of the coefficients; the expression cannot
contain any radical such as X/X, p > 2, where X is a one-valued
(or rational) function of the coefficients, not a perfect pth power,
for the reason that, expressing the coefficients in terms of the
roots, such function & X is not a rational function of the roots;
if it were so, by lemma I. it would be a one-valued (that                                                               is,   a

any radical &/X, where      not being                 X,

the Action of Poisons.” By W. H. Broadbent, M.D.
  The starting-point in the inquiry has been the two following                                                  pos
tulates:–
   1. That there must be some relation between the substance admi
nistered and the animal organism, on which the effects depend.
   2. That, so far as the substance is concerned, the basis of the
relation can only be                    its
                              chemical properties, using the term                                           in   its
widest sense.

     3. That substances chemically allied should have similar physio
logical and therapeutic actions,        any diversity found

for evolution            in of
                    force.    While mutually interdependent, they are
 distinct, and      character essentially antagonistic—structural         and
chemical elaboration                    on
                             the one hand, oxidation       disintegration                or                       on
the other.
   The two great classes      food, organic and mineral, are
                                                 of                 close                                  in
relation with these. The organic foods build       the tissues, but ulti            up
mately undergo oxidation and yield force. The inorganic foods take
a  subordinate part     the composition
                                   in       the textures; they        not of                                do
yield force             by
                oxidation, but they influence the nutritive processes.
    So
    also the organic remedies and poisons affect the evolution     force,                                  of
mineral substances the   organic processes.
   (The action               of

   The force evolved      the animal organism takes the form

                  Dr. W. H. Broadbent                      on the           Action of Poisons.                            389
action,   it is necessary to consider closely the evolution of nerve-force,
and to endeavour to realize the chemical conditions implied.
    In the first place, the source of nerve-force is oxidation, and the
seat of the oxidation is the nervous structures.               This is generally
admitted, and seems to be conclusively established by an analysis
of the phenomena observed in experiments with a prepared frog's leg.
    This admitted, it is to be noted—
    1. That nerve-action is intermittent and of varying intensity, and
that, in addition to the presence of the oxygen brought to the nerve
structures by the blood, an impulse from without, or from some
other part of the nervous system, is necessary to determine the evo
lution of the force.
    2. Again, there is a storing up of potential energy in the nervous
structures; witness the necessity for sleep, &c.
    3. A due supply of oxygen is required.                   The phenomena of
asphyxia show that the demand is most urgent in the hemispherical
ganglia.
    These facts indicate that the constituent of the nervous structures
by oxidation of which the force is yielded, possesses what                     have                                I

    Experiments, nevertheless, have been made for the purpose                    as                                 of

(rats being the animals used)         which, after the injection in                                                  of   an
overwhelming dose, the fatal effect has been delayed quite beyond

     Ithas been found also that     proportion      prussic acid diffused
                                                                 a                    of

action on the animal in the latter case.
    With frogs the results were most contradictory and embarrassing,
till was discovered that prussic acid injected under the skin had
      it
scarcely any action      them     but   they were subsequently placed
                                        on              ;             if

which the acid diffused,      would gradually affect them.          seems                                      It

392                                             Royal Society         –
probable that the affinities in operation in the nervous structures
of the frog are not sufficiently emergetic to determine the decompo
sition of the H Cy, which will then act upon this animal as an
anaesthetic.
   Nitroglycerine was at first made the subject of experiment, under
the idea that possibly oxygen might be evolved from the NO, which
is substituted for three equivalents of H in the typical molecule.
Subsequent reflection showed that this is not likely to occur; but
the fact remains, that it is a substance liable to change, and very
highly charged with oxygen, as compared with the ordinary con
stituents of the body.
   It is a very powerful poison, having, however, entirely different
effects on frogs and rats.
   In frogs it very speedily induces powerful tetanic convulsions: a
single drop of a solution of one pint of nitroglycerine in four parts
of methyl in alcohol placed on the back of a frog is followed in five
or eight minutes by stiffness of movement, and in thirteen to sixteen
minutes by most violent spasms.      In rats an hour or more elapses
before any symptom is manifest, and then death is by a gradually
increasing feebleness of movement, in two or three hours, without
convulsion.
  It is unquestionable that this difference in the effects has a relation
to the oxygen contained in the nitroglycerine.      The contrast with
prussic acid in the action on warm and cold-blooded animals is sug
gested.
   A very extended and comprehensive inquiry, both as to the con
ditions in the nervous system associated with convulsions, tetanus,
delirium, &c., and into the relations and constitution of the poisons
which give rise to these symptoms, is necessary before the second
analogy can be followed out with any confidence. Experiments are
being made with substances of known composition and constitution,
with a view to elucidate this part of the question.
   In conclusion, two points are considered which cannot be passed
over in any attempt to apply the principles of physical and chemical
science to the case of poisons.
   The first is as to the minuteness of the fatal dose.           Any expla
nation, before it can be accepted, must show that the cause is adequate
to produce the effect.     This is a difficulty in the path of any rational
explanation. It is attempted to meetit by showing, on the one hand,
that the equivalency of nerve-force is extremely small, by reference
to       its
        analogy with electrical currents, and          other considerations,by
                                                                                                              of its
and that therefore the       degree      chemical       of
                                                     change   involved                                   in
evolution      also small; and, on the other hand, the maximum
force          to   be is
               obtained from        organic body  an   through the exercise is
of the affinities of its individual elements.
   The second point              the special action
                                      is   as   to        certain poisons on     of

    tracts which                 do
                        not suffer,          explain the action

which does.     The explanation       sought       the fact that the differ
                                                       is            in

ence in the functional activity of the brain and cord, the need for
sleep by the brain, not experienced, at any rate in the same degree,
by the cord, point to a difference of tension, and therefore of relation
to the substances which act as poisons.        This consideration will
apply where the differences of susceptibility and of tension are not
so marked.
  But this is only part of a still wider question—the different action
of poisons on different classes of animals. The explanation is still
the same.      Difference in the functional energy or activity of corre
sponding nerve-centres implies difference of tension.
   The following facts bear strikingly on this point                                   :-

rent  identity of  position, the bands in the two spectra were very
similar in their general characters and in their relative brightness.
   These observations were confirmed on June 25.
   The remarkably close resemblance of the spectrum of the comet
to that of the spectrum of carbon, necessarily suggests the identity
of the substances by which in both cases the light was emitted.
   The great fixity of carbon seems, indeed, to raise some difficulty
in the way of accepting the apparently obvious inference from these
prismatic   observations.   Some comets have approached sufficiently
near the sun to acquire a temperature high enough to convert even
carbon into vapour.
   In the case of other comets, the author suggests that the difficulty
is one of degree only; for the conditions are not known under which
even a gas permanent at the temperature of the earth could maintain
sufficient heat to emit light.
   The author states that some phosphorescent substances give spectra
which are discontinuous, but he gives reasons which would scarcely
permit us to consider cometary light to be of a phosphorescent cha
racter.
   The spectrum shows that the colour of this comet was bluish
green. Considerable difference of colour has been remarked in the
parts of some comets. Sir William Herschel described the head of
the comet of 1811 to be of a greenish or bluish-green colour, while
the central point appeared of a ruddy tint. The same colours have
been observed in other comets.       If
                                      carbon be the substance of some
comets, this substance, if incandescent in the solid state, or reflecting,
when in a condition of minute division, the light of the sun, would
afford a light which, in comparison with that emitted by the luminous
vapour of carbon, would appear yellowish or approaching to red.
   The author refers to the bearing of these results on certain co
metary phenomena, and on the apparent identity of the orbits of
the periodical meteors with those of some comets.

            ON STELLAR    SPECTRA.        BY FATHER SECCHI.
    one of my previous researches on stellar spectra I pointed out
IN that researches on coloured stars led us to admit a fourth type of
stellar spectra, the standard of which might be the spectrum which
I have published of the star 12561 of Lalande.    Now (after having
completed a review of the coloured stars) I am absolutely certain of
this fact. This type had escaped me in my previous researches; for
none of them exceeds the sixth magnitude; and it would not have
been remarked without the introduction of the cylindrical eyepiece,
which leaves to the spectra of these stars     all
                                             their brilliancy.

   The essential character of this type is to present a spectrum formed
of three luminous bands separated by dark intervals. The brightest
band is in the green; it is generally strong, well marked, and very
dilated.   Another, much feebler band is met with in the blue; but
this band is often very difficultly visible. The third band is found
in the yellow, and expands towards the red; this, however, is divided
into several others.
   All these bands have the characteristic that their light increases
in the direction of the violet, and then suddenly ceases.        On the
contrary, towards the red they gradually shade into absolute black,
There is thus a complete opposition between this type and the third;
for in this not only are the columns double in an equal space, but
they present the maximum of light on the side of the red, and the
minimum on that of the violet.       The two spectra are therefore not
 a modification of one and the same type ; they are evidently due to
substances completely different.
   The feebleness of their light, which prevents us from using the
spectroscope with a slit, hinders a rigorous definition of the sub
stances which produce these phenomena.        It may, however, be said
that there is  great analogy with the reversed carbon spectrum.      But
I think any   conclusion of this kind is premature.

   It is to be presumed that among the smaller stars some other
spectrum will be found; but for this purpose I think it is indispen
sable to use a telescope with a greater power than that of nine inches,
or a more delicate eye. Nearly all red stars have spectra with
bands; the small ones often present a continuous spectrum: this
continuity might be merely apparent, and these stars would belong
to the red type without bands, as is the case with Arcturus among the
large ones.    In my researches I have not limited myself to the stars
of the catalogue, but each time I have traversed the surrounding
heavens; thus I have discovered some new stars, but in small num
ber, which leads me to believe that the greater number have been
noted, at any rate for our hemisphere.         A similar study would have
to be undertaken for the southern        hemisphere.
   Having at length been able to put up the complete apparatus for
the absolute measurement of the lines and their comparison with
chemical elements,              I
                         have confirmed that the rays of hydrogen coin
cide with the four black lines of a Lyrae with surprising accuracy.
I say the four lines; for even the most refrangible line of the violet
is found in       its
                 place      the spectrum

         INVESTIGATIONS          ON OBSCURE  CALORIFIC SPECTRA.
                                 BY M. DESAINS.
  The whole of the researches relative to the calorific spectrum have
long ago established that the heat of the luminous part of this spec
 trum is more transmissible through water than are the mean obscure
 rays.   Melloni has gone further, and, in a memoir presented in 1831
 to the Academy, announced that the least-refrangible parts of the
 obscure solar spectrum are completely destitute of the property of
 traversing a layer of water a few millimetres thick. These portions,
 from this point of view, would resemble the radiations from blackened
 bodies heated to temperatures below 300°.
    Whatever since Melloni's time be the results which science has
 acquired relative to the properties of solar calorific radiations, I have
 thought it right to investigate again whether, in the spectra formed
 of these radiations, there really are rays analogous to those of sources
 at a very low temperature.
    The ideas recently acquired on the absorbing action of vapours
 made it little probable; and in fact I could never find, in the solar
 spectra I have investigated, rays completely deprived of transmissi
bility through water. These spectra were so pure that the eye could
readily detect the principal lines; the luminous part was about 25
millims. in extent, and their obscure part about the same.           I exa
mined the different parts by the aid of a line pile, the breadth of which
was scarcely a twenty-fifth of the whole-breadth of the spectrum. In
the maximum I had frequently a deviation of 30°, and sometimes
much more ; but on removing the pile to the limits of the obscure,
where there was only a deviation of one or two divisions, I found
that the heat capable of producing these deviations was transmitted
in considerable proportion through a layer of water of 2 millims.
It is not, perhaps, superfluous to remark that these latter pencils of
obscure heat did not in my experiments exceed the two-hundredth
part of the total heat spread over the whole extent of the spectrum.
    Entirely different results are obtained on analyzing the spectra of
terrestrial luminous sources, such as the flame of a lamp without a
glass, or an incandescent platinum wire.
    In one series of experiments a wire of this kind was kept at a               by
cherry-red heat in a small gas-flame.             Its
                                                 radiation, confined             a
suitable diaphragm, fell     on   rock-salt lens with

                                               of
deviated and dispersed. The luminous portion            the spectrum was
                                                          of
barely visible, and the calorific effects      produced      feeble inten

of the solar rays, and it exhibited a well-defined maximum ; in the
position relative to this maximum, the pile received so much heat
that the deviation obtained often amounted to 20°. On the dark
side the spectrum extended to a distance at least equal to that which
separated the maximum from the luminous region.                 The whole of
this second part of the spectrum was completely absorbable by a
layer of water 2 millims. in thickness; and the rays forming the maxi
mum were almost completely absorbed.             Scarcely a third part of the
rays escaped absorption, and it was necessary to approach the lumi
nous region to rediscover well-marked transmissions.               Thus in a
spectrum formed by rays which have not had to traverse an absorb
ing layer of appreciable thickness, rays are found which are analo
gous to those ordinarily proceeding from the sides of heated en
 closures.
     The apparatus I used in these spectrum-studies enabled me to
 measure to a quarter of a degree the deviation of the pencil by the
 prism of rock-salt, which was always placed in the position in which
 the deviation of the red was a minimum.             In making these mea
 surements       I
               soon ascertained that pencils of the same breadth, and
 the same mean refrangibility, were very differently absorbable by 2
 millims. of water, according as I took them in the solar spectrum
 or in a spectrum formed by rays emanating from platinum.              In this
 latter case the absorption is stronger than in the other.
     The differences are very precise, and cannot be attributed to the
 presence of rays quite absorbable coming from the extremities of the
 spectrum and which, owing to a defective arrangement of the appa
                                                                                          If,
 ratus, were mixed with the rays to be operated upon.                     fact,          in
  there were such flux   a       of
                             absorbable  rays,  there  ought        another    to   be               of
  rays much more transmissible coming from the most refracted por
  tion   ofthe spectrum, and the effects would almost balance each
  other.    Moreover the following new experiment could leave no
  doubt.      Amoderator lamp was taken           source    heat, and
                                                           as             very

  pure spectrum was formed with the rays proceeding from                   one       it.      In a

missibility through the trough of spar filled with water was remark
ably increased; it became # in the first case, and 3; in the other.
   From these numbers a complete demonstration of the propositions
previously enunciated appears to follow.    In fact, if the trough filled
with water   only allows a third of the rays near the extreme red to
pass, and far less of the other and less refrangible obscure pencils,
it is impossible to assume that a mixture of rays so little transmis
sible could form a pencil capable of being transmitted in the propor
tion of , or 4. Yet this consequence must be admitted if it be
allowed that the trough of water only modifies the incident pencils
in the degree that it clears them by extinguishing rays of mean re
frangibility very different from those of the pencils investigated.
    It seems to me made out that if in very fine spectra, but of differ
ent sources, we isolate two layers of rays of the same mean refran
gibility, and the breadth of which (the same in both cases) is a very
small portion of the total breadth of the spectrum, these two layers
of rays may have very different properties.
   Without discussing here the various interpretations which might
be proposed of this fact,             I
                                 will restrict myself to the remark that it
may be completely explained by the data which spectrum-analysis
furnishes.     In fact, if in a solar spectrum, whether luminous or che
mical, we consider a band the breadth of which is a fifteenth to a
thirtieth of that of the spectrum, we know that this band is filled with
a number of lines which correspond to rays that have been absorbed
in passing through the solar or terrestrial atmosphere; and, though
with considerable differences, absorbents conveniently chosen may

LI.  On the Communication of Vibration from a Vibrating Body

   Sec. R.S., Fellow of Pembroke College, and Lucasian Professor
   of Mathematics in the University of Cambridge*.
       the first volume of the Transactions of the Cambridge
IN    Philosophical Society is a short paper by Professor John
Leslie, “On Sounds excited in Hydrogen Gas,” in which the
author mentions some remarkable experiments indicating the
singular incapacity of hydrogen for becoming the vehicle of the
transmission of sound when a bell is struck in that gas, either
pure or mixed with air. With reference to the most striking of
his experiments, the author observes       267), “The most re         (p.
markable fact               is,

hydrogen gas is mixed with common air, it probably does not
intimately combine, but dissipates the pulsatory impressions

   In referring to Leslie’s experiment in which a half-exhausted
receiver is filled up with hydrogen, Sir John Herschel suggests
a possible explanation founded on Dalton’s hypothesis that every
gas acts as a vacuum towards every other+.     According to this
view there is a constant tendency      sound-waves           propa     for                        to    be
gated with different velocities    the    and  hydrogen   in  which air                                  of

supply the deficiency behind.         Now conceive the periodic time
of the motion to be    continually   diminished. Gradually the alter
nation of movement becomes too rapid to permit of the full
establishment of the merely local reciprocating flow; the air is
sensibly compressed and rarefied, and a sensible sound-wave (or
wave of the same nature, in case the periodic time be beyond the
limits suitable to hearing) is propagated to a distance.             The
same takes    place in  any  gas;   and the more     rapid the  propaga
tion of condensations and rarefactions in the gas, the more nearly
will it approach, in relation to the motions we have under consi
deration, to the condition of an incompressible fluid; the more
nearly will the conditions of the displacement of the gas at the
surface of the solid be satisfied by a merely local reciprocating flow.
    This explanation, when once it suggested itself, seemed so
simple and obvious that          I
                                could not doubt that it afforded the
true mode of accounting for the phenomenon.            It remained only
to test the   accuracy   of the  assigned    cause  by actual numerical
calculation in some case or cases sufficiently simple to permit of
precise analytical determination.        The result of calculations of
the kind   applied  to a  sphere  proved   that the assigned cause was
abundantly sufficient to account for the observed result.           have       I
not hitherto published these results; but, as the phenomenon
has not to my knowledge been satisfactorily explained by others,
I  venture to hope that the explanation I have to offer, simple as
it is in principle, may not be unworthy of the notice of the Royal
Society.
    For the purpose of exact analytical investigation              I
                                                              have taken
the two cases of a vibrating sphere and a long vibrating cylinder,
the motion of the fluid in the latter case being supposed to be
in two dimensions.       The sphere is chosen as the best represen
tative of a bell, among the few geometrical forms of body for
which the problem can be solved.          The cylinder is chosen as the
representative of a vibrating string.          In the case of the sphere
the problem is identical with that solved by Poisson in his me
moir “Sur les mouvements simultanés d'un pendule et de l’air
environnant” +; but the solution is discussed with a totally dif
ferent object in view, and is obtained from the beginning, to
avoid the needless complexity introduced by taking account of
the initial circumstances, instead of supposing the motion already
going on.                                    -

Secondly, the radius must be sufficiently small, or the pitch suffi

nearly as D} instead of Dä, whatever be the order of the Laplace's

                              from the telegraph-wires. On standing
near     telegraph-post, the ordinary comparatively bass sound with
         a
which we are           familiar was heard, appearing

the post. On receding from the post the bass sound became
feebler, and midway between two posts was quite inaudible.
Nothing was then heard but the peculiar high-pitched sound,
which appeared                       to
                         emanate from the wires overhead.                  had                                   It        a

telegraph ran for miles, it was only at one spot that the peculiar
sound was noticed, and even there only in certain states of the
wind. The wires seemed to be less curved than usual at the
place in question, from which it may be inferred that they were
there subject to an unusually great tension.
    The explanation of the phenomenon is easy after what precedes.
The wires were thrown into vibration by the wind, and a num
ber of different vibrations, having different periodic times, coex
isted. As regards the vibrations of comparatively long period,
the     air
          around the wires behaved nearly like                  incompressible            an
fluid,     no

    On the sides of the cavities gelatinous silica is found coating
chalcedony and opalescent silica in various stages of formation,
from the gelatinous state to that of the hardest opal.     This indu
rated silica is sometimes colourless, but is more frequently per
meated by cinnabar and iron pyrites, or blackened by the tarry
matter before referred to. Cinnabar is also found in striae, and
occasionally even in veins and concretionary masses of conside
rable thickness; where the bituminous matter occurs in the largest
quantity, and the mass consequently becomes black and friable,
cinnabar is replaced by globules of metallic mercury.
    On the edge of Clear Lake near the sulphur bank is a hot
spring, of which the outlet, even when the water is low, is par
tially beneath the lake, so that the amount which flows from it
cannot be ascertained.       Hot water, however, rises through the
sand at various    points,  extending  over a considerable area; and
Mr. Moore, of San Francisco, who analyzed the water from this
locality, has found that, in addition to chloride of sodium and
carbonate of soda, it contains a large quantity of borax, and
above a hundred grains of ammoniacal salts per gallon.           Lying
immediately at the foot of the sulphur bank are several springs of
cold water, some of which contain carbonate and sulphate of soda,
whilst others yield boracic acid. All these springs evolve large
quantities of carbonic acid.
   The chalcedony and semi-opal from this place, when examined
under the microscope, are seen to enclose cubical pyrites, together
with crystalline cinnabar; but the latter mineral appears to have
been generally deposited in an amorphous state.          Specimens of
chalcedony taken from the fissures in the sulphur bank were,
when first broken, so extremely soft as to readily receive an im
pression of the mail; but on reaching England they had become
hardened, and had assumed the ordinary characteristics of that
                   -
mineral.
   Thin sections of these specimens showed a structure like that
of fortification-agate, and were traversed by numerous fissures
parallel to lines of incipient crystallization, besides which they
were in places stained by oxide of iron.
   Boiling Springs.--About fifteen miles east of Little Lake,
situated in lat. 35°50' north and long. 18° 10' west from Green
wich, 200 miles north of Los Angeles, are numerous boiling
springs.    The first group covers several acres of the southern
declivity of a granitic hill, and is no longer in a state of great
activity, although numerous apertures are giving         off

   It is somewhat remarkable that this water, issuing from the
ground in a boiling state, should at the same time contain chlo
rides and free sulphuric acid; but it must be remembered that
the acid is in an exceedingly dilute state, and that the water was
collected immediately at the mouth of the aperture from which
it emerged.       It is probable that potash and soda may exist
in the form of the bisulphates of those bases, since an excess of
sulphuric acid is present.
    It was  observed that where these acid waters flowed away at a
temperature of above 200°F. several low forms of vegetation
 (probably Confervaceae) appeared to flourish, but to become less
 abundant and less vigorous where the temperature had become
considerably reduced.
     Steamboat Springs.—The        most remarkable instance on the
 Pacific coast of the actual     growth,   on a large scale and at the
 present   time,  of mineral veins is   probably     that afforded by the
 boiling springs in Steamboat Valley, seven miles north-west of
 the great Comstock silver vein and Virginia city.
     These springs are situated at a height of about 5000 feet above

 426       Mr.       J. A. Phillips's       Notes on the Chemical Geology
the level of the sea, at the foot of the eastern declivity of the
Sierra Nevada.     The rock in this locality presents several parallel
fissures, either giving out heated water or simply ejecting steam.
The first principal group of crevices comprises five longitudinal
openings extending in a straight line for a distance of 3500 feet.
Their general direction is north 6° west, and they are comprised
within a band of about 600 feet in width. The fissures are se
parated   from one another by intervals of from 40 to 60 feet,
have each a thickness of about 12 inches, and are severally con
nected with each other by lesser openings, which intersect the
first nearly at right angles.
    These crevices are often full of boiling water, which sometimes
overflows and escapes in the form of a rivulet, whilst at others
it does not flow over, but violent ebullition is heard to be taking
place at a short distance below the surface.    The fissures are par
tially filled by a siliceous incrustation which is being constantly
deposited on the sides, whilst alongitudinal central crevice allows
of the escape of boiling water or steam. On the most eastern of
these lines of fracture are several active centres of eruption, from
which boiling water is often ejected to a height of from 8 to 10
feet.   These waters are alkaline, and contain, in addition to car
bonate of soda, the sulphate of that base, with chloride of sodium.
There is also everywhere an escape of carbonic acid, whilst from
some places sulphuretted hydrogen is also evolved.        These pro
 ducts give rise to the deposition of sulphur, silica, and oxide of
 iron. The silica forms semicrystalline bands parallel with the
 walls of the fissures; and spongy deposits accumulate around some
 of the points of most active emergence in such a way as to form
 small circular basins, of which the edges go on continually                in
 creasing in height, so that each finally presents the appearance
of a small volcano of boiling water.
    At a considerable distance to the west of these, a second group
having the same origin is observed; but this is no longer tra
versed by hot water, although it still gives off steam and carbonic
 acid at various points. This large dyke of quartz commences at
its southern extremity by a number of fissures which subse.
quently converge into a single crevice, of which the two walls
are of silica, and extend a distance of considerably over a
mile. At    in itsnorthern extremity central fissure still remains
                                               a
                                                                            by
open; but        other localities   it for the most part obstructed
                                         is
siliceous concretions.      Towards the south the siliceous deposits
extended beyond the edges          the cleft, and have accumulated
                                    of                                      on

a  distance of from 80        to90 feet on each side of the fissure.
These deposits almost entirely consist          moreof    less hydrated

   This veinstone, which exhibited numerous parallel bands in
the direction of the enclosing walls, was selected for analysis as
having been most recently formed. On boiling 35-18 grains of
this substance in a finely divided state during eight hours in 4 oz.
of a strong solution of caustic potash, only 2:35 grains, or 6.68
per cent., of the silica present was dissolved.
   A section of this substance examined under the microscope
showed the reniform structure of chalcedony,            together with
patches of amorphous silica and small crystals of iron pyrites;
but no other appearance of crystallization could be detected. This
specimen contained a well-defined fluid-cavity, in which the va
cuity occupied about one-tenth of             total volume.        its

                                   of
of crystalline silica. On carefully examining the great western

quantities of fossil wood, and are often hardened into a compact
conglomerate by a cement consisting either of finely crystallized
iron pyrites or of silica. This iron pyrites encloses gold which
is sometimes water-worn, and at others is in a crystalline or fili
form state, showing that it has not been subjected to attrition.
In Australia, pyrites replacing the woody constituents of the
stems of trees found in similar positions has been shown by va
rious chemists to contain large quantities of the precious metal.
The siliceous cement of the ancient river-beds of California has
sometimes, but rarely, been deposited in a crystalline form, and
on examination such crystals have not been found to contain
fluid-cavities presenting the usual vacuities.
    (7) Mineral springs are exceedingly numerous, and their
waters generally escape from the ground in a state of ebullition.
These springs deposit silica, sulphur, iron pyrites, &c., whilst
in some instances cinnabar is brought to the surface in large
quantities by solfatara action; occasionally the deposited silica
takes the form of an ordinary auriferous vein, and gold is stated
 on good authority to have been found in quartz so produced.
 At the surface the silica of such deposits contains a larger amount
 of water than that of the older quartz veins of the country, but

434                 M. Schröder Van der Kolk                         on the Mechanical
     In the following considerations two principles are used:—
     I. When mechanical work is performed an equivalent quantity
of   heat disappears, and conversely; the same is presupposed with
regard to chemical work.
   II. Heat cannot of itself pass from a warmer to a colder body.
   In due connexion with this is the principle that mechanical or
chemical work can of itself be spontaneously    transformed into
heat; but heat can never be changed into work without the                                                      si
multaneous occurrence of a compensating action—for instance,
when a quantity of heat passes from a higher to a lower tem
perature.
     Most important in these determinations is the heat of combi
nation, the determinations of which were mostly made by Favre.
He expresses the numbers in thermal units, and refers them to
equivalent quantities if the equivalent of hydrogen is taken = 1
gramme.      The two constituents of a compound unite at a de
finite temperature ;                    if,
                          then, the compound formed        cooled                                    be            to

how much more energy         accumulated      the components

     M.   Becquerel'sfirst series                     of

point of a small tube heated to redness.      The crack must not be
allowed to become too   large;   it is merely necessary that it shall
allow the solutions, or at any rate one of them, to enter by ca
pillary attraction.
    One of the most remarkable effects is obtained by filling such
a cracked tube with a concentrated solution of nitrate of copper,
then introducing this tube into a test-glass containing a solution
of monosulphide of sodium which marks 12° to 15° of the areo
meter, the two liquids being at the same level, so that the pres
sure is the same on the two sides.      By simply mixing the two
solutions, black sulphide of copper and nitrate of soda should be
formed. This, however, is by no means the case; a short time
after the experiment had been arranged, a very brilliant deposit
of metallic copper with a crystalline texture began to be perceived.
Little by little the deposit increased, the crack enlarged, and the
tube ultimately broke.     Small cylinders of copper 2 millims. in
diameter could then be withdrawn.
   With several other solutions of copper the effects are the same,
but less rapid. Similar results are also obtained with concen
trated solutions of silver, lead, gold, tin, cobalt, and nickel.
   It is very difficult to obtain reduction effects with those of iron
and zinc.
   The author used several kinds of capillary spaces besides
that above mentioned—such, for instance, as the interval be
tween two glass or quartz plates pressed more or less closely
together, the porosity of the parchment-paper used for dialysis,
the capillary intervals between grains of glass or of quartz, un
baked porcelain or sandstone, tubes drawn out at one end.
The first method gave good results; by                       its
                                               means the reduction

              M. Becquerel    on Chemico-capillary Actions.      439
metallic reductions which he has described.        Before examining
the explanations he has given and the experimental proofs on
which he rests them, it will be convenient to dwell on some facts
of detail which he developes in various parts of his investi
gation.
    Among these may first be noticed the effects produced by dif
ferent kinds of diaphragms, such as bruised quartz and glass in
thin layers, fine sand, and hardened mortar, the interstices of
which are capillary spaces. To examine the effect of fine sand,
he introduces a certain quantity into tubes closed with a piece of
sackcloth bound by means of a wire on the outside, thus forming
diaphragms of 4 to 5 centims. in height; he then places suc
cessively various metallic solutions in the tube, and the solution
of monosulphide of sodium in the test-glass, taking care that the
sand is fine enough and the height of the column sufficient to
allow the liquids only to mix slowly.       Most metals are thus re
 duced from their solutions; it is thus with copper, silver, gold,
 cobalt, nickel, &c. A solution of equal parts of nitrate of cop
per and of silver first gives the silver in dendrites or in plates;
then comes the copper, but after a considerable interval. With
hardened mortar the reduction of platinum, cobalt, &c. is effected.
 M. Becquerel has also endeavoured to replace, in his old experi
ments on simple electrochemical apparatus, the kaolin which he
 used as a diaphragm by cracks in tubes.          Thus in the couple
 which is called the oxygen one, he substituted for the tube filled
 with kaolin, which separated the solution of caustic potash from
 nitric acid, a slit tube closed by the lamp at one end, and he ob
 tained the same effects.     The same result was obtained in other
 analogous cases, in which he used simple electrochemical appa
 ratus for obtaining simple and double sulphides and iodides.
    M. Becquerel thinks the reduction of metals in capillary spaces
 cannot be explained, as has been attempted, simply by reference
 to molecular attraction, but that it is due to the combined actions
 of affinity, molecular attraction, and electricity.
    In order to show the influence of electricity in the production
 of the phenomenon, M. Becquerel uses the apparatus consisting
 of a cracked glass tube filled with a solution of nitrate of copper,
 which is immersed in a test-glass containing a solution of mono
 sulphide of sodium; he then connects these two solutions by a
 platinum or copper wire, which by completing the circuit forms
 a simple electrochemical      couple, which gives rise to a current
 which is indicated    by  the galvanometer.     In a short time the
 solution of nitrate of   copper  is decomposed, and the end of the
 wire which is immersed in this solution is covered with metallic
 copper.     During these reactions the crack only acts by making
 contact between the two solutions; no trace of metallic copper

 is observed in the interior of the crack on the inner surface of
 the tube; but if the copper wire be removed, which suppresses any
 metallic contact, the fissure fills with small crystals of metallic
 copper, as well as the inside of the tube.  In this case, according
 to M. Becquerel, the liquid lodged in the fissure acts as the cop
 per wire which has been suppressed; and there are two currents,
 which add on to each other, for they are in the same direction—
 one due to the reaction of the liquids, the other arising from the
 oxidation of the reduced metal.     When the fissure is filled with
 metal,   it may happen that there is no direct contact between the
  two liquids, and the couple then ceases to act. The same results
  are obtained with other metallic solutions, such as nitrate of
  silver.   It may be remarked that, capillary spaces of the same
  section being far more imperfect conductors of electricity than
  the metallic wires whose functions they perform, the electroche
  mical effects should also be feebler.
     M. Becquerel assumes that liquids enclosed in capillary spaces
  play the part of solid conductors. This he finds supported by
  the circumstance that, from M. E. Becquerel's experiments, the
  conductivity of liquids in capillary tubes is greater than is due to
  the section of the liquid column. This important fact would tend
  to prove that the increase in density of the liquid layer retained
  on the surface of the glass by molecular attraction comes into
  play to form a voltaic circuit consisting solely of liquids.
   I   shall not dwell on the various improvements successively
 made by M. Becquerel in the construction of these apparatus,
 nor on the numerous experiments made to replace monosulphide

 of sodium by other solutions. Before concluding will restrict
 myself to remarking upon a few points which appear to me more
 important.
   I   will first call attention to a series of facts which would seem
 to prove the production of electric currents in the fissures of
 cracked glass vessels without the apparent intervention of che
 mical actions.      In    all
                            the phenomena previously described, the
 fissures  of   cracked vessels, though very narrow, nevertheless
 enable the two liquids which moisten the sides            to
                                                            react chemi
 cally upon each other       inthe capillary spaces and      give rise
                                                            to                  to
 electrochemical effects.      Now observe what takes place            the
                                                                       if
 magnitude      of the fissures    bevaried.   If  the size     relatively
                                                                is
great, the solutions mix more           less rapidly, giving rise
                                        or                             the to

the interval between the plates is only a few hundredths of a
millimetre, most of the metals are reduced; while when it is
only a few thousandths of a millimetre, silver and gold are easily
reduced, but the others only slowly and with difficulty.
    Using as a capillary space the interval between two plane
glass plates kept pressed against each other by a ligature, so that
there is only a very small capillary interval, the effects obtained
are much more regular than with slit tubes, which have not
everywhere the same width.           The liquid, which is a solution of
a  metal,  is introduced between the plates by means of a small
reservoir at the top, and the supply is so arranged that the
exit of the liquid by the edges is inappreciable, which is easily
effected.    The system of two plates between which is the liquid
is then immersed in an outer vessel containing the other solu
tion, that of the monosulphide for instance.
    It sometimes happens that the metallic deposits formed be
tween glass plates merely separated by an interval of a few hun
dredths of a millimetre, between which is a band of filtering
paper, and kept firmly bound, exert such an expansive force that
 even when the bands are not broken one of the plates               From                  is.

to suppose that the effect observed is only the result of the che
mical action, more or less modified by the fact that the space is
capillary—and in particular that the action can only take place
on a small number of molecules at a time and successively,                                                           in
stead of acting on the whole of the two solutions at the same time.
This is evidently an important point to investigate.       It is very
probable that the chemical action is modified by the so-called
molecular attraction to which capillarity is attributed.     It is also
possible that this so-called molecular attraction is only one form
of affinity—or rather that the two forces are only one, so that in
the capillary spaces the liquid is not in the same conditions,
physical or chemical, which it presents when it is in mass; thus
the action of another liquid on the capillary layer would be quite
different from that which it exerts in     ordinary state.         its
                                                                would                                 It

from their arrangement in the field of view, the intervals between
them, their colour, and general aspect”*. To bring this into
harmony with the preceding determinations in which measures
were made, we must suppose that M. Rayet’s B and E were in
reality C and b. It is to be observed that the intervals between
B and C, and between E and b, are the two smallest of the                                      in
tervals between lines lettered by Fraunhofer, and therefore that
these rays are the most liable to be confounded in such eye-esti
mates as M. Rayet made.       The details of M. Janssen’s obser
vations have not reached Europe; but he describes hydrogen as
detected in the principal protuberance; and therefore his report
also inclines in favour of C.   On the whole, then, we may with
most   safety conclude that the lines seen were probably C, D, b,
F, the hydrogen line near G, and four other very faint lines.
Those which seem to be identified are the principal lines of hy
drogen, sodium, and magnesium—the three gases in the solar

Society (see Proceedings of the Royal Society, vol. xvii.).    [For
convenience of reference the paragraphs of this paper are num

  450               Mr. G.    J. Stoney on the Bearing    of
  before we could be spectators of them.             It now appears that
  some, at least, of them escape—or, to speak more accurately, the
  marginal parts of some of them; for it will probably be found,
  if they can be submitted to examination with a sufficiently fine
  slit, that there is a central stripe of each blotted out by absorp
  tion, and appearing as a narrow dark line in the middle of each
  bright line. We must also bear in mind that there may be other
 lines emitted so narrow that they cannot cross the surrounding
 atmosphere.
     100. Which lines then reached the earth 7 Plainly those
 which, as they were emitted by the incandescent gas, were
 broader than the corresponding dark lines of the solar spectrum,
 or at least than that part of the width of the latter which is due
 to the absorption of those strata of the sun’s atmosphere through
 which we have to look in viewing the prominence.              And as even
 lines of the same gas differ from one another in this tendency to
 spread out when heated, we see at once how one hydrogen line,
 C, could seem to Mr. Lockyer to extend further downwards in
 the solar atmosphere than another, F+. The lower part of F was
 no doubt effaced by the greater absorption of a hotter part of
 the atmosphere telling with more effect upon F than upon C.
 We must remember, too, that the ascending column may carry
 with it gases from lower regions of the solar atmosphere to
heights not usually reached by them.              Any rays which they
would then emit while in the gaseous condition would be un
 obstructed in passing out through the surrounding atmosphere;
 and such may be some of the faint lines seen by M. Rayet.
 However, such constituents would probably, for the most part,
 soon cease to be gaseous, and augment the cloud by being chilled
into a mist, or by hanging on the limits between their precipi
 tated and gaseous conditions in the way explained in § 71.              In
any of these ways their spectral lines may be either enfeebled or
suppressed.
     101. Solar clouds may be of various kinds (see $$ 69 and
 71). But the light from a sufficiently attenuated mist of parti
cles giving a continuous spectrum would have the property of
being so weakened in the spectroscope by being spread over the
whole length of the spectrum, that it might be easily overlooked
in such hurried observations        as were made last    Augustí.    It ap
pears probable, therefore, that the protuberance which was most

    f  Thus if a salt of sodium be burned in a candle-flame, though the so
 dium adds but little to the aggregate light of the flame, yet in a spectro
 scope with a sufficiently narrow slit the flame will give a background of
 almost insensible faintness upon which the two sodium lines are brilliantly
projected.

and the photosphere.       There can be little doubt now that this
shell of clouds,  which I erroneously supposed lay almost in con
tact with the hot stratum over the photosphere, is in reality no
other than the long-sought boundary of the atmospheres of iron
and of the other gases near it in vapour-density, and that the
spectrum seen by Captain Haig will, when examined through a
sufficiently fine slit, prove to be that spectrum of bright lines
coincident with the fainter of the dark lines of ordinary sunlight,
to which          I
             last year took the liberty of asking the attention of
the observersk. It is a matter equally of interest and import
ance to ascertain whether this bright spectrum may not be ob
served in the absence of an eclipse, in the way in which the
spectra of protuberances have been made out by Messrs. Lockyer
and Janssent.
   105. The whole of the light, however, which is seen with the
telescope in this bright region cannot emanate from these spec
tral lines, although most of what is seen with the spectroscope
probably does.      For light from this class of spectral lines would
maintain          its
               brightness           the edge     up

 cloud permanently established at a sufficient height in their at
 mospheres, the cloud must act as a carrier of heat and raise the
 layer of hydrogen in which it floats to incandescence, while the
 adjoining strata on both sides remain cool.   The cloud might be
 of any of the kinds enumerated in §§ 69 & 71 of my paper “On
 the Constitution of the Sun.” And if the stellar atmosphere
 extend far outside the stratum of cloud, we may expect to find a
 dark absorption-band in the middle of each of the four bright
 hydrogen lines of these stars.

      I would wish to take thisopportunity of asking the reader to
correct two errors in my previous papers.      In a paper “On the
 Internal Motions of Gases compared with the Motions of Waves
of Light,” Phil. Mag. for August 1868, in the last line of § 2,
for 16° or upwards of 250 times read VI6 times. And in the
paper “On the Physical Constitution of the Sun and Stars”
cancel the footnote to § 28 (Proceedings of the Royal Society,
vol. xvii. pp. 20 & 21).                                  o
    From a review of the additional iron lines seen   by  Angström
with a continuous electric current, his account of whichº I have
succeeded in procuring within the last month, it is manifest that
the cause of their not being seen in the spark from Ruhmkorff’s
                                                I
machine is in most cases not what conjectured in the footnote,
but a purely physiological phenomenon.       The spark is so evan
escent  (lasting only one three-thousandth,  or thereabouts, of the
time required to make the maximum impression on the retina)
that no lines which are not of the exalted intensity that will com
pensate for this can be seen.      It is evident, therefore, that a
vastly feebler continuous current may reveal multitudes of lines
not visible to our eyes in the spark.

    These are the equations by which the action of sodium on
ethers of the fatty acids has been explained by me.             All of them
represent change of the same kind, viz. displacement of the acid
forming radical by sodium. The difference between them re
lates to whether the acid-forming radical is simply isolated, or
enters into combination with more or less sodium.
    The first of these equations was given in 1864*. The second
was announced last year at the Meeting of the British Associa
tion in Dundee, and is to be found in ‘The Laboratory,’ p.409.
The third was also given in a modified form in Dundee, but di
stinctly brought forward and insisted upon at the last Meeting
 of the British Association at Norwich.           A report of the paper
read at Norwich occurs in the ‘Chemical News,’ 11 Sept. 1868,

  The sodium dissolved completely, without evolution of gas.
To the product of the action water was afterwards added ; there
was again no evolution of gas.  Two layers of liquid resulted on
adding water, viz. an oily layer, containing, of course, much ether,
and an aqueous layer, which was powerfully alkaline.
   The aqueous layer was examined.        The amount of free alkali
ascertained  by the use of test-acid was equivalent to 5:13 grims.
of sodium.    Furthermore,    by careful distillation of the aqueous
layer, there was extracted from it 4.5 grims. of absolute alcohol.
   The oily layer, after being deprived of ether and dried, weighed
19 grims. A sojourn of forty hours in vacuo over sulphuric acid
brought about a loss of 0.9 grm. A combustion made of the
oilyielded the following numbers—C=66:31 per cent., H=11.7

   The  properties of this very interesting compound will be more
fully described on a future occasion.       It is an oily liquid of a
very pale yellow colour (whether this colour is essential or not                                                                   I
cannot tell).  Boiling-point about 215°C. It has a very power
ful and very  peculiar  smell. “Limited oxidation” appears to
give only valerianic acid.    Its spec. grav. in the liquid state is
about 0.90 at  ordinary   temperatures.

the first examples of the actual visible representation of any de
rived involutes of the circle beyond those of the first order.                                                                     I
propose, for want of a better word, provisionally to give the name
of Cyclodes (suggested by Professor Cayley) to these spirals.
They may be considered a genus of a more general class of
spirals which I propose to name algebraical spirals, defined by
the condition that the perpendicular on the tangent from a cer
tain fixed point (which may be termed            pole)      rational                   its

 460                        Mr.      J. J.        Sylvester's Second Note on
 clode may be said to be an integral algebraical spiral, i.e. one
 in which the perpendicular on the tangent becomes a rational
 integral function of the angle of contingence.
        I
      find in a certain question, presently to be alluded to, the
 theory of the class so indisputably bound up with that of the
 genus, as to persuade me of the importance of the theory of the
 former being gone into by some one who has leisure for the                                                            in
 vestigation, and of the desirableness of an organic description
 being discovered or devised for the rational fractional case. The
 peculiar feature of the cyclode class is the absence of points of
 inflection, real or imaginary. The cusps of cyclodes are strictly
 analogous to the asymptotes in algebraical curves, like them
 entering and disappearing in pairs, creating partial interrup
 tions of continuity, and thus separating the curve into distinct
 branches *.  In the                        same way as the order of an algebraical
 curve is determined                        by the number of     intersections with      its
 any right line,                  any such spiral may                                               be

 The Elements    of Plane Geometry  for  the use of Schools and Colleges.
    By Richard P. WRIGHT, formerly Teacher of Geometrical Drawing
    &c. in Queenwood College, Hampshire. With a Preface by T. ARCHER
    HIRST, F.R.S. &c., Professor of Mathematics in University College,
    London.    London: Longmans and Co. 1868 (pp. 211).
 IN    noticing this work we shall, in the first place, speak of it simply
       as a Treatise on Plane Geometry, and abstain from weighing
its merits against those of any other manual.        Regarded from this
point of view, we may mention that it consists of four books; of
which the first two are elementary, the third treats of ratio and of
 similar figures, the fourth of areas.  The first two books are in sub
stance very nearly the same as props. 1–34 of the 1st book, props.
 1–33 of the 3rd book, and a few propositions in the 4th book of
Euclid's ‘Elements;’ the differences, which at first sight look much
greater than they really are, consist mainly in arrangement and
in modes of statement and proof. For instance, the theorem “Through
any three points A B C, not in the same straight line, one, and only
one, circumference can always be drawn,” and the problem “To de
scribe a circle which shall pass through three given non-collinear
points, P, Q, R,” are neither more nor less than the theorem “One
circumference of a circle cannot cut another at more than two points,”
and the problem “To describe a circle about a given triangle.” The
 arrangement, however, is very different; e.g. the first chapter of
the first book is devoted to theorems equivalent to props. 13, 14, 15
of Euclid's 1st book.      But perhaps the capital difference is that
Mr.    Wright   reserves the solution of problems to the end of the
second book.      It might be thought that to assume a variety of
constructions in proving theorems without showing that previously
proved theorems give the means of making those constructions,
would lead to reasoning in a vicious circle; and of course this might
easily happen.      But we believe that Mr. Wright has avoided the
danger, and that the deduction of his various theorems is perfectly
rigorous.
   The first chapter of the third book is devoted to a very elaborate
discussion of the doctrine of ratio and proportion.       The line taken
will be most easily understood by a citation of two definitions.
Ratio is defined thus:– “Between every two magnitudes A and B
of the same kind, there exists a relation answering to the inquiry how
often the first contains the second, which is called the ratio of A to
B.” Proportionality is thus defined :—“When two associated and
variable magnitudes are so related that the ratio of any two values,
A, A, of A, is equal to the ratio of the corresponding values, B, B,
of B, these magnitudes are said to be proportional.”       It is tolerably
plain, from the definition of ratio, that the discussion has to be pre
ceded by an introductory discussion of commensurability and incom
mensurability, which, again, introduces the conception of limits.

change, if effected, will be for the worse, even if books as good as
Mr. Wright's are adopted. We think that an advocate for the use of
Euclid's ‘Elements’ might fairly urge–
   (1) That, on the whole, the first and third books of Euclid would
prove easier to a learner than Mr. Wright's first and second books.
   (2) That the arrangement by which theorems are treated first and
problems afterwards is calculated to weaken the learner's perception
of the conditions of proof, and that it might in many cases lead to
an unnoticed failure of proof. And he might urge that most learners,
particularly boys, more readily understand a reason for a thing done,
than a reason for an abstract truth of which they do not see the
use.

MOLECULAR CHANGE PRODUCED BY MAGNETISM IN STEEL BARS.
                              BY M. TREves.
    More than twenty years ago several physicists, among others

472              Intelligence   and Miscellaneous          Articles.
Messrs. Wheatsone, Joule, Wertheim, and De la Rive, showed in
various ways the influence of magnetization on the molecular con
stitution of iron and of steel.
   The vibrations produced in rods and wires of steel or of soft iron
by an alternate succession of magnetizations and demagnetizations,
as well as the modifications which magnetization produces in the
elasticity and even the dimensions of these metals, have led to the
assumption that the development of magnetism is due to a common
direction imparted to the particles of magnetic metals, and conse
quently to a change in the arrangement of the molecules—a conclu
sion directly verified by a great number of researches, and especially
by those of M. Wertheim. The following new fact confirms in a
remarkable manner this mode of view.
    M. Trèves has been led to examine the change of molecular con
dition produced in a bar of iron when it is subjected to a magnetic
action.
   He takes two identical steel tuning-forks, which therefore are in
unison; he provides them with mirrors by Lissajou's method, and
arranges them opposite and in planes at right angles to each other.
One of them is surrounded by a stout helix, through which is passed
the current of a battery of eight elements. If one of them be sounded
by a bow the vibrations commence; and as the tuning-forks are in
tune, the figure reflected in the second mirror is a perfectly fixed
luminous circle.     Magnetizing suddenly the tuning-fork in the
middle of the coil, the luminous circle is at once inclined, changes
into an ellipse, vibrates right and left with a velocity which gives
the measurement of the new vibratory motion.
   The tuning-forks used gave 136 simple vibrations in a second ;
and it has constantly been observed that a beat was produced at
intervals of six seconds, which means that in a second the tuning
fork suddenly magnetized gave 1364 vibrations.       If the current be
                to is,
                   the tuning-fork restored
opened (that                                               its
                                                    natural state), the

figure ceases      move and again becomes        fixed circle.

   Since 1847 Mr. Joule”, working with soft iron and with steel
wires stretched      or
                      not stretched, had observed the changes        length
                                                                         in
and volume when they are magnetized.           The preceding arrangement
may also   be  utilized for this investigation; and M. Trèves proposes
    use this optical method,                graphically tracing vibrations,
