          I.   On different Forms of                 the   Virial.        By R. CLAUsius+.
MY
|               theorem of the virial has already given rise to some
                discussions on the forms which the virial can assume.
I  myself, in my first memoir relative to itt, indicated that when
the movable points partly exert forces upon one another, and
partly are acted on by forces from without, the virial can be
analyzed into an internal and an external, and gave their forms
for certain frequently occurring cases. Yvon Villarceau subse
quently (Comptes Rendus, vol. lxxv.) effected other transforma
tions of the equation relating to        especially         it,

the centre      gravity and the relative motions

 points about the centre      gravity, and referring the equation

    It scarcely needs to be mentioned that in equations (8), (14),
(15), (19), (20), and (25), as well as in the earlier corresponding
equations, with the formation of mean values the last term
(which is a differential coefficient according to time) drops out,
and the terms then remaining on the right-hand side are forms
for virials, the special signification of which is readily seen in the
individual cases.

which is the case with the angles themselves, since to one direc
tion an infinite number of angles belong, which differ from one
another by 27.      In the former case Xpg is a quantity the value
of which, with a stationary motion, varies only within certain
limits, and accordingly the mean value of the differential coeffi
cient, taken according to time, of this quantity may at once be
regarded as vanishing and be omitted from the above expres
sion.   In the latter case, on the contrary, the mean value of that
differential coefficient does not necessarily vanish, and hence it
must remain in the expression for further consideration.

Th;      following is a simple and thoroughly general explana

  Suppose, for simplicity and greater generality, that the instru

rying a pencil at each end, A and B; and suppose any lines A a,
Bºb were traced out by these pencils: we will consider how the
area A a b B may be expressed in terms of land the motion of
some point in the line A B.
   Let the motion from A B to a 3 represent an elementary
motion of the bar, the centre of it C moving from C to y, and
the bar turning about y through the angle d0;          dm- the                             let

Smyth”, and others, which show that the spectrum is continuous,
and not perceptibly different from that of faint sunlight. The
writer has also made numerous observations with a spectroscope
specially arranged for faint light, of which an account will be
published hereafter, and which lead to the same conclusion.      It
may be mentioned further that a particular object in these ob
servations was to determine whether any bright lines or bands
were present in the spectrum, or whether there is any connexion
between the zodiacal light and the polar aurora; and the results
give, as an answer to the question, a decided negative. This is
important here, as excluding from the possible causes of the
light the luminosity of gaseous matter, either spontaneous or
due to electrical discharge.   The supposition that the light is
reflected from masses of gas, or from globules of precipitated
vapour, is not to be entertained, since, as Zöllnert has shown,
such globules in otherwise empty space must evaporate com
pletely, and a gaseous matter would expand until           density                           its
became far too small      exert any visible effect upon the rays
                                   to                                                                    of
light.
   We must conclude, then, that the light       reflected from mat        is
ter  inthe solid state—that                        is,
                                  from innumerable small bodies
revolving about the sun         orbits,    which more

                                  confirmation, since spectroscopic
                                              to
appearances alone leave      uncertain whether the matter
                                        it                         not                             is

similar     their character

this   purpose the  apparatus  already described was employed,
there being added to it a support for the object, with a hori
zontal circle for determining the azimuths in placing the object
and the light.     The substances examined had approximately
plane surfaces, which were placed vertically and so that the
normal, at the point observed, bisected the angle between the
lines from it to the eye and the illuminating flame. The light
being thus polarized in a horizontal plane, was depolarized (that
is, compensated)                      by

the different oceans, as well as between the trade-winds and the
equatorial currents, is most striking.
   Both in the Atlantic and in the Pacific and Indian Oceans
there flows from east to west, on each side of the equator, a cur
rent extending over about 20 degrees of latitude” and many
thousand feet deep. This is named the equatorial current,
while for more particular designations the names of the ocean
and hemisphere in question are added.         Between these two

parallels, therefore entirely as with the compensation-currents,
constant west winds prevail, under the name of anti-trades.
Between these constant air-currents there are, just as with the
sea-currents, both in the vicinity of the equator and not far from
the 30th degree of latitude in both hemispheres, zones of no
wind, which are known by the name of the equatorial and the
tropical calms. The trade-winds, with the calm-zones belonging
to them, shift a little with the seasons—in the summer of the
northern hemisphere moving somewhat northward, and in the
winter toward the south.            In the currents of the ocean this
 shifting of the zones is less marked; hence the currents of
water and           air  not exactly correspond; yet, excepting slight
                           do
 deviations, the trade-winds with their calms present the same
picture       as
               the equatorial currents with their streamless zones.
In   spite, however,         this striking similarity, the trade-winds

rapid, the polar wind is turned westward, and expresses itself in
the northern hemisphere by a north-east, in the southern by a
south-east wind. In the higher strata the ascending air returns
to the poles to serve as a compensation for the air which has
flowed thence to warmer latitudes.     As this upper anti-trade
streams polewards, it receives from the rotation of the earth a

constant west wind of the middle latitudes.     The ascent of the

    On the other hand, Mühry accounts for the compensation

28            Baron N. Schilling                on the Constant Currents
equatorial water would stand 14 feet higher than the water of
the polar seas, if it could not flow off.   It has been thought
that this  tendency of the equatorial water-surface to rise would
serve to account for the Gulf-stream, which accordingly would
flow down hill.   But this inconsiderable elevation of the surface
of the equatorial sea would not give a fall of even 3 inch in a
German mile, which, in relation to the velocity, is much too
little.  Even the assumed elevation of the surface, however, can
never actually be produced; for as soon as any particles of
water become a little lighter, they must, in obedience to the law
of gravitation, immediately spread uniformly over the entire
surface.   Thereby is necessarily produced a flow of the warmer
and therefore lighter superficial water to the colder regions, and
of the heavier cold water at the bottom to the warmer regions.
Such an exchange of the waters of the warmer and                                     colder seas
exists in reality.  A proof of this is furnished by                             the tempe
ratures of the ocean diminishing with increasing                                depth—the
temperatures of the greater depths being very low,                              even in the
equatorial regions.   An exception to this rule is                               formed by
 those seas which are divided from the ocean                                by a ridge over
which the water is considerably less deep.        In such seas the
 temperature sinks merely to a depth corresponding to the height
 of the water above the ridge, and below that remains nearly
 unaltered, because the colder water, cut off by the ridge, can
 have no influx.    We have an example in the Mediterranean,
 united with the ocean by the Straits of Gibraltar, the depth of
 which is only a little over 100 fathoms,    and in the Skagerrack
and some Norwegian fjords, for which the bottom of the pro
portionally much shallower North Sea forms a ridge.           It is
therefore unquestionable that water flows at the surface of the
sea out of warmer into colder, and in         depths out    its
                                                             colder                      of
into warmer   regions;           so

which may have lasted an hour, the blue water had moved along
the surface, and the red along the bottom; but, notwithstanding
the pretty considerable difference of temperature and the length
of time, the coloured water particles had travelled only a few
feet.   This experiment proves, therefore, only what we have
already said—that through difference of temperature an ex
change of the water particles must take place, but that this
exchange proceeds very slowly, even with considerable difference
of temperature and with little distance between the differently
heated waters.
   In nature, however, the difference of temperature of sea
water is proportionally inconsiderable,    never amounting in the
whole to more than about 30°C., while this difference is dis
tributed over the vast distance of the polar from the equatorial
seas.   It thus appears, then, impossible that this cause can have
power to set in motion such a current as the Gulf-stream.     Even
the mass of the heated water, which is so readily invoked, cannot
here exert any accelerating action, because only an incon
siderable superficial layer is warmed by the sun, and nothing
hinders the direct, gradual, and immediately complete inter
change of the water particles.         Only when large basins of
water of different  temperatures   are united by a channel can the
mass of the warmer water       play  a part, and the difference of
temperature generate a considerable current in the channel.
Thus, for example, we may regard the northern part of the
Atlantic between Norway and Greenland as a broad channel
connecting the north-polar basin with the ocean.                      ".
   The   air, however,    expands   15 times as much         by  heating  as
water, and the influence of temperature-difference                  on air
currents is undeniable; yet even here that influence is generally
very much overrated. For air, as well as water, is a bad conductor
of heat, and therefore only slowly changes                             its
                                                         temperature and

   Evaporation, then, also cannot occasion any perceptible cur

with the ocean a difference of level between the two seas, arising
from greater evaporation of the inland sea, may occasion a strong
current. We have instances of this in the Straits of Gibraltar
and Babelmandeb.

34                    Baron N. Schilling on                       the Constant Currents
flowing must rapidly diminish downward, and soon entirely
cease.  A. Findlay” thinks that the wind can never call forth
a current of greater depth than 5 fathoms.     James Croll's re
markt, that the duration of the wind, as well as its force, must
have great influence on the depth to which it acts, may to a
certain extent be quite correct; but, nevertheless, action of the
wind upon currents at a depth of thousands of feet (as, for                                                      in
stance, in the equatorial current) is not possible; hence we
must see that Franklin and Rennell's view, that the equatorial
current results from the action of the trade-winds, cannot be
true.
   Nature herself gives us decisive proofs against that view.
With the shifting of the zone of calms it happens that the
equatorial current flows just as well in that zone as in the trade
wind. In the Indian Ocean the change of the monsoons has
scarcely any influence on the equatorial stream.              The Gulf
stream often flows in opposition to very violent storms, which
would be impossible if         motive force lay its  the trade-wind.            in

sure prevails.   It is self-evident that a current thus produced
in the ocean can only be very inconsiderable and inconstant,
since it changes with every change of the atmospheric pressure.
This force, again, can only make itself perceptible in channels.
   Suppose that on an inland sea connected with the ocean
only by a strait the barometer suddenly fell 1 inch, the level of
this sea would stand 13-6 inches lower than equilibrium with
the ocean at the moment would require.        The mass of water
wanting must therefore pass from the ocean through the strait.
   We must ascribe it to this circumstance that, in the Sound, a
change in the direction of the current mostly occurs 24 hours
before a change in the direction of the wind. Just so the water
usually rises in the Gulf of Finland before the south-west wind
commences;     and this rise is noticed also in winter, when the
entire surface of the sea is covered with ice, and thereby the
direct action of the wind is withdrawn.
                     b. Saltness of Sea-water.
   Alterations in the saltness of seas greatly affect the specific
gravity of the water.    The observations, however, which have
been made in different parts of the world have proved that the
difference in saltness of the various oceans is extremely slight*.
This compels us to the conclusion that currents immediately
tend to equalize the slightest difference in the saltness of the
water.
  The causes of change in the saltness may be accidental and
temporary, or constantly repeating themselves in certain regions.
In the first case they produce variable currents, which do not
belong to the subject we are considering; but in the second
they must confer upon the water a constant tendency to inter
change, and call forth constant currents.
   In the equatorial regions, for example, the half inch of water
evaporated daily leaves constantly                     its
                                              salt behind, which, with
           depth          ocean,        hardly  add perceptibly              to
                    of of

specific gravity     the rest          of
                                  the water.
   Nevertheless    this water, very gradually becoming slightly
salter and heavier, and sinking, must occasion            the depths
                                                              in                   a

vations seem       contradict this, the reason may well
                           to                                      that the                            be
 thermometers were not      sufficiently   protected   against   the pres
 sure     of
          the  depths, and hence     always   gave   the  temperature                                                 of
 the bottom too high.   On this defect rests also Ross's                                                          well

      At
       the mouths       rivers, the fresh water must spread upon
                                      of
 the surface, and therefore give rise        current running out           toa
 wards from the     mouth,   until       mixed sufficiently with the

 salt water.   To this   end,  however,  the heavy salt water will
 flow     in
         the  opposite direction,  toward the mouth—which, even
 with     slight current, must greatly favour the formation
           a                                                                                                             of

with river-mouths, the upper current in the channel of discharge
will flow outwards, while an undercurrent of constantly salt
water must flow inwards. But in seas where the evaporation
exceeds the influx (for example, in the Mediterranean and the
Red Sea), the upper current must flow in through the channel,
and the undercurrent carry out the superfluous salt.            An
extremely interesting example of this sort is presented by the
Gulf of Karabughaz, which is connected with the Caspian by a
very flat channel of only a few feet depth.    As the evaporation
from the  very spacious surface of the gulf, into which no streams
flow, is very great, especially in summer, water is perpetually
flowing in from the Caspian with a velocity that sometimes rises
to 6 knots an hour. Of course this current brings much salt
into the gulf, from which it cannot get out again, because the
channel is too shallow to permit an outflow beneath.      The salt
thus accumulating is deposited in crystals on the bottom; and
thus the Gulf of Karabughaz plays the part of a saltpan conti
nually withdrawing salt from the Caspian Sea. If in the course
of time the sand washed in by the waves should completely
block up the shallow strait which joins the gulf to the sea (which
would long since have happened if the current were not so
strong), Karabughaz as a lake would soon evaporate completely
and leave behind a basin of solid salt, such as we see in the
Elton-See and in Iletzkaja Saschtschita as formations of pri
meval times.
     If in   any part   of the ocean animal life be developed in greater
abundance   than in others, the excessive abstraction of salt or
lime from the water by the animals will also give rise to slight
movements of the water.         Although such movements could
scarcely be called a current, it cannot be doubted that such must
take place in the deepest seas even at the bottom, because other
wise no life would be possible there; for among the animals
living in the depths there are creatures that cannot change their
place; nourishment must consequently be brought to them by
Currents.
   The theory of perfect stillness in the bottom waters of the
sea + is therefore, like the theories of Ross and Forbes, to be
regarded as incorrect.
   We have thus examined                all
                               the causes which affect the specific
gravity      of
           sea-water and the air, and come    the conclusion that

                                      the ocean we must assume that there
is   almost complete stillness.”—Lehre iber die Meeres-Strümungen,  p.   5.

which is as directly derived from gravitation as is that of a
water-mill upon a mountain-stream. The water is raised in the
former case by gravitation towards the moon and by gravitation
falls back towards the earth; in the latter it is raised by evapo
ration, and falls back to the sea by gravitation. It is true that
the earth’s and the moon’s rotation are “inseparable accidents”
to the rise and then the fall of the surface of the sea at any
particular point; but the source of the power is derived, not
from the mechanism nor at the expense “of the earth's rotation,”
but as directly from gravitation as is the case in any ordinary
mill-stream.    If I am wrong in this I shall gladly accept cor
rection. My chief object here, however, is to ask whether
(assuming the actuality of retardation of rotation by the tidal
wave acting as a brake, and be its amount more or less) there
may not be other forces in action upon our globe tending to
countervail this to a greater or less extent.    It seems to me that
there are—though, so far as my reading goes, I have not seen
any notice of such on the part of physical writers. Every particle
of matter (rotating as part of our earth) which descends from a
higher to a lower elevation, must in doing so part with kinetic
energy proportionate to                 its
                             decrease invelocity     rotation between      of

subsequent    movements are coerced by them.        Except througn
the winds it has no     point  d'appui upon  the solid earth. . Now
the movements of the winds, however largely modified by the
form and rotation of our earth, mainly depend upon differences
of temperature produced by the sun's heat; it would seem there
fore that, so far as the kinetic energy of the ascending particle
of vapour is concerned, it may or may not affect, and, if at
all, very slightly, the horizontal motions of the winds, but can
have no effect upon the rotation of the earth.
    The case is different, however, as soon as the particle of vapour
raised by molecular forces to the level of a mountain-top is pre
cipitated thereon as rain or snow, and begins to descend again
 towards the ocean whence it came : at every foot of          descent                     its
it  parts with kinetic energy, which       transfers directly    itthe                                to

ocean-level as a datum plane, the changes of level originating
land and sea may have tended rather to accelerate than retard
the earth's rotation.      Taking the mean of the sediment stated
to be carried by six great rivers, namely the Mississippi, Po,
Vistula, Rhine, Ganges, and Rhone, it amounts to about Tºry
in volume of the water discharged; and if we apply this to the
water discharged from the whole surface of the land, as above
stated, we have **** = 1990 cubic miles of sediment annually
discharged at the sea-level.         These rough estimates are pro
bably far from correct, and we do not know with any pre
cision what is the mean specific gravity of this sediment, nor
from what mean height it may be considered to have descended;
 but we can easily see that the loss of rotative energy during the
descent of this vast mass, if transferred to the globe as a whole,
is scarcely negligible. Nor does this represent               that we have                all

                                     think it is to be greatly regretted
that the   original memoir,    very tardily  published in the Transac
tions of the Royal Society, should be so difficult of access, that
few of those interested are enabled to appreciate the caution and
laborious conscientiousness which Mallet has brought to bear on
his investigation and discussion of this most complex problem,
and to what extent he has himself anticipated most of the ob
jections raised. In calling attention to some apparent omissions
in this respect, it may be useful to recall the state of the ques
 tion as regards some of the more prominent points at issue.
    The first and most sweeping attack upon the very basis of
 Mallet’s theory comes from Sir William Thomson, in a letter to
 Mr. Poulett Scrope (Nature, Feb. 1, 1872), in which he calls
attention        to,
               and reaffirms the results      his investigation (supple

                              the earth must exert upon precession
and mutation, and which led him            the conclusion that, unless

result from compression, would scarcely seem admissible, save in
a case of absolute homogeneity and equilibrium—if then.        It is
certainly incompatible with the demonstration made by Professor
Belli of Pavia (as quoted by Mallet), to the effect that rigid
bodies are weakened by the simultaneous application of ortho
gonal pressures—that no known materials could sustain, under
any circumstances, a strain several hundred times greater than
that which would crush it if laterally free to yield—that such
 strains exist in the contracting crust, and that upward deforma
 tion must result, if such contraction takes place at all, as the
 annual loss of heat by the earth compels us to assume is the case.

 by that of the demonstrated increase of temperature as we de

                     a                       pressure—or whether    of
 we even consider alone the secular loss         heat     radiation,      of              by

twenty-five miles of sedimentary rocks is not anywhere (on the
continental areas at least) actually superimposed vertically upon
the crust, and hence that it is not unreasonable to assume
that a pressure sufficiently great to produce fusion may never
occur within the limits of the sedimentary strata, albeit other
manifestations of subterraneous thermal action may not be
wanting.      It is true that, on the whole, Mallet’s memoir leaves
upon the reader’s mind the impression that he seeks the source
of volcanic action at depths sufficiently shallow to justify in a
measure     the objection raised by Forbes, although he ex
pressly declares that, with our present data, the determination
of the points at which the maximum of crushing-effects occurs
is impossible.
    Similar considerations apply to the objection raised by F. W.
 Hutton (Nature, Nov. 27, 1873), that “faults show no heating
effects, even where considerable crushing has taken place.”
The pressure under which the faulting occurred may have been                                                        j

46               Mr. E. W. Hilgard on         some   points in
 subject for the proof of the efficiency of this agency. But we
 find that the maximum of temperature resulting from the crush
 ing to powder + of the hardest rock is something over 217°
 Fahr. This, then, represents the maximum increment of tem
 perature that can be rendered efficient toward the fusing of
 rocks by the crushing process under the most favourable cir
 cumstances, viz. upon the supposition that it takes place                  in
 stantaneously, or under such circumstances that the heat can
 not be conducted away, and, further, that the resistance of the
 rock has not been materially diminished by the downward in
crease of hypogeal temperature.   At the most moderate depths
at which volcanic phenomena can be supposed to originate, the
last-mentioned factor must exert a very considerable influence,
reducing materially the available heat-increment. Hence the
numerical results of Mallet’s laborious experiments on rock
 crushing, however interesting and useful as affording a definite
 measure of the thermal effects producible by this means, yet
 fail to carry conviction as to the efficacy of this particular modus
 operandi in reducing large masses of solid rock to fusion, unless
 essentially supplemented by friction, not so much of rock walls
 against each other, but more probably by the heat produced
 within more or less comminuted detrital or igneoplastic masses
 by violent pressure and deformation.
    It may be doubtful what would be the physical and thermal
 effect of enormously great pressures upon rock powder such as
 was produced in Mallet’s experiments; but it would seem that
 if made to yield, the frictional effect must produce very high
 temperatures.      A fortiori, solid detrital masses of variously
 sized  fragments    intermingled (such as, rather than powder,
 would be   likely to result from steady pressure), yielding rapidly
 under great pressures, might, under the combined influence of
friction and rock-crushing, well be supposed to reach the tempe
 rature of fusion, which a simple crushing of a solid mass by
 pressure would have failed to produce.        Mallet mentions the
 probable influence of friction, and of the squeezing of igneo
plastic masses, but does not attach to these agencies such im
portance as they seem to me to deserve.
    Of the complex thermal effects of the movements of detrital
masses under great pressure, Mallet’s figures of course offer no
measure whatsoever; nor is this, or even the thermal coefficients
resulting from his rock-crushing experiments, at                 all
                                                            necessary

the heat evolved in the crushing of rigid bodies is the equiva
lent of the work performed,” Mallet’s experiments on the con
traction of fused rock in cooling, and his estimates of the amount
of volcanic energy manifested on the globe, coupled with that of
the earth’s annual loss of heat, completed the proof of the quan
 titative adequacy of the cause invoked by him. And when it is
 understood that the earth’s present loss of heat during sixteen
 and a half years is the mechanical equivalent of            the volcanic                 all
 work performed since the period          fissure eruptions, the burthen

the movements as taking place exclusively within the solid
shell, he (unnecessarily as it seems to me) leaves a point open
to objection.
   While admitting that slow secular oscillations, or those minor
changes of level constantly occurring in volcanic areas, may
even now in many cases be reasonably attributed to changes of
temperature occurring within the solid rocks themselves, and
within their limits of elasticity, it is impossible to assign this
as an adequate cause of those extensive oscillations which
have characterized the Quaternary period, and are recorded,
e.g., by the raised beaches of the North-Atlantic coasts and
inlets, and by the drift-pebbles even now found four hundred
and fifty feet below the level of the Gulf of Mexico, while the
emerged formations record a complementary            elevation to at
least a similar extent during the Terrace epoch.         This record
of an oscillation of near a thousand feet on the Gulf-shore
since the glacial-drift epoch, implies at least a corresponding one
over the greater portion of the area drained by the Mississippi,
unless that river flowed backward at one time”.             Doubtless
these   oscillations,  like the glaciation of which   they   probably
were   cooperative   causes, were of continental  extent, as was the
 (more or less contemporary) emergence of the Siberian plain;
and as such they must be presumed to have been true move
ments of the earth’s crust, although lying quite within the vol
canic period proper. It is but reasonable to suppose that the
sinking of the great Pacific area was then, and may still be,
of a similar nature.

 50              Mr. E. W. Hilgard    on some points   in
 but may be obviated by admissible assumptions regarding the
 mode of distribution of the solid and liquid matter constituting
 the globe, we are led to the reasonable assumption that while
 the thickness and rigidity of the crust is evidently too great to
 admit of further folding or fissure-eruptions, and (probably) to
 admit of connecting ordinary volcanic phenomena directly with
 the (virtually or actually) liquid interior, yet we need not as
 sume it to be so great as to render the crust incapable of yield
 ing somewhat, on a large scale, to static upward pressure.      Such
 pressure may be either the resultant of tangential stress, such
 as might slightly deform an arch without fracture or folding,
 or even the direct result of a corresponding subsidence else
 where.
    The latter effect would of course be incompatible with a
 shrinking away of the fluid interior from the crust, as required
 by Mallet's theory, if it were necessary to assume that the        in
 terior crust-surface is substantially “smooth,” i. e. free from
 important downward projections or upward sinuosities.          But so
 far from this, the cooling influence that has so long acted on
 the oceanic areas, contrasted with those enormous outwellings
 of igneous rock that have occurred even in late Tertiary or
 Posttertiary times, together with other considerations, necessi
 tate the assumption that such inequalities do exist to a notable
 extent.    Hence the overlapping alluded to by Mallet of the
period of fissure-eruptions and of that of volcanic activity
proper, which appear to have coexisted, in different portions of
 the globe, from early Tertiary to early Quaternary times.         For
even Mallet himself considers the       outpourings  of  igneous rocks
on the Pacific coast “wholly inconsistent with existing vol
canic forces;” and few geologists will agree with LeConte + in
ascribing precisely these most extensive fissure-eruptions in the
world to the “ineffectual fires” of the volcanic period, arising
alone from transformed motion.
    Indeed   it is not  easy to understand    the precise mechanism
 of the great fissure-eruptions as a consequence of nucleal con
 traction, without the aid of some static head of pressure that may
 exist more or less locally, in consequence of inequalities in the
crust (whether of form, thickness, or density), and thus act as
a vis a tergo.
     At first blush the “squeezing out of sub-mountain liquid
matter,” assumed by LeConte as the consequence of the fold
ing and fissuring of strata by tangential thrust, appears natural
enough. Yet it seems hardly possible that the same force
which makes and elevates mountain folds (being the result of
interior shrinkage) should at the same time serve to compress the-

interior liquid, unless either such folding occurs beneath the
general level of the liquid, or the latter is locally confined,
or the movement is so (comparatively) brusque or cataclysmal,
that viscosity would prevent the lateral or downward escape of
the liquid rock. In the case of the Pacific eruptions the evi
dence of steady static outflow and regular upbuilding is espe
cially cogent; and, as LeConte remarks, it has been slow work,
as indeed is usually or universally the case with mountain
building”.
    The assumption of locally limited fire seas with a solid globe
as made by Danat in conformity with Hopkins's views, would
remove the difficulty if the crust could be assumed as contract
ing on the whole independently of the portions over fire seas.
But when we come to discuss the application in detail of this
intrinsically improbable hypothesis, we find the required ex
tent and localities of these fire seas to be such that we can
hardly imagine them to be effectually separated from each
other; in other words, we approach very near to a condition of
general undercrust fluidity up to late geological periodst.      It
then becomes a question of minor importance whether there is
a central nucleus solidified by pressure, or whether        within                                          all

52       On some   points in Mallet's Theory of Vulcanicity.
case, we assume the existence of a thickly viscid, igneoplastic
undercrust layer.      Such a layer, while barely or very slowly
obeying the laws of liquid equilibrium, would be capable of
being liquefied by a slight increase of temperature, such as
might be produced by squeezing or kneading.             Portions of
such plastic matter would occasionally become involved in the
anticlinal folds of synclinoria, and thus supply the material for
limited fissure-eruptions, in that case literally “squeezed out.”
But the inverse ratio pointed out by Dana as existing between
folding and fissure-eruptions points to the rarity of such
events.
   At   any rate they could not explain the outwellings of the
 Pacific border, which continued long after close plications had
ceased to be made—in fact, as it would seem, up to the end of
the period of elevation of the main Sierra Nevada.
   It is but fair to assume that near lines of weakness indicated
by plications or fissure-eruptions, the isogeotherms have been
during the elevation of mountain-chains (and probably still are
where such lines are marked by volcanic vents) considerably
 above their general level.       In an anticlinal upheaval they
would    probably   conform to the progress of the sublevatory
movement, in a ratio more or less directly proportional to the
rapidity of the upward movement, and would gradually descend
during periods of repose.     This would happen independently of
any heat generated by transformation of motion.
   In a polygenetic chain like the Sierra Nevada, after the col
lapse and folding of the geosynclinal and the subsequent stif
fening of the backbone (so to speak), any further elevation of
the main ridge becomes a quasi-anticlinal movement, accom
panied necessarily by the compression and “squeezing” of the
heated rocks embraced within the arch.          The heating being
greatest, catteris paribus, where the resistance and motion is a
maximum, more heat would be generated by the compression
of the upper, half-stiffened portion of the viscous or igneoplastic
layer, than in the lower ones; and the liquid matter so formed
would constitute a head of pressure, from which fissure-erup
tions might derive their material; whether directly, or by pres
sure communicated to more distant points of rupture and fusion
by lateral stress.
   If, then, as LeConte's data seem to show, the final and most
considerable anticlinal elevation of the great interior range took
place during the same period that witnessed the great fissure
eruptions of the Coast and Cascade ranges, it may not be un
reasonable to suppose these events to have not only been con
temporaneous, but to have borne to each other something of
the relation of cause and effect, and that each of the numerous

                    Dr.      J.      Rae on some Physical Properties                                of Ice.                    57
being already saturated, can hold in solution no more salt than
it already contains.
   Could not salt be obtained readily and cheaply by this means
from sea-water in cold climates?
  During several long journeys on the Arctic coast, in the early
spring before any thaw had taken place, the only water to be
obtained was by melting snow or ice.       By experience     found                                                  I
that a kettleful of water could be obtained by thawing         with                                                     ice
a much less expenditure        fuel, and       shorter time, than

mense collection of extinct animals may be accounted for without
having recourse to the somewhat improbable theory that a very
great and sudden change had taken place in the climate of that
region.
    Ihave seen at the mouth of Hayes River in America animals
frozen up as above described; but as the latitude of this place is
only 57° north, the fixed ice usually wholly disappears before
the next winter sets in, and liberates the animals shut up in it;
but when the rivers reach the sea, as some of those of Siberia
do, 1000 or 1200 miles further to the north, it may be fairly
assumed that a large part of this fixed ice, protected as i would
be by a layer of mud, might continue unthawed.

length of solid rubber, is placed                     Fig. 1.

doubt that these illustrations alone will cause the book to have, as
it undoubtedly deserves to have, an extensive circulation.
    It will be evident from the large number of contrivances men
tioned in the above list, that the description of each must be brief,
and that the attention of the reader is mainly directed to the dy
namical principles involved in their use.           It could scarcely fail to
happen, under these circumstances, that in some cases points in
the contrivances are not quite so fully described as the reader
might wish. . In others the contrivance is regarded from a point of
view which does not bring quite the whole subject under notice;
and this is sometimes a little misleading.           For instance, the con
trivance for    feeding    a  running     train with water is considered
simply as an illustration of inertia; and this probably accounts for
the statement that the water which runs up the tube “is at rest
except so far as the movement in a vertical direction is concerned”
(p.49). As one end of the tube is vertically over the other end, it
is plain that the water before it leaves the tube must have acquired
the forward velocity of the train as well as the vertical velocity
with which it ascends the tube; and in fact the illustration of the
inclined plane pushed beneath the water (p. 49), if properly worked
out, shows this very point: e. g. conceive a particle (P) at rest
acted on by no forces, and an inclined plane (with an angle a)
moving forward with a velocity W to come into contact with it; an
 instantaneous action takes place between the plane and the point
 along the perpendicular to the plane; and after the action, P will
 move with a uniform velocity along a line in space coinciding with
 the position of the perpendicular at the instant of the action.                                    If
 we further suppose that there is no force of restitution, P, while
 moving in space along the above-mentioned line, will continue to
 touch the plane and appear to run up                 Supposing the mass

 other cause, the tendency has no effect so far as the present ques
 tion is concerned; and, finally, as the tube for a large part of its
length is nearly or quite vertical, the horizontal velocity of the as
 cending stream cannot fail to acquire the forward velocity of the
 train.
    The Statement of General Principles and the proofs of particular
 theorems contained in the text are (it is almost needless to say so)
 correct as far as we have noticed ; and the student who works at
 the book conscientiously will doubtless not fail to make it out,
 though the style does not generally show in any marked degree the
 power of clear exposition.     There is one point which ought not to
 be left unnoticed, as the author lays considerable stress upon it:
 he states that he has endeavoured “above all to show that the re
 lation of the theory of heat to mechanics should be approached by
 the student in his earliest inquiries with the same careful thought
 with which he will surely regard it when his knowledge and his
 powers have become extended and strengthened.” And accordingly
 the book contains articles in which are explained what is meant by
 the mechanical equivalent of heat, by the kinetic theory of gases,
 and one or two other matters.      What parts of a subject an author
 puts into his book is a matter depending so much on his own judg
 ment as to be rarely the proper subject of criticism; but we may
 perhaps be allowed to record a difference of opinion.      It seems to
 us, then, that the subject of energy of motion presents difficulties
 to the beginner so great that it is best to give him a fair chance of
 becoming familiar with it before introducing him to the far more
 difficult subject of Potential Energy, and accordingly that it is better
 not to deal with the latter subject in a purely elementary treatise
 on mechanics.
 Eclipses Past and Future, with General Hints for Observing the Heavens.
    By the Rev. S.    J. JoHNSON. Parker & Co.: Oxford and London.
    1874.
    Mr. Johnson, in the work before us, has added considerably to
 our prospective knowledge of eclipses, transits, and allied pheno
 mena, and has also given us some interesting information relative
 to ancient eclipses, mentioning that the first of which we have a
 clear record happened at Nineveh in the year 763 B.C. Noticing in
 the order of their sequence the most celebrated eclipses of antiquity,
 and bringing up the catalogue of observed eclipses to the present
 date, the author gives us two interesting chapters (W. and VI.):—the
 first on the prospects of the amateur, showing the paucity of large
eclipses in England during the next thirty years; and the second,
 “Curiosities in Lunar Eclipses,” as bright and black total eclipses,
and those in which both luminaries were above the horizon at the
 time of the moon being eclipsed, an obvious effect of refraction.
The first part of the work, in which we have notices of eclipses
from the celebrated one of Ho and Hi 2127 B.C. October 13, to
A.D. 2381 July 21, contains a large amount of information on an       in
teresting branch of astronomy.

    From eclipses of the Sun and Moon, the author passes in the
 second part of his work to describe prospectively the most interes
ting planetary phenomena, the periods at which they may be most
advantageously looked for, with the peculiar features they are likely
to present.      Allusions are made to the Aurora, Zodiacal Light,
Meteors, &c.; and we notice a remarkable suggestion embodied in a
communication to the ‘Spectator’ by the Rev. E. L. Garbett, that
the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed by a group of
the meteors following Tempel's telescopic comet of 1866. Mr.
Garbett gives six reasons for his suggestion as follows:—
    1. From the deduced period of node passage of the comet a
visit must have occurred in the autumn between B.c. 1898 and B.c.
 1897, which is generally assumed as the date of the catastrophe.
    2. The earth's passage of node was on July 31.
    3. A vertical fall of meteors as rain was only possible at sunrise,
the hour of the destruction of the cities.
    4. The latitude of the vertical fall agrees with that of the cities.
    5. Sodium, the chief element in the deposits formed in the loca
lity, is the chief element in these meteors as observed by Secchi.
    6. Magnesium, which also occurs in the locality, is the only other
ingredient in the meteors conspicuous to Secchi by means of the
spectroscope.
    “Suppose,” says the writer, “any event not due to this comet to
be recorded.      The chances against the account presenting these six
agreements with its elements and no disagreements, are three mil
lions to one that the history of Sodom is true, and this the phy
                                                                      -
 sical cause.”
    The work closes with a list of 152 double stars and nebulae, ar
ranged much in the same way as the portion on the Starry Heavens
  f Webb's ‘Celestial Objects for Common Telescopes, the angles
of position of the double stars, as seen near the meridian, being          in
dicated by dots, an addition which we have no doubt will be duly
appreciated by those readers who are just commencing their obser
vational career.

66            Royal Society :—Mr. W. Crookes on the
weighing substances which were of a higher temperature than the
surrounding air and the weights.      There appeared to be a diminu
tion of the force of gravitation; and experiments were instituted
to render the action more sensible, and to eliminate sources of error.
   In an historical résumé of the state of our knowledge on the sub
ject of attraction or repulsion by heat, it is shown that in 1792
the Rev. A. Bennet recorded the fact that a light substance de
licately suspended in air was attracted by warm bodies: this he
ascribed to air-currents. When light was focused, by means of a
lens, on one end of a delicately suspended arm, either in air or in
an exhausted receiver, no motion could be perceived distinguish
able from the effects of heat.
   Laplace spoke of the repulsive force of heat. Libri attributed
the movement of a drop of liquid along a wire heated at one end,
to the repulsive force of heat; but Baden Powell did not succeed
in obtaining evidence of repulsion by heat from this experiment.
   Fresnel described an experiment by which concentrated solar
light and heat caused repulsion between one delicately suspended
and one fixed disk. The experiment was tried in air of different                                           .
densities; but contradictory results were obtained under apparently
similar circumstances at different times, and the experiments were
not proceeded with.
   Saigey described experiments which appeared to prove that a
marked attraction existed between bodies of different temperatures.
   Forbes, in a discussion and repetition of Trevelyan's experi
ment, came to the conclusion that there was a repulsive action ex
ercised in the transmission of heat from one body into another
which had a less power of conducting                         it.
   Baden Powell, repeating Fresnel's experiment, explained the
results otherwise than                 repulsion
                                           to         heat. By observingby

the descent   of
               the tints      Newton's Rings between glass plates when
heat was applied, Baden Powell showed that the interval between
the plates increased, and attributed this         repulsive action
                                                              to   a   heat.                     of
   Faye introduced the hypothesis              repulsive force

vacuum-tube instead of outside it as before; and the pith balls of
the former apparatus were replaced by brass balls.      By careful ma
nagement and turning the tube round, the author could place the
            brass pole either over, under, or at the side of the source
of heat. With this apparatus it was intended to ascertain more
about the behaviour of the balance during the progress of the ex
haustion, both below and above the point of no action, and also to
ascertain the pressure corresponding with this critical point.
   After describing many experiments with the ball in various po
sitions with respect to the incandescent spiral, and at different
pressures, the general result is expressed by the statement that
the tendency in each case was to bring the centre of gravity of the
brass ball as near as possible to the source of heat, when air of or
dinary density, or even highly rarefied air, surrounded the balance.

    “44. The pump was then worked until the gauge had risen to
within 5 millims. of the barometric height. On arranging the ball
above the spiral (and making contact with the battery), the attrac

 millims. The pump continuing to work, the gauge rose until it was
within 1 millim. of the barometer. The attraction of the hot spiral

In these, however, the tooth-like processes belong to the horny bill

into bony teeth is peculiar, so far as he knows, to Odontopterya.
He concluded, from the consideration of all its characters, “that
Odontopteryw   was a warm-blooded, feathered biped, with wings;

mountain-region.     After describing the characters presented by the
bottom-till in the northern part of Lewis, the author proceeded to
notice those of the lakes, some of which trend north-west and south
east, others north-east and south-west, whilst those of the mountain
district follow no particular direction. The lake-basins of the first
series he regarded as formed at the same time and by the same
agency as the roches moutonnées and other marks of glacial action;
they are true rock-basins or hollows between parallel banks formed
wholly of till, or of till and rock. The N.E. and S.W. lakes coin
cide in direction precisely with the strike of the gneiss; and the
author explained their origin by the deposition of till by the land-ice
in passing over the escarpments of the gneiss facing the north-west.
The lakes of the mountain district are regarded by the author as all
produced by glacial erosion. The author considered that the ice
which passed over the northern part of Lewis could only have come
from the mainland.        Referring to the glaciation of Raasay, he
showed that the ice-sheet which effected it must have had in the
Inner Sound a depth of at least 2700 feet; and taking this as ap
 proximately the thickness of the mer de glace which flowed into the
 Minch, which is only between 50 and 60 fathoms in depth, no part
 of this ice could have floated, and the mass must have pressed on
 over the sea-bottom just as if it had been a land surface.          Ice
 coming from Sutherland must have prevented the flow of the Ross
 shire ice through the Minch into the North Atlantic, and forced it
 over the low northern part of Lewis; and the height to which Lewis
 has been glaciated seems to show that the great ice-sheet continued
 or its
     progress until    reached the edge

    6. “On Fossil Corals from the Eocene Formation of the West
 Indies.” By Prof. P. Martin Duncan, M.B., F.R.S., W.P.G.S.
    The author had considered his labours amongst the fossil corals of
 the West-Indian Islands finished; but lately a very fine collection has
 been sent to him from the University of Upsala, and Mr. P. T. Cleve
 of Stockholm. The specimens were collected from limestone and coral
 conglomerates, which are covered by and rest upon volcanic débris
 and ejectamenta in the Island of St. Bartholomew.       The species re
presented there are numerous, and may be divided into :—Group 1,
species not hitherto known; 2, species with a Cretaceous facies;
3, species characteristic of the horizons of the Upper Eocene and
Oligocene deposits of Europe; 4, species found also in the Nummu
litic deposits of Europe and Sinde; 5, species belonging to the
recent coral fauna; 6, species belonging to genera which belong to
the Jurassic fauna, and to the Caribbean.
    The determination of the forms of the associated Mollusca and
Echinodermata permit the following deposits being placed on a
general geological horizon—the limestone and conglomerate of St.
Bartholomew, the dark shales beneath the Miocene of Jamaica,
the beds of San Fernando, Trinidad. These were probably contem
poraneous with the Java deposits, the Eocene of the Hala chain,
the great reefs of the Castel Gomberto district, the reefs of Ober
berg in Steiermark, and the Oligocene of Western Europe.
    The author has already described reef corals from the Lower Cre
taceous   (Upper Greensand) of Jamaica; and the size of the speci
mens proves that the reef was exposed to the surf of an open sea.
To these reefs succeeded on the same area others in the Eocene
time, in the Miocene and Pliocene; and there are modern reefs in
the neighbourhood.
                                                             -
    The affinities and identities of the fossil forms with those of con
temporaneous reefs in Asia and Europe, and the limitation of the
species of the existing Caribbean coral fauna, point out the correct
ness of the views put forth by S. P. Woodward, Carrick Moore, and
the author, concerning the upheaval of the Isthmus of Panama after
the termination of the Miocene period.

By R. Etheridge, Esq., Jun., F.G.S.
    The author described this deposit, which is worked at the village
of Lal-Lal, south of Mount Bunniyong. A boring towards the centre
of the deposit showed about 73 feet of sand, clay, and gravel, 3 feet
of fireclay, and 115 feet of lignite. The lignite is an earthy bitu
minous coal, composed of branches, roots, &c. of coniferous trees.
In the mass there are a few thin seams of jet and clay-beds, accom
panied by two kinds of resin. The lignite is very poor in carbon.
It is almost entirely composed of remains of coniferous plants not
now existing in Victoria; and the author considered that it is nearly
of the same age as the Lignite deposit of Morrison's Diggings, which
has been regarded as Miocene.

ON    THE FLOW   OF   SALINE SOLUTIONS THROUGH CAPILLARY TU BES.
                        BY THEoDoRE HüBENER.
THEnotvelocity of the flow of solutions in capillary tubes appears
        to depend solely on their weight and capillary adhesion.
Poiseuille has demonstrated that the velocity of flow of a mixture of
water and alcohol decreases in proportion as the specific gravity
increases by the addition of larger and larger quantities of water,
to a minimum which corresponds exactly to the maximum of con
traction of the mixture.    Girard found that the velocity of flow of
chloride of sodium is less than than that of a solution of chloride
of potassium of the same density.
    M. Hübener thought that, beside the adhesion and the weight of
the liquid, an important factor for the velocity of flow of a solution
must be the intermolecular friction resulting from its greater or
less cohesion; and to test this he has compared the velocities of a
 number of solutions of very different chemical compositions brought
 to the same density.
    The liquid was introduced into a vertical rectilinear glass tube of
 50 centims. length and 1.78 centim. diameter, having a capillary
 continuation of about 40 centims. length. The large tube presented
 two marks; and with a seconds-watch the time was accurately
 measured which was required for the level of the liquid to fall from
 one of these marks to the other.
    Operating in this way upon solutions of chloride, bromide, and
 iodide of potassium, of chloride of sodium and of ammonium, with
 a density of 1:059 and at a fixed temperature, the author ascertained
 that the velocity of flow of saline solutions is as much lower as the
 atomic weight of the salt dissolved is less.  For the different binary
bodies above indicated, it is the metal which has the greatest influence
upon the velocity of flow, much more than the metalloid.          The va
riations presented by the velocity from one body to another are as
much more marked as the tube is more capillary and as the con
centration of the solution is greater.
    On comparing two solutions, of chloride of sodium and potassium,
at 1:1058 density, the author arrived at the remarkable result that
the times of flow of these two salts are found to be very sensibly
proportional to their equivalents.       From this experiment, and from
others analogous, extended also to the chlorides of the alkaline-earthy
metals barium, strontium, magnesium, M. Hübener thinks it may be
concluded generally with a high degree of probability, that the velo
cities of flow of these bodies in solution in water, to a certain degree of
concentration, are in the same ratio as their equivalents.
    The explanation of these facts      is,  according  to  M. Hübener,
to be found in the circumstance that the molecules of substances
which have  a   higher equivalent are larger, but,    on  the other hand,
 in less number, and consequently must give rise           to less friction
with the solvent       which they are held, thus communicating greater

        A NoTE on MELDE’s ExPERIMENT.                By w. Low ERY.
    In performing Melde's experiment upon the vibrations of
 strings, it is desirable to change the tension of the vibrating cord
 in a continuous manner. The ordinary method of attaching
 weights to the cord does not admit of this with precision; and with
 small weights the movement of the weight itself, on account of the
 rapid vibration of the string, prevents the formation of the ventral
 segments with regularity.        I have adopted the following method:—
 A glass tube graduated into millimetres is weighted so as to float
 in a vertical position: this is attached to the silk cord which
 hangs from the prong of the tuning-fork, and is placed in a glass
 vessel filled with water.         This latter vessel is provided with a
 siphon, by means of which the water can be drawn off at pleasure.
 It will be readily seen that, by drawing off the water from the
 larger vessel, the    displacement      produced by the graduated glass
tube is diminished,    and the tension of the string thereby is increased.
 By diminishing or     increasing the amount of water in the larger
 vessel the tension    can be diminished or increased to the desired
 extent.
    In order to make quantitative experiments, the tube is in the first
 place connected with the arm of a delicate hydrostatic balance.
The balance is adjusted when the level of the water in which the
tube floats is at the zero of the millimetre scale. In order to
 avoid errors in reading, it is best to use a cathetometer.             The
weights which are necessary to keep the index of the balance at
zero, when the level of the water in the outer vessel falls through
the millimetre divisions on the graduated tube, are noted. The
upward pressure of the water, and consequently the tension upon
the suspending cord, are then given in grams.
    In order to show the regularity of the method, the following
results of one experiment are given.           In the experiments, a glass
tube which, immersed at 110 millims. on the scale, weighed two
grams gave, when the level of the water in the outer vessel was
lowered, the following:—
       Immersed at 110 millims.                  Weight = 2 grams.

difference of 5 of a gram.          It is evident by increasing the size of

 ox constANT ELECTRIC CURRENTs.     BY M. HEINE, of HALLE.
  Kirchhoff" has developed a simple expression for the electric
potential, with a constant current, in every point P of a circular
homogeneous plate into which the current enters at given points

the strength  of the current entering at the point A, and if B, is
the conjugate  point to A, the electric potential of the circle in the

    Some years since, while investigating the action                 light upon           of
silver iodide,       Isucceeded        proving that the black substance

which    is  produced when silver iodide         exposed  is  light     presence  to           in

enable me        toascertain which.        When this black substance was
treated with nitric acid, normal yellow silver iodide was left behind,
and silver was found on solution.
I      have recently applied the same treatment             the bromine com  to
pound with similar results.              find that when silver bromide

black substance which remains contains           bromine,    and    resolved           as                by

nitric acid into normal silver bromide (left behind
film) and silver, which passes into solution.                 therefore either

a trace of residual air, an apparatus (fig. 2) is here shown in

side it as before.   A mass of magnesium, b, turned conical, is
suspended in a glass tube, c de, by a fine platinum wire of such
a length as to vibrate seconds.      The upper end of the platinum
wire is sealed into the glass at e, and passes through to the outside
for the purpose of electrical experiments. The platinum spiral

first sight to understand how it can produce attraction. The
law of exchanges, however, explains this perfectly. The pith
index and the whole of the surrounding bodies are incessantly
exchanging heat-rays; and under ordinary circumstances the
income and expenditure of heat are in equilibrium.          A piece of
ice brought near one end of the index cuts offthe influx of heat
to it from that side, and therefore allows an excess of heat to
fall upon it from the opposite side. Attraction by a cold body
is thus seen to be only repulsion by the radiation from the op
posite side of the room.
    Instruments of the kind just described are perhaps the best
for exhibiting large and striking movements of attraction or
repulsion. Two glass globes 4 inches in diameter, fitted up with
bars of pith 3} x , inch, are now before you.        One is full of air
at ordinary pressure, whilst the other is completely exhausted.
A touch with a finger on a part of the globe near one extremity
of the pith will drive the bar round over 90°, in the vacuum.
In air the attraction is not quite so strong.
       I
    If place a lighted candle an inch or two from the vacuous
globe, the pith bar commences to oscillate.        The swing gradu
ally increases in amplitude until one or two complete revolu
tions are made. The torsion of the suspending fibre here inter
feres, and the vibrations proceed in the opposite direction.      The
movement continues       as long  as the  candle   burns.    This con
tinued movement ceases if the source of radiation is removed
some distance off; the pith index then sets equatorially.         The
cause of the continued vibration when the            radiant  body   is
at a  particular  distance from the  pith  is easy  to understand on
the supposition that the movement is due to the direct impact
of waves on the suspended body.
    For more accurate experiments    I prefer making the apparatus
differently.    Fig. 4 represents the best form. a b is a glass
tube, to which is fused at right angles another, narrower tube, cd;
the vertical tube is slightly contracted at e so as to prevent the
solid stoper d, which just fits the bore of the tube, from falling
down. The lower end of the stopper de is drawn out to a point;
and to this is cemented a fine glass thread about 0.001 inch
diameter, or less, according to the torsion required.
    At the lower end of the glass thread an aluminium stirrup
and a concave glass mirror are cemented, the stirrup being so
arranged that it will hold a beam fg having masses of any de
sired material at the extremities.      At c in the horizontal tube
is a plate-glass window cemented on to the tube.          At b is also
a piece    of plate glass cemented on.        Exhaustion is effected
through   a branch tube h   projecting from the side of the upright
tube.    This is sealed by fusion to the spiral tube of the pump,

the warm fingers repel and incandescent platinum attracts.
    During the course of this lecture have spoken frequently of   I
repulsion by heat, and have used a spirit-lamp as a source of
heat to illustrate the facts described.       now wish to show that   I
these results are not confined to the heating rays of the spec
trum, but that any ray, from the ultra-red to the ultra-violet, will
produce repulsion in a vacuum.
                                          I
    In my own laboratory have used sunlight, and have experi
mented with a very pure spectrum, taking precautions to avoid
any overlapping or diffusion of one part of the spectrum with
another.     Here        I
                     can only use the electric light, and, in order
to get results visible at a distance, the spectrum cannot be very
long.
    The spectrum is formed with one disulphide-of-carbon prism,
and is projected on to the screen by a lens.        Immediately be
 hind the screen is an exhausted bulb, having a movable index
 with pith terminals suspended with a cocoon fibre (fig. 3). This
 is delicate enough to swing over 90° with a touch of the finger,
 and it will even move under the influence of a ray of moonlight.
I  first ofallarrange the spectrum                           so
                                         that the extreme red would
 fallon   one pith disk were     not for the screen.
                                              it       On removing
 the screen the index immediately retreats, making nearly half                                             a
 revolution.
 I   now replace the screen, and arrange the spectrum                  that                      so
the invisible ultra-violet rays are          position     fall

The iodine solution, interposed, cuts off apparently none of the
action. The alum plate cuts off a considerable amount, but by
no means all. On uniting the alum and the iodine solution the
whole of the spectrum is obliterated, and no action is produced,
whatever be the ray which would, were it not for this double
sifting, fall on the pith.
     Throughout      the course of these investigations, which have
occupied much of my spare time for some years,                 have endea                        I
voured to      keep  in  my   mind the  possible explanations    which may
be  given    of the actions    observed;   and I have     always   tried, by
selecting some circumstances and excluding others, to put each
hypothesis to the test of experiment.
   The most obvious explanation                                 is,
                                            that the movements are due
to  the currents formed           the residual gas which theoretically
                                            in
must    be  present              to
                          some extent even         those vacua which are   in
most    nearly   absolute.
    Another explanation                        is,
                                  that the movements are due            elec                               to
tricity developed          the moving body
                                  on                   the glass apparatus or     on
 by  the incident radiation.
    A   third explanation has been put forward                     Professor                         by
 Osborne Reynolds,              paper which was read before the Royal
                                      in   a
Society      on June 18th last. He considers the results                 due                              to   be
to  evaporation and condensation.
I      will discuss these explanations         order.                in
   First, the air-current theory. However strong may                      the                                  be

irrefragably         by
                    the phenomena themselves.                 most difficult            It   is
to  believe that the residual air           Sprengel vacuum, when the
                                                           in   a
gauge and barometer are level, can exert, when gently warmed
by    the finger,       upward force capable
                           an                        instantly overcoming   of

than when the mass acted on is heavy like brass; whereas in
practice the contrary obtains.    Pith ceases to move under the
influence of radiation at a rarefaction of about 7 to 12 millims.,
whilst brass only ceases to be affected when the gauge and ba
rometer are appreciably level.
   But even could the phenomena up to the neutral point be
explained by air-currents, these are manifestly powerless to act
after this critical point is passed.   If a current of air within 7
millims, of a vacuum cannot move a piece of pith, certainly the
residual air in a Sprengel vacuum should not have more power;
and a fortiori the residual gas in a perfect chemical                                                  vacuum
cannot possibly move a mass of platinum.
    It   is,
         however, abundantly demonstrated that,           cases after                  in        all

devised with the object of showing that the attractions and re
pulsions are not due to electricity.

   Here are two    experiments    which bear        this subject.             on                               A

exhausted, and the usual experiments are tried with hot and
cold bodies, both with and without        wet blotting-paper cover.

The inside of the tube                    a b     is lined with               a   cylinder of copper
gauze, having holes cut in the centre for the passage of the sup
porting thread dc and the index ray of light falling on the
mirror c, and holes at each end to admit of the plates and g
being experimented with.
                                                                                                        f
                                  A wire attached to the copper gauze
passes through a hole in the plate b, so as to give me electrical
access to the copper gauze lining.         Under the most diverse elec
trical  conditions,   whether insulated orconnected with “earth,”
this apparatus behaves normally when exhausted.
    A further reason why electricity is not the cause of the move
ments    I  have described                is,
                                 that they are not only produced                                                  by
heat, but also         by
                      ice and cold bodies.       Moreover       shall pre                     1

                                             of
ultra-red rays which produce dilatation            mercury        thermoof                      in a

                     electric current between     antimony   and bismuth
 couples, and cause         sensation

 skin, will produce the effect          repulsion    of  vacuum.              in   a                         It   is
 therefore       my mind abundantly proved that electricity, such

 as  we  at  present  know this force,       not    chief agentis     these

 terfere with and complicate the phenomena.
 I     will now discuss Professor Osborne Reynolds's theory, that
 the effects are the results                         of
                                        evaporation and condensation.

 In   my exhausted tubes            assumes the presence           aqueous                         of
 vapour, and then argues          follows:—“When the radiated heat

                                              temperature will rise, and

 92                        Mr. W. Crookes               on Attraction and
periments appear to show that evaporation from a surface is
attended with a force tending to drive the surface back, and
condensation with a force tending to draw the surface forward.”
   It does not appear that Professor Reynolds has tried more
than a few experiments; and he admits that they were in reality
undertaken to verify the explanation above quoted.          have                                          I
worked experimentally on this subject for some years; and the
last experiment recorded in my notebook is numbered 584.
From the abundant data at my disposal,       can find many facts           I
which will,       I
               think, convince you that this hypothesis has been
arrived at on insufficient evidence.

                         will show that the presence of moisture or
of a condensable vapour is not necessary. Besides pith, which from
 itstexture and lightness might       supposed              be

                                            so,   would certainly

driven backwards than when pith had                moved; but the          to   be
contrary obtains            in   all
                        cases. The rule seems       be, the greater                  to
the density the higher the neutral point.

seek to proceed in the direction in which the force acts that pro
duces the motion, therefore in that of the meridian.     Now, ac
cording to the existing theory, two forces are constantly acting
both upon trade-winds and the meridional currents of the ocean:
-of     which the one, the impelling force, springs from the differ
ence of temperature of the equatorial and polar regions, and
hence operates only in the meridian-direction; while the other,
the rotating force of the earth, acts in consequence of the inertia
of the particles, and always in the direction of the parallel circle,
therefore at right angles to the motive force.                          then, both    If,
forces remained         constantly    unaltered,  the direction        the current        of
would also remain invariably the same; that                     the angle whichis,
the current forms with the meridian would neither increase nor
diminish.        In our case the action           the forceof     the meridionalin
direction must             be
                          assumed               to   be
                                             constantly     uniform;      while the
lagging behind,            or
                            the advance, called forth                           by
                                                                   the transition
into other latitudes           more considerable
                                is                        the higher than
                                                                     in          the             in
lower     latitudes,    because the     parallel  circles diminish       only  very
gradually       in the latter, but rapidly                  in
                                                      the former.       From this
it follows that the deviation from the meridional direction would
necessarily          be

namely, the Gulf-stream and the Kurosiwo flow north-east; and
the cold currents of the seas of Japan and Greenland go south
west, just as the earth’s rotation demands.     But since the cur
rents of the southern hemisphere, notwithstanding the ample
space open to them, are quite unaffected by the rotation of the
earth, we cannot but see that the direction of the currents in the
northern hemisphere must be referred to other causes. The
bend which the Gulf-stream makes again to the north by Cape
Hatteras, after a considerable inclination to the east, seems also
to speak in favour of our view.

   We conclude the consideration of the influence of the earth's
rotation on air- and sea-currents with the conviction that the
existing explanations are altogether insufficient for the currents
which flow parallel to the equator, because the rotation of the
earth can only inconsiderably alter the direction of an already
existing current, whether in air or sea, but can never indepen
                      ;

106              Baron N. Schilling                  on the Constant Currents
attraction       of the moon acts at the angle LBb with the earth's
gravitation.         We thus see that the weight of the water and air
becomes greater the further we remove from the point where
the moon or the sun is in the zenith.     In the points C and D,
which are as distant as the centre of the earth, k=0; therefore
the full attraction of the earth corresponds to the weight of the
water and air in these points. In the other hemisphere, turned
away from the moon, k is a negative quantity, because the centre
of the earth is more powerfully attracted than any point of the
surface of this hemisphere.         But k acts in the same direction
with gravitation, and must therefore be added to it in order to
determine the weight of a particle in this hemisphere.                   The
point E, most remote from the moon, is the most feebly attracted;
hence in E also the quantity to be added to gravitation is the
least, and the weight of a particle in E lighter than in any of the
other points of the hemisphere which is turned away from the
moon.      In the point F, for example, the weight of a particle
might be expressed by g-ka. cos OFL; and it would constantly
diminish the more we approached the point E, which has the
                                                                     k, its

moon must the water more or less swell, and thereupon, in an
undulatory motion, push the swelling further, in accordance with
the law of the wave-theory,   and in this manner carry the tide
into high latitudes, whither, according to the theory of the
moon’s attraction, it should not come.
   We are confirmed in this view of the tides by the circumstance
that the tide-wave in the atmosphere has not yet been observed,
although according to the theory it must show itself there more
considerable than in the sea.   The question of the atmospheric
tide-wave has   occupied  many  scientific men.   Laplace, after a
long series of observations, expressed a decided opinion that
there is no atmospheric tide. More recently Bouvard, Eisenlohr,
and Sabine have thought they could perceive a very small tide,
expressing itself only in hundredth parts of a line on the baro
meter-scale.

ratus may be conveniently made by means of ball-and-socket

in the blowpipe-flame, and the socket by cutting in half a thick
bulb blown on a glass tube. The ball is then ground into the
socket by means of emery and solution of soda, and afterwards
 polished with rouge and soda solution.                When slightly greased

XVII.       On Wind-pressure in the Human Lungs during Perform
         ance on Wind Instruments.          By Dr. W. H. Stonet.
        HE  object of these experiments was originally physiological.
          It had been stated by many writers that the forced expi
 ration employed in playing tended to produce emphysema of
 the lungs; but the real amount of such pressure had never
 been measured.
     The facts elicited had also an interest of a purely physical
 character, which was the principal cause of their being brought
 before this Society, although, the writer of the paper remarked,
 it was on the border-ground between two great subjects of study
 that new phenomena were often to be looked for.
     The experiments were two in number. The first aimed simply
 at measuring, by means of a water-gauge, the extreme pressure
 which could be supported by the muscles of the lips, both in
                       ºi.
trained musicians and in persons unaccustomed to the con
 tinuous exercise of these organs.           The difference between dif
ferent individuals was           very   great,    some untrained persons
having naturally                        muscular power.        About 6 feet
 of water was the ordinary maximum when a small tube was
    * Since the above was written Dr. Sprengel has pointed out that Mr.
 Hartley (Proc. Roy. Soc. vol. xx. p. 14.1) has described as a “Sprengel
joint” a connexion between two glass tubes made by grinding a conical
tube into a conical cup and placing mercury or water in the cup. The
 difference between this and the one above mentioned is obvious : the
 former is quite rigid, the latter perfectly flexible.                  -

inserted between the lips. When the      lips were supported by a
cupped mouthpiece, such as is used       for brass instruments, a
greater height of the column could       be obtained. The great
majority of untrained persons could       not support more than
three or four feet of water.   It was to be noticed that the lip
muscles invariably gave way long before the expiratory power
of the thoracic muscles was exhausted.        By pinching the lips
round the orifice of the tube with the   hand,  and thus prevent
ing their yielding, a far higher column of water could be
supported.
   The second experiment consisted in introducing a small bent
glass tube into the angle of the mouth, connected with a flexible
tube passing over the shoulder. It was found that most instru

XVIII.     On the Fall in Pitch of Strained Wires through which a
       Galvanic Current is passing.     By Dr. W. H. Stone *.
Th;        object of this paper was to apply the vibrations of sound
         to the measurement of electrical currents, and to distin
guish what was due to heating-effects from those caused by
alteration of elasticity.
    Strings of brass and steel, such as are used for pianofortes
(No. 16 gauge), were stretched, by means of wrest-pins, across
a resonant box, over bridges surmounted by brass bearings, and
tuned to unison. On passing a current from two or more
Grove's batteries through them, a very marked fall in pitch was
obtained. The vibrating string being 24 inches long, and tuned
to two-foot C, the tone sank above a fourth in steel and a major
third in brass.
    This result being a compound of actual lengthening by heat
 and  of other causes, it was, in a second experiment,   endeavoured
to eliminate the former element         by straining similar strings
between the same bridges by means of a weight.              This was
attached to the arm of a bent lever, to the short end of which
the string was made fast.         By shifting the position of a four
pound weight along the arm, very accurate unison, or definite
periodicity of beats could be obtained. When the current from
the battery was passed through this string, free to expand by
the falling of the weight, and therefore at a constant tension, a
fall of pitch was still noticed.      There was also a very marked
loss of tone, which, on approaching a red heat, amounted to
total extinction of sound.
    A  third experiment exhibited the changes of electrical resis
tance in a wire subjected to variations of strain.      The wire was
accurately balanced against another resistance in a Wheatstone's
bridge, and the spot of light from a mirror-galvanometer join
ing the two circuits thrown on the screen. On suddenly            in
 creasing the tension and raising the musical pitch of the string,
the galvanometer was visibly deflected.       This was not an effect
of heat (since the balance had been brought about during the
passage of the current), and must be due to altered molecular
state caused by the strain.
    It was incidentally noticed that, when beats were produced
 by two strings on the same sonometer, they continued to be
sensible to the touch by laying the hand on the instrument long
after, from diminution of amplitude in the vibration, or from
slowness in the beats themselves, they had ceased to be audible.
 This afforded a good demonstration of the continuity of sensa
tion in touch and hearing.

     GENTLEMEN,
   N the ‘ Proceedings of the Royal Society,' No. 152, p. 308,
      there is an account by Mr. Grubb of a very satisfactory
method of correcting the curvature of the spectrum-lines, a de

fect inherent in    spectroscopes     present made.        at
tortion   isdue,    ofcourse,        the fact that the rays from different
                                         to
parts  of the slit fall         on
                              the prism under different vertical angles;
and Mr. Grubb proposes                   to
                                      correct                         by
                                                       making the slit itself

being then simply employed              rendering straight the slit-images
                                                 in

I     think     just worth while
               it                            mention, to     corroboration in                              of
Mr. Grubb's      paper,    that the same        sufficiently  obvious remedy
occurred       to
               me some time         ago,  and that since November last                                 I
have had curved slits           use for

                                                      a
fectly satisfactory results.         These are screwed                 front of)  on    (in
the   ordinary  slit-plates,    which latter are      opened   wide;     and the
curved plates are thus readily replaced                others         by
                                                                   loosening           by                  a
couple    of milled-head screws.           Any spectroscope may               this                in
way have the additional slit-plates fitted                     with   very  little

   None of the above methods, however, came to have ex
tended, or indeed any, practical application. They appear to
have been   attempted doubtingly and without  confidence; and
although the trials are generally reported to have been suc
cessful, yet the methods were rejected as impracticable,  and
came to be regarded as merely   of scientific interest”.
     Only recently, after a torpid existence of almost                                            twenty
years, has duplex telegraphy been revived, and come to be the
leading topic in telegraphy,  securing after such a lapse of
time the amount of public interest it rightly deserves.
   To Mr. Stearns, an American telegraph-engineer, is due
the honour of having appreciated the real value of duplex tele
graphy, and of having (by giving the system, modified by im
provements of his own, an extended application on the lines of
the United States) proved                          its
                             thorough practicability.

120                 Mr. L. Schwendler                       on the General Theory
   The first of these, we find, is that the invention was in ad
vance of the requirements     of the age. Telegraph-lines had
already been constructed which were quite capable of carrying
the given traffic and even more.     Further, any increase in traffic
could be  easily met  by an increase in the number of wires on the
existing telegraph-posts, instead of by resorting to a system which
had a complex appearance, and after        might not answer.          all
    However, although the above considerations explain the course
                                                                                  up
of  events       certain limited instances, and
                   in                                          certain time,     to          a

 have been generally adopted until recently               preference              in                    to   in
 troducing duplex telegraphy—for instance, the reconstruction
and multiplying          long overland lines, and especially the laying
                              of
of   asecond submarine cable when the traffic became too great
for one.

clectrical condition of the lines, as well as the perfection of the
instruments and the professional education of the staff, would
have fully admitted of the successful introduction of duplex
telegraphy at least ten, if not twenty, years ago.
   It is true indeed that the suggestion of using condensers for
balancing the charge and discharge of a line has only been made
very lately, being one of Stearns's happy ideas; but this should
have been no reason against introducing the system on short
and overworked lines, where the charge and discharge is imper
ceptible.   If only one telegraph-administration had shown the
perfect practicability of the system on a short line, the cloud
of prejudice would have been dissipated, and suggestions for
overcoming the charge and discharge on long overland lines
and submarine cables would have been readily enough given,
and thereby large capitals saved.
  To sum up, therefore, we have the following causes which
acted persistently against the introduction of duplex telegraphy.
   First, the invention was in advance of the age.
                                                                         is,
  Secondly, the telegraph profession, young as it      far more         is
conservative than    good for the advance
                      is                      telegraphy; and,   of
on the whole, telegraph-administrations and staffs have                                    by   no
means that professional education which    required    conduct
                                                            is                   to
practical experiments with    clear understanding,
                                     a              and thence
deduce rational conclusions. Thus prejudice was created, which
was increased from year       year
                                to     authors by                of
                                                    school literature
writing most discouragingly              on
                                   the subject.
  Thirdly, unfortunately during                all
                                       that time     physicist found
                                                                  no

                      to                                         view                    a
to ascertain quantitatively  what can       expected   be them,   and       of
how they actually compare, with respect          safety, with single

working.
    Fourthly, duplex working itself could not progress, because
it  was neither tried nor investigated, and hence              sugges            no
tions for   overcoming    the  difficulty              of
                                               charge and discharge
were called for.

progress in one of the youngest branches of applied science may
be retarded for a considerable period by nothing but prejudice
of the profession themselves, for whom the progress should be
the first essential; and administrations will see how much the
advance of telegraphy will always depend on their recognizing
and encouraging by experiment inventions that are theoretically
sound and tend in the right direction.

   Before entering on the solution of the problem for any par

state definitely the nature           the general question before us.

duplex working, independent of the particular method adopted,
namely:-
   1. The receiving-instrument of each station should not be affected
by   its
       own sending.
     2.The duplew signals and single signals must               equal                         be   of
strength.
 If       these two conditions, which are necessary    and sufficient,
could     always
           be       fulfilled,  duplex  telegraphy  would      entirely                       be

not interfere with the receiving (the more important condition

   Theoretically,        course, every duplex method hitherto sug
gested fulfils these two conditions; otherwise the method would
have      to    be
             rejected      priori, and could not find any place

 p, P, and Q being functions of the resistances and electromo
 tive forces of the system, which are known so soon as the parti
 cular duplex method has been selected.
    The general problem which is to be solved for duplex tele
 graphy may now be clearly stated as follows:–
    D and S are two known functions which must be rigidly equal
 to zero when no variation in the system occurs, and which for any
 given variation in the system must be as small as possible, and ap
 proacimate rapidly towards zero as the variation in the system
 becomes smaller and smaller.
     Thus the solution of the problem for any given duplex method
  will always be a question of the minima and maxima calculus.
     Having then ascertained the best arrangement for each duplex
  method, the methods can be compared inter se; and that method
  will be best, and should be selected for use, which for any given
  variation in the system gives the least absolute magnitude to the
 functions D and S.
     If we suppose, however, that the particular duplex method is
  not  given,  the problem to be solved becomes more general, but
  would still be entirely within the limits of the variation cal
  culus, furnishing, no doubt, a very interesting and important
 application of that most powerful mathematical instrument.
 The general solution would at once determine the best method
 possible, after which special solutions would give the best ar
 rangement for that best method.

   The resistances which are similarly situated in both the sta
tions will be designated by the same letters; and to indicate the
station to which they belong, each letter will have one accent in
station I. and two accents in station II.
   Further, if a relation between the resistances of one station
has to hold good between those of the other station also, the let
ters will be used without any accents.
   The great practical advantage of the bridge method, it will be
clear at once, is that any kind of receiving-instrument which has
been used for single working may also be employed for duplex
telegraphy. This fact must always be of great consideration for
any administration that contemplates the general introduction
of duplex telegraphy.
                General expressions for the two functions D and S.
   To obtain the functions D and S, we have first to develop the
general expressions for the forces p, P, and Q, say for station I.
   By p' we understand the force which acts on the receiving
instrument 9' of station I. when that station is sending alone
(station        II.      at rest).

the force by which balance in that station is disturbed.
   Consequently the rigid fulfilment of the first condition (D=0)
will entail the rigid fulfilment of the second condition (S=0);
and this, it will be clear, is only due to the fact that the complex
resistance p is independent of b, and that the key during signal
ling does not alter p; whence it follows that the perfection of
the key in this respect is of the greatest importance. There are,
however, no practical difficulties connected with the construction
of a key which fulfils condition (WII.) perfectly.

nevertheless bring the regularity of duplex working as near as
possible to that of single working by making D and S as small

S towards zero in both stations is obtained if we make the complex
resistances p' and p" maxima.

                                      (a+f)=(g-H d),

XXII.     Modification of the usual Trombone Apparatus for showing
    the Interference of Sound-bearing Waves.      By W. F. BARRETT,
    F.R.S.E. &c., Professor of Physics in the Royal College of
    Science, Dublin +.
A SIMPLE           apparatus for showing the interference of sound
         bearing waves may be made by employing a circular
arrangement of tubes, one sliding within the other. One tube,
A, to which the mouthpiece M is fixed, is three fourths of a
circle; the other tube, B, to which the nozzle N is attached, is
half a circle, and of such diameter that it slides freely over the
tube   A.
    When the nozzle is diame
trically opposite the mouth
piece, the path of the sound
waves is of equal length, and
hence the sound from any
convenient source placed near
to or within the mouthpiece
is distinctly heard. By turn
ingthenozzletowards N',in the
direction shown by the dotted
lines, one limb of the tube
is lengthened whilst the other
 is correspondingly shortened;
 the path of the waves being
 now unequal, a point is soon
 reached where the sound is nearly obliterated.
     Employing a suitable source of sound, and a sensitive flame
 or a resonant jar as a phonoscope, an audience can perceive at
 once the gradual destruction of the sonorous pulses; and more
 over the relative lengths of the two branches of the tube clearly
 indicate the principle of interference thus illustrated.
     One instrument I made was 2 feet in diameter, of l-inch
  square zinc tubing; another and better instrument (skilfully
  made by Mr. R. H. Ridout) was of brass tubing, 1 foot in
  diameter, the one limb being -inch, the other 3-inch tube.
  About 18 inches in diameter would probably be the best and
  most convenient size. In making the experiment, care should be
  taken to avoid (2) the conduction of sound to the ear by the
  metal substance of the instrument; (8) the direct transmis
  sion of sound through the surrounding air. The latter can be
  overcome by attaching a sufficiently long gutta-percha tube to M,

thus removing the mouthpiece to a distance from the ear. The
former can be obviated to some extent by having an inelastic
mouthpiece or similar covering to the end of the tube.       But
Mr. Woodward's device of putting a source of sound, such as a
reed, entirely within the tube, and a trumpet mouthpiece at N,
is undoubtedly the best and most suitable class method of making
the experiment.
  P.S.—With an ordinary pitch-pipe inserted at N, I have to-day
(July 25) repeated the experiment to the class of science teachers
now at South Kensington.     A continuous blast of air was driven
through the pipe from an acoustic bellows; and the loud note
heard at first was utterly eatinguished by altering the relative
lengths of the tubes.     By pushing the tube still further round
the note  again came  out;   thus the sound of the pitch-pipe could
be turned on and off at  pleasure.     Extinction is not confined to a
mere line in adjusting the pipe, but spreads over a short and
definite range.    In this case it is probably, as Professor Goodeve
suggests, the interference of two resonant columns of air, rather
than the coalescence of two progressive waves in opposite phases.

THIS work
  “On the      Figures of Equilibrium of a Liquid Mass without
Weight,” which the distinguished physicist of Ghent has published
in the “Memoirs of the Belgian Academy of Sciences' during the
years 1843 to 1868. The substance of these papers having appeared
from time to time in the pages of the ‘Philosophical Magazine, in
the form of comparatively full abstracts of the original memoirs, it
is not needful to say much here by way of introducing or recom
mending the work to our readers. It should be observed, however,
that this book is not merely a republication, offering simply the
convenience of presenting in a collected form results which were
previously accessible only in a number of separate papers published
at intervals during a period of twenty-five years; thanks to the
careful revision which the whole has received, and to numerous ad
ditions (some of them of considerable extent, relating chiefly to the
work of other investigators in the same field of research), the work
before us possesses much of the continuity and completeness of a
systematic treatise.
   The chief scientific interest of the phenomena which Professor

 in continuation of the original plan, and which occupies the first
 place in the present volume.          Facing page 1 we have an excellent
 map of the area, carefully drawn in outline, accompanied by a full
 descriptive catalogue of 99 craters and other objects situated upon
 the area. The description is completed by a comparison of four pho

 must be highly suggestive to every earnest student.

of geological time, such as:—calculations intended to estimate
the age of deltas, founded on the annual rate of accumulation
of sediments; the astronomical method followed by Mr. Croll, in
connexion with the recurrence of glacial epochs; the relative
thicknesses of different formations; and the relation of strong
unconformity between two sets of formations in connexion with
marked disappearance of old genera and species, and the appear
ance of newer forms.     Having shown that none of these methods
give any clear help in the absolute measurement of time in years
or cycles of years, even when founded on well-established facts, he
proceeds to attempt to estimate the comparative value of long por

the deposition of the Old Red Sandstone may have taken, when
compared with the time occupied in the deposition of certain
members of the Mesozoic formations.               Through a series of argu
ments, lithological, stratigraphical, and palaeontological, the conclu
sion is arrived at, that the whole of the Liassic and Oolitic series
present the various phases of one facies of marine life, and, in this
respect, are comparable to the changes in the fossil contents of the
various subformations of the Cambrian and Lingula-flag series,
of which the Tremadoe Slates form an upper member.                          In
like manner the Lias and Oolites may be compared with the
Lower Devonian strata; and therefore a lower portion of the Old
Red Sandstone may have taken as long for              deposition    its

   Following out this train           argument through the Neocomian
                                           of

   In  the same manner the next term              the Continental era, the

comes the Permian series, comparable                                  its

locally began with the Eocene period and lasts            the present day,  to
has been of much shorter duration.
   The author then pointed out that during the older continental
era there flourished two typical floras—one extending from the

time, we have also two distinct typical floras—the first          Jurassic,            of
and the second        much more modern type, beginning with the

    The experiments               of   which the explanation                          will      be   given were   as
follows:—
   A        light stem
                    glass, with pith-balls
                          of                       ends, was suspended on       its
 by     a   silk thread glass flask,
                             ina         that the balls were nearly
                                                             so                                                   at
the same level. Some water was then put             the flask and boiled        in
until all the air was driven out     the flask, which was then corked
                                                        of
and allowed       cool. When cold there was
                        to                            partial vacuum              a                               in
it, the gauge showing from                    inch pressure.

  It   was now found that when the flame              lamp was brought           of   a
near     the flask, the pith-ball which was nearest the flame was
            to
driven away, and that with      piece     ice the pith was attracted.

   This experiment was repeated under a variety of circumstances,
in different flasks and      different balances, the stem being some
times of glass and sometimes of platinum; the results, however,
were the same in       all
                      cases, except such variations       am about                    as
                                                                                       I                  to
describe.
   The pith-balls were more sensitive                     to
                                      the heat and cold when the
flask was cold and the tension within    low; but the effect wasit
perceptible until the gauge showed about    inch, and even after         an
that the ice would attract the ball.
   The reason why the repulsion from heat was not apparent                                                at
greater tensions, was clearly due                  to
                                         the convection-currents which
the heat generated within the flask.         When there was enough
vapour, these currents carried the pith with them; they were,                                             in
fact, then sufficient      to

them; i.e. the currents carried them towards the lamp and from
the ice; but, by placing the lamp or ice very low, the reverse effects
could be obtained, which goes to prove that they were the effects
of the currents of air.
   These experiments appear to show that evaporation from a sur
face is attended with a force tending to drive the surface back, and
condensation with a force tending to draw the surface forward.
These effects admit of explanation, although not quite as simply
as may at first sight appear.
   It seems easy to conceive that when vapour is driven off from a
body there must be a certain reaction or recoil on the part of the
body; Hero's engine acts on this principle. If a sheet of damp
paper be held before the fire, from that side which is opposite to
the fire a stream of vapour will be drawn off towards the fire with
a perceptible velocity; and therefore we can readily conceive that
there must be a corresponding reaction, and that the paper will be
forced back with a force equal to that which urges the vapour for
wards.    And, in a similar way, whenever condensation goes on at
a surface it must diminish the pressure at the surface, and thus
draw the surface forwards.
     Itis not, however, wholly, or even chiefly, such visible motions as
these that afford an explanation of the phenomena just described.
If  the only forces were those which result from the perceptible
motion, they would be insensible, except when the heat on the
surface was sufficiently intense to drive the vapour off with con
siderable velocity.     This, indeed, might be the case if vapour had
no particles and was, what it appears to be, a homogeneous elastic

   Thus we have an expression for the force in terms of the quan
tity of water evaporated and the ratio of the pressure to the den
sity of the vapour; and if the heat necessary to evaporate the
liquid (the latent heat) is known, we can find the force which
would result from a given expenditure of heat.
   Applying these results to steam, we find that, at a temperature
of 60°, the evaporation of 1         water from           oflb.

 be in opposition to the lifting of the ascending current, and it will
 depend on the shape and thickness of the ball whether it will rise
 or fall when in an ascending current of heated gas.
    The reason why Mr. Crookes did not obtain the same results
 with a less perfect vacuum was because he had then too large a
 proportion of air, or non-condensing gas, mixed with the vapour,
 which also was not in a state of saturation.          In his experiments
 the condensable    vapour  was that of    mercury,   or something which
 required a still higher temperature, and it was necessary that the
 vacuum should be very perfect for such vapour to be any thing
 like pure and in a saturated condition. As soon, however, as this
 state of perfection was reached, then the effects were more appa
 rent than in the corresponding case of water. This agrees well
with the explanation; for, as previously shown, the effect of mercury
would, for the same quantity of heat, be three times as great as
that of water; and, besides this, the perfect state of the vacuum
would allow the pith (or whatever the ball might be) to move much
more freely than when in the vapour of water at a considerable
tension.
    Of course this reasoning is not confined to mercury and water;
                                ".
any gas which is condensed or absorbed by the balls when cold
in greater quantities than when warm would give the same re
sults; and, as this property appears to belong to              gases,         all              it

    There was one fact connected with Mr. Crookes's experiments
which, independently        the previous considerations, led me
                                of                                      the                   to

    It must be remembered that e depends on the rate at which
cold particles will come up to the hot surface, which is very slow
when it depends only on the diffusion of the particles of the gas
inter se and the diffusion of the heat amongst them.
     It will be much increased by convection-currents; but these
will (as has been already explained), to a certain extent, produce
an opposite effect. It would also seem that this action cannot have
had much to do with Mr. Crookes's experiments, as one can hardly
conceive that much heat could be communicated to the gas or va
pour in such a perfect vacuum as that he obtained, unless, indeed,
the rate of diffusion varies inversely as the density of a gas”.                It
will be interesting, however, to see what light experiments will
throw on the question.

    The following communications were read:—
    1. “On the Skull of a Species of Halitherium from the Red Crag
 of Suffolk.”     By Prof. W. H. Flower, F.R.S., F.G.S.
     The specimen described, which is in the collection of the Rev. H.
 Canham, of Waldringfield, is from the so-called coprolite- or bone-bed
 at the base of the Red Crag, and presents the usual aspect of the
 mammalian       remains from that bed.             It is of especial interest as
 furnishing the first recorded evidence of the existence in Britain of
 animals belonging to the order Sirenia.                The fragment consists of
 the facial   part  of the    cranium,    separated,    probably before fossiliza
 tion, from the posterior part at the fronto-parietal suture, and in a
 line descending vertically therefrom. It was afterwards subjected
  to severe attrition, by which many of the projecting parts have been
  removed; but sufficient remains to enable its general relationship to
  known forms to be determined.               The whole of that portion of the
  maxillae in which the molar teeth were implanted is preserved.
     The author compared the fossil skull with those of the existing and
 extinct species of the order, and stated that, while it presents many
 characters common to the Manati and the Dugong, there are others
  by which it differs from both, the most striking being the more
  normal development of the nasal bones and the outer wall of the
  nasal fossae, and especially the dentition, in all of which it shows a
  more generalized condition.          The existence in it of maxillary teeth
 removes it still further from Rhytina.                In general character the
     * June 10.—Professor Maxwell has shown that the diffusion both of heat
  and of the gas varies inversely as the density; therefore, excepting for con
  vection-currents, the amount of heat communicated from a surface to a gas
                                                                         f
  would be independent of the density of the gas, and hence the force would be
  independent of the density; that is to say, this force would remain constant
  as the vacuum improved, while the convection-currents, and counteracting
  forces would gradually diminish.          It seems probable, therefore, that Mr.
  Crookes's results are, at least in part, due to this force.

 154                     Geological   Society:—
molars correspond with those of the genus Halitherium, in which
the author considered that this fossil found its nearest ally in H.
Schinzi, Kaup, from the Miocene of the Rhine Valley, a formation
in which several of the animals of the Red-Crag bone-bed are known
to occur. The differences, however, especially the larger size of the
cranium, in the Crag specimen, and the larger size of its teeth,
induce the author to regard it as a distinct species, which he pro
poses to name    Halitherium    Canhami.

mediate between Birds and Reptiles.” By Henry Woodward,             Esq.,
F.R.S., F.G.S.
  The author, after giving       a brief sketch of the Sauropsida, and
 referring especially to those points in which the Pterosaurians
 approach and differ from birds, spoke of the fossil birds and land
 reptiles which he considered to link together more closely the
                                                           -
 Sauropsida as a class.
    The most remarkable recent discoveries of fossil birds are:-
    I. Archaeopterya macrura (Owen), a Mesozoic type, which has a
 peculiar reptilian-like tail, composed of twenty free and apparently
 unanchylosed cylindrical vertebrae, each supporting a pair of quill
 feathers, the last fifteen vertebrae having no transverse processes,
 and tapering gradually to the end.
   II.   Ichthyornis dispar (Marsh), discovered by Prof. O. C. Marsh
 in 1872 in the Upper Cretaceous beds of Kansas, U. S. It possessed
 well-developed teeth in both jaws. The teeth are set in distinct
 sockets, and are all more or less inclined backwards.
   III.   Odontopteryx   toliapica (Owen), an Eocene bird from the
 London    Clay of Sheppey,   the skull of which alone has been dis
 covered, has very prominent denticulations of the alveolar margins
 of the jaws.
    The author then referred to the Dinosauria, some of which he
 considered to present points of structure tending towards the so
 called wingless birds.
    I. Compsognathus longipes (A. Wagner), from the Oolite of Solen
hofen, is about two feet in length, having a small head with toothed
jaws, supported on a long and slender neck.
    The iliac bones are prolonged in front of and behind the aceta
bulum; the pubes are long and slender. The bones of the fore
limbs are small, and were probably furnished with two clawed
digits.    The hind limb is very large, and disposed as in birds, the
femur being shorter than the tibia. The proximal division of the
tarsus is anchylosed with the tibia as in birds.
  II.   The huge carnivorous Megalosaurus, ranging from the Lias to
the Wealden, had strong but not massive hind limbs, and short
reduced fore limbs; it moved with free steps, chiefly if not solely
on  its hind limbs, which  is  true also    the vegetable-eating lizards
                                           of
of the Mesozoic rocks.
   The author next drew attention     to the Frilled Lizardof  Australia,
Chlamydosaurus Kingii (Gray), which has         itsfore limbs very much
smaller than the hind limbs, and has been observed not only        to   sit

Browning, Vogel, and others, a scale could be very easily connected
with this instrument, it can be recommended even without one for
systematic mass-observations of fixed-star spectra, in which the
prime object is to ascertain the typical constitution of the spectra.
As the essential differences between these types probably depends
only on the temperature and mass of those incandescent bodies, and
according to the observations of Secchi and others those types stand
in a certain relation to the distribution of the stars in space, such
systematically conducted mass-observations may in future become
of high importance for the progress of astrophysics.

 NotE on THE CAUSE of TIDEs.           BY E. J. CHAPMAN, PH.D.,     PRO
    FESSOR OF MIN ERALOGY AND GEOLOGY IN UNIVERSITY                 COL
    LEGE,    Toronto”.
    The phenomenon of the tides, stated broadly, consists of a pass
ing elevation, real or apparent, of oceanic waters at two opposite
 points on the surface of the globe. These elevations, which follow
the moon in its course, may become greatly intensified under local
conditions, as where opposing coast-lines impede the progress of
the tidal wave; but in the open ocean, it is well known, they are
 of but slight significance. According to the received theory, they
 are occasioned essentially by the unequal degree of attraction ex
erted by the moon on different parts of the earth—this attraction
 being, of course, modified by that of the sun.      It is thus assumed
that the waters, owing to their comparative mobility, are drawn
 towards the moon on one side of the globe, whilst the solid earth
 is drawn away from the waters on the other side—or, to use the
 common phraseology, is drawn towards the moon faster than the
 waters can follow.
    This view, although not without opponents, has been almost uni
 versally adopted in default of a more satisfactory explanation.
    The explanation of the cause of tides now suggested has at least
 this merit: it applies the same principle in elucidation of both tides
 —that nearest the moon, and that on the opposite side of the globe.
 It  is briefly this:—When two bodies pull against each other, there
 must necessarily be a contraction of particles towards the centre of
 each body along the line of pull or resistance.      In the pull, there
 fore, of the earth upon the moon, the earth (and of course the moon
 also) must suffer a passing contraction, the part along the line of
 pull, so to say, contracting more than the other parts. But this
 contraction is mechanical only, and is therefore a compression; and

as water is practically incompressible, the sea remains essentially
unaffected, whilst the earth shrinks beneath              and thus causes the        it,

meter is identical with that which would be exerted by a disk of
surface w placed at the aperture of our sphere, this disk having the
same temperature and emissive power as the sun. We can there
fore define the temperature of the sun by that which would have to
be attributed to this imaginary disk, possessing the emissive power
of lampblack, to produce upon the thermometer the same effect
which is actually produced by the sun.       Let ~ be the temperature,
thus  defined,  of the sun, 6 the stationary  temperature of the ther
mometer    receiving  the solar radiation through  the aperture w; the
quantity of heat emitted by the thermometer (which was Sa‘ at the
temperature t) has become Sa”; and putting that quantity of heat
equal to the sum of the quantities emitted by enclosure and by the
sun, we have at once
                                    Sa?=Saº-H war.
This is precisely the equation as written by M. Vicaire; but it was
established under reserves from which we must now free ourselves.
The dimensions of the thermometer are necessarily finite; and con
sequently the aperture through which the solar rays penetrate must
be widened to permit them to reach the whole of the bulb.: hence
comes a double complication.
   Let us now consider an admission-aperture       Q large enough for
an entire  hemisphere   of the bulb to receive the rays of the sun.                                If
the diameter of the bulb is sufficiently small in proportion to that of
the enclosure, every point of it will                 i.

ratus, it is sufficient to consider any one point whatever of the
bulb.   This point is submitted:—(1) to the radiation of              the                    all

 ON   A Peculi.AR PHENOMENON        IN THE PATH OF THE ELECTRIC
                sPARK.     BY PRof. To EPLER,    of GRAz.
   It is well known that the sparks from the discharge of       a Leyden
jar leave upon the surfaces of insulators    a trace, conditioned by cer
tain mechanical processes. The phenomenon is especially charac
teristic upon very delicately smoked glass surfaces to which sparks
spring between pointed conductors.
                                       -
                                          I have therein observed a re
gular microscopic structure.
   With a length of spark of 4 to 6 centims. the trace is generally
a bright streak 3 millims. wide, with a dark axis, produced by the
soot-particles being partly thrown to the sides, partly going to
the axis and there accumulating.         On this trace there is further
found a mostly very striking knot-like thickening just where the
lateral motion of the air has taken place with peculiar violence—a
place in the spark which had already struck me in my optical
observations (Pogg. Ann. vol. cxxxiv.).           Before this spot the
trace is altogether different from what it is beyond.            Towards
the positive conductor the spark-path is mostly branched off like
a tuft, towards the negative not so.           When the trace is ex
amined with a magnifying-power          of 15–20, there appears fre
quently on the positive side, never on the negative, in the dark
axis of the spark-path a very fine dark zigzag line resembling a mi
croscopic sine-curve, of 0.12–0.13 millim. wave-length.         From the
internal angles of this line issue laterally equidistant bright streaks
inclined to the axis of the spark in the direction of motion of the
positive electricity.   This microscopic structure (the regularity of
which is sometimes surprising) is often found also just as distinct
on the fine side branches which break forth from the positive part
of the spark-path.      I remark, further, that the soot-particles which
exhibit the structure are in some measure fixed to the glass surface;
for when the layer of soot is removed, say, with a fine hair pencil,
the dark streak in the axis of the spark remains adhering, though
of course the microscopic delicacy of the figure is destroyed.—

 XXVI.      On the Opacity of the Developed Photographic                            Image.
           By Captain ABNEy, R.E., F.R.A.S., F.C.S.*
IN by
   a series of pictures of the sun which have lately been taken
      photography, I found the opacity of the image by no
means varied directly as the time of exposure.    This caused me
to institute an inquiry into the relation of time of exposure and
intensity of light on the one hand, and the resulting opacity of
the image on the other.
   Primarily it was necessary to obtain some known gradation
of intensity of light, and then to measure the resulting opacities
caused by it on a photographic plate.     The gradation was ob
tained by causing a “star” to revolve rapidly round         centre.             its
The “star” was cut out with great exactness from white card
board and made with eight “points.” The curve       each point was        of
                                portion       equiangular spiral.
                                                                  of an

(and within that distance) pure white was obtained; whilst                                   at

background employed was         such    dead nature that sunlight

162              Captain Abney   on the      Opacity of the
    Plates were exposed on this object, the negatives being ob.
tained by the ordinary wet process, with simply iodized collo
dion, an 8-per-cent. nitrate-of-silver bath, and 4-per-cent, iron
developer.    The strength of the developer was afterwards varied;
but for the purposes of these experiments any variation was ex
cluded. Other negatives were obtained on dry plates made with
bromized collodion, a 16-per-cent. nitrate-of-silver bath, albu
men preservative (washed off, after application, as far as possible),
and alkaline development of one particular strength.           By alka
line development, as is well known, the bromide of silver is re
duced to metallic (or oxide of) silver in situ, no free nitrate of
silver being applied to the image during development.               The
opacity of the image obtained by this method is particularly
adapted for giving the necessary means of measuring the action
of any relative intensities of light acting on the silver for any time.
    In order to determine the relative opacities of the image, it
 was necessary to obtain some standard scale with which to mea
 sure.   The ordinary methods were tried without success, the
 image being “matt,” or only translucent.          Failure with them
 was inevitable.   After various experiments with coloured gela
 tine wedges,    Idetermined to use coloured glass wedges, and,
owing to the kindness of Mr. Browning, obtained three smoke
 coloured ones, corrected for refraction by crown glass. These
 in varying combinations have given me every thing that could be
desired.    The mounting I adopted for them is as follows.
                                 Fig.   1.
   A is  the wedge in position, B a space in the frame E, in which
any glass whose opacity is to be measured is placed, C a slit,
and D a fixed scale dividing the wedge into arbitrary divisions.
In actual use the whole of the frame was glazed with finely
ground glass, the slit being next to           it,
                                             and the wedge against
that again.     When measurements        opacity were taken, the
                                              of

values of each wedge; and the following Table will give an idea
of the degree of accuracy with which they were scaled. The
values are given in lengths of a half-inch scale, starting from the
calculated zero of the wedge which          I have called A.    Each of
the wedges were reduced to the same scale. The numbers refer to
different opacities which were measured.            A mean of six read
ings was taken in each case; and in no instance did any reading
vary more than 15 from the mean.

    From careful measurements it was found that the coefficient
of absorption for each unit of scale of wedge A for the light with
which the measurements were taken was 192.
    The photographs of the rotating star were taken of the full
 size of the original, only half of the disk being in some cases on
 one plate.        Strips were cut from these negatives, one edge
 always passing through the centre of the image of the star.        The
 relative transparencies of every 4" or A" were obtained by com
 parison with the wedges.          From these values the accompanying
 curves    (fig. 2) have been   formed,  the ordinate being the translu
 cency, whilst the abscissa is a measure of the intensity of the
 original reflected light.       Only four results are shown—two ob
 tained by wet, and two by dry plates.               About thirty were
 measured with almost identical results.
     Each strip was compared with the wedge by daylight, and
 also by an artificial monochromatic light. The results obtained
 by the one were nearly proportional to those obtained by the
 other; hence only one curve for each strip is given; and this
 was obtained by the latter light.         To guard against a false ratio
 of intensity of light due to the lens, negatives of the star were
 taken at different parts of the plate, and a mean taken.         As the
 lens used was non-distorting and of long focus, the edge and
 centre of the plate, when directed towards the sky or on a uni
 formly white surface, had sensibly the same illumination. Each
  portion of the strip cut from the negative whose opacity was
 to be compared was placed above the wedge, at B, and opposite
  the slit C.      These were clamped together and moved till light
  from behind, shining through the slit and through the image
 and the wedge respectively,        appeared  of the same brightness on

Moreover this operation may be repeated without the substances
suffering decomposition.         Cudbear, camwood, logwood, and tur
meric are selected as illustrations of the properties cited.
    Cudbear yields a brilliant orange fluorescent light, and is
visible in diffused daylight without the agency of a condensing
lens, which is necessary to show it in an alcoholic solution.
     Camwood       exhibits a powerful apple-green fluorescence,
although wholly destitute of this property in aqueous or alco
holic media.      The spectrum of the fluorescent light is continuous
from E     downwards,      interrupted by two narrow faint shadings
situated at 3; and 5 of Sorby's scale.
   With regard to logwood, unless the castor-oil solution be sa
turated, sunlight and a lens are requisite to bring out                   fluo                             its

circles of normal level are more than 45° and less than 60° of

   As at coasts the currents produced by the flow and ebb are
always observed to flow alternately in precisely opposite direc
tions, it is generally believed that the attraction of the moon and
sun cannot exert any influence on the constant currents. Mühry
says, “It is scarcely necessary to mention that the tidal motion,

  All that we have just said                     of
                                the moon holds good also for the
sun, with only this difference—that the motions   air and water                     of
produced            by   its
                attraction will   somewhat less than those pro

duced          by   the moon.
        We           that the attractions of the sun and moon
             see therefore
must each present two reciprocally counteracting developments
 offorce.  The one, which calls forth    east-to-west current and  an
corresponds    high water, we will henceforth name the flood
                         to
current force; the other, corresponding     the ebb and impelling       to
air and water from west        east, we will call the ebb-current
                                             to
 force.
        If
      these two forces are     equal intensity, they will balance
                                             of
 each other and produce       current; but  no soon   one      the            as              as   of

        Before we compare, however, with one another the quantities
 of these two forces, it will be necessary to illustrate further what
 has been said, representing the earth in the plane of the meridian.
   Let the circle PASE (fig. 5) be a terrestrial meridian, and

 the equator.    The dotted line p as e marks the form of the tidal
 ellipsoid. Through the rotation of the earth the moon appa
 rently moves from east to west; with it the ellipsoid p as e turns
 about the axis PS, and develops, as we have seen, at the equator
 two forces opposed one to the other. The one, the force effect
 ing the flood-current, directs                its        west, and
                                                                                      onto

  This circumstance seems at the first glance to contradict the
theory of the moon’s attraction; yet the origination of this
equatorial streamless zone is easily explained when we reflect
that the moon and sun are simultaneously in the vicinity of the
equator only for a very brief time twice yearly.     They usually
describe parallel circles which                       lie
                                     between the equator and the
tropics; the moon only goes sometimes slightly beyond the last
mentioned circles.    The ellipsoid arising from the united attrac
tions  ofthe moon and sun must always have          cusps between          its
the sun and moon; and hence these cusps must mostly describe
parallels between the equator and the tropics.

                                                 at
position    the ellipsoid, diminishes only slowly polewards, con
             of

                      in the     Air   and in the Sea.                                     173
sequently    will have already become slightly less at the parallel
circles a'a and ele, on which the maximum           of the flood-current
is found. The direction of this current will also not be purely
from west to east, but, as the arrows C and D show, alternate
between W.N.W. and W.S.W.               The opposite forces of the ebb
and flood-current must therefore on both sides of the parallel
circles a a' and e e' balance one another and form a zone of no
current.
    This appears to occur in the vicinity of the equator and of the
parallels of 30° latitude, the zones of calms and of the Sargasso
seas being found there.         In the latitudes of the parallel circles
a a' and eel must be the maximum of the east-to-west flood
current; this perfectly corresponds with the phenomena of the
 trade-winds and the equatorial currents. Polewards from the
streamless zone in the 30th parallel of latitude the rapidly dimi
 nishing force of the flood-current must be overpowered by that
 of the ebb-current, and a constant current from west to east be
 produced—which also actually happens; for between the 40th
 and 50th parallels of latitude, or thereabouts, both in the air
 and in the water, in      alloceans and       both hemispheres,
                                                  in                  cur              a
 rent directed eastwards     is  constantly  observed.
     Hence,                 us, the action
                                              of of
             it  seems to                      the attraction     the sun        of
 and moon explains the origination            the trade-winds and anti
 trades with their zones     of  calms, and the rotation-currents run
 ning parallel with the equator, with the Sargasso-seas and the
 streamless equatorial zone, considerably better than            hitherto        all
 existing hypotheses.
  If    our explanation     ofthe trade-winds and equatorial currents
is   correct, also the position and the breadth                   of
                                                       the current-zones

  the equator, the equatorial calm-zone must            non-existent, the

                                                         lower latitudes.

                                          know not.

then the ebb-current may predominate         the middle in the zone,             of
and that this circumstance accounts for the west-to-east current

174                 Baron N. Schilling on the Constant Currents
which flows in a narrow band along the equator and is named,
in Berghaus's ‘Chart of the World,’ the “equatorial counter
current.”      In the air this current does not exist. It would
therefore have to be ascertained if this equatorial counter-current
is a constant one or is only to be observed when the moon ap
proaches the tropics, and whether it is not wanting when the sun
and moon are simultaneously in the vicinity of the equator.
   The shifting of the trade-wind zones appears to be on the
whole more considerable than that of the sea-currents, and seems
in many cases to coincide with the change of the seasons of the
year—which, then, proves that the sun'by             heat also exercises      its
an   influence        theon

and part to the south-west. The north-west branch of this cur
rent unites in the Caribbean Sea with the northern equatorial,
and in this way impels almost the whole of the warmed water of
the surface of the Atlantic equatorial zone into the Gulf of
Mexico.     The great mass of this warmer and therefore lighter
water driven together by the equatorial current must, of course,
have the tendency to spread over the colder and heavier water,
and to flow off northward. Thus arises, then, a current of warm
water flowing out of the Gulf of Mexico, commonly known by
the name of the Gulf-stream.
   The motive force of the Gulf-stream must therefore be derived
partly from the pressure of the equatorial current, partly from
the tendency of the warm water to spread over the cold of the
higher latitudes, but partly also from the attraction of the cur
 rent, directed eastward, of the middle latitudes; but         these                       all
 causes  spring directly  from the attraction     the sun and moon,    of

phenomenon        is often produced at coasts by the action of the
wind; and those who have sought a sea-bath will remember
that with    a land-breeze the water is always colder than with a
sea-breeze.      The former removes the warmed superficial water
from the    coast,  by which the colder water beneath is brought to
light.    The   sea-breeze,   on the contrary, drives to the shore the
water which has been warmed on the surface of the sea.             What
the wind does in this case may well be brought about in a
higher degree by a permanent sea-current. In the depths,
even in the northern hemisphere, the polar currents appear to
be directed to the south-east.          This is demonstrated by the
many icebergs which, near Newfoundland, cut through the
Gulf-stream in that direction.         Dana's chart of the isothermal
lines of the sea-surface in the coldest month”, on which the dis
tribution of the corals is given, permits us also to draw a similar
conclusion. The polar limit of the coral zone, both in the
Atlantic and in the Pacific, is (probably on account of the water
being too cold) about 10° nearer the equator on the east side
than on the west side of the same ocean. It is interesting that,
according to this chart, the northern boundary of the corals is
 10 degrees more to the north in the Pacific than in the Atlantic
 Ocean.     The reason is probably to be sought in the fact that the
 Atlantic forms almost the only discharge, and the main supply,
 of the north polar basin.
    The alternating warm and colder strips of water in the Gulf
 stream, as well as in the Kurosiwo, seem to us to favour the
 idea that the force which carries away from the coast the entire
 current eastwards is not constantly of equal strength, but, so to
 speak, has a reflex action—which perfectly corresponds with our
 hypothesis, according to which, in the middle latitudes, the force
 of the ebb-current must on the whole take the upper hand, but,
 through the westward-directed force of the flood-current, may
 be subject to periodical interruptions.
     L. von Schrenk, Member of the Academy of Sciences of St.
 Petersburg, has recently, in a very interesting work (Strömungs
  Verhaltnisse im Ochotskischen und Japanischen          Meere), pointed
 out that in the     Yellow,   as well as in the  Japanese    and partially
 in the Ochotsk      Sea,   the  temperature  of the water is constantly
 lower at the east coasts of the continent and the islands than at
  the west coasts. We see in this a proof that in these inland seas
  there is the same tendency of the water to move eastwards, and
  that thereby the upper warmer water is accumulated at the east
  side of the sea or at the west coast of the land.                 In the
  White Sea also, and the Waranger Fjord in North Lapland,
  the temperature of the water is higher in the eastern parts than

in the western.     As we have already remarked, the warmer
water accumulated on a coast must flow away polewards, while
the cold water of the west side of the sea seeks to occupy the
space left free, and so flows towards the equator. It is also                                         in
teresting that Schrenk” has pointed out the existence of strips
of cold water in the warm current of the Japanese Sea. The
colder but very slightly less salt water may, under some circum
stances,  have exactly the same specific gravity as the warm,
somewhat salter water; and hence they may flow a long time
side by side without mingling.     These strips of colder water
have not yet been demonstrated in the Brazilian and Mozam
bique currents; but it is probable that they are present there
also, especially in the Brazilian current, which extends further
south. Indeed it is likely that these warm currents are sepa
rated from the coast by colder water.
   The Mozambique current, it seems to us, strikingly corre
sponds with the theory of the moon’s attraction.      It has                                          its

the hurricane always commences in very low latitudes, with a

circles, however, is so inconsiderable           that the air streaming to
the centre can only be deflected by the earth's rotation to an
angle of 2 or 3 degrees from the meridional direction. As

   Action of      a     Galvanic Coil on an external small Magnet.   185
mum velocity in the condensed half of the wave, is towards the
rarer end.    At the same time, according to the mathematical
result obtained in art. 8 of the article in the Philosophical Ma
gazine for June 1872, the impulsive action on the aether, whether
the primary vibratory motions be backwards or forwards, is
towards the denser end, out of which consequently the generated
streams flow.
   ll.  The next point is to determine the forms of the courses
of the magnetic    streams generated under the above-described
circumstances.     To do this it is necessary to begin with admit
ting the truth of the following general hydrodynamical theorem,
of which great use will be made in the subsequent investiga
tions.    [For proof of the theorem see art. 10 of the communi
cation  just cited.]   It is not possible that the motion of an un
limited fluid mass can be such as to transfer any portion of the
fluid on one side of an unlimited fixed plane to the other side
without the transfer of an equal portion from the latter to the
former.     Thus the motion must be circulating or reentering ;
 and accordingly a general characteristic of magnetic and gal
vanic currents is accounted           for on the principles of hydrody
namics.
   12.       This being understood,
                                the forms of the magnetic lines
of motion are determinable, at least approximately, by the fol
lowing argument. We have seen that in consequence of the
regular gradation of the atomic density of a cylindrical magnet,
 and the velocities due to the outstanding undulations which by
 their attractive action maintain this state of density, the fluid is
 impelled in each transverse section at every instant towards the
 denser end of the magnet.       These impulses operating against
 the inertia of the   surrounding   mass of fluid, have the effect of
 generating streams which, as being due to a steady action, are
 steady, and, as fulfilling the condition stated in art. 11, are ne
 cessarily circulating.    To give a first idea of the courses of these
 streams, at least in the immediate neighbourhood of the mag
 net,    I
         cannot do better than refer to the figure in p. 17 of the
 Astronomer Royal’s ‘Treatise on Magnetism,” the directions of
  the axes of the small magnets indicating (as will be shown sub
 sequently) the directions of the lines of motion at the positions
 where they are situated.      An approximate analytical expression
  for the forms of these magnetic curves is derivable from the pre
  sent theory by the following investigation.
     13. From what is argued above, the impulses are produced
  by variations of pressure due to variations of the square of the
 mean of the velocities within the cylinder estimated in directions
 parallel to      its
               axis, these variations being caused exclusively         by
 the mean contraction      channel resulting from the increasing
                               of

186           Prof. Challis           on the       Hydrodynamical Theory of the
occupation of space by the atoms towards the denser end.    Now
we may conceive this mean effect to result from the separate
effects of a vast number of atoms contained within a thin trans
verse slice of the cylinder, inasmuch as the individual motions
due to the occupation of space by the atoms may coexist, and
the parts of the motions resolved transversely to the axis will in
that case destroy each other.     Also it is to be considered that
the motions of the aether resulting from the mean of the impulses
must satify the condition of circulating.
    14. This being understood, it will be seen to be allowable
to substitute for the impulsive effect of contraction of channel
that of a motion forward in the same direction of the aggre
gation of atoms contained in the above-mentioned                   slice, the
fluid  being   relatively  at rest.     For on this      supposition     there
will be a mean impulse parallel to the axis of the cylinder,
which will be the sum of the impulses of the individual atoms
resolved in that direction, and moreover will give rise to a
circulating motion.      The last assertion rests on Poisson’s so
lution of the problem of the simultaneous motions of a ball-pen
dulum and the surrounding fluid, according to which the lines
of motion of the fluid are reentering ; and this being the case
with respect to each atom, the result of the composition of                                                   all
the motions will          circulating motion.

that the stream resulting from the action                     the atoms         of   all                      in

   24. Proceeding now to discuss in a similar manner the pro
blem of the action of a galvanic coil on a small magnet, propose,                              I
first, to solve it according to the principles of the hydrodyna
mical theory of galvanism, and then to inquire how far the same
theory will account for the facts and hypotheses on which Am
père's empirical solution of the problem rests.         The hydrodyna
mical considerations will differ in some essential respects from
those applicable to magnetism.
    25. First it will be necessary to ascertain what motions of the
aether correspond to the transmission of a galvanic current along
a fine wire.     For this purpose certain hydrodynamical theorems
will be  employed,    the principles and the proofs of which I have
discussed in various antecedent researches.          I consider it to be
an axiom    that,  whatever be the motion of a fluid mass, the lines
of direction of the motion may at            times      cut   all  surface        be         by   a

the individual parts of the fluid alter their relative positions
remains the same.
   29.     If
            while such change of relative position is taking place
each rectangular fluid element is also changing form, the lines
of motion are necessarily not parallel; and since, by hypothesis,
they are in the directions of normals to continuous curved sur
faces, it follows that for such motions udw-H way + walz is an exact
differential. But if each rectangular element retains the same
form, the lines of motion must be parallel, the surfaces of dis
placement are planes, and uda + way+wdz is integrable by a
factor.

along a straight cylindrical conductor, the motion of the fluid
at any point may be determined by the following reasoning
(given in more detail in the ‘Principles of Physics, pp. 563–565).
The motion is plainly a function of the distance from the axis of
the cylinder, but cannot be wholly parallel to it; for if that were
the case, since the motion               is,   by
                                    hypothesis, steady, and      such                   in
motion the   pressure    everywhere

and since     this instance the velocity will evidently

greater the distance from the axis,        would follow that

Thus the velocity parallel                           to      the axis varies inversely                        as   the      dis

and    therefore proportional
         is                        varies according          to

above defined vary directly     the distances,                as
                                                    follows that                                    it
through each elementary channel outside the wire the same
quantity           of   fluid flows            in   a    given interval.                       Also, since             it   has
been shown (art. 31) that f(r)=                                          F(r), we obtain

  the transverse circular motion varies inversely

is consequently positive.         As the factors A and M are wholly
arbitrary, we have thus shown that, as far as hydrodynamics is
concerned, the galvanic current might be either deatrorsum or
sinistrorsum.
    Having in the preliminary part of this communication dis
cussed the action of a large magnet on a small one, and having
now ascertained the exact form of a galvanic current along a cir
cular wire, I propose in a second Part to investigate the action
of a galvanic coil on a small magnet, and to show why it agrees
approximately with that of a magnet, and in what respect espe
cially the two actions differ. In the course of the investigation
the facts on which Ampère's theory rests will be accounted for
 by the hydrodynamical theory, for the purpose of fully establish
ing the claim of the latter to be considered a strictly a priori
theory.

       SHOULD    be glad if any of your readers will send me a re
      ference to any work of authority in which there is any direct
 statement of the height of the level of the ocean (say the central
 Atlantic) compared with high-water mark on the east and west
 coasts of Ireland and England.      This is an important point in
                                                  am about to dis               I

 the general theory of the tides, a subject
 cuss.  The view    shall advocate is that the level of the ocean is
 nearly represented by high-water mark on coasts and bays where
 there is free access of the tide and a channel without a sudden
 taper.    Mr. E. Roberts, of the Nautical Almanac Office, editor
 of the  Reports   of the Tidal Committee of the British Associa
 tion, informed me last month he was not aware of any statement
 in print on good authority on this point. The only opinion                                                     I
 have on this subject is from Professor G. G. Stokes, F.R.S. (and
 that is an unprinted one”), who wrote, “Nobody maintains that
 the general level of the ocean is that of low water; it is the
 mean between high and low, except in shallow channels &c.,
 where it is not the exact mean.”            In the absence of further
 authorities I shall   give  my  deflection theory of tides.

 208                   Mr. A. Tylor              on Tides and Waves.
      If fig.
           4, Pl. IV., is correct, there can be no great heaping up
 of water or any tidal wave generated in one direction, as has
 been sometimes assumed; for I show that the action of the tide
 is a reciprocating action, and has as much motion from west to
 east as from east to west.
    The assumption of a great heap of water travelling in one
direction, or producing a certain amount of retardation of
the rotary movement of the earth, quite unbalanced by ac
celeration, has been taken as a serious fact ; many writers
of reputation have supposed that the rotation of the earth
must be affected by this hypothetical wave-action in -  one di
rection.
    My view of the general theory of the tides (fig. 4, Pl. IV.)
differs materially from those generally accepted; and    cannot                                  I
understand the existence of an intumescence (shown in figs. 1,

 in the ordinary manner                 of
                                reasoning.
 I    entirely disbelieve      tidal action having the smallest effect

on the rotation of the earth.                balanced action. The sun

The two cases are not parallel, and the diagram mentioned by
Herschel is certainly not applicable to the tides at all. The
oceanic water has no tangential force independent of the earth;
for two points in the ocean, reaching 180°, opposite to each other

exact equilibrium if the difference of tidal action is left out of
consideration.    I think the authors have not taken into consi

 tion P, E, which is that of the line of rotation. In an inland sea
 like the Mediterranean, where the deep water is 6000 feet, the
 movement of the tide on the coast is often not more than 1 foot.
 There are 7-feet tides in one or two places in the Mediterranean
 where the contour of the coast is like our Bristol Channel.
         If the
           deep water in the Mediterranean Sea were one twelfth
 of the depth of that in the Atlantic, we should expect a 1-foot tide
 there in place of a 12-feet, according to the law of composition
 of forces}.  The peculiar circumstances of the Mediterranean
 make the tides much smaller than I should have calculated from
 the experience of the Atlantic. Taking 6000 feet as the basis of
 the deep water and 9 inches as the tide, diffusion of the tidal force
 from deep central to surrounding shallow coast-basins seems to
 absorb 3 of the force. The proportion of deep water is very small.
    The Mediterranean standard of rates of depths of ocean to
 height of tide along       coasts, seems        its
                                                  match more with                   to
 Pacific and west-coast-of-America standards than with the obser
 vations    the eastern Atlantic coast. The European tides seem
                    on

locity of the wave, instead of the impossible velocity of 800 miles
per hour suggested by some authors.
     An earthquake might transmit a blow through the deep water
in the ocean at six miles per minute, as a wave was formed at
Barbadoes 3000 miles from the supposed origin of the shock in
585 minutes after it was observed at Lisbon. Michell, in 1755
wrote “when the bar at the mouth of the Tagus was seen dry
from shore to shore, then suddenly the sea, like a mountain, came
rolling in.” When this blow struck a distant coast below the level
of the sea, it would be reflected and cause the sea to ebb from the
coast first. Then when the force which heaped up the water away
from the shore diminished by work done upon the water in raising
up the level of the sea, a great wave would be moved shorewards
by gravity. The first announcement of the approach of an
earthquake-wave is the ebb of the water*, not a surface-wave.
     If a great surface-wave were generated by an earthquake, it
 would not travel very far, but would soon diminish in height
and speed, and would not be preceded by a wave in an opposite
 direction.
     In some careful experiments in a course of one fifth of a milet

II. and      III.
   In fig. 1, Plate II., a point is assumed in the Atlantic 300
miles from the Land's End, where the high- and low-water level
is assumed to be invariable, and where the mass of the ocean
water is supposed to move east and west very slowly in alternate
and opposite directions in each tide.
   When the flowing tide is moving a ship 3 miles an hour, there
is 360 miles difference in distance, and 6 hours’ time, between
high water at Plymouth and Dover; therefore the lost motion
is 18 miles out of 360, or 5 per cent.   The impulse received at
 Plymouth from the central slowly moving oceanic water must
 have been transmitted through the deeper water at a much
 higher rate, but only reaches Dover after travelling at 60 miles
an hour.    Then the impulse is transmitted from Dover to Lon
don at the rate of 120 miles in three hours, or 40 miles an hour,
the tide only taking a ship 9 miles in 3 hours; so that the lost
motion is 9 miles out of 120, or 7 per cent., the difference of
time between Plymouth and Dover (21 minutes) not being taken
into account.

periodicity about the alternation of land and water surfaces,
particularly in the Carboniferous period, which might be ex
plained by slow changes in long intervals of the disposition of
the solid and fluid internal substance of the earth with regard
to and about its centre.
     Aslow circulation of an eccentric mass of fluid may occur in
the interior of the earth, and gases may periodically pass from one
part of the solid portion to another, their place being supplied
by fluids, attracting the ocean unequally.
    Unequal attraction from variable subterraneous inequalities
would affect different points of the surface and raise the water
level on one part for long periods and depress it on alternate and
opposite points to an equal extent.            The theory of inconstancy
of rainfall and of fluctuation of the sea-level in geological periods
is gaining ground since                    I
                               first advanced these views (in 1853) in
this Journal, in a paper entitled “Fluctuations of the Sea-level
 in stated Periods of Time.”
    We must not gauge our interpretation of nature by the pre
 sent temperature, rainfall, or tide-gauges, but from the actual
evidence presented in the strata themselves.

THE“On   a Self-recording Method of Measuring         the Intensity of
the Chemical Action of Total     Daylight.”   By H. E. Roscoe, F.R.S.
   The  object of the present communication is to describe an instru
ment by which the varying intensity of the chemically active rays,
as affecting chloride of silver paper of constant sensitiveness, can be
made self-recording.     The method described by the author in the
Bakerian Lecture for 1865, although it has been the means of
bringing into notice many important facts concerning the distribu
tion of the sun's chemical activity throughout the atmosphere, as
well as in different situations on the earth's surface, has not as yet
been introduced as a portion of the regular work of meteorological
observatories, owing to the fact that, in order to obtain a satisfac
tory curve of daily chemical intensity, at least hourly observations
need to be made, and this involves the expenditure of more time
and labour than it has been found possible to give.       In the pre
sent communication a method is described, which, whilst preserving
untouched the principles and accuracy of the former method, re
duces the personal attention needed for carrying out the measure
ments to a minimum, and thus renders its adoption in observatories
possible.
   According to this plan, a constant sensitive paper is exposed by
a self-acting arrangement for accurately known times, at given
intervals throughout the day. The insolation apparatus stocked
with sensitive paper is placed in position either early in the morn
ing of the day during which the measurements have to be made, or
on the previous night, and by means of an electric communication
with a properly arranged clock, the sensitive paper is exposed every
hour during the day, so that, in the evening, the observer has only
to read off, in the ordinary manner, the hourly intensities which
have been recorded on the paper during the day.
   This self-recording arrangement, though apparently simple,                        in
volves points which have rendered           its

chanically, not once, but for several known but varying intervals
of time quickly succeeding each other; so that whatever may be
the intensity of the total daylight (supposed during these intervals
F.
to remain constant), some one at least of the several exposed
         will possess the requisite shade. This is accomplished by
a  duplicate  arrangement of a clock and insolation-apparatus,     by
means of which disks of the constant sensitive     paper  are exposed
each hour for successive known intervals of time, varying from two
to thirty seconds. After an interval of an hour, another set of
disks are exposed for the same series of intervals; and these series
of insolations are repeated once every hour during the day. The
mechanical arrangements for effecting this with accuracy are fully
described in the paper.     On unrolling, at the end of the day, the
strip of sensitive paper which has served for the exposures, black
disks showing where the paper has been stationary for the hour
are seen ; and between each of these are found ten circles variously
tinted, from that, probably, scarcely visible, which was exposed for
two seconds, to that, perhaps too dark to read off, which was inso
lated for thirty seconds. Amongst these, some one at least, will
be found of such a shade as to enable it to be read off by the mo
nochromatic soda-flame, on a graduated fixed strip, as described in
former communications.
   A new method of calibrating the fixed strips of standard tints
necessary for these measurements is next described ; and the ques
tion as to the possibility of preparing constant sensitive paper in
long strips instead of in large sheets is next experimentally dis
cussed, the result of the examination being that it is possible to
prepare silvered paper in long narrow strips such as are used in
Morse's telegraph—apparatus, so that it shall throughout

moment the sensitive flame                       at   F,   ceasing     to     be      affected, resumed
its former tranquillity.
   Exactly the same action takes place when the luminous portion
ofa   gas-flame   made the reflecting layer; but

that the portion transmitted through the reflecting layer shall be
incompetent to affect the flame. Then by the introduction and
withdrawal of the bat's-wing flame the two sensitive flames can be
rendered alternately quiescent and strongly agitated.
   An illustration is here afforded of the perfect analogy between
light and sound; for if a beam of light be projected from B to F,
and a plate of glass be introduced at A, in the exact position of the
reflecting layer of gas, the beam will be divided, and one portion
will be reflected in the direction A F, and the other portion trans
mitted through the glass in the direction F, exactly as the sound
wave is divided into a reflected and a transmitted portion by the layer
of heated gas or flame.

   The following communication was read:—
   “On an Instrument for the Composition of two Harmonic
Curves.”    By A. E. Donkin, M.A., F.R.A.S., Fellow of Exeter Col
lege, Oxford.
   The interest in such compound curves lies in the fact that, as a
simple harmonic curve may be considered to be the curve of pres
sure on the tympanic membrane when the ear is in the neighbour
hood of a vibrating body producing a simple tone, so a curve com
pounded of two such simple harmonic curves will be the curve of
pressure for the consonance of the two tones which they severally
represent, and thus the effect on the ear of different consonances
can be distinctly represented to the eye.
   If the motion of a point be compounded of rectilinear harmonic
vibrations and of uniform motion in a straight line at right angles
to the direction of those vibrations, the point will describe a simple
harmonic curve.
   Thus a pencil-point performing such vibrations upon a sheet of
  aper moving uniformly at right angles to their direction would
  raw such a curve.
   The same kind of curve would also be drawn by keeping the
pencil fixed and by giving to the paper, in addition to its continuous
transverse motion, a vibratory motion similar and parallel to that
which the pencil had ; and ff the motion of the latter be now re
stored, a complicated curve will be produced whose form will depend
on the ratio of the numbers of vibrations in a given time of the
pencil and paper, and which will be the curve of pressure for the
interval corresponding to this ratio.
   The manner in which these three motions are combined in the
machine is as follows:—Two vertical spindles, A and B, revolving
in a horizontal plate carry at their lower ends each a crank, C and
D, and at their upper ends each a wheel cut with a certain number
of teeth; these two wheels can be connected by means of an inter
mediate one, as is seen in the figure; and since either wheel of the
pair can be replaced by another with a different number of teeth, the
relative angular velocities of the spindles can be regulated at plea
sure. The paper upon which the curve is to be drawn is carried upon

224     Royal Society:— Mr. A. E. Donkin on an Instrument
a rectangular frame, EFG H, capable of sliding horizontally up and
down in a direction parallel to that of the plane passing through the
  spindles. This frame has a pair of rollers, EF and GH, at each end
  connected by tape bands, between which the paper passes as the rol
  lers turn. In order to give a motion of revolution to the rollers, a
  wheel, L, is fixed upon the axis of one of them whose teeth gear

                     for      the Composition              of two         Harmonic Curves.                                  225
into those of a pinion, PQ, alongside which the frame slides, and
which is itself driven by one of the vertical spindles. A connecting
rod, DM, is carried to the frame from the crank of this spindle, so
that upon turning the latter a vibratory motion is given to the
former; and since the transverse motion of the paper also depends
upon the same spindle, a fixed pencil-point resting on it would
draw a simple harmonic curve whose amplitude would depend on
the radius of the crank, and wave-length on the transverse speed of
the paper, which can be regulated at pleasure by means contrived
for the purpose”.

curve represents the effect on the ear of a diatonic semitone, while
the ratio 81 to 80 would give that of the comma. In both these
curves, and more especially in the latter, the beats which would
ensue on actually sounding the two tones together are shown with
remarkable distinctness.
   As the machine is provided with a set of change-wheels, many
different curves can be produced, while the form of each can be
more or less changed by altering the relative positions of the
cranks before bringing the idle wheel into gear. It is also possible
to obtain very large values of m and n in the above equation by
using two idle wheels on the same axis, which shall come into gear,
the upper one with the wheel on the one spindle, the lower one with
that on the other.
   Thus, suppose A and B are the numbers of teeth on the spindle
wheels respectively, C and D those on the idle wheels, and                                                        letA

   The material for this note was a slab from Cowleaze Chine, con
taining portions of two individuals of Hypsilophodon Fowii—one con
sisting of a skull with a great part of the vertebral column, the
other of a portion of the vertebral column.        The author described
some details of the structure of the     skull, and especially the palatal
apparatus. The pterygoids, which are not mesially joined, have a
stout body, the posterior border of which bears a very large basi
sphenoidal process; and the left pterygoid retains the root of a strong
quadratic process, in front of which the hollow outer border runs out
into an ectopterygoid.      In front of the pterygoids the palatines are
partially visible, also separated by a fissure. Of the eight vertebrae,
the last three are firmly anchylosed, and the seventh and eighth
form part of the sacrum.         They are constricted in the middle;
and their transverse    processes,  which spring from the junction of
two   vertebrae, are bent  backwards,   joining the dilated outer end of
the transverse   processes of the next vertebra, including a large sub
circular   loop.   The second fragment of a vertebral column, which
belonged to a smaller individual, includes the sacrum and several
vertebrae.    Near the skull the slab contains several very thin bony
plates of irregularly polygonal form, regarded by the author as
dermal scutes.      In connexion with the question of the generic rank
of Hypsilophodon, the author stated that in Hypsilophodon the
centra of the sacral vertebrae are cylindroid and rounded below,
whilst in Iguanodon they are compressed laterally and angulated
below.

of the Lancashire and Cheshire Low-level Clay and Sands.” By T.
Mellard Reade, Esq., C.E., F.G.S.
    The author commenced by explaining a section in a cutting at
Booth-Lane Station, in which most of the beds seen about Liverpool
    *
are typically represented.     This section shows in ascending order:-
 1. Pebble-beds of the Trias; 2. shattered rock; 3. compacted
 red-sand rubble (ground moraine); 4. lowest bed of Boulder-clay
 (largely composed of red sand); 5. stratified sand, with shell
 fragments; 6. bed of fine unctuous clay : 7. brick-clay (with many
 shells); 8. sand-bed; 9. stratified yellow sand (“Washed Drift
 sand  ”).
                 next gave a list of the localities in which shells were
 found, and stated that in all forty-six species had been met with
 distributed through the clay-beds, those found in the sand-seams
 being rare and generally fragmentary and rolled.         The shells most

commonly found entire are usually of small size, and of a form cal
culated to resist pressure, such as Turritella communis, Trophon
clathratus, and Mangelia turricula. Fusus antiquus and Buccinum
wndatum are generally represented only by worn fragments of the
columella; and Cyprina islandica is always found in fragments.
The author thought that the association of the various species dis
tributed without order through the clays shows that they could not
have lived together on the same bottom, but that they must have
been to a great extent transported.         He contended that the ad
mixture of shells in the Boulder-clay was due to the tendency of the
sea to throw up          contents its                 on
                                       the beach, whence changing cur
rents and floating ice might again remove them, and            the oscilla                  to

     3. “On the Mud-craters and geological structure of the Mekran
Coast.”      By Lieut. A. W. Stiffe, F.R.A.S.       Communicated by Prof.
Ramsay, F.R.S., W.P.G.S.
     The coast of Mekran, extending from near the western frontier of
India to the mouth of the Persian Gulf, was stated by the author to
be a nearly rainless district, consisting of clay plains with pre
cipitous tabular hills, the former veined here and there with crystal
line gypsum, the latter composed of clay capped and sometimes
interstratified with coarse, friable, fossiliferous calcareous strata,
from 5 to 30 feet thick, supposed to be of Miocene age, and all
horizontal or nearly so, except at the extreme east and west, where
the strata are inclined at an angle of from 40° to 60°. Along the
 coast there are no distinct traces of volcanic action; but on the
 north coast of the Persian Gulf a similar formation has been much
 disturbed by the protrusion of recent volcanic material, near Jashak
 to the west there is a hot mineral spring, and near Karachi there
 are springs of pure hot water. The author described the mode in
 which denudation is effected in this region by occasional heavy
 rains, and by the constant action of the sea upon the coast, and then
 noticed the occurrence, within a few miles of the shore, of numerous
 peculiar mud-craters, forming hills varying in height from 20 to
 300 or 400 feet above the plain, of a regular conical form, with
 truncated tops, and the sides sloping at an angle of about 40°. The
 summits of these hills present a circular cup with a narrow border,
 filled with semifluid mud, which occasionally flows slowly over the
 margin of the crater.        The author considered that the conical hills
 have been formed        solely  by these overflows.    He believed that a
 small shoal     occurring    offthe coast near Jashak might       produced

                                                     to

ON     THE LIGHT REFLECTED BY PERMANGANATE                                              OF POTASSIUM.
                  BY DR. EILHARD WIE DEMAN N.
      ROFESSOR STOKES” observed that in the spectrum of the
        light reflected from solid permanganate of potassium dark
streaks occur, and that they are exhibited most distinctly with a
certain angle of incidence; further, the minima of brightness in the
spectrum of the reflected light correspond to the rays transmitted
in the greatest intensity by the permanganate.
   I   have pursued this subject further, and examined not only the
light reflected at the boundary of permanganate of potassium and
air, but also that at the boundary of benzine, sulphide of carbon,
and a mixture of these two substances, and the above salt.                 More
over the polarization of the incident light was kept in view. To
obtain the reflecting surfaces, triturated crystals of the salt were
polished upon ground glass plates by means of a jet-burnisher.
 Clean surfaces, free from oxide, were thereby secured for the inves
tigation, which is not the case when whole crystals are employed.
 The glass plate thus prepared was inserted in a rectangular hollow
 prism (which could be filled with the different liquids) in such wise
 that   itscoated face was turned         the rectangular edge.
                                                        to            The prism
 was   placed  upon     graduated
                             a        circular table that could          rotated,               be
 and sunlight       thrown upon one
                        so                     the two surfaces including the
                                                              of
 right angle that the light refracted there fell upon the coated plate
and, through reflection, passed out                            at
                                                 the other surface.    Thence                                 it
arrived       the slit
              at             spectrum-apparatus.

 on   the coated plate was determined thus: the light from the first
              the prism was reflected back                   own direction; the   its

 position      the table was then read         off;  the rotation      the table               of
 with the prism gives immediately the incidence-angle                   the first               at
 surface; from this angle and that between the glass plate and the
 first face     the prism, and the index

    These numbers show :—
     1. That, with large angles of incidence, the streaks in the light
 polarized perpendicular to the incidence-plane, with respect to those
 in the light polarized parallel to the plane of incidence, are displaced
 towards the blue, and that in the former another streak occurs in
 the vicinity of D.
     2. That with the increase of the refraction-index of the surround
 ing medium the streaks in the parallel-polarized light undergo dis
 placements towards the blue; while, on the contrary, in the per
 pendicularly-polarized              light the streaks preserve their position un
 changed, or alter it but little.                   Observation of the streaks in the
 blue beyond F is attended with great difficulties, as is the entire
 investigation, through the breadth of the streaks and the impossi
 bility of obtaining perfectly reflecting surfaces.
     A comparison of the streaks obtained in the transmitted and in
 the reflected light shows that never do two of such streaks cover
 one another, and that neither do the former lie each in the middle
 between two of the latter.
     As to change of position of the streaks with the angle of inci
 dence, it resulted that in the light polarized parallel to the plane of
 incidence, and likewise in natural light, the position was as good as
 independent of the angle of incidence; but in the light polarized
 perpendicular to that plane the streaks have, up to a certain angle
 of incidence, which amounted to

angles greater than those given, the above Tables hold good.
   Precisely the same phenomena as on the ground and polished salt
may be observed on crystals.     Just so are they exhibited on per
manganate of ammonia; but here measurements were impossible,
on account of the great decomposability of the salt.
   The above observations were verified in every way possible. For
example, the dependence of the situation of the streaks on the index
of refraction was again established by putting benzine and sulphide
of carbon in layers one above another, immersing a glass plate
coated with polished permanganate of potassium, and comparing
immediately the spectra of the light reflected at the boundaries of
the two media by the permanganate.       The streaks in the spectrum
of the  light which had passed  through  the sulphide of carbon were,
in relation to those in the  spectrum   of that which had traversed
the benzine, displaced towards the blue.—Poggendorff’s Annalen,

        ON    THE TEMPERATURE OF THE SUN.                              BY   J. VIOLLE.
   I   have previously indicated and discussed the method                                      I   most
frequently employ in my measurements concerning the temperature
of the sun. I shall today describe the apparatus I use, and shall
develop the calculus of the experiments.
   My apparatus is composed of two concentric spherical envelopes
of brass. The interior one, 15 centims. in diameter, constitutes
the enclosure, in the centre of which is the bulb of the thermonieter
submitted to experiment.     This enclosure, blackened on the inside,
is kept at a constant temperature by a continuous current of water
furnished by the conduit-pipes of the city and circulating between
the two balls.   The exterior ball has a diameter of 23 centims. ; it
 has been carefully polished on                   its
                                              outer surface, and         besides,      is,

                screens which leave free only the admission-aperture.

                       PHYSICS OF THE INTERNAL EARTH.
                                BY D. WAUGHAN.
  In     1853  I  first attempted to trace the consequences of subter
ranean heat, by taking into consideration some facts and principles
which seemed to have received but little attention.          The results of
my inquiries on the subject were given in a circular in 1854, in a
pamphlet in 1856, and in a paper which                       I
                                                       sent to the British
Association in 1861, and of which an abstract is published in the
Reports of the Sections, page 134. In that paper                     I
                                                              endeavoured
to show that the terrestrial crust, if reposing on lava of a declining
temperature, would receive accessions of buoyant solid material,
chiefly on such points as extend deep into the fiery menstruum, and
that the consequent growth of internal mountains would be inter
rupted only by the occasional movements of vast portions of this
 light matter to positions much higher than those at which they were
 first deposited. To the collisions of such rising masses against the
 weaker parts of the earth's crust             I
                                             ascribe earthquakes; but the
 theory affords a more satisfactory explanation for volcanic phe
 nonnella.
      Avalanches of siliceous rocks, ascending through buoyancy from
 deep subterranean peaks or depressions, would lead to important
  results by conveying heat from a lower to a higher stratum of the
  internal earth. Owing their solidity to pressure, such stony masses
  would fuse during the ascent; and, like our mountain-floods, would
  erode channels which must for a long period direct them to the same
  localities.    The same spots of the earth's crust, being thus exposed
  for   many   ages  to the repeated inroads of intensely heated matter
  from    great  depths,  would be reduced in thickness by the frequent
  fusion, and would present a weaker barrier to subterranean vio
   lence. Such an internal convection of heat would end in perforating
   the earth's crust and producing an immense lake of lava on           sur        its
   face, were      not for the cooling influence    aqueous action; and the

is to be found in the decomposition of many of the heavy silicates
by enormous pressure when the temperature of the menstruum in
which they were fused sunk below the melting-point of quartz.
An equivalent of oxide of lead and of crystallized silicic acid would
have their common volume increased about 14 per cent. on combi
ning and forming lead glass. Now, at a depth of 1000 kilometres
below the earth's surface, the pressure is equal to about 300,000
atmospheres; and accordingly the formation of a cubic inch of
glass by the union of quartz and oxide of lead would, in conse
quence of the expansion it involves, be resisted by a force the ther
mal equivalent of which may be represented by the heat expended
in melting 14 cubic inches of ice. A force of equal energy would
be exerted by the same pressure for the decomposition of a cubic
inch of silicate of lead, in the supposed locality, and for the crys
tallization of the resulting silicic acid. As far less heat is evolved by
the union of the strongest acids and bases, and as a crystallization
 or atom-arrangement can make no heavy demands on force, it is
reasonable to conclude that in the supposed case chemical affinity
would be overruled and that the silicate of lead would be decom
posed. From similar estimates it would also appear that other
silicates, especially those of heavy metals, would undergo a similar
decomposition at great depths, and would part with their silica
                                                                                   in its

the earth's crust has evidently the greatest thickness and reposes
on the deepest internal prominences; and to the occasional slides
and ascending movements of matter from these parts of the subter
ranean regions, we may ascribe the prevalence of vulcanicity on so
many continental coasts.                                                                                                   -
    If  only one per cent. of terrestrial matter passed into a solid form
in the course of ten millions of years, there would be still sufficient
grounds for assigning to rock-slides a mass so great that the me
chanical effects of their collisions against the thinner parts of the
crust may produce the most violent earthquake shocks. But the most
obvious effects must be ascribed to the sudden elevation of tempera
ture which the thin spots of the earth's crust should experience,
and which may be reasonably estimated at many thousand degrees.
Exposed to such a fierce heat, the solid structure would be rent by
the unequal expansion of           parts,      its

      were attached (by fusion) containing the conducting-wires, so that
      in the experiment the wires were at least 45 centims. distant from
      each other.    The tube was filled with phosphorus vapour of very
...   little tension; after the experiment                      its
                                                   sides were coated with

         The second apparatus serving for the same purpose,           master
      piece of  the glassblower's art, has the form and size           beaker           of   a a

      (Pogg. Ann. vol. cxxvi.     195) were made with another arrange

                      able  resume this subject
                                 to                   greater detail; for     in

XXXIV.         On Gladstone’s Experiments relating to Chemical Mass.

     TH:   Philosophical Transactions for 1855 (vol. cxlv.) con
       tains an important memoir by Gladstone “On Circum
stances modifying    the Action of Chemical Affinity.”      In this
memoir numerous sets of experiments are described, which
mainly serve to determine, by means of an increase or diminu
tion of colour, the progress of certain selected reactions.    The
results are exhibited in curves, several of which show a regular
course, while       all
                  are continuous; but                     no

212              Dr. E.        J.    Mills    on   Gladstone's Eaperiments
of change per unit interval is proportional to the amount of sub
stance then changing.
     As Gladstone’s results were the first in which the continuity
of the chemical process was experimentally demonstrated (at any
rate on a sufficient scale),                  I
                             felt much interested in ascertaining
whether Esson’s equation would apply to them—especially when
I  considered how few have been the contributions to chemical
dynamics, the laborious (and consequently unpopular) nature of
such researches, and the inexpediency of allowing good work to
                                       -
remain dumb or unexpressed.
    II. The colorimetrical method, which was used throughout by
Gladstone, has considerable disadvantages, and is most service
able when only small quantities, as in the case of the Nessler
test, have to be measured and an inaccuracy of about 5 per cent.
is of no consequence.     It is probable that the observer's estimate
of colour varies    during  a long course of experiments,      and is
really under training in the earlier ones; so that, as will
actually be found below,                     all
                                the more serious errors occur,
                                                                                                          as
                                                                                                          a
rule,      at
          the outset.  We must also remember that colour-effects
in  solutions are not unfrequently slow        attaining their maxi   in
mum, thus making          particular observation too low;
                                     a                            the                              on
other hand, the subsequent arrival         this maximum will makeof
   following observation too high: hence also,                                   by
                                                       virtue    com                             be of
a
pensation,           the later observations                 may   -
                                                                      be   expected        to            more
correct.
     A    further difficulty lies   the computation itself. The amount
                                             in
                           (or substance) originally present  not given
in of
        chemical  energy
                                                                                          byis
   terms     the reagent, and has
                 of                         arrived         to   be
                                                          successive              at
and wearisome approximations; and these might perhaps have
been carried    stage further with advantage.
                       a                            Again, the suc
cessive values        are very

                                 w       given      the experiments,        in
which had not been arranged         test any particular hypothesis;
                                                       to
they had consequently           obtained to    graphic interpolation

    The entire number of comparisons is sixty-seven. Thus it
 appears that 54 per cent. of the errors are such as would, on
 their average, be found in very good analytical work; 33 per
 eent. of them occur, on their average, in ordinarily good analy
 tical work; the remaining 13 per cent. lie, on their average,
 within the usual limits allowable in colorimetry.
    X. The foregoing equations show that any such expression as
             #[Fe3Cl8l4-3KCNS=4[Fe3(CNS)6]+3KCl
 is wholly erroneous, if intended to represent the chemical energy
 of a ferric salt, or the amount of potassic sulphocyanide that is
 capable of acting thereon; for the energy of the quantity
 #[Feº Cl*] is not exhausted until about 400 units (KCNS) have
 been brought to bear upon it; and other ferric salts are repre
 sented by similarly high numbers.             The ordinary equations of
 chemistry represent the result of distributing weight, and give
 no account of work done; these, on the other hand, represent a
 dynamical process as well as distribution of weight. Hence it is
 clear that the “equivalents” or valencies inferred from the com
 mon equations rest upon a wholly fallacious basis, and cannot
 be depended upon in scientific reasoning. To assert, for instance,
 that C is equivalent to Hº, amounts to stating that hydrogen
 and carbon have been compared as to the work they can do
 under certain circumstances, just as ferric chloride is compared.
                    i
 with ferric sulphate in Gladstone’s experiments.                 No such re
 search has, however, been made; and it would not be likely to
 yield the ratio        =l if it   were made.        What, then, becomes of
 the doctrine that carbon is tetravalent?
    It is worthy of remark that, while the ordinary equations                  in
 variably express that quantity consists of parts (that, for example,
 potassic chloride contains potassium            and chlorine, whereas we

chlorine), the logarithmic equations make no suggestion upon
this subject. All the above experiments might have been accu
rately performed and symbolically expressed by a person totall
ignorant of the “constitution” of ferric salts or of potassic
phocyanide; and the reagent might have been extremely impure,
provided that it produced a red coloration. What we owe to
Esson and Gladstone we might have inherited from Wenzel or
Cavendish.

cently been found to possess, has within the last four or five
years been prepared in considerable quantities, and has become
an article of some commercial importance; and numerous as
are the useful applications which have already been made of
that substance in medicine, there can be but little doubt that
their number may be greatly increased; so that we may justly
regard chloral hydrate as one of the most, if not the most, im
portant of the recent additions to our materia medica.

distilled water till the presence of ammonia could no longer be
discovered in the filtrate.   The brown matter was subsequently
dried, first by exposure to the air on the filter at the ordinary
temperature, then at a very gentle heat, and afterwards by ex
posing it for some time under a bell-glass to the drying influ
ence of sulphuric acid.
        I
   As thought it more than probable that the substance, from
the way    in which it had been procured, contained some free
sulphur (which was afterwards shown to be the case), a portion
of that which had been so dried was placed in a stoppered bottle
and digested for some days along with bisulphide of carbon; the
mixture was then thrown on a filter, and washed with repeated
fresh portions of pure bisulphide till but a faint trace of residue
remained after the evaporation of a little of the filtrate; and this
seemed to be due, not to sulphur as at the first, but to the brown
compound being soluble to a very slight degree in the bisul
phide. After this treatment the bisulphide was allowed to eva
porate off from the substance, when it was placed as before under
a bell-glass along with a vessel containing sulphuric acid, where
it remained for some days. Thinking, however, that it might
still not be perfectly dry, it was subsequently heated in a-water
bath or oven to about 212°F., when                               I
                                          found that a very slight

resistance of the wire wound round the magnet is 30 mercury
units+. The mean electromotive force of the induction-shocks is
 7t

second.       During the following investigation the magnet rotated
about forty times a second; so that the resultant electromotive
force in each direction was about 0:12 Grove.
   The resistance of the galvanometer was found to be about
2477 mercury units; so that the resistance of the whole circuit
was as nearly as possible 2500 units.      The galyanometer had a
plane mirror, and was read                  off   by

circuit, the wire showed a very strong unilateral conductivity.
Cleaning and scraping the wire had at first apparently no effect;
screwing the wire, however, to another binding-screw attached
to the induction-coil destroyed the effect entirely, so that the
wire, even when screwed to the original binding-screw, showed
no unilateral conductivity.  The same experiment was repeated
a second   time, and with the same result.   Five minutes' lying
in powdered charcoal was sufficient to reproduce a strong
unilateral conductivity; and the same operation as before
destroyed            it.

its neutral state. All the various circumstances which generally
had produced unilateral conductivity were now tried; but none
succeeded.    New wires were tried; the whole apparatus was
left untouched and disconnected for several days; but        could                             I
not obtain the effect again.        used the same instrument

another investigation during three consecutive weeks, during
which various new wires were tried and new combinations em
ployed; but the effect only came out once more, and this time
in  the galvanometer.     The deflection amounted       about 20                         to
divisions        of

                            lasted for several days and then dis

by him under the name of bilateral deflection (doppelsinnige
Ablenkung). It seems that the currents in alternate direction
affect to a certain  degree the temporary magnetization of the
needle.   This has  of course an influence on the time of vibra
tion, which is shorter while the current increasing the mag
netism passes through the galvanometer.       While the current
passes in this direction the needle makes a greater way than in
the same time while the current in the opposite direction is
passing.   The two currents succeeding each other at regular
intervals of time will therefore not counterbalance each other,
but the current increasing the magnetism of the needle will have
the upper hand.
   The result will be that the needle will be driven towards the
side to which it was originally deflected.    This, of course, only
happens if the effect of this magnetization is sufficiently strong
—that is to say, if the original deflection is sufficiently large;
for the magnetizing effect on a needle, placed at right angles to
the axis of the galvanometer-coil, is zero, and increases as the
sine of the angle of deflection.       According to Poggendorff,
a needle which is not deflected more than eight or ten degrees
from     its
         zero-point, will return    that point    currents      alter

   The current produced by an electromotive force in a circuit
composed entirely of copper wires joined together by means of
binding-screws may, under certain circumstances, be different from
the current produced by the same electromotive force acting in the
opposite direction.
    Ihave called this phenomenon “unilateral conductivity,” and
I have tried to bring    it into connexion with known facts. The
most   plausible explanation    seemed to me to be, that a thin layer
of air may sometimes intervene between the two wires which
are screwed together.       This explanation has been confirmed by
some experiments.       Other experiments have shown that the ex
planation is insufficient.                I
                                  do not think that the evidence is
sufficiently strong to abandon altogether an explanation which
seems to agree so well with the most characteristic features of
the phenomenon.        Secondary causes may intervene which pre
vent the   phenomenon       from being formed.        suggest the dif     I
fusion of the gases into the wires as such a secondary pheno
menon. Effects which are so unstable, however, are never
explained by a simple set of experiments.           They will only be
satisfactorily explained by a number of observations from dif
ferent experimenters.       It      hope, is,

      HE    simple methods about to be described, of exhibiting the
          chief phenomena of wave-motion, were suggested during
 some experiments lately made by the author on the refraction of
liquid wavest. These experiments consisted in the production
 of waves on the surfaces of two liquids of different densities,
lying side by side: on agitating the surface of either liquid,
 waves were produced which passed from one liquid to the other,
 at the same time undergoing changes in amplitude, length, and
 form of front.      In preparing diagrams to represent these phe
 nomena it became necessary to make drawings of vertical sec
 tions through the two liquids, perpendicular to their line of
separation.
     The appearance presented by the sinuous lines on these dia
 grams immediately suggested that a similar appearance could be
 exhibited by means of waves on flexible cords.             India-rubber
 tubes, variously suspended, and both empty and loaded, were
 tried without satisfactory success; the waves moved too quickly
 to be well observed, and the reflected waves interfered with the
 direct ones.      Further experiments led the author to devise the
 simple apparatus now exhibited, which, however, has been made
to serve for many other illustrations of wave-motion in addition
to those it was at first intended to show.
     The apparatus consists essentially of:—(1) a piece of stout
board about 20 feet long and 9 inches wide, which should be
painted black; and (2) three or four ropes, which must be both
heavy and flexible : the ropes used by builders for securing their
 scaffolding have been found to answer very well, especially if
      ‘.
they have been in use some time. To enable the eye to readily

   By means of this apparatus waves may be produced which
move slowly enough to be readily examined by the eye.        The
chief phenomena of wave-motion which can be shown are as
follows:–
   1. Transmission of a Wave.—One end of a rope, a few feet
longer than the board, is fixed to a hook at the end of the board.
The free end of the rope is then taken in the hand, and, the
the rope being quite slack, a sudden up-and-down movement of
the hand is made. A protuberance is thus formed which moves
very slowly along the rope, presenting the appearance shown in
Plate W. fig. 1*.
   A single up-and-down movement produces a wave consisting
of a crest only, the trough being suppressed by the board;                                                 if,
however, with the rope very slack, the hand            moved        and         be                 up
down very quickly and emergetically,      series     waves, consisting
                                                          a                of
of both crest and trough, are produced (fig. 2).

        the ropes are held        the hand, with the finger between

loaded   rope is required. That now used has strung upon it a
number of rings of lead cut from a leaden water-pipe; these
are placed about 6 inches apart, and are covered with india
rubber bands to prevent their making unpleasant noise. The
loaded and an unloaded rope are laid on the board side by side,
and fixed at one end. Then, taking care the tension is equal
in the two ropes, waves are simultaneously generated on them,
as before described.     It is then observed that the wave on the
loaded  rope  lags considerably  behind the other (fig. 4). By suffi
ciently tightening the loaded rope the velocity of        waves may                         its
 be made equal                to,   or

with their amplitudes and differences                 phase.     Now Helm of

   “The mathematical possibility, established by Fourier, of de
composing any sonorous motion into simple vibrations, cannot
authorize us to conclude that                          this is the only admissible mode

essentially real. The fact that                         the ear effects that decomposition,
induces one, nevertheless, to                          believe that this analysis has a

   The slight improvement of the physical side of Hamilton's
method stands far from the high degree at which these analytical
investigations have arrived. An essential peculiarity of it con
sists in this—that it passes from a given motion of the system
of points to another in a similar manner to that in which La
grange's process passes from one configuration of the points to
another. The primary function, a definite integral which is ex
tended over the original motion, undergoes an alteration by the
variation of the arbitrary constants of the motion; and this va
riation, or that of a similar integral representing the expenditure
of the force, is given by Hamilton's symbolic equations of mo
tion.    Hence Hamilton's method differs, secondly, from La
grange's (in which the force-function changes according to the
elements of the given motion) in the same way as the variation
differs from the differentiation of the functions. This second
aspect of it could not but lead immediately to a new treatment
of the perturbations, which has by Hamilton, Jacobi, and Sche
ring been developed into a series of new systems of perturbation
formulae.     Only the above-mentioned application of the variation
of the motion, which is in principle only a particular way of re
presenting the latter, is not the essential of the new view; that
must much rather be sought in similar principles to those on
which the ordinary differential equations of the mechanical pro
blem are based.            It
                         is true that one signification of these prin
ciples, the representation of individual integrals, does not here
come into consideration in the indicated general process of inte
gration; their physical meaning, however (independent of the
other), which was proved most evidently in the proposition of
the    vis
         viva, especially with the generality given               Helm       to   it    by

278            Prof.     J. J.     Müller      on a Mechanical       Principle
dinates; and this function is nothing else but the above-defined
primary function of the system. This peculiarity gives to the
primary function a real signification similar to that obtained by
the force-function in the potential energy, and makes the coor
dination between the principle of energy and the new proposi
tion still more evident.
   If this proposition was the general principle at which those
investigations of the theory of heat aimed, it must have included
as a special case the second proposition of that doctrine, in the
 same way as the principle of energy included the first.   In this
relation it is remarkable that, applied to the mechanical theory
 of heat, it leads direct to the second main proposition as soon as
we make the apparently indispensable supposition that the tem
perature of bodies is proportional to the vis viva of their mole
cular motion.     Corresponding to this, the principle seems also
capable of a series of further applications like those of the prin
ciple of energy; those which will be here given, however, are
limited to the case belonging to the theory of heat.
   The proposition cited resulted from the combination of two
long-known mechanical equations.          Hamilton, namely, had
given his equations of motion both in reference to the function
 V and in reference to the function W; and the separate results
needed only to be combined, in order at once to furnish the new
one.    It would be obtained in the most general form by intro
ducing the integral elements generalized in the sense of Lip
schitz and Schering. As, however, the essential point was                              its
application     real physical motions, and
                    to                         had        presented

292              Prof.   J. J.   Müller on a Mechanical Principle
  Of the applications of the proposition of the action, those shall
be introduced here which can be made of it in the mechanical
theory of heat.     If heat be conceived as molecular motion, the
application to it of the Energy proposition leads immediately to
the first main proposition of this doctrine.        Corresponding to
this, we are now investigating what, on the same hypothesis,
results from the Action theorem.        These molecular actions are
stationary motions of a system of points; and the simplest case
of such motions is obviously that in which           the points move        to all
in closed   paths, and with    period common
                                         a               them.   This            all   of
shall first       be
               supposed.
   As, for closed paths, the two limits          the integral which        of
forms the action    coincide, when the  integration     extended over                is
an entire revolution we obtain
                                 _x 3W.                                -[º]J.T."

 motion designated heat, making use at the same time of the hy
pothesis  that the temperature is proportional to the vis viva of
the  motion,  we arrive (as Boltzmann, Clausius, and Ledieu have
shown) easily at the second proposition of the mechanical theory
of heat. In general, however, the motion of the molecules of a
body does not take place in closed paths. With respect to fluids,
for example, we are not even justified in assuming for them a
fixed mean position; and in the case of solids, where such an
assumption is indeed necessary, the actual motion will yet be
distributed along             all
                       the dimensions.     Now, for such cases Clau

                   By FREDERIck GUTHRIE *.
Mr.            ELLIOTT have constructed for me a galvano
        meter which will, I believe, be found to possess for some
purposes certain advantages over those at present in use.      Its
          depends upon the measurement of the current-strength
 y the measurement of the mechanical force necessary to bring
to a given distance of one another two electromagnets, which
are excited by the current in such a fashion that they repel one
another.
   The current enters at a by the screw-clamp ; thence it passes
beneath the circular wooden stand C along the copper wire a b.
It rises vertically and coils round a soft iron mass f, which lies
horizontal and tangential to the axis of the instrument. It
passes down and across the centre of the board, then rises and
coils round a soft iron mass f", exactly similar and similarly
placed to <U+017F>, but on the opposite side of the instrument. Having
encircled f', the current-bearing wire again descends, and carries
a mercury-cup g, through whose bottom it passes, and which is
exactly in the axis of the instrument.     The current then leaves
the mercury by the wire i, which dips into                 it.   It
                                                       then traverses
the wire around the iron,      m. Thence     crosses the instrument
                                                 it

reasoning   and expression; nor will they, making due allowance
for the difficulty of the undertaking, be in any way disappointed.
It is not an easy task to teach even the first principles of me
chanics to those of whom only a knowledge of Arithmetic, a little
Geometry, a few rules of Mensuration, an aptitude in the use of
compasses, scale, and protractor, and enough Algebra to solve a
simple equation are demanded.        Yet the author has performed
this task in a manner which shows that with him teaching is an
art of which he is an accomplished master. It is true that now
and then he is obliged to omit or postpone the proofs of certain
important theorems which involve a knowledge of Geometry and
Trigonometry not possessed by beginners.            In the parallelo
       of forces (art. 37), for instance, the student is told to find
the resultant by construction.      That the resultant is the diagonal
of a parallelogram  of which the two given forces are adjacent sides,
is assumed to be true—the reason of the rule being given in a sub
sequent chapter (137), to which, however, no clue is given.       And
this seems a suitable place, in our notice of Mr. Twisden's book,
for remarking that a work containing so much matter (far more
than at first sight appears) ought certainly to be furnished with a
copious index.
   That the centre of gravity of a triangle is the intersection of the
three straight lines which join the vertices to the middle points
of the opposite sides, is a proposition also given without proof
(art. 18), showing that the little Geometry which Mr. Twisden
requires of his readers does not even extend to the proof of so simple
a theorem.     In art. 18 (b) we are told that “any area may be
conceived to be made up of a number of parallel straight lines,”
a conception which must be inconsistent with the young geo
meter's notion of a straight line. By use of the principle of limits
in finding the centre of gravity of the surface of a triangle, this
inconsistency would certainly be avoided.
   The book consists of eight chapters, the first five of which are
made as simple as possible.     Each chapter is followed by a collec
tion of excellent questions, not less than four hundred altogether
being given in this manner. Besides, nearly two hundred complete
solutions of useful and interesting problems are scattered through
out the book, invaluable to those who study without a teacher.
   There are also Tables of Specific Gravities, Moduli of Elasticity,
Tenacities, and Resistances to Compressions.
   We recommend the book to the notice of that numerous class
for whom it is specially intended—those who must know mechanics
and yet possess but little mathematical knowledge—to Students, as
being suitable to the curriculum of the University of London, and
to   all
      Teachers,     on

developments   ofthe most   important  parts of the subject,

far inferior quality to Euclid's : this is no more than might be ex
pected; but we will give an instance of what we mean.         Euclid's
treatment of the Corollaries to the 32nd prop. of Book 1 is not, per
haps, wholly proof against minute criticism; still if any thing be
wanting it could be supplied by a word or two of explanation;
and surely nothing can be plainer or more direct than his method.

maticians regard the former as the correct answer to the above
question. There is not much difficulty in believing that we are
born into the world with minds so constituted that as soon as we
know the meaning of words we cannot do otherwise than hold that
things equal to the same thing are equal to one another; but no
one except a hardened metaphysician could suppose that a belief of
the 12th axiom is produced by anything but an acquaintance with
the actual properties of space.             Accordingly many wish to substi
tute for it something which is more “self-evident,” i.e. something
more consonant with their metaphysical views.
    It is not easy to see, on other grounds, what advantage is gained
by substituting one axiom for another.                No one has any difficulty
 in  understanding      what the 12th axiom        means,   nor in seeing that it
is undoubtedly true.          If  any one will prove the converse of pro
position 27 without assuming more than the first eleven axioms
and the first 27 propositions, he will do something worthy of all
honour.       But when the question is to prove the point by means of
a   special   axiom which differs from Euclid's our interest in the
matter is but small.          e. g.   If  any one prefers Playfair's axiom to
Euclid's we do not know          why    he should not; only we would remark
that it is    merely   a question     of preference, that the two axioms are
                                                         #.
quite coordinate with each other, and that if either is taken for
granted the other can be immediately proved.
    Mr. Cuthbertson, however, takes a                        view from this, and
he   goes   to work to improve        upon    Euclid as follows:–On p. 33 he
gives “Deduction G,” viz.               “If points be taken along one of the
arms of an angle farther and farther from the vertex, their dis
tances [meaning, as explained, perpendicular distances] from the
other arm will at length be greater than any given straight
line.”     It is obvious that this statement as it stands is not true;
however, the needful correction could be supplied without much
difficulty; e. g. it would be sufficient for present purposes for it to
run,   “If    points be taken at equal distances &c.,” and this is appa
rently what is meant. Further, the demonstration of the deduction
assumes that any angle however small can be multiplied until an
angle is     ...'greater         than aright angle. We have no objection
to this   being    assumed,     only   to   its
                                              being assumed implicitly.          In
book which        formally    specifies    the axioms assumed,          ought
                                                                        it            to a
                                                      34 an
have been      separately    enunciated          as axiom    and we cannot find
                                                                   ;
that this has been done. On                     p. Mr. Cuthbertson gives the
axiom which     he    proposes     to substitute for Euclid's 12th axiom, viz.
“If    one    straight   line    be drawn        the same plane
                                                 in                     as

cannot first recede from and then              approach       the other, neither
                                                                   to

can      first approach     to and then recede from the other           the same
 sideof it it.” By means         of this axiom and deduction G,          succeeds
in   proving Playfair's axiom.             In other words    (putting  accidental
defects out    of   the question),         he
                                            succeeds      proving one axiom

 assuming two. We willingly accord                 this the praise
                                                      to              ingenuity;

    We had marked for notice our author's way of treating the
subject of proportion; but our limits will not allow us to fulfil our
intention. We will only say that it seems to us a feasible way of
treating the subject (in the same manner as his treatment of paral
lels is feasible); but as to     being           its

                           cannot account for what is described and
drawn in  enclosed,              I
                      hasten to place the same before you, intending
to look for the white lines in question so soon as I move down to
a lower altitude.    Amongst others, no doubt Kirchhoff closely ex
amined the   region in question, without notice of the lines; and this
only adds to my perplexity, unless what                            I
                                              see here is due (1) to
altitude, or (2) is instrumental. In the latter case       cannot ac                       I
count for the absence of the white lines at Dehra, where           ex                                  I
amined the spectrum generally several times;      must, however, add        I
that without close examination and some experience, the lines
might easily be passed over. But if instrumental, to what are they
due?        I
           very much regret that the old spectroscope is not avail
able at present            [it

begun at the red end, until on arrival at the region aboutb my atten
tion was attracted by the fact that K 1657-1 by no means appeared
as the strong line depicted in Kirchhoff's map, Plate      II.  On ex
amining this region carefully,    I
                                  was  surprised to find the colourless
lines shown in the diagram; these lines, from want of a more ap
propriate name, Ishall call white lines (or spaces); they cannot ab
solutely be described as bright lines, yet they closely resemble
threads of white floss silk held in the light. The spectroscope in
use, with the most convenient highest-power eyepiece, presents
images of about two thirds to seven ninths of those drawn in the
diagram; the former are exaggerated by reckoning to agree with
ICirchhoff's millimetre scale; it will therefore be readily understood
that the white lines do not present striking objects in the spectro
scope, especially about the time of sunset, when       Ihappened first
to notice them; they are best seen about noon, when their resem
blance to threads of white floss silk is very close; but once seen,
the lines in question can always be readily detected.      So far as m
instrumental means permit, the wider line extends between
1657-1 and K 16583; more accurately speaking, it falls short of
the latter and rather underlies the former; the narrower white line
is underneath K 1650.3, sensibly more of the former appearing
beyond the edge towards violet of the latter, which presents the
quaint look of a black line on a white surface enclosed in a green
band. These are the only white lines in the spectrum from extreme
red to F; they are not bright (or reyersed lines), so far as     I
                                                              have
had opportunity to judge.    Were they bright lines, the question
would arise, why these alone should be reversed at 6700 feet above
sea. Like the black lines the white lines grow dim and disappear
with the slit opened wide. As seen here, K 1657-1 is sensibly
weaker than K 1667.4, whereas Kirchhoff assigns 5 b to the former
and only 3 a to the latter.

Joseph Warren Zambra.
   The Fellows of the Royal Society are perfectly aware of the
assistance afforded by Her Majesty's Government (at the request
of the Royal Society) for the purpose of deep-sea investigations,
and have been made               with their results by the Reports
of those investigations published in the ‘Proceedings of the Royal
Society’ and by the interesting work of Professor Wyville Thom
son. Among other subjects, that of the temperature of the sea at
various depths, and on the bottom itself, is of the greatest import
ance. The Fellows are also aware that for this purpose a peculiar
thermometer was and is used, having              its
                                              bulb protected         by   an
outer bulb  or casing,   order that     its
                                        indications may not     viti

ated  by the pressure of in
                         the water    various depths, that pressure

    1. “Observations on some features in the Physical Geology of the
 Outer Himalayan region of the Upper Punjab, India.”              By A. B.
 Wynne, Esq., F.G.S.                -
    The district of the Upper Punjab described by the author con
 sists of crystalline, granitoid, syenitic, and schistose rocks far in
 among the hills, succeeded by slates and limestones, possibly of
 Silurian age, unconformably overlain by Triassic and perhaps older
 rocks, which are in their turn unconformably succeeded by a series
 of mutually conformable Jurassic, cretaceous, and nummulitic lime
 stones and shaly beds. These secondary and Tertiary beds, which are
 chiefly limestones, are called the “Hill Limestones.”        Beyond these
 comes a zone of hills and broken     plains, composed of sandstones, clays,
 and  conglomerates,   of  great  thickness and of   Tertiary  age (Eocene
 and Miocene), which the author calls the “Murree beds.” This belt
 passes generally along the whole southern foot of the Himalayas,
 from Assam to Afghanistan.            In the district described by the
 author it is bounded on the south by the Salt Range, beyond which
 stretch the deserts of the Punjab and Sind.
    The outer Tertiary belt presents a gradation towards the hill
 character.    Among the rocks of the Murree zone there are harder
 beds than elsewhere; limestones occasionally appear, sometimes
 like those of the hill-beds, and the Hill Nummulitic limestones may
 have alternated in their upper part with the Murree beds.              The
 nummulitic limestones of the Salt Range, containing large Bivalves
 and Gasteropoda, were probably of shallow-water origin, whilst the
 diminutive organisms of the Hill Nummulitic limestone inhabited
 greater depths.
    Contortion of the strata is a common feature of the country,
 affecting solue of the newest Tertiary beds so as to place them in a
 vertical position, and almost everywhere throwing the rocks into
 folds, producing in many cases inversions of the strata.
    The author compares these rocks with those of the Simla area
 described by Mr. Medlicott, who found there two strong uncon
 formities, namely, between his Siwa'ik and Nalum, and Nalum and
 Subathu groups, and regarded the whole of the beds of the outer
 Tertiary detrital zone from the base of the Subathu group upwards
 as discordant to the Himalayan or Hill-series and to each other.
    The junction of the newer Tertiaries with the rocks forming the
higher hills of the outer Himalaya, both in the Simla area and in the
outer Punjab, is marked by disturbance, distortion, and inversion or
abnormal superposition in the Tertiary strata along the contact.

           Mode of Occurrence of Diamonds in South Africa.           311
In    the Upper Punjab the junction follows a curved line, running
nearly east and west to the north of Rawul Pindee; then de
scribing an angle which closely follows the great bend of the Jhilam
river near Mozufferabad, it runs more or less in a south-easterly
direction through Kashmere towards Simla.           This junction line is
inseparably connected with the causation of the great mountain
chains; it shows a parallelism to the axes of the outer ranges, and
is chiefly due to intensity of disturbance, the result of lateral
pressure.
     The author also refers to the difference existing between the
geology of the outer Himalayan region and that of the Salt Range,
as being similar to that which obtains between the Alpine and
 extra-Alpine characters of European rock-groups, and suggests that
 the recurrence of such similar features at such distances may indi
 cate a connexion between the former conditions of deposition and
 the early history of the great chains themselves.
     2.  “On   the mode of occurrence of Diamonds in South Africa.”
        E. J.  Dunn, Esq.     Communicated by Prof. Ramsay, F.R.S.,
 #..P.G.S.
     In this  paper the author stated that the diamonds of South Africa
 occur in   peculiar circular areas, which he regards as “pipes,” which
 formerly constituted the connexion between molten matter below
 and surface volcanoes. The surrounding country consists of horizontal
 shales, through which these pipes ascend nearly vertically, bending
 upwards the edges of the shales at the contact. The rock occupying
  these pipes was regarded by the author as probably Gabbro,           al
  though in a very altered condition.     Intercalated between the shale
 beds there are sheets of dolerite &c.; and dykes of the same rocks
  also intersect the shales at frequent intervals.      Within the pipes
  there are unaltered nodules of the same dolerite.       With regard to
  the relation of the diamonds to the rock of the pipes in which they
  are found, the author stated that he thought it probable that the
  latter was only the agent in bringing them to the surface, a large
  proportion of the diamonds found consisting of fragments. At
  the same time he remarked that each pipe furnished diamonds of a
  different character from those found in other pipes.

      1. “The Origin of some of the Lake-basins of Cumberland.”
  —First Paper. By J. Clifton Ward, Esq., F.G.S., Assoc. R.S.M.
      After referring to the fact that the question of the origin of lake
  basins cannot be satisfactorily discussed unless the depth of the
   lakes and the heights of the mountains are brought before the
   mind's eye in their natural proportions, the author sketched out the
  physical geography of the lakes under discussion (Derwentwater,

Bassenthwaite,        Buttermere, Crummock, and Loweswater), and
pointed out what must have been their original size and shape
before they were filled up to the extent they now are. These lakes
were not moraine-dammed, but true rock-basins.                     The belief that
the present Lake-district scenery was the result of the sculpturing
 of atmospheric powers, such as we see now in operation, varied by
 climatal changes and changes in the height of the district above the
sea, was enforced, and the opinion given that the work of elabora
tion of the lake-country scenery has been going on ever since Car
boniferous or pre-Carboniferous times.                 The lake-hollows repre
 sented almost the last        rock-shavings       removed by Nature's tools.
What were the        special tools  producing    these hollows?       There being
no evidence of their         production     by  marine action or by running

   2. “On the Traces of a Great Ice-sheet in the Southern part of
the Lake-district and in North Wales.”     By D. Mackintosh, Esq.,
F.G.S.
  In   this paper the author brought forward the evidence which
seems to him to establish the existence in the southern part of the
Lake-district of a “valley-ignoring and ridge-concealing ice-sheet.”
With regard to ice-marks, he distinguished between primary striae
and those produced at a subsequent period, and stated that in the
Lake-district the direction of the primary striae generally coincides
with that of the action by which roches moutonnées have been pro
duced. He gave a table of thc direction of ice-marks observed by
him in the district under notice, and stated that about Windermere
and Ambleside the general direction is nearly N.N.W., round Gras
mere between N.W. and N.N.W., north-west and west of Grasmere
in upland valleys and on high ridges about N. 30° W., south of Gras
mere and in Great Langdale N. 35° W., and in the Coniston district
a little W. of N. In many places he recognized an uphill march of
the ice.     He thought that the iceflow producing these marks
might be anterior to the flow from south to north, of which traces
are observed in the northern part of the Lake-district, and that
 itssource was probably        vast mass                        of
                                              ice covering many square

          of                  Far Easdale. The author also referred                                 to
the glaciation     North Wales, some
                         of                the marks      which, observed

                    of

           parallel currents attract one another when they have the
     Twosame direction; they repel each other when their directions
are opposite.”      After enunciating this rule, Ampère believed he
could  immediately    generalize it by extending it to the elements of
the  currents,   to which he applies, whatever may be their relative
direction, the idea of a course in the same or in opposite directions.
Two currents are said to be in the same direction when they both
increase their distance from the foot of the common perpendicular,
or when they both approach it; in the contrary cases they have
different directions.    Adopting this language, it is not accurate to
say that two elements having the same direction attract one the
other; it is not accurate even for parallel elements. As the asser
tion has been reproduced in           the treatises  all physics, and serves                on
as
a     basis for several    important     explanations,      have thought                    I                                        it

he would give some observed facts.”

 EXPERIMENTS         ON   THE DISSIPATION    OF  ELECTRICITY BY FLAMES.
                                BY J. W. FEWKES.
     By means of an electrometer made on the principle of Sir
 William Thomson's quadrant,          I have been able to perform a few
 experiments in relation to the dissipation of small quantities of
 electricity by different kinds of flames.
     These experiments were conducted with such small quantities of
 electricity as could be obtained by rubbing a vulcanite plate six
 inches square with a catskin. The sensitiveness of the electro
 meter to the electricity thus formed was very great. The experi
 ments are given below.
     Experiment 1–An alcohol lamp, carefully insulated, was con
 nected with the electrometer.          The sections of the quadrant to
 which it was attached were then charged by means of the vulcanite
 plate, the opposite sections being at the same time in connexion
  with the earth. The lamp was then carefully lighted.              The spot
  of  light, which had been deflected to the        edge  of the scale by the
  change,    quickly   retured to the zero-point, indicating a quick dissipa
  tion of the    electricity  by the flame.
     Exp. 2.-The same conditions as those in Exp. 1 were observed,
  with the exception that a Bunsen burner was substituted for the
  alcohol lamp. The dissipation of electricity was the same as before,
  i.    took place, as near as could be observed, at the same rate as
  before.
     Exp.    3.-I    then substituted for the Bunsen flame a very fine jet
  of light, obtained by passing the gas through a finely pointed glass
  tube. The results obtained from this experiment indicate that the
  rate of dissipation is in no respect related to the size of the flame.
     Erp. 4.—The end of the wire connected with the quadrant was
  then placed so that when the gas was lighted the wire point would
  be in the flame. The quadrant was then charged and the gas
  turned on without being lighted.          The spot of light had no move
  ment, and gave no sign of any loss of electricity by the quadrant.
  An artificial current of air across the wire point likewise had no
   effect in dissipating the charge.
      Exp. 5.—The end of the wire was then placed in the jet of an
  atomizer, the same conditions being observed as in Exp. 1. The

fine globules of steam and water issuing from the atomizer had no
effect in dissipating the electricity of the quadrant.
  I   also performed two very striking experiments, which seemed
to have some bearing upon this subject. The instruments used
were the same as in the former experiments; and the manipulation
was as follows:—
    Erp, 1–Carefully insulate a wire communicating with the
flame of an       intº
electrometer, and place            point withinits

XLVI.     On the Magnetic Permeability and Maximum of            Magne
   tism of Nickel and Cobalt.       By HENRY A. Rowland,         C.E.”
Soº         time ago a paper of mine on the magnetic permeabi
       lity of iron, steel, and nickel was published in the Philo
sophical Magazine (August 1873); and the present paper is to
be considered as a continuation of that one.            But before pro
ceeding to the experimental results,        I should like to make a few
remarks on the theory of the subject.          The mathematical theory
of  magnetism    and  electricity  is at present  developed in two radi
cally different manners, although the results of both methods of
treatment are in entire agreement with experiment as far as we
can at present see.      The first is the German method; and the
second is   Faraday's,   or the English method. When two mag
nets are placed near each other, we observe that there is a mu
tual force of attraction or repulsion between them. Now, accord
ing to the German philosophers, this action takes place at a dis
tance without the aid of any intervening medium: they know that
the action takes place, and they know the laws of that action; but
there they rest content, and seek not to find how the force tra
verses the space between the bodies.          The English philosophers,
however, led by Newton, and preeminently by Faraday, have
seen the absurdity of the proposition that two bodies can act
upon each other across a perfectly vacant space, and have
attempted to explain the action by some medium through which
the force can be transmitted along what Faraday has called
“lines of force.”

net near                       the Germans would say that the
                   a compass-needle,
action was due in part to two causes—the attraction of the coil,
and the magnetism induced in the iron by the coil. Those who
hold Faraday's theory, on the other hand, would consider the
substance in the helix as merely “conducting” the lines of force,
so that no action would be exerted directly on the compass
needle by the coil, but the latter would only affect it in virtue
of the lines of force passing along           interior, and      there    its                             so

possible for 8 to attain a maximum value so that a should ap
proach to 0, k would be negative, and the substance would then
become diamagnetic for very high magnetizing forces”.        This is
not contrary to observation; for at present we lack the means of
producing a sufficiently intense magnetic field to test this expe
rimentally, at least in the case of iron.   To produce this effect
at ordinary temperatures, we must have a magnetic field greater
than the following—for iron 175,000, for nickel 63,500, and
for cobalt about 100,000 (?). These quantities are entirely be:
yond our reach at present, at least with any arrangement of
solenoids. Thus, if we had a helix 6 inches in diameter and 3
feet long with an aperture of 1 inch diameter in the centre, a
rough calculation shows that, with a battery of 350 large Bun:
sen cells, the magnetic field in the interior would only be 15,000
or 20,000 when the coils were arranged for the best effect. We
might obtain a field of greater intensity by means of electror
magnets, and one which might be sufficient for nickel; but we

putting this in practice. But the results which  have obtained,                            I
though probably influenced in the higher magnetizing-forces by
this heating, are still so novel that they must possess value not
withstanding this defect; for they contain the only experiments
yet made on the permeability of cobalt at ordinary temperatures,
and of iron, nickel, and cobalt at high temperatures.

   In  Table I. are given the results for nickel at about 15°C.,
together with the values of p and k calculated from the formulae
given below the Table. We see that the coincidence is almost
perfect in both cases, which thus shows that the formula which
we have hitherto used for A and u can also be applied to k, at
least within the limit of experiments hitherto made, although it
must at last depart from one or the other of the curves. The

greatest relative error is seen to be in the first line, where $5 is
small: this does not indicate any departure from the curve, but
is only due to the too small deflections of the galvanometer; and
the error indicates that of only a small fraction of a division at
the galvanometer.
   In the calculation of u and k a method was used which may
be of use to others in like circumstances, who have to calculate
a large number of values of one variable from a function which

    On comparing the magnetic curve Table II. with the normal
 curve Table
                           I.,
                  we see that the magnetic curve         nickel bears                             of
 the same relation                is,
                       the normal curve          have  already  found          as   we

 curve for            all
               points before the vertex, but afterwards the two
 coincide.
      Hence           we    sce   that    at   ordinary temperatures                      the magnetic                  pro

330        Mr. H. A. Rowland                      on the    Magnetic Permeability
perties of nickel are a complete reproduction of those of iron on
a smaller scale. But when we come to study the effect of tempe
rature we shall find a remarkable difference, and shall find nickel
to be much more susceptible than iron to the influence of heat.
   In Table III. we have experiments on the permeability of
nickel at a high temperature, the ring being maintained at
220° C. by being placed in a bath of melted paraffin: in this
bath the silk covering of the wire remained quite perfect, but
after many hours became somewhat weak.            After completing
the   experiments   on this and the cobalt    rings, on unwinding
some of them              I
                  found the outside layer quite perfect; but, espe
cially in the smallest ring, the silk on the inside layer was much
weaker, although the insulation was still perfect when the wire
was in place.             I
                   can only account for this by the electric current
generating heat in the wire, which was unable to pass outward
because of the outside layer and also of the pieces of paper
which were used to separate the layers of wire; hence the ring
at high magnetizing-powers must have been at a somewhat
higher temperature than the bath, to an amount which it is im
  ossible to estimate.  It is probable that it was not very great,
  owever; for at this high temperature continued for             it                         #.
requires but little increase of heat to finally destroy the silk.
We can, however, tell the direction of the error.

  I  have not as yet obtained a complete curve of iron at a high
temperature; but as far as have tried, it does not seem to be     I
affected much, at least for high magnetizing-powers.        have,                                                                             I
however, found that the maximum of magnetization          of iron
decreases about 2 per cent. by a rise of temperature from 15°C.
to 222°C., while that of nickel decreases 22.7 per cent.

                               have made with cobalt do not seem
to be so satisfactory as those made with nickel and iron.  There
are some things about them which        cannot yet explain; but as                   I
they are the only exact experiments yet made on cobalt, they
must possess at least a transient value. The difficulties of getting
a good cobalt-curve are manifold, and are due to the following
properties—(1)                           its
                     small permeability, (2)    sensitiveness                                                  its                                     to

   We also see from Table IV. that, at least in this case, the per
 meability of cobalt is less than that of nickel, though we could
 without doubt select specimens of cobalt which should have this
quality higher than a given specimen of nickel. The formula
 at the foot of the Table also shows, by the increased value of
the coefficient of k in the right-hand member, that the diameter
 of the curve is much less inclined to the axis of § in this case
 than in the case of nickel or iron.     In this respect the three
 metals at  present  stand in the  following order—cobalt, nickel,
iron. This is the inverse order also of their permeability; but
at present         I
               have not found any law connecting these two, and
doubt if any exact relation exists, though as a general rule the
value of the constant is greater in those curves where the per
meability is least.   .
    In a short abstract in the ‘Telegraphic Journal,’ April 1,
1874, of a memoir by M. Stefan, it is stated “that the resist
ance of iron and nickel to magnetization is at first very great,
then decreases to a minimum value, which is reached when the
induced magnetic moment is become a third of           maximum.”                              its

     In Table
            W. we have the results for cobalt in the magnetic
state. We here find the same effect of magnetization as we have
before found for iron and nickel.
     In Table VI,we have results for cobalt at a high temperature,
and see how  greatly the permeability is increased by rise of tem
perature, this being for the vertex of the curve about 70 per
cent. But on plotting the curve I was much surprised to find
an entire departure from that regularity which I had before
found in                 all
             curves taken from iron and nickel when the metal
was homogeneous.     At present am notable         account for this,

 experiment,   but illustrates what extremely small changes will
 affect the permeability  of any metal.
    We have now completed the discussion of the results as far
 as they refer to the magnetic permeability, leaving the discus
 sion of the temporary and permanent or residual magnetism to
 the future, although these latter, when discussed, will throw
 great light upon the nature of the coercive force in steel and
 other metals.   The whole subject seems to be a most fruitful
 one, and            I
             can hardly understand why it has been so much neg
 lected.             It
              may have been that a simple method of experiment
 was not             known; but if so,                    I
                                 believe that my method will be
found both accurate and simple, though it may be modified to
suit the circumstances.   Professor Maxwell has suggested to me
that it would be better to use rods of great length than rings,
because that in a ring we can never determine       actual mag                                its
netization, but must always content ourselves with measuring

in which a is the mean radius of the ring, R the radius of the
section, n' the number of coils in the helix, and i the intensity
of the current. Now in integrating this before, I assumed that
A was a constant throughout the section of the ring: now we
have found that p is a function of the magnetization, and hence
a function of the magnetizing-force; but the latter varies in dif
ferent parts of the section, and hence u must vary.       But the
correction will be small, because the average value will be nearly
the same as if it were a constant. We may estimate the correction
in the following manner.      Let u and $5 be the values of those
quantities at any point in the section of the ring, u' and @' the
values at the centre of the section, and u, and Ø, the observed
values.       Then, by Taylor's theorem,

    G is a galvanometer, the resistance of which was 2477 mer
cury units;        I  is the induction-coil within which the rotating
magnet is placed; C is a commutator; E a Daniell’s cell.
     It is seen by the diagram that only a small part of the perma
ment current passed through the galvanometer, as the resistance
of the wire a b was very small compared with the resistance of the
galvanometer.           The experiments were conducted in the following
WaW     :—
     #.  The rotating magnet was first left fixed in a certain posi
tion, and the first deflection produced by E was measured.                              It
was found that this deflection was the same in whatever position
the magnet was fixed; and we may therefore conclude that the
reaction on the current of the magnetization                           produced by the
 current was too small to be observed.                      The     magnet      was set in
rotation now after contact had been broken at c; and when the
 needle in G had come to rest again, which was done in a very
 short time (the galvanometer having a strong logarithmic decre
 ment), the first deflection produced by E was measured.                                 It
 was found that the first deflection was always larger when the
magnet rotated. The following is a series of observations which
 I  take at random out of my laboratory book.

                                                          Table shows
 that the difference in the first deflection which is observed ac
 cording as the magnet rotates or not, is sensibly proportional
                                                                     to
 the strength of the permanent current. The first column gives
 the first deflection observed when the magnet was not rotating;
 the second column gives the difference in the deflection when
 the magnet rotated; and the third column gives the ratio of the
 numbers given in the first two columns. The numbers given in
 the third column are as nearly constant as could be expected.
 The chief error of observation is caused by the difficulty of keeping
 the rotation of the magnet constant             sufficient length   for   a                              of

than it had been before.          The electrical vibrations were, of
course, much stronger now ; but each of them taken separately
would have produced about the same deflection of the galvano
meter.     The galvanometer had no damping-arrangement. The
needle, therefore, never was entirely at rest; and, accordingly,
the first deflection could not be measured.      Five successive elon
gations were taken, and the position of rest calculated from these
elongations. As the observations necessarily extended over a
much greater length of time, they were less accurate. The result
is given in the following Table. The first column gives the first
deflection observed when the magnet was not rotating;             the
second column gives the ration of the difference in the first de
flections to the first deflection observed when the magnet was not

                 III.      Discussion   of Eaperiments.
  We shall have to discuss now whether these experiments can
be explained in any simple way or by any known causes.    At
first sight three possible explanations suggest themselves; and
we have to see whether one of them, or several of them taken
together account satisfactorily for the different experiments,
before we assume that we have to do with a new set of pheno
mena.     We might assume:–
    1. That the electrical vibrations affect the electromotive force
of the battery;
   2. That the electrical vibrations affect the magnetism of the
galvanometer-needle     so as to increase the deflection of the per
manent current;
   8. That the permanent current affects the magnetism of the
rotating magnet in such a way as to increase                its
                                                         momentum
while the current      one direction      passing, and       to
                   in in
                                          is              decrease    it
while the current    the opposite direction  passing.   The two
                                                       is
opposite currents induced      theby
                                   magnet   would therefore not
counterbalance each other, but one would      stronger than the
                                                       be
other.

344     Dr. A. Schuster's Eaperiments on Electrical Vibrations.
     We shall discuss these cxplanations in their order.
   1. The explanation given under 1 does not at first sight seem
unlikely. We do not know how these electrical vibrations affect
the polarization of the battery. They might decrease it for                                                 all
 we know, and thereby cause the phenomena which              have                                 we
observed.         In

                                     to        experimentally, the
apparatus was disposed     indicated    the following diagram:

put into the circuit     the battery. The strength
                                     of                    the elec                      of
trical vibrations  passing through  the   battery was therefore now
about 1700 times        great    as
                                  before.   We should expect the
                                                    as
effect  to    much stronger now

of  the electrical vibrations     the battery. As, however, the

deflection was exactly the same now whether the magnet rotated
or not,      we
            may safely conclude that this explanation   not the                              is
correct one.               do

                  I                                      is
that electrical vibrations            not affect the polarization                                           of
the  battery.    On the    contrary,    think     would       important it          be                      to
make more careful experiments

   Additional experiments to prove the impossibility of accounting
for the effect by bilateral deflection were made. The needle was
deflected by permanent magnets placed near the galvanometer.
The relative position of the galvanometer-needle to the axis of
the coil was therefore changed; and this was done in such a way
that bilateral deflection, instead of increasing the deflection,
would tend to diminish         As, however,    this case the deflec

in consequence.    While the north pole moves from c to d, the
temporary magnetism dies away again, and thereby strengthens
the current in b d. The consequence of this reaction of the
magnetization on the current is that the maximum of magneti
zation does not take place when the north pole is at c, but only
after it has passed c. Similarly the minimum does not take
place when the north pole is at a, but only after it has passed a.
The induction-shock is therefore stronger while the north pole
of the rotating magnet moves from c to a than while it moves
from a to c. The two induction-shocks are not of equal strength,
but the direction will have the upper hand in which the perma
nent current goes.    A phenomenon similar to the one observed
would therefore take place.     We have therefore to settle the
question whether this effect would be sufficiently strong to pro
duce any visible effect. This could best be done experimentally.
While    I was engaged with these experiments    I  did not think
of this retardation of the maximum of       magnetism,    to which
my attention has since been drawn      by Professor Kirchhoff.    I
can therefore, unfortunately, offer no direct evidence on the
               I
subject; but hope to be able to show that it is extremely un
likely, and even next to impossible, that the phenomenon is due
to the cause just described.    The strongest argument which      I
can offer regarding this point is this:—The magnetism induced
by the permanent current must have been much weaker than
the magnetism induced by the earth. The temporary magnetism
induced by the earth did not, however, affect the experiments;
      I
and conclude therefore that magnetism induced by the current
did not affect the experiments.
   That the magnetic force of the current was weaker than the
magnetic force of the earth is shown as follows:–The tangent
of the deflection of the galvanometer-needle       never exceeded
0-2. This is therefore the ratio of the     magnetic   force of the
current on the galvanometer-needle to the retaining force, which,
as the needle was astatic, was much weaker than the earth's
horizontal force.  The magnetic force of the current on the gal
vanometer-needle   must have been much stronger than that on
the rotating magnet, as the resistance of the galvanometer was
2477 and that of the induction-coil only 30, the wires being about
the same thickness. It follows that the magnetizing force of
the current on the rotating magnet was much weaker than the
magnetizing force of the earth. As the induction-coil was used
in various positions, and no effect dependent upon that position
was ever observed,  I conclude that the effect of the earth’s   in
duction was too small to be observed, and consequently that
the permanent current could not have produced any sensible
alteration in the magnetism of the rotating magnet.

  Dr. A. Schuster's Experiments on Electrical Vibrations.                347
   Many other observations agree with this conclusion. When,
for instance, the galvanometer of small resistance was employed,
a current about eighty times stronger passed through the induc
tion-coil than when the usual galvanometer was used. It should
be expected that if the effect were due to a magnetization of the
magnet, it would be stronger in that case, if not eighty times,
perhaps thirty or forty times.  Yet the effect was hardly stronger
than  before,  sometimes even not quite as strong.     The nume
rical results obtained give additional evidence against the expla
nation which we have just discussed.
                 IV.   Two possible Eaplanations.
   As we cannot explain the effect by any known cause, we have
to find another explanation. I can only account in two ways
for the phenomenon which has to be explained; and my experi
ments give no clue as to which of them is the correct explanation.
The first, and perhaps the simplest assumption to be made, is
that Ohm’s law is not rigidly correct.   Ohm’s law says that the:
resistance which a wire offers to an electric current going through
it is independent of the strength of the current.                   I
                                                          shall try to
show now that    my observations can be      explained  by  assuming
that the resistance decreases as the current     increases,  but that
the deviation from Ohm's law would be so small that it would
not have been found out by any of the usual methods of veri
fying Ohm’s law. Suppose the electromotive force of the rota
ting magnet to be +e in one direction and                      -e
                                                       in the other
direction, and that the electromotive force sending the perma
ment current through the galvanometer-circuit is +2a.         If the
permanent current and the electrical vibrations go, through the
circuit at the same time, we have a current the electromotive
force of which is a +e, counterbalancing another current the elec
tromotive force of which is a —e.   If the resistance for both cases
is equal to r, we have as the resultant current affecting the           galva
mometer-needle
                         a   +e        w—e       22.
                             7"            7"        r
We should therefore have the same effect as if only the perma
ment current went through the circuit.

     If,   therefore,           dr     be

It is assumed that this electromotive force is proportional to
the rate of increase of the current; so that, if that rate is a
negative quantity, an electromotive force in the same direction is
set up.   If we could imagine some state of things so that this

THEtained  in Part I. in the September      Number, have prepared
the way for a direct solution on hydrodynamical principles of
the problem of the action of a galvanic coil on a small magnetic
needle, which         I

numbered in continuation of those of the first.
   43. From the reasoning contained in arts. 24–38 it has been
concluded that the motion of a galvanic current along a uniform
conductor whose axis is a complete circle, and whose transverse
section is a small circle of given radius, consists of circular
motion parallel to the axis and of circular motion about the
axis in transverse planes, the result being spiral motion, which,
as shown in art. 42, may either be dextrorsum or sinistrorsum.
A rectilinear axis being supposed to be drawn at right angles to
the plane of the circular axis of the conductor through      centre,                                its

sists of.    But it is evident that the motion of the current
parallel to the axis of the conductor has no effect in determining
the angular position of the magnet, inasmuch as it cuts the plane
in which the magnet is compelled to move at right angles.
Also the small secondary motions generated by the reaction of
the atoms against the portion of the current which flows in the
interior of the conductor, if they should be of sensible amount,
would have no tendency to cause vibrations of the magnet,
because the aggregate directive effects of those on the opposite
sides of the plane of vibration would be just equal and opposite.
It remains only to consider the effect of the circular motions
about the conductor in planes perpendicular tothe plane of itsaxis.
   45. Now these motions will have a directive effect on the
magnet   in two ways, which will require separate considerations.
First, the angular position of the magnet will be determined in
part, and in a direct manner, by the circular motions about the
two opposite points of intersection of the axis of the conductor
by the transverse plane passing through the centres of the mag
met and of that axis.   If A and B be these points and P be the
given point, these motions, being in the same direction about
the axis of the conductor, will be in opposite directions about
the points A and B, and, according to the law stated in art. 43,
will vary inversely as the squares of the distances AP and BP.
Hence it is easy to calculate the sums of the resolved parts of
the velocities in two rectangular directions, one parallel to the
before-mentioned axis through the centre of the conductor, which
will be supposed to be the axis of z, and the other parallel to
the intersection of the plane of the circular axis by the plane
through the axis of 2 and the point P. If we suppose the latter
plane to be coincident with the plane za, the resolved velocities
will be parallel to the direction of the axes of 2 and w. Hence
if 2 be the distance OC of the centre C of the circular axis from
O the origin of coordinates, and if p and q be the coordinates of
P parallel to the axes of z and and          ar,

   It is here supposed that the direction of the motion about the
axis is such that at the centre C, where the two motions have
the same direction, the compound motion is in the positive                                                                         di

354       Prof. Challis on the Hydrodynamical Theory of the
effect; and as the different circles may be assumed to produce
independent effects, there will be in the interior of the coil from
end to end impulses of equal intensity analogous to those which
were supposed in art. 7 to be generated in a magnet by a regular
 gradation of atomic density.       The whole action being symme
trical with respect to the axis of the coil, the impulses may with
close approximation be assumed, for the same reasons as in the
 case of the magnet, to be concentrated         along the axis, sup
 posing the shape of the coil to be that of a hollow cylinder,
and the radii of the interior and exterior surfaces to be small.
     51.  In fact, so far as regards the indirect action now under
 consideration, the hydrodynamical circumstances due to the coil
 are exactly analogous to those due to a magnet, the force of the
 battery performing the part which was attributed to the grada
 tion of atomic density of the magnet.      Consequently the mathe
 matical   investigations contained in the Numbers of the Philoso
 phical Magazine for July 1869 and June 1872, and already ap
 plied in the theory of the magnet given in arts 6–15 of the pre
 sent essay, may with equal reason be applied to the problem of
 the action of a galvanic coil, although in each case the adopted
 solution of the hydrodynamical problem can only be considered
 to be approximately applicable. It suffices, however, for draw
 ing the inference that the galvanic action of a cylindrical coil
 approximates to the action of a cylindrical magnet, which con
 clusion is confirmed by well-known experiments made with
 Ampère's solenoids. Accordingly the formulae obtained in art.
 15 for the directive action of a large magnet on a small magnetic
 needle will be considered to be equally applicable to the action
 of a galvanic coil on the needle, so far, at least, as regards the
 indirect action of the coil.
      52. But experiment     has also shown that there is a decided
  difference between the action of a magnet and that of a coil
 under the same circumstances.          This fact has been specially
  established by the experiments of the Astronomer Royal the
 results of which are given in the Philosophical Transactions,
 vol. clxii. pp. 489–491.      I propose to account for the difference
 by taking into consideration the direct effect of the circular
 motions treated of in arts. 45–47, to which there is nothing cor
 responding in the hydrodynamical circumstances of the streams
 of a magnet. This explanation admits of being supported by
 the following argument.
     From results obtained in art. 15 it appears that if at any point
 P, the coordinates of which in the longitudinal and transverse
 directions are p and q, the directive force of a large magnet of
 length 2l on a small one in the longitudinal direction be Zi, and
 that in the transverse direction be Xi,

of motion are more distant from O in the case of the coil than
in that of the magnet. These inferences from the theory accord
with the results of the experiments mentioned in art. 52.

   Respecting these results, it is first to be noticed that the ob
served and calculated values of a differ so little from each other
(except  in the instances of Nos. 7 and 13, which seem to be
affected by  some incidental errors), that the differences scarcely
exceed what might be attributed to unavoidable errors of obser
vation. It is evident, therefore, that the effect of not taking the
direct action into account must be very small; and          have conse                              I
quently not thought it worth while to employ the calculations
indicated in art. 53 for ascertaining          amount.      The reason   its
that the direct action has comparatively         little effect take             so                           I             to

into account (see art. 52); and in Ampère's theory the same
thing is done by making the hypothesis of a magnetic sheet.
This probably explains why that theory agrees with experiment
in some degree better than the hydrodynamical theory when the
latter does not include the direct action.
   The hydrodynamical theory admits also of the application of
a different arithmetical test, based on the following considera

This equality would be generally true if the ratio of Yi to Y!
were the same as that of X, to X', even if that ratio were differ

   The anomalies here presented by Nos. 7 and 13, taken in
connexion with those in the former comparison, seem to point to
errors concerned with the computing of Y, and observing of X'.
The differences X'—kX, and Y'—ky, between the observed and
calculated forces according to the hydrodynamical theory, and
the differences X'—k'X, and Y'—k'Y, according to Ampère's
theory, are perhaps not greater, when compared with the values
of X" and Y', than might from the circumstances of the observa
tions be expected.           Relative to these differences it may be re
marked, as before, that the hydrodynamical theory, restricted to
the indirect action, does not agree so well with observation as
the theory of Ampère.              The totality, however, of the above com
parisons with the former theory prove that the value of k must
at least be very approximately constant, and so far justify the
theoretical conclusion that for the case of a coil, or a magnet,
reduced to a line of magnetism, that factor is absolutely con
stant,
   But at the same time the foregoing comparisons with Ampère's
theory prove that the factor k' is also very nearly constant,
although there is no à priori reason deducible from that
theory why this should be the case. It is worthy of remark,
too, that the differences between observation and calculation ex
hibited above follow for the most part the same law for both
theories, although they depend on very different processes of
calculation.     I    cannot but regard these circumstances as confir
matory of the views maintained in the foregoing essay, according

    Sir William Thomson on Perturbations of the Compass.           363
to which the received empirical theories of galvanism and mag
metism virtually have for their basis the hydrodynamical theory
of these forces.             -
   I  have not attempted to treat in like manner the other expe
riments the details of which are given in the same memoir,
because my analysis applies exclusively to a cylindrical magnet,
or coil, of the same transverse section throughout. The action
of a large bar-magnet, and that of an iron core in the form of a
bar within a coil, would require very different treatment, on ac
count of the forms not being symmetrical with respect to an axis.
The experiments made with the edge and flat side of the large
bar-magnet turned towards the small magnet showed that the
action depended in some degree on the form presented to the
latter.    I take occasion to mention incidentally that the great
accession of magnetic force which was observed to result from
putting a soft-iron core in the coil is attributable, according to
the hydrodynamical theory, to the transverse circular motions
about the rheophore constituting the coil, which give rise to just
such aetherial streams as are proper for magnetizing.             (See
‘Principles of Physics, pp. 619 & 620.)
   The arguments, and the evidence from numerical comparisons,
which    I  have now adduced, should,      I think, suffice for coming
to the conclusion that galvanic and magnetic forces are modes of
pressure of the aether in steady motion.
XLIX.      On the Perturbations of the Compass produced by the
   rolling of the Ship.     By Sir WILLIAM THoMson, F.R.S.*
      HE “heeling-error,”      which has been investigated by Airy
         and Archibald  Smith,    is the deviation of the compass pro
duced    by  a  “steady heel” (as a constant inclination of the ship
round a longitudinal axis, approximately horizontal, is called).
It depends on a horizontal component of the ship's magnetic
force, introduced by the inclination; which, compounded with
the horizontal component existing when the ship is upright,
gives the altered horizontal component when the ship is inclined.
Regarding only the error of direction, and disregarding the
change of the intensity of the directing force, we may define the
heeling-error as the angle between the directions, for the ship
upright and for the ship inclined, of the resultant of the hori
zontal magnetic forces of earth and ship at the position of the
compass.       These suppositions would be rigorously realized with
the compass supported on a point in the ordinary manner, if the

British Association at Belfast (1874).

364             Sir William Thomson                         on the     Perturbations of the
bearing-point were carried by the ship uniformly in a straight
line. They are nearly enough realized in a large ship to render
inconsiderable the errors due to want of perfect uniformity of
the motion of the bearing-point, if this point is placed anywhere
in the “axis of rolling”*; for in a large ship the compass, how
ever placed, is not considerably disturbed by pitching, or by the
inequalities of the longitudinal translatory motion caused by waves.
Hence, supposing the compass placed in the axis of rolling, the
perturbation produced in it by the rolling will be solely that due
to the variation of the horizontal component of the ship's magnetic
force.   Such a position of the compass would have one great
advantage—that the application of proper magnetic correctors
adjusted by trial to do away with the rolling-error, would per
fectly correct the heeling-error. To              against this advan       set   off
tage there are two practical disadvantages:–one, that the axis                                                     of
rolling (being always below deck) would not                  convenient

Suppose, for example, the period of the rolling to be 6 seconds*
 (or three times the period of the “seconds' pendulum ”); 1 will
be 29 feet (or nine times the length of the seconds' pendulum).
And suppose the compass to be 14% feet above the axis of roll
ing.    We have k= }i (so that the range of apparent rolling                 in
dicated by a pendulum hung from a point in the position of the
bearing-point of the compass is greater by half than the true
 range of the roll). On these suppositions the kinetic-equilibrium
 error amounts to

 About the middle of the British Islands the magnetic dip is 70°,
 and therefore        (being the natural tangent of the dip) is equal
                  à
 to 2-75 nearly.       Hence the kinetic-equilibrium             error for the
 supposed case amounts in this locality to about a degree and
                                                                               -

     In an iron ship the equilibrium value of the rolling-error will
 be approximately the sum of the kinetic error investigated above,
 and a heeling-error found by an investigation readily worked
 out from that of Archibald Smith in the “Admiralty Compass
 Manual” (edit. 1869, Section IV. pages 82–89, and Appendix,
 pages 139–150), with modification to take into account the de
 viation of the apparent level, at the place of the compass, from
 the true gravitation-level.
    I  have used the expression “kinetic-equilibrium                 error” to
 distinguish the error investigated above from that actually exhi
 bited by the compass.         It is exactly the error which would be
 shown by an ideal compass with infinitely short period of vibra
 tion. A light quick needle (either with silk-fibre suspension, or
    * This would  be the case for a ship    of any size exposed to regular waves
 of length 184 feet from crest to   crest, and, if moving through the water,

more than about two seconds, shows the rolling-error very beau

                         have thus found the rolling and pitching
errors so great in a small wooden sailing-vessel that it became
very difficult to make exact observations with the quick compass,
either in the Frith of Clyde or out at sea on the Atlantic unless
when the sea was exceptionally smooth.      The well-known kinetie
theory of “forced oscillations” is readily applied to calculate,
whether for a wooden or an iron ship, the actual “rolling-error”

the lower vertebrates, and there remains but         rudimentary                         a

   Although the homological connexions existing between the
vertebrates and articulates, even when advocated       naturalists,                       by

First, such       apparatus, unless occupying           large proportion

                                                                              a                               of
the volume             insect, would not present surface enough for
                           an
this kind    ofreceptor        vibrations; and secondly, the minute
                                         of
ness  of such     membrane would render
                  a                                 impossible      covibrate

with those sounds which generally occur                  nature, and which    in
the insects themselves can produce. Similarly,                   non-aquatic             all
vertebrates have                an
                           inner ear formed                 bring       so
                                                                   the aërial as    to
vibrations which strike the tympanic membrane                  bear with the             to
greatest effect      the auditory nerve-filaments”; and the minute
                          on
ness  of insects also precludes this condition.           Finally, the hard
test, characteristic       the      of
                                articulates,  sets aside the idea that they
receive the aërial vibrations through the covering              their bodies,             of
like fishes, whose bodies are generally not only larger and far
more yielding, but are also immersed                 water which transmits
vibrations with                44

and with    a yet greater increase         intensity.   inFor these reasons
I  imagine that those articulates which are sensitive             sound and                   to
also emit characteristic      sounds,  will  prove     possess  receptors     to                              of

with the physical conditions necessary for them to receive and
transmit vibrations to the interior ganglia.
   Naturalists, in their surmises as to the positions and forms of
the organ of hearing in insects, have rarely kept in view the im
portant consideration of those physical relations which the
organ must bear to the aërial vibrations producing sound, and
which we have already pointed out. The mere descriptive ana
tomist of former years could be satisfied with his artistic faculty
for the perception of form; but the student of these days can
only make progress by constantly studying the close relations
which necessarily exist between the minute structure of the
organs of an animal and the forces which are acting in the
animal, and which traverse the medium in which the animal
lives.   The want of appreciation of these relations, together
with the fact that many naturalists are more desirous to de
scribe many new forms than to ascertain the function of one
well-known form which may exist in                      animals  all     class,     of   a

ated a row of transparent vesicles containing the same kind of
cuneiform staff-like bodies, mentioned as occurring with the
Acrididae.   The two large trachean trunks of the fore legs open
by two wide infundibuliform orifices on the posterior border of
the prothorax; so that here, as with the Acrididae, a part of this
trachean apparatus may be compared to a tuba Eustachii.
With the Achetidae there is on the external side of the tibia of
the fore legs an orifice closed by a white silvery membrane (tym
panum), behind which is an auditory organ like that just de
scribed.   (With Acheta achatina and italica there is a tympanum

     think that Siebold assumes too much when he states that
the existence of a tympanic membrane is the only test of the
existence of an auditory apparatus.     It is true that such a test
would apply to the non-aquatic vertebrates; but their homolo
gies do not extend to the articulates; and besides, any physi
cist can not only conceive                of,

of the second joint from the tip. These fibrils are highly elastic,
and so slender that their lengths are over three hundred times
their diameters.    They taper slightly, so that the diameter at the
base is to the diameter near the tip as 3 to 2.
  I  cemented a live male mosquito with shellac to a glass slide,
and brought to bear on various fibrils a one-fifth objective. I then
sounded successively, near the stage of the microscope, a series
of tuning-forks with the openings of their resonant boxes turned
towards the fibrils.    On my first trials with an Uta fork of 512
vibrations per second,                I
                            was delighted with the results of the
                             I
experiments; for saw certain of the fibrils enter into vigorous
vibration, while others remained comparatively at rest.

drawn from a horizontal position. On obtaining the ratio of
these numbers, I found that it coincided with the ratio exist

covibrated the fibrils of which these pine-rods were models.

                                    found that it always cut within
5° of the   position of the source of the sound. The antennae of
the male mosquito have a range of motion in a horizontal di
rection, so that the angle included between them can vary con
siderably inside and outside of 40°4; and conceive that this is                        I
the manner in which these insects during night direct their
flight toward the female.      The song of the female vibrates the
fibrillae of one of the antennae more forcibly than those of the
other. The insect spreads the angle between his antennae, and
thus, as I have observed, brings the fibrillae, situate within the
angle formed by the antennae, in a direction approximately pa
rallel to the axis of the body.     The mosquito now turns his
body in the direction of that antenna whose fibrils are most
affected, and thus gives greater intensity to the vibrations of the
fibrils of the other antenna.   When he has thus brought the vi
brations of the antennae to equality of intensity, he has placed his
body in the direction of the radiation of the sound, and he directs
his flight accordingly; and from my experiments it would appear
that he can thus guide himself to within 5° of the direction of
the female.

   The auditory apparatus we have just described does not in the
least confirm Helmholtz's hypothesis of the functions of the
organ of Corti; for the supposed power of that organ to decom
pose a sonorous sensation depends upon the existence of an audi
tory nerve differentiated as highly as the covibrating apparatus,
and in the case of the mosquito there is no known anatomical
 basis for such an opinion.     In other words, my researches show
external covibrating organs whose functions replace those of the
tympanic membrane and chain of ossicles in receiving and trans
mitting vibrations; while Helmholtz’s discoveries point to the
 existence of internal covibrating organs which have no analogy
to those of the mosquito, because the functions of the former
are not to receive and transmit vibrations to the sensory appa
 ratus of the ear, but to give the sensation of pitch and to de
 compose a composite sonorous sensation into          elements; and                        its
this they can only                       do     by

scopical Society,’ entitled “Auditory Apparatus of the Culer
mosquito,” by Christopher Johnston, M.D., Baltimore, U.S.
                               I
    In this excellent paper found clear statements showing that
its talented author had surmised the existence of some of the
physical    facts which my experiments and observations have
established”.     To show that anatomical facts conform to the
hypothesis that the antennal fibrils are the auditory organs of
the mosquito,    I  cannot do better than quote the following from
Dr. Johnston's paper:—
    “While bearing in mind the difference between feeling a noise
and perceiving a vibration, we may safely assume with Carus—
for a great number of insects at least—that whenever true audi
tory organs are developed in them, their seat is to be found in
the neighbourhood of the antennae. That these parts themselves
are in some instances concerned in collecting and transmitting
sonorous vibrations, we hold as established by the observations
we have made, particularly upon the Culer mosquito; while we
believe, as Newport has asserted in general terms, that they serve
also as tactile organs.           Fig. 2.
    “The    male mosquito differs considerably, as is well known,
from the   female,   his body being smaller and of a darker colour,
   * A short time before the death of my friend Professor Agassiz, he wrote
me these words:--" I can hardly express my delight at reading your letter.
I feel you have hit upon one of the most fertile mines for the elucidation
of a problem which to this day is a puzzle to naturalists, the seat of the
organ of hearing in Articulates.”

and his head furnished with antennae and palpi in a state of
greater development (fig. 2). Notwithstanding the fitness of
his organs for predatory purposes, he is timid, seldom entering
dwellings or annoying man, but restricts himself to damp and
foul places, especially sinks and privies. The female, on the
other hand, gives greater extension to her flight, and, attacking
our race, is the occasion of no inconsiderable disturbance and
vexation during the summer and autumn months.
    “The head of the male mosquito, about 0.67 millim. wide, is

found two pyriform capsules nearly touching each other, and
having implanted into them the very remarkable antennae.

a horny substance, and is attached posteriorly by             pedicle,                 its

conclusion that the antennae serve to a considerable extent as
organs of touch in the female; for the palpi are extremely
short, while the antennae are very movable and nearly equal
the proboscis in length.      In the male, however, the length
and perfect development of the palpi would lead us to look for
the seat of the tactile sense elsewhere; and in fact we find the
two apical antennal joints to be long, movable, and compara
tively free from hairs, and the relative motion of the remaining
joints very much more limited.”                                                              -

know, been explained.     It is the same with a gaseous or vaporous
solution. Soda-water, in a chemically clean test-glass, in which
not a bubble of gas is visible, will display a line of bubbles along
the path described with friction by a clean glass, metal, or other
rod, against the inside of the glass below the level of the liquid.
So also, if a glass rod be rubbed against the side of a vessel con
taining a liquid (such as spirits of wine, or a saline solution such
as one of common salt) at or near the boiling-point after the
source of heat has been removed, bubbles of vapour may be libe
rated so abundantly that the liquid may be made not only to
boil, but to boil over.
    A gentle rubbing sometimes fails to convert a friction line into
a bubble line, whereas harder rubbing and a quicker motion
produce the effect. And in general hard bodies are more effica
 cious in producing the result than soft ones.     It is not necessary
 that the friction produce an actual scratching of the surface;
 nor does the track of a bubble line remain more sensitive than
other parts in liberating gas after the first display is over. The
more highly supersaturated or superheated the solution the more
sensitive the surface appears to be, and the smaller the amount
of friction required. Beer gently warmed produces foam by
rubbing the side of the vessel. Or           instead            if,

388     On the Action of Solids in liberating Gas from Solution.
     Mariotte's experiment, differently arranged, forms a good
 illustration for a class.        Over a tall glass cylinder of water is
 suspended a funnel with                       its
                                        beak from 20                            to

 before the water has time                close over it; and
                                                to                     the shot           as

LIII.       On the Surface-Forces caused by the Communication of Heat.
                   By Professor Osborn E REYNoLDs +.
                    before the Royal Society, June 18, I pointed
IN out,paperit read
        a
                seemed to me, that whenever evaporation or con
                as
densation takes place on a surface they are attended with certain
forces tending respectively to drive the surface back and urge it
forward, these forces arising, according to the kinetic theory, from
the momentum which is imparted from the surface to the particles
driven off, and vice versá.                 I
                                also pointed out at the end of the
paper that similar effects will be produced whenever heat is com
municated from a surface to a gas, and vice versä. The possibility
of this latter effect only occurred to me as was on the point of  I
sending off the paper, and consequently was added by way of an
appendix. The first part of the paper contains a description of
some experiments undertaken to verify my conclusions respecting
the forces of evaporation and condensation, the results of which
seem to me to be fully explained by these forces; so that had                                        I
 rewritten the paper after becoming aware of the possible existence
of the other force, I should have had nothing to add in connexion
with these experiments.        I had, however, also endeavoured to
show that the first class of forces afforded an explanation of Mr.
Crookes's experiments; and had this part of the paper been re
written it would have been somewhat altered, as the last class of
forces (those arising from the simple communication of heat)
seem to afford a simpler explanation of some of the phenomena
observed by Mr. Crookes.                    I
                                   regret that this was not done,                                   as,

             of
from other considerations, throw           fresh lightno    the case       on                      in

a long time after the gauge showed half a millimetre.       It was
the results of this experiment which     was endeavouring to ex                 I

                         I
applied; and had not the least intention of implying that these
were the only results which Mr. Crookes obtained.       However,

supposed,           I
             think that he would have forgiven me when he sees
that he has committed a similar offence against me.      He com
mences his remarks on my paper by saying, “In my exhausted
receiver he assumes the presence of aqueous vapour;” whereas
                                                 I
nowhere in my paper do mention any such assumption, nor did
it enter into my head to make      Nay, further, think  have    it.                                 I            I
shown, however darkly, that, under the conditions under which
Mr. Crookes's experiments were made, aqueous vapour would
not       be
        sufficient     explain the results, since
                                  to                  would                                    it                 be   to   all

instance of electric currents being maintained without the consump
tion of power, and in magnets there is no source of power; electric
currents also generate heat, but a magnet is not a heated body.
    If, however, we substitute the view that the phenomena of
attraction and repulsion of magnets are due, not to continuously
circulating electric currents, but (as in electric wires) to definite
directions of molecular structure, such as is shown by the pheno
mena of electrotorsion to really exist in them, the theory becomes
more perfect.    It would also agree with the fact that iron and steel
have the   power   of retaining both magnetism and the electrotor
sional state after the currents or other causes producing them have
ceased.
   According to this view, a magnet, like a spring, is not a                                                source
of power, but only an arrangement for storing it up, the                                                    power
being retained by some internal disposition of its particles     acting
like a “ratchet” and termed “coercive power.” The fact           that a
magnet becomes warm when           variations      its

PRELIMINARY         NOTICE ON A NEW METHOD FOR MEASURING                 THE
       specific     HEAT   of   GASEs.   BY EILHARD wiedEMANN.
   Since the researches made by M. Regnault, no physicist has re
sumed in a thorough manner the study of this important question
—perhaps on account of the complication and large dimensions of
the apparatus to be employed.     Now       I
                                         have succeeded in discover
ing a method which realizes, with means much more simple, an
accuracy as great as that arrived at by M. Regnault with his.
   The gas to be studied is enclosed in a balloon of caoutchouc con
taining about 25 litres kept in an empty balloon of glass by means
of a glass tube fixed in a caoutchouc stopper.   Another tube serves
to put the glass balloon in communication with a second balloon,
which communicates with a reservoir full of water placed 10 feet
above. A manometer gives the pressure in the interior of the
second balloon.      When water is brought from the reservoir into
this  balloon,  the air found there is compressed, and the pressure is
                                               A certain quantity of the
transmitted to the caoutchouc balloon.
gas is thus expelled from the caoutchouc balloon into the
apparatus and the calorimeter.        This quantity can be measured ex
                                                                       idiº
actly by the weight of the water introduced, account being taken
of the temperature and the pressure.
   The heating-apparatus consists of a tube 3 metres long and 9 cen
tims. in diameter, completely filled with copper turnings, and placed
in a leaden tank full of boiling water. The heating of the gas is
complete when 10 litres of it traverse the apparatus per minute.
   The calorimeter is composed of a series of tubes of silver 43 mil
lims. in height and 9 millims. wide, filled with silver turnings, and
successively traversed by the gas.          These silver tubes, three in
number, dip into a cylindrical vessel of silvered copper 54 millims.
in height and 44 millims. in width, full of water. From the rise
of temperature undergone by this water, the equivalent in water of
the vessel and the tubes being known, the quantity of heat given
up by the gas, and       its
                           specific heat, can    be
                                                  deduced.
   To avoid    radiation, arrangements     are made     that the tempera

1.
     INApril       published in the Philosophical Magazine in
               a paper
               1872, attention was called to the meanings attached
to and the facts summed up in modern chemical formulae, and to
some of the connexions and distinctions between these pithy sum
maries of knowledge and certain hypotheses assumed by che
mists to account for the observed facts. The present essay bears
directly on the former and indirectly on the latter of these points,
the primary object being to call attention to the necessity which
exists for a full and complete study of the amounts of energy
involved in chemical changes—a subject of which it may be said
that as yet we are almost unacquainted with even the faintest
outlines of        its
                scope and bearings.

pounds and their constituents are related, viz. that, by the action
of a weight X(w) of some other body or series of
weight X(w) of the compound, a series of weights collectively
                                                             upon a                      §:
equal to X(w-Hw') of new products is formed, precisely the
same weights of the same products respectively being formed
when the weight X(w) of these other bodies acts on the weights
wi, wa, we, ... of the constituents severally.
   In these two cases different amounts of work are gained. If
the work gained by the action of the weight X(w) of the reacting
bodies on the weight X(w) of the compound examined be H
calories, whilst that gained by the action of the weight X(w) of
the reacting bodies on the weights wi, wa, wa, ... of the consti
tuents be H' calories, the affinity of the constituents in the com
pounds is given by the equation
        F=
                   H!   –H           -                      -            -

               TX(w)
   In this way the affinity of the constituents in a compound
may be indirectly determined; in many cases, indeed, this indi
rect method is the only one practicable.
   5. By the conventional use of the terms Combination, Com
pound, Constituent, Affinity, &c., no question is raised or begged
as to whether the constituents are actually present as such in the
compound: they may be bodily present (as a hypothetical atom
of any kind must be bodily present unchanged in qualities in
every molecule into which it may be conceived as entering), or
they may not (the kind of matter of which the compound is com
posed being viewed as homogeneous throughout, and differing
from that of each and                    all
                                  constituents of     its
                                                    the same way                    in
that these differ from one another); the question       not     any                      is        in
way raised         or
               decided     the       by
                               language  used     express   the ob              to
served facts.

                     case, however, experiment
rical connexion  very frequently   exists between the values of the
ratios of the weights of any given pair of constituents in the two
instances.   This same connexion is also noticeable when a pair
of constituents is common to two compounds, whether the other
constituents are severally identical in kind or not. This connexion,
known as the Law of Multiple Proportions, may be thus stated:
If w and we are the weights of any two of the various consti
tuents which jointly form a weight X(w) of any compound,
whilst wi and w', are the weights of the same two constituents

  When       t is above    100, the last term      sa(100–1) becomes
negative.
   15. By means of this formula the values of 26Floo for various
substances given in the following Table (pp. 410,411) are calcu
lated. In several instances the data for the calculation of the
value of H2 are only approximately known; and in some the
value of H, is only estimated as a probable guess.     Inasmuch,
however, as the experimental errors in the determination of the
values of Hi are considerable, and often as large as the value of
H2, a small error in the estimation of the latter does not much
affect the general result.
   The initials affixed to some of the numbers stand for:—

   16. On examination of the affinity-values given in the
Table, it is evident that as any homologous series is ascended
there is usually an increase in the value of 28Floo; and so general
is this rule, that it seems extremely probable that the few excep
tions met with are only apparent exceptions due to experimental
errors in the determination of the values of H1 &c. used in the
calculations. Thus the value for ethylbutyrate (1477) is consi
derably too high, 110-0 being probably near the true value
 (§ 39); whilst that for ethyl formate (92.0) is probably also
rather too high, as a priori the true value may be expected to             lie
between 68-0 and 91-5, the numbers found for methyl formate
and ethyl acetate respectively; probably 86.0            isnear the true
value   (§ 39).      Similarly the value for amylic ether (83.5)           is
probably     alittle too high,       the substance used
                                     as                       by
                                                               Favre and
Silbermann appeared            to
                               contain    a little amylic alcohol, which
 would diminish the value found for H1, and hence increase the
value  of    28
              Floo.    On the other hand, the value for stearic acid
 (1540)   appears    to   beconsiderably too low, suggesting the pro
bability    of
             the   presence     oflittle stearine, &c.
                                    a                    inthe acid used.
The values for amyl acetate and methyl, ethyl, and amyl valerates,
being deduced from one determination          of   H, only     each case,
                                                              in
 can only    beregarded    asapproximations. Of these, the values          of
amyl acetate and methyl valerate are probably the most incorrect,
 the true values being probably near 1144 and 110-0 respectively
 (§ 39): when these corrections are made, and           if105-0     be
                                                                    taken
 as the value for    methyl  butyrate   instead of  115-1,    all

412                Dr. C. R. A. Wright on the Relations between
   With respect to these corrections, it is evident that the expe
rimental difficulties in the determination of the exact values of
H, are so considerable that a larger number of determinations
than was usually made by Favre and Silbermann is required in
each instance before a mean value can be obtained on which per
fect reliance can be placed.     These experimental errors do not
seem   materially  to affect the nature of a curve drawn, as by
Favre and Silbermann, to indicate the rise in value of H1 as an
homologous series is ascended; but they become far more per
ceptible in the values 28Floo, every such error being there mul
tiplied by 28.    As shown in § 24, however, a means is afforded
of correcting in future these first approximations to the true
values of 28 Floo by observing the heat-disturbance occurring
during definite chemical reactions under known conditions of
temperature, pressure, and physical state.
   17. The reduced affinity-values obtained as above afford the
means of calculating the amount of heat-disturbance (evolution
or absorption) in any given reaction, the materials and products
being      all
           supposed         gaseous, and
                                   to   be  the uniform tempera   at
ture 100° and pressure 760 millims.       The heat evolved during
such    areaction (Hoo) must necessarily     given    the equation be        by

             Affinity and Dissected (Structural) Formula.        4, 15
    22. It may be noticed that the values     of Hloo can also be cal
culated from the equation
            Ho-X428(H, 4-H,)}, -X428(H, 4-H,)},
where   X428(H, 4-H,)}, and X428(H, 4-H,)}, indicate the alge
braic sums of the values of 28(H1+ H2) for the materials and pro
ducts respectively; for these quantities indicate respectively the
heat that would be generated were the materials in the gaseous
state at 100° and 760 millims. burnt to gaseous carbon dioxide and
liquid water at 15° and 760 millims, and that absorbed were the
resulting carbon dioxide and liquid water at 15° and 760 mil
lims. converted into the gaseous products at 100° and 760
millims.      It is easily seen on examination that this equation can
be inferred from the previous one involving Huoo, and the fun
damental equation involving 28Floo, from which the numbers in
the Table are calculated.
    23. If it be required to know the heat-disturbance during any
reaction when the materials and products are measured under
 circumstances different from those above stated (vaporous state
at 100° and 760 millims.), this can easily be calculated by means
of the formula
                       H.-Hoo-->(h).->(h.),
where X(h), and X(h.), represent the algebraic sums of the
 amounts of heat absorbed in the alteration of the materials and
products respectively to the new conditions.        H. thus becomes
         => {28(H, + H.) +h.}
                                   ,-> #28(H, + H2) +h,},.
 Thus,   if ethylic alcohol in the liquid state at 15° give rise to
 ethylene and liquid water measured at 15° and 760 millims, the
value of H, becomes
                      H. =X(28H), X(28H),
aS
                      X(28H3),= –2(h.),
and
                      X(28H,),=->(h.),
Or
        H. =46 x 6'998–(28 x        11.919-1-18  × 0)=–11.8.
     24. By reversing this mode of calculation, it becomes possible
 to infer from the heat-disturbance taking place in any given re
 action under known conditions the heat-disturbance that would
 take place under the conditions taken as standard (vaporous
 state at 100° and 760 millims.), and hence to infer the differ
 ences between the algebraic sums of X(F) and X(F,), or, in other
 words, to obtain the means of correcting the first approximations

   It should result, therefore, that marsh-gas has a higher boil
ing-point than hydrogen, i. e. will be more readily condensed to
a liquid.
   34. Similarly, an acid always boils at a higher temperature
than the corresponding methylic ether, and, as previously shown
 (§ 28), has a higher affinity-value. The corrected affinity-values

rizing aldehydes, olefines, terpenes, &c. is very well known in
numerous instances, although the exact heat-development has
not been accurately measured in any particular case.         Kekulé

LVII.   The Hydrodynamical Theory of the Action of a Galvania
   Coil on an external small Magnet.—Part III. By Professor-

                             [Continued from p.363.]
    complete the arguments contained in Parts I. and II.
To relative to the action of a galvanic coil, it remains to em
ploy the hydrodynamical theory of galvanism to account for the
experimental basis of the explanation of that action given by
Ampère's theory.    The facts and hypotheses that will be referred
to for this purpose are for the most part contained in Leçons 70
and 71 of Jamin’s Cours de Physique, vol. iii., and for the sake
of convenience will be adduced by citation from that work. The
articles in this third Part are numbered in continuation of those
of Part II.
   55. Two parallel rheophores are mutually attracted or repelled
according as the currents along them are in the same or oppos
site directions (see Jamin, p. 198).     Before proceeding to give
a theoretical demonstration    of this law, a few preliminary re
marks are required.
   It may be first stated that since according to one of the fun
damental hypotheses enunciated in art. 1 “the size of the atoms
is supposed to be so small that even in dense bodies they fill a
very small portion of a given space,” it will be assumed that the
steady motions that will come under consideration are not sen
sibly modified by the mere occupation of space by the atoms.
Again, it will be admitted, as before in art. 19, that in steady
motion the accelerative action of the fluid on an atom has a con
stant ratio to the accelerative force of the fluid itself at the po
sition of the atom, and is in the same direction.      Hence, since
in the case of the parallel rheophores the mutual action may be
assumed to take place in directions transverse to the axes, if p
be the pressure at any position distant by r from a fixed line of
reference parallel to the axes and in the same plane, the accele
rative action on an atom in that position will be proportional to
         It   is further to be remarked         that the law arrived at in art.

plies to the action of either rheophore on the other.
   57. Since in the foregoing reasoning the lengths of the rheo
phores were not involved, we may draw from it the important
corollary, that, if two elements of parallel currents be so situated
that the straight line joining their middle points is perpendicu
lar to their axes, the mutual action between the elements varies
inversely as the square of the interval between the aires.   It is to
be noticed that this law has thus been     independently derived by
argument from the fundamental hypotheses.
   58. “We may always replace a rectilinear current by any
sinuous current in the same general direction, provided it is
very little distant from the first" (Jamin, p. 200). This is
another of the facts, or laws, which, as forming the basis of
Ampère's theory, it is proposed to account for by the hydro
dynamical theory.      The following     think, the appropriate              is,

      It is here to be remarked that in Ampère's theory the proof of the
      law of the inverse square is founded upon the earperimental fact ;
      whereas in the course of reasoning which           have adopted that law         I
      is deduced from    independent    à priori principles  (see art. 57); and
      the above explanation of the fact may therefore be regarded as
      evidence of the truth of the hydrodynamical theory of the gal
sº    vanic current. It may also be remarked that the above result

      is the same as that obtained by Ampère, although                have taken                                I

details of integrating, which would be a process of considerable

     Action of a Galvanic Coil on an external small Magnet.                                    441
   73. I come now to the consideration of a circumstance which
bears in an especial manner on the relation of the hydrodynami
cal theory to the theory of Ampère, and on the proof of the a
priori character of the former. It is made evident by the inves
tigations of Ampère and of physicists who have adopted his
views, that the formula for the mutual action between two
galvanic elements, which he constructed with so much labour
and ingenuity, does not apply, without some additional hypo
thesis, to the action of a galvanic element on a magnetic
element.        understand a magnetic element to be the magne
                (I
tism of an    indefinitely small magnetized needle.)  This is true
also of the  formula,   consisting of a single term, which    have                        I
employed for the solution of the problems discussed in arts.
69–72.     The hydrodynamical theory assigns as the reason for
this   inapplicability  of the formula, that a galvanic element
differs essentially from a magnetic element in respect of the
mode in which the circulation of the currents takes place in the
two cases, this condition being fulfilled in galvanism by means
of conductors forming a complete circuit, whilst in magnetism,
as is explained in art. 12, the circulation results from the reaction
of the inertia of the fluid against the impulses of the magnet.
The theory has, in fact, shown that two elements of galvanic
currents are capable by their composition of producing forces
which vary inversely as the square of the distance between the
rheophore-elements    to which they belong, and are proper for
causing motions of translation of these elements, but that a
stream pertaining to a galvanic element (as also one pertaining
to a magnetic element) can give to an elementary magnet, by
composition with      its
                    streams, only   motion     rotation, the force
                                                     a                 of
producing this effect varying approximately                             as   the inverse cube
of   the distance between the elements.
   74. This theory therefore accounts for the introduction into
Ampère's theory           additional hypothesis, having the effect

according to the law of the inverse square (see art. 69).
    75. The processes by which different physicists have calculated
the action of a galvanic coil on a small magnet rest entirely on
the results of experiments made by Ampère, the details of which
are given in his work entitled Théorie des Phénomènes Electro
dynamiques uniquement déduite de l’eapérience.            Ampère, with
the view of   explaining   magnetic   phenomena     by  galvanic  action,
conceived that each molecule of a        magnet   might  be surrounded
by a complete galvanic circuit, and by following out the conse
quences of this hypothesis was led to give to a galvanic conductor
the form of a coil, or solenoid, the action of which is found prac
tically to be nearly the same as that of a magnet. Advantage
being taken of this experimental result, the calculation of the
action of a coil on an external small magnet is reduced to the
calculation of magnetic action.        On these principles Professor
Clerk   Maxwell,   in his ‘Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism’
 (vol. ii.   p.
             131,  art. 482), compares “the action           finite [gal         of    a

that the hypothesis is applicable with more exactness to the action
of a coil than to that of a magnet.

infinitely small compared with the entire amplitude of dis
placement.”    It is evident that the compressions and dilatations
which    may exist in any body depend entirely on the differ
ences in the phases of the vibrations constituting the sonorous
wave; and when the body has a depth equal to half a wave
length, it can embrace the maximum amount of condensation
and rarefaction.    But condensation and dilatation alone produce
lateral action on the walls of a straight canal traversed by sono
rous vibrations; and hence, if the length of the canal be but a
small fraction of the wave, then there exists throughout the
canal but little difference in phase, and therefore but little
lateral action.   Now the united lengths of the scalae is but a
small fraction of the mean length of the sonorous waves which
traverse it; for if we take, as above, 44 metres as the mean
length of the waves which are propagated through the scalae,
and 59 millims. as the length of the united scalae, it follows that
the latter is only ', of the mean wave-length.      Now if we ima
 gine the scalae straightened and forming one continuous tube
 with a free communication existing at the helicotreuna, then the
mean wave traversing them will cause only ºr of the lateral
 action which this same wave would produce if the scalae had the
 length of half of the wave; and it follows that the whole liquid
 of the scalae would vibrate forward and backward almost as an
incompressible mass, approaching in character to the oscillations
of a solid piston in a cylinder; therefore the action against the
walls of the ductus cochlearis would be very slight. But now
consider the change in effect on the ductus which takes place
when  it, together with the scalae,   wound     into such
                                                   is          asup              an

in the scalae thrown forward and backward          the vibrationsby                   of

form  of the scalae causes them      press against the outer

brana basilaris) when the stapes moves inward; and when                               it
moves outward this action         compressionof    relieved from the

the same intensity (by reason                 of

tions like the fluid    which they are immersed. Therefore there

adopt    the latter view, then every thing works to produce the
 maximum effect on the covibrating parts of the organ of Corti;
for when the stapes moves inward, the pressure is thrown on the
outer border of the upper wall or roof of the ductus, thence
across to the peripheral portion of the basilar membrane.           This
action, we may say, takes place simultaneously throughout the
whole length of the ductus, moves downward the floor of the
basilar membrane, and thus presses the fluid of the scala tym
pani against the fenestra rotunda and moves this membrane out
ward.     When, however, the stapes moves outward, the pressure
is relieved from the elastic basilar membrane, which is now moved
upward, while the fenestra rotunda moves inward”.
    There are also other anatomical facts, besides the inclination
of the membrana Reissneri to the plane of the membrana basi
laris, and the inclination of both these membranes to the plane
perpendicular to the axis of the cochlea, which favour an opinion
that the outer or peripheral part of the basilar membrane re
ceives the main part of the vibrations which enter the ductus.
The auditory nerve-fibrils are not attached to the Corti rods or
pillars, as was formerly imagined; and therefore these bodies
cannot be the covibrating parts of the ductus; but the Corti
pillars appear to act, in conjunction with the cylindrical nerve
cells of Hensen, as supports for the lamina reticularis, between
which and the basilar membrane are steadily and tensely
stretched the hair-cell cords (as I will term them); and to these
cords are attached the nerve-fibrils.         Waldeyer says on this
point that “The outer radial fibres direct their course, as Gott
stein has found, toward the tunnel of Corti, passing between the
inner pillars and traversing the tunnel about midway between
the summit and base of the arch; in a profile view these fibres
appear like stretched harp-strings.      On leaving the arched space
they pass between the outer pillars and direct their course
 (rising a little toward the scala vestibuli) straight to the hair
cells, with which they become completely fused.              In several
preparations from the dog and the bat           I  have seen this ter
mination of the nerves in the most convincing manner, at least
so far as the innermost row of hair-cells is concerned; as to the
other rows, we may pretty confidently assert that the termina
tion of the nerves is the same; for we can frequently see several
fibres passing at the same time between the outer pillars.” The
very fact that the number of these hair-cell cords increases
with the higher development of the ear shows their important
    * If we could examine at the same time vibrating points on the stapes
and on the fenestra rotunda with a vibration-microscope,  I imagine that
these points would exhibit no difference in phase when the membrana
tympani vibrated to a note below the treble.

 function; for while in man they are arranged alternately in five
 rows and number 18,000, in other Mammalia there are only
  two or three rows”.         These hair-cell cords are more perpen
 dicular to the basilar membrane than the Corti rods, and are
 also different in their forms, having swellings in the middle of
  their lengths.      These swellings must cause them to act like
  loaded strings; and hence each hair-cell cord is peculiarly well
 adapted to covibrate with only one special sound.               Also these
 hair-cell cords are placed in reference to the sound-pulses
 striking them somewhat in the relation which the antennal
 fibrils of the mosquito bear to a wave-surface to which their
 lengths are perpendicular.         The hair-cell cords, therefore, will
 not be set in vibration      by  the action of the feeble pulses which
 may reach them directly through the membrana Reissneri from
 the scala vestibuli; and, furthermore, the shielding influence of
 the membrana tectoria tends to prevent this direct action on the
cords.
     If my view be correct, that these cords receive their vibra
tions from the basilar membrane, and not directly from the im
 pulses sent into the ductus, it necessarily follows that these cords
 bear, to the membrane to which they are attached, the same re
 lation as stretched strings bear to the vibrating tuning-forks in
 Melde’s experiments; and therefore a cord in the ductus will
 vibrate only half as often in a second as the basilar membrane to
 which it is fastened.      Experiments similar to those described in
 section 1 of this paper illustrate very well our hypothesis of
 audition. Thus the membrane placed near the sounding-reed
 stands for the basilar membrane; strings of various lengths
 and diameters and loaded at their centres are fastened to the
 membrane, and represent the hair-cell cords.            On sounding the
 reed-pipe, only those strings in tune with the harmonics exist
 ing in the composite sound of the reed will enter into vibration,
just as, when the same sound-vibrations enter the ear and vibrate
 the basilar menbrane, the only hair-cell cords which enter into
 vibration are those in tune with the elementary vibrations exist
ing in the membrane.             Also it is to be observed that as the
loaded string makes one vibration to two of the membrane, so
the hair-cell cord makes only one vibration to two of the basilar
membrane.
    * It is to be regretted that no accurate measures of the length and dia
meters of the rods and cords of the organ of Corti have been secured. The
outer pillars of the arch of Corti certainly double their length in going
from the base to the top of the ductus; but does this fact point them out
as bodies suitably proportioned to covibrate to sounds extending through

                          Prof. A.         M. Mayer's              Researches          in Acoustics.             451
            If it be true that when simple vibrations impinge on the ear
        the  tympanic    and basilar membranes vibrate twice while the co
        vibrating body only vibrates once, then it follows that, if the
        same simple vibrations can be sent directly to the covibrating
        parts of the ear without the intervention of the basilar mem
        brane, we should perceive a sound which is the octave of the one
        we experienced when the same simple vibrations entered the ear
        through the tympanic membrane.          Hence it appears that our
        hypothesis can be brought to the test of experiment in the fol
        lowing manner:—A tuning-fork held near the ear causes a
        sensation corresponding to the designated pitch of the fork.
        But the vibrations of this fork can be sent to the inner ear
        through the bones of the head; and although we cannot prevent
        the simultaneous vibration of the tympanic and basilar mem
        branes, yet we can at the same time directly vibrate the parts of
        the inner ear. Therefore, if we first hold this fork near the ear
        and note           its
                       pitch and the quality         sound and then pressof      its
        its foot  firmly  against  the temporal  bone, we should perceive
        marked difference         the timbre of the fork when sounded

   Our fundamental equations (C) may be arrived at with less
analysis and perhaps equal rigour by a somewhat modified pro
cess. The conditions that the forces \Ps, Ya, &c. vanish, impose
linear relations on the coordinates, and virtually reduce the de

pressure, is numerically equal to the product of the absolute
temperature into the increase of pressure required to raise the
temperature one degree when no heat is allowed to escape. (See

LX.    Note on Carbon-Spectra.   By W. MARshALL WATTs, D.Sc.,

 IN four
     the
             different spectra as spectra of carbon.
                                                              described
                                                          One of them
  was the ordinary spectrum from hydrocarbon-flames            first de
 scribed by Swan; the second was the spectrum obtained from
 vacuum-tubes enclosing carbonic oxide, carbonic anhydride, or
 olefiant gas; the third was the spectrum of the Bessemer-flame,
 and the fourth the spectrum of the high-tension spark in car
 bonic anhydride or carbonic oxide
   I   have since shown (Phil. Mag. February 1873) that the
 Bessemer-spectrum,      instead of being a spectrum of carbon, is
 the spectrum of manganese oxide; and                     I
                                                    have now to add
 the result of recent observations which show that the second
 spectrum also is due not to carbon itself, but to some oxide of
 carbon.    This spectrum was held to be a spectrum of carbon
 because it was common to compounds of carbon with hydrogen
 and with oxygen.       Following the line of research indicated by
 Schuster (Proc. Roy. Soc. June 1872),               I
                                                 have now found that
 it is not given   by  spectral  tubes enclosing   olefiant gas if spe
 cial care be taken to exclude       all
                                       trace     oxygen.

 tion  of one experiment will suffice.     The olefiant gas prepared
from alcohol and sulphuric acid passed first through              wash   a a
ing-bottle containing sulphuric acid, then through               second
bottle filled with solid caustic potash.       This bottle was also
provided with    a   separating-funnel, the tube          which passed
                                                              of

Mr.  J. W. L. Glaisher   on the Problem   of the Eight Queens.   457
some time, a strong solution     of pyrogallic acid was introduced
through the separating-funnel into the bottle, and the tap of
the funnel was closed again.      The gas thus freed from oxygen,
passed on through a calcium-chloride drying-tube into the
vacuum-tube which formed the upper part of a tube some 300
millims. long, the lower end of which just dipped below the
surface of mercury in a bottle, passing air-tight through the
cork. A second tube through the cork of this bottle put it in
communication with the air-pump.         The vacuum-tube was thus
cut off by a sort of mercury-valve from the air-pump, so that it
was impossible for air to leak into the tube from the air-pump
during the process of exhaustion.          Finally, one end of the
vacuum-tube contained      sodium,   and the other a minute frag
ment of  potassium   chlorate  wrapped   up in platinum-foil.
   The gas having been allowed to pass briskly through the
apparatus for some time, the vacuum-tube was melted together
at the end remote from the air-pump, exhausted, and sealed off.
The sodium was then heated to ensure the absence of oxygen.
   The discharge from the induction-coil was then sent through
the tube.   The light emitted (which was not very bright), exa
mined with the spectroscope, gave the lines of the first carbon
spectrum, the positions of the lines 5635 and 5165 being veri
fied. The potassium chlorate was then heated so as to set free
oxygen, and the observations were repeated. The light was now
much brighter, and gave the second carbon-spectrum, the lines
5803, 5602, 5195, 4834, 4505, and 4395 being verified.            We
have therefore only one spectrum which can be proved to be due
to carbon—that, namely, which is common to the flame of olefiant
gas or cyanogen, the electric discharge in cyanogen or carbonic
oxide at the ordinary pressure, and to the electric discharge in
vacuum-tubes enclosing cyanogen, olefiant gas, or hydrocarbons
such as benzol.

   To rotate a solution through 90° in the simplest manner,
observe that the corresponding letters on opposite sides of the
a diagonal form the pairs b and c, d and e,f and g, h and k, m

The Correlation of Physical Forces.   Sirth Edition. With other Con
  tributions to Science.   By the Hon. Sir W. R. Grove, M.A.,

  Longmans, Green, and Co.        1874. (8vo, pp. 466.)
      volume contains the sixth edition of Sir W. Grove's well
This
  known essay on the “Correlation of Physical Forces,” the third
edition of the essay on “Continuity,” and a reprint of thirty-eight
papers on various scientific subjects which have appeared from time
to time in different periodical publications, sixteen of them in our
own pages; the most important, however, appeared originally in
the Transactions of the Royal Society, viz. those on “The Gas
Woltaic Battery,” on “The Voltaic Action of Phosphorus, Sulphur,
and Hydrocarbons,” on “The Effect of Surrounding                Media on
Voltaic Ignition,” on “The Electro-chemical polarity of Gases,”
and the Bakerian Lecture of A.D. 1846, on “Certain Phenomena of
Woltaic Ignition, and the Decomposition of Water into               consti                its
tuent gases         by
                   Heat.”    These papers, says the author, have not
been “altered, further than

the  volume;   and the five   papers  whose names we have given above,
nearly half the remainder (pp. 112).

                 think that the assumption of the universality of or
dinary matter is the least gratuitous.” (p. 124). This, however,
does not amount to much more than an allegation that this part of
the subject is obscure, and that for the present we must acquiesce
in the conclusion that, “before this obscurity can be perfectly
cleared up, we must know something of the ultimate or molecular
constitution of the bodies, or groups of molecules, at present known
to us only in the aggregate”.
   The present edition differs in many respects from the first, not
in substance, but in the way of additional illustrations; e.g. on
comparing the parts treating of Heat in the two editions, it will be
found that the original eight pages exist almost word for word in
the new edition, but are expanded into forty-four pages by addi
tions, which serve, for the most part, to mark the progress of science
during the last thirty years.
   The second essay, on “Continuity,” is probably known to mosº
of our readers as the President's Address to the British Associa
tion at Nottingham in A.D. 1866; its leading idea is thus enunci
ated:—“One word will give you the key to what                 am about to                  I
discourse on ; that word is continuity—no new word, and used in
no new sense, but perhaps applied more generally than it has
hitherto been.                                                  I
                   We shall see, unless am much mistaken, that the

diate links have been discovered uniting the apparently segregated
instances with other more familiar phenomena. We shall see that
the more we investigate, the more we find that in existing pheno

   The author describes the miscellaneous papers as containin
“something of suggestion.... which may not be altogether useless.
He has therefore published them along with his better-known
essays as “a last legacy.”            He tells us, in words which disclose
        jº.
something like regret, of his finding it “necessary to the well
being of others” to relinquish science for law.                We may perhaps
be allowed to think that the interests of the community were well
consulted when he devoted to the law powers which his high profes
sional                      to have found in the law a congenial employ
ment, and at all events to say that few men have made science their
sole pursuit, who in the evening of life can give so good an account
of their occupations as that contained in the present volume. Nor
can we forbear to add that Sir W. Grove's eminence in other pur
suits gives an almost judicial character to the opinion pronounced
in the following words, with which we must end our notice:–
“Little can be achieved in scientific research without an acquaint
ance with it in youth; you will rarely find an instance of a man
who has attained any eminence in science who has not commenced
 its study     at very early period

and demonstrations” of the present work, “much has been derived
from Sir W. Thomson and Professor Tait's ‘Treatise on Natural

adopts their terminology, according to which the science of Mecha

472       Royal Society:—Dr. W. Huggins on               the  Motions  of
and from the earth which      I had the honour to present to the Royal
Society in 1872 appeared to show, from the position in the heavens
of the approaching and receding stars, as well as from the relative
velocities of their approach and recession, that the sun's motion in
space could not be regarded as the sole cause of these motions.
“There can be little doubt but that in the observed stellar move
ments we have to do with two other independent motions—namely,
a movement common to certain groups of stars, and also a motion
peculiar to each star”.
   It presented itself to me as a matter of some importance to
endeavour to extend this inquiry to the nebulae, as it seemed
possible that some light might be thrown on the cosmical relations
of the gaseous nebulae to the stars and to our stellar system by
observations of their motions of recession and of approach.
   Since the date of the paper to which           I have referred,    I  have
availed myself of the nights sufficiently fine (unusually few even
for our unfavourable climate) to make observations on this point.
      .
   The inquiry was found to be one of great difficulty, from the faint
ness of the objects and the very minute alteration in position in
the spectrum which had to be observed.
   At first the inquiry appeared hopeless, from the circumstance
that the brightest line in the nebular spectrum is not sufficiently
coincident in character and position with the brightest line in the
spectrum of nitrogen to permit this line to be used as a fiducial line
of comparison. The line in the spectrum of the nebulae is narrow
and            while, the line of nitrogen is double, and each com
ponent is nebulous and broader than the line of the nebulae.              The
nebular line is apparently coincident with the middle of the less
refrangible line of the double line of nitrogent.
   The third and fourth lines of the nebular spectrum are un
doubtedly those of hydrogen; but their great faintness makes it
impossible to use them as lines of comparison under the necessary
conditions of great dispersive power, except - in the case of the
brightest nebulae.
                           I
   The second line, as showed in the paper to which                I have re
ferred, is sensibly coincident with an iron line, wave-length 495.7;
                                       .
but this line is inconveniently faint, except in the brightest nebulae.
   In the course of some other experiments my attention was di
rected to a line in the spectrum          lead which falls upon the less
refrangible of the components of the double line of nitrogen. This
line appeared to meet the requirements of the case, as it is narrow,
of a width corresponding to the slit, defined at both edges, and in
the position in the spectrum of the brightest of the lines of the
nebulae.
                          I
   In December 1872 compared this line directly with the first
line in the spectrum of the Great Nebula in Orion.            I was delighted
to find this line sufficiently coincident in position to serve as a fidu
cial line of comparison.

   I am not prepared to say that the coincidence is perfect; on the
contrary,           I
             believe that if greater prism-power could be brought
          upon
to bear        the nebulae, the line in the lead spectrum would be
found to be in a small degree more refrangible than the line in
the nebulae.
   The spectroscope employed in these observations contains two
compound prisms, each giving a dispersion of 9°6' from A to H.
A magnifying-power of 16 diameters was used.
   In the simultaneous observation of the two lines it was found
that if the lead line was made rather less bright than the nebular
line, the small excess of apparent breadth of this latter line, from
its greater brightness, appeared                overlap the lead line

of lead in the nebulae.

  be,   say, 10 miles per second from the nebula, then the nebula
  would not be receding with a velocity greater than 15 miles per
   second ; but the nebula might be approaching with velocity as great
  as 35 miles per second, because 10 miles of this velocity would
  be destroyed by the earth's motion in the contrary direction.
      The observations seem to show that the gaseous nebulae as a
   class have not proper motions so great as the bright stars.                    It
  may be remarked that two other kinds of motion may exist in the
  nebulae, and, if sufficiently rapid, may be detected by the spectro
  scope:–1. A motion of rotation in the planetary nebulae, which
  might be discovered by placing the slit of the instrument on oppo
  site limbs of the nebulae. 2. A motion of translation in the visual
  direction of some portions of the nebulous matter within the
  nebula, which might be found by comparing the different parts of
  a large and bright nebula.
      Sir William Herschel states that “nebulae were generally de
  tected in certain directions rather than in others, that the spaces
  preceding them were generally quite deprived of stars, that the
  nebulae appeared some time after among stars of a certain con
   siderable size and but seldom among very small stars, that when
  I  came to one nebula            I found several more in the same neigh
  bourhood, and afterwards a considerable time passed before                 I came
  to another parcel”*.
      Since the existence of real nebulae has been established by the
  use of the spectroscope, Mr. Proctorf and Professor D'Arrestf
  have called attention to the relation of position which the gaseous
  nebulae hold to the Milky Way and the sidereal system.
      It was with the hope of adding to our information on this point
  that these observations of the motions of the nebulae were under
  taken.

  * General Catalogue         of Nebulae.’       The earth's motion given is the
  mean of the motions of the different days of observation.

                      the investigations of the properties of reflected light
        have been, by preference, occupied with the ratio of the two
principal components to each other, as well in respect of the phase as
of the intensity; and only a few works have attempted a direct
determination of the two with respect to the incident light. The
only series of experiments on the intensity, which are found in
Arago's posthumous Works, for the white light reflected by a plane
parallel glass plate, leaves out of consideration the absorption of
the glass; and then it does not give the index of refraction or the
angle of polarization; so that the results cannot well be compared
with the theory. On that account                            I
                                                 have here undertaken again

 suffices to produce close contact at any part of the spectrum the
 observation of which is desired.
    For the arrangement of the apparatus, the Nicol without the
insertion of the prisms was turned so that one image of the slit
vanished; then the prisms were prefixed and rotated until again
only one image of the slit was to be seen. Their incidence-plane
then coincides with the principal section of the doubly refracting
prism; and this gives at the same time the point from which the
rotation of the Nicol is to be reckoned. In front of the lower half
of the slit a rectangular glass prism was fixed, which reflected the
light of a laterally placed petroleum-flame into the apparatus. On
a level with the upper half stood the telescopes of a small spectro
meter provided with a little turntable, by which the light of a
second flame was concentrated upon the upper half of the slit.
The tube of the collimator, standing next to the flame, had, in
  lace of the slit, a circular aperture; and the two telescopes, pro
vided with only the objective-lenses, were placed so that the lens
of the second threw upon the upper half of the slit of the photo
meter a sharp image of the aperture, which was in the focus of the
                    #º

    For the observation the telescope next the flame was placed at

  POLARIZATION OF THE PLATES OF CONDENSERS.              BY A. S. THAYER.
    It is well known that in polarization-batteries, of which Planté's
battery is a type, a combination of the ions resulting from elec
trolysis takes place when the plates of the battery are connected,
and a current results which slowly diminishes in strength.           In the
case of condensers made with solid dielectrics the same diminishing
current is observed; and the following experiments would seem to
show that it might be due to an electrolysis or decomposition of
the material separating the plates of tinfoil.            The experiments
consisted in placing condensers of various kinds in a circuit, through
which a current was made to pass by two Bunsen's cells, and
noting their changes. The plates of the condensers were of tinfoil,
and had an area of about fifteen square inches. The experiments
were as follows:—
    (1) The dielectric used was a sheet of dry glazed paper.           The
condenser could not be charged so as to give a perceptible dis
charge.
   (2) When a sheet of glazed paper, moistened with shellac, was
substituted for the dry paper, the discharge was sufficient to send
the light off the scale of the galvanometer, and continued for some
minutes.
   (3) Dry goldbeaters' skin was used as        a dielectric; and no deflec
tion could be obtained.

   (4) The goldbeaters' skin, when moistened with shellac, gave a
slowly diminishing deflection.
   (5) The dielectric was made by flowing the surfaces of the plates
with a solution of wax and gasoline; and a slowly diminishing de
flection was obtained.
   (6) The condenser used in (4) was tried again after the shellae
had dried, and again gave a diminished deflection, less than the first
deflection.
   (7) The condenser used in (5), when tried again after a day or
two, did not again give a deflection.
   (8) Unglazed paper dry and oiled gave no deflection.
    (9) Glazed paper oiled gave a very slight deflection, and the
galvanometer-needle immediately returned to zero.
    (10) Glazed paper wet with water and covered with shellac gave
the greatest deflection of             all
                                the dielectrics.     The light was sent

    NEOUS IMMERSION OF TWO MERCURY ELECTRODES IN VARIOUS

                   follows.]

480            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
   1.    Iftwo mercury electrodes, connected by the wire of a multi
plier,   be immersed one after the other    in any liquid which is a con
 ductor of electricity (water, alcohol, glycerine, saline solutions, hy
 drochloric acid, &c.), an electric current is observed, which goes
 from the freshly wetted mercury-surface through the liquid to the
 mercury-surface which has been wetted longest.
    2. The intensity of this current diminishes as the resistance of
 the liquid column between the electrodes is increased.
    3. The electromotive force of the current varies according to the
 nature and the concentration of the liquid, decreases as the concen
 tration of the saline solution increases, and may amount to 0:6 of
 the electromotive force of a Daniell's element.
    4. The electromotive force is as much greater as the boundary
surface of mercury with the surrounding liquid on the later-im
 mersed electrode is more quickly produced.          With increasing velo
city of production of the boundary surface the electromotive force
approaches a maximum, which in the case of viscous fluids, like
 glycerine, is very soon reached.
    5. The electromotive force stands in no relation to the quantity
of the capillary constant of the common boundary surface of mer
 cury and the surrounding liquid.
    6. The reason of these electrical currents is probably to be sought
 in the alteration of the molecular condition (change of density or
 concentration) which is gradually accomplished, in the particles of
 the liquid in the vicinity of the surface of contact with the mer
 cury, after the wetting.
    7. Upon non-simultaneous wetting of solid metals by water and
 other liquids, electrical currents ensue in like manner, and for the
 same reason, as upon the non-simultaneous wetting of mercury.
    8. The electrical currents generated by the non-simultaneous
immersion of mercury electrodes in sulphuric acid, nitric acid, &c.
have their cause chiefly in the substances formed by chemical action
on the mercury; they are therefore secondary phenomena, or che
 mical-polarization currents.
    9. As has long been known, the surface-tension of the common
boundary of mercury with other liquid conductors of electricity
may be altered by electrolysis.
    10. This alteration may consist in an augmentation or a dimi
nution, and may change         its
                                sign with the direction and duration    of
the electric current.
    11. The disturbances which occur     in   capillarity-phenomena can
not     be
         accounted for    by substances electrolytically separated.
    12. Since accidental and unavoidable impurities considerably mo
dify the amount    of the surface-tension  of  mercury and other liquids,
                     to determine from that amount the quantity
                                                                        it of
an it not advisable
   iselectrolytically formed substance,     or  even  to    deduce from
indirectly the intensity   of  electric currents or   electromotive forces.
